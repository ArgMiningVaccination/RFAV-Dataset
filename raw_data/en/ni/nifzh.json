One way to consider how well a public service agency is managed is in terms of the five sequential functions of management. Likely to occur in predictable sequence, the funct ions provide continuity to the process of management: Planning Organizing Staffing Directing Controllin g Picture three consultants assigne d the task of designing from s cratch an agency to serve a community of 50,000. Consider the major questions they would have to address: Planning What resources are set aside for this agency? How should we state the mission and goals? What programs and activities are needed to achieve them? What standardized procedures? What about standing decisions on important recurring matters (p olicies)? How will we develop the first budget? Organizing We need to establish an organiza tional structure, delineate pos itions and relationships and create job descriptions with necessary qualifications. How do we divide up the necessary work so that personnel are assigned most effectively? Staffing What steps should we take to recr uit and develop qualified empl oyees? What standards established to avoid the \"rejects\" of neighborin g agencies, or the people who cannot make it in the private sector? How much to budget for recruit training and continuous upgrading of employee skills, knowledge and ability? Directing What can be done to insure that employees are motivated and produce, both day-to-day and over the course of a career? How to resolve conflicts and encourage independent thought? How to stimulate innovation and creative solutions to problems? Can we set up structures to make it easier for them to keep at the cutting edge of the field? Controlling How to make sure the agency ach ieves its objectives according t o plan? What performance standards are required? Reporting systems? How to insure that necessary co rrective actions take place to s tay on target? How to measure results so that it can be shown that objectives are being achieved? 7 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Using the Basic Resources: In addition to money and time managers must conserve and util ize their resources to achieve agency objectives: Conceptual: ideas, planning and managerial skills, training, technical co mpetence, in-house information and access to outside databases and the worldwide web; Physical: vehicles and professional equipment, consumable materials, un iforms, safety gear, furniture; the buildings and constructed facilities for housing employees as well as the above; Human: health, motivation to work, sup ervisory leadership, intelligence, interpersonal skills, loyalty to the agency, commitment to the field. In utilizing these resources manager will resort to the five se quential functions as well as other management skills and functions; e.g., analyzing problems, making decision , communicating with employees and citizens. Evaluating Agency Management: No one public service manager (or management team) can be ful ly capable in utilizing appropriate management skills and functions. In e valuating agency management, however, it is helpful to consider the full range of duties, responsibilities and activities' needed for effective and efficient management. The following items are divided according to the f ive sequential functions. Many of them may be delegated to subordinates; never theless, the chief executive an d management team must accept responsibility for all of them. Evaluation Exercise Directions: Indicate using the scale below how well in your judgment the chief executiv e & management team of your agency accomplish the following responsibilities and ac tivities: Planning - How well do they: 1. _____Determine the purpose of the agency with a clear mission s tatement, goals and objectives. 2. _____Develop essential policies (e.g., authority defined, use o f discretion, alternatives to arrest, use of deadly force, high speed pursuit), and then require adherence t o them. 3. _____Divide the agency's work into program (e.g., traffic, patr ol, crime prevention, cri minal investigation, work with youth) and annually review each program's objectives with emphasis on increased effectiveness for the next twelve months. 4. _____Establish the priority, sequence, and timing of all the st eps necessary to achieve annual program objectives (with a timetable and milestones indicated. 5. _____Develop a budget that realistically reflects the importanc e of the annual objectives to be accomplished. 6. _____Administer the budge effectiv ely throughout the budget yea r. 7. _____Develop written directives (procedures, rules) to cover al l essential, recurring operations. 8. _____Utilize staff who are qualified for specialized planning a nd problem-solving. 10 Excellent 8 - 9 Good 6 7 Adequate 4 - 5 Barely Adequate 1 - 3 Poor 8 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 9. _____Hold staff meetings for effective planning (and at an appropriate frequency). 10. _____Provide for adequate manpow er research, crime analysis and deployment of personnel according to work load. 11. _____Push the planning process as far down into the operational level as possible; i.e., get as many people involved as practical.

Alec Mackenzie The chart of \"The Management Process,\" begins with the three ba sic elements with which a manager deals: ideas, things, and people. Management of these three elements i s directly related to conceptual thinking (of which planning is an essential part), administration, and leade rship. Not surprisingly, two scholars have identified the first three types of managers required in organi zations as the planner, the administrator, and the leader.1 Exhibit 1 The management process This diagram shows the different elements, functions, and activ ities which are part of the management process. At the center are people, ideas, and things, for these are the basic components of every organization with which the manager must work. Ideas create the need for conceptual thi nking; things, for administration; people, for leadership. Three functions\u2014problem analysis, decision making, and communication\u2014are important at all times and in all aspects of the manager's job; therefore, they are shown to permeate his work process. However, other functions are likely to occur in predictable sequence; thus, planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling are shown in that order on one of the bands. A manager's interest in any one of them depends on a variety of factors, including his position and the stage of completion of the projects he is most concerned with. He must at all times sense the pulse of his organization. The activities that will be most important to him as he concentrates\u2014now on on e function, then on another\u2014are shown on the outer bands of the diagram. Note the distinction between leader and manager. The terms should not be used interchangeably. While a good manager will often be a good leader, and vice versa, this is no t necessarily the case. For example: In World War II, General George Patton was known for his ability to lead and inspire men on the battlefield, but not for his conceptual abilities. I n contrast, General Omar Bra dley was known for his conceptual abilities, especially planning and managing a campaign, rather than for hi s leadership. Similarly in industry, education, and government it is possible to have an outstanding manager who is not capable of leading people but w ho, if he recognizes this deficiency, will staff his organization to compensate for it. Alternatively, an entreprene ur may possess charismatic qual ities as a leader, yet may lack the administrative capabilities required for overall e ffective management; and he too must staff to make up for the deficiency. We are not dealing here with leadership in general. We are deal ing with leadership as a function of management. Nor are we dealing with administration in general but, again, a s a function of management. 14 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The following definitions are sugg ested for clarity and simplic ity: Management\u2014achieving objectives through others. Administration\u2014managing the details of executive affairs. Leadership\u2014influencing people to accomplish desired objectives. Functions described The functions noted in the diagram have been selected after car eful study of the works of many leading writers and teachers.2 While the authorities use different terms and widely varying c lassifications of functions, I find that there is far more agreemen t among them than the variations suggest. Arrows are placed on the diagram to indicate that five of the f unctions generally tend to be \"sequential.\" More specifically, in an undertaking one ought first to ask what the purpose or objective is which gives rise to the function of planning; then comes the function of organizing\u2014determining the way in which the work is to be broken down into manageable units; after that is staffing, selecting qualified people to do the work; next is directing , bringing about purposeful action toward desired objectives; f inally, the function of control is the measurement of results against t he plan, the rewarding of the people according to their performance, and the replanning of the work to make corrections\u2014thus starting the cy cle over again as the process repeats itself . Three functions\u2014analyzing probl ems, making decisions, and communicating\u2014are called \"general\" or \"continuous\" functions because they occur throughout the manage ment process rather than in any particular sequence. For example, many d ecisions will be made throughout t he planning process as well as during the organizing, directing, and cont rolling processes. Equally, there must be communication for many of the functions and activities to be effective. And the active manage r will be employing problem analysis throughout all of the sequential f unctions of management. In actual practice, of course, t he various functions and activi ties tend to merge. While selecting a top manager, for example, an executive may well be planning new activities which this manager's capabilities will make possible, and may even be visualizing the organizational impact of these plans and the controls which will be necessary. Simplified definitions are added for each of the functions and activities to ensure understanding of what is meant by the basic elements described. Prospective gains Hopefully, this diagram of the management process will produce a variety of benefits for practitioners and students. Among these benefits are: A unified concept of managerial functions and activities. A way to fit together all gene rally accepted activities of mana gement. A move toward standardization of terminology. The identifying and relating of such activities as problem anal ysis, management of change, and management of differences. Help to beginning students of management in seeing the \"boundar ies of the ballpark\" and sensing the sequential relationships of others. Clearer distinctions between the leadership, administrative, an d strategic planning functions of management. In addition, the diagram should appeal to those who, like mysel f, would like to see more emphasis on the \"behaviorist\" functions of management, for it elevates staffing and communicating to the level of a function. Moreover, it establishes functions and activities as the two mo st important terms for describing the job of the manager. 15 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 1. See H. Igor Ansoff and R.G.

SWOTT Analysis is an effective way of identifying your Strengths and Weaknesses, and of examining the Opportunities, Threats, and Trends you face. How to use tool: To carry out a SWOTT Analysis write down answers to the following questions. Where appropriate, use similar questions: Strengths: What advantages do you have? What do you do well? What relevant resources do you have access to? What do other people see as your strengths? Consider this from your own point of view and from the point of view of the people you deal with.

Arul What makes a good manager? Innate traits or acquired skills? As suming that a manager is one who directs the activities of other persons and undertakes the responsibility f or achievement of objectives through such efforts, successful management seems to rest on three basic developable skills: technical, human and conceptual. The relative importance of these three skills varies with the level of managerial responsibility. (See diagram, below.) Technical Skill The technical skill implies an understanding of and proficiency in a specific kind of activity, particularly one involving methods, processes, procedures, or techniques; it inv olves specialized knowledge, analytical ability within that specialty, and facility in the use of the tools and techniques of the specific discipline. Vocational and on-the-job training programs largely do a good job in developin g this skill. Human Skill This refers to the ability to w ork with, understand and motivate other people; the way the individual perceives (and recognizes the perceptions of) his superiors, equals, and subordinates, and the way he behaves subsequently. The person with highly developed human skills is aware of his own attitudes, assumptions, and beliefs about other individuals a nd groups; he is able to see t he usefulness and limitations of these feelings. He is sufficiently sensitive to the needs and motivations of others i n his organization so that he can judge the possible reactions to, and outcomes of, the various courses of action he may undertake. Human skills could be usefully divided into (a) leadership abil ity within the manager's own unit and (b) skill in intergroup relationships. Experience shows that outstanding cap ability in one of these roles is frequently accompanied by mediocre performance in the other. Intragroup skills are essential in lower and middle management roles and intergroup skills become increasingly impo rtant in successively higher levels of management. To acquire the Human Skill, the executive must develop his own personal point of view toward human activity so that he will (a) recognize th e feelings and sentiments which he brings to a situation, (b) have an attitude about his own experience which will enab le him to re-evaluate and lea rn from them, (c) develop ability in understanding what others by thei r actions and words are trying to communicate to him and (d) develop ability in successfully communicating his ideas and attitudes to others . The process of acquiring this ability can be effectively aided by a skilled instructor through use of case problems coupled with impromptu role playing. It is important that the trainee self-examines his own concepts and values, which may enable him to develop more useful attitudes about him self and about others. Conceptual Skill This skill involves the ability t o see the enterprise as a whol e; it includes recognizing how the various functions of the organization depend on one another, and how changes in a ny one part affect all the others; and it extends to visualizing the relationship of the individual business to t he industry, the community , and the political, social and economic forces of the nation as a whole. The conceptual skill involves thinking in terms of the followin g: relative emphasis and priorities among conflicting objectives and criteria; relative tendencies and pr obabilities (rather than certainties); rough correlations and patterns among elements (rather than clear-cut cause-and-effect relationships). Training can enhance previously developed conceptual abilities. In developing the conceptual skill, some of the best results have been achieved through \"coaching\" of subordina tes by superiors. One way a superior can help \"coach\" his subordinate is by assigning a particular responsibi lity, and then responding with searching questions or opinions, rather than giving answers. 21 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Another excellent way to develop this skill is through trading jobs: by moving promising young men and women through different functi ons of the business but at the same level of responsibility. Special assignments, particularly the kind which involve inter-departmental problems , can also help develop this skill. Relative Significance of Managerial Skills Conceptual Human Technical Conceptual Human Technical Conceptual Human Technical * Supervisory level Middle mgmt levelTop mgmt level * Technical skills are not so im portant for the chief executive s in large organizations where such executives have extensive staff assistance and highly competent, experienc ed technical operators are available. In smaller organizations, however, where tec hnical expertise is not as per vasive and seasoned staff assistance is not available, the chief executive has a much greater need for pers onal experience in the industry.

Five Managerial Objectives Manage YourselfManage Your Boss Manage People You Serve Manage Your StaffManage Your Collegues 30 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Leadership versus Management by Bonnie Bucqueroux The best police departments benefit from excellent leadership a nd superior managemen t. But what we must remember are the differences between the two -- and the fact th at the same person may not be good at both. LEADER MANAGER Vision Implementation \"Big Picture\" Detail Long Term Short Term Inspire Direct Strategic Planning Action Planning Outline Framework Assess Progress Proactive Reactive Motivate Facilitate Change Agent Steady Hand Delegate Delegate Communicate Communicate Leadership - Leadership rests on vision - what the late Bob Trojanowicz c haracterized as the ability to paint the Big Picture. A leader is someone who can persuade other people to envision a better future and inspire them to work enthusiastically to make that dream a reality. Some leader s can persuade by sheer charisma, but that can result in a shaky foundation for long-term change. Others wisel y rely on including key stakeholders in the decision-making process, grounding major decisions in consensus . The challenge of leadership also requires communicating, clearly and consistently, what the future should look like and what it will take to get there. Management - Management is the ability to structure and supervise the cha nges that can make that vision a reality. The manager's job is to focus on the individual brush strokes that make up the Big Picture, prodding people to do their best, overcoming obstacles and pitfalls, and documenting and assessing progress toward ultimate goals. On rare occasion, a great leader is also a great manager and vi ce versa. Lincoln apparently not only had the ability to inspire, but also the skills to manage the steps required to make his vision a reality. Yet it is more likely that a person is one or the other. President Reagan, lik e him or not, was clearly an exceptional leader. His successor, President Bush, like him or not, was more the manage r. The challenge for police departments is to make sure that they strive for e xcellence in both categories. Both are essential It is a mistake to think of leaders as to managers. If a police department is going to implement a change as profound as implementing community policing, it will need the s kills of both. It would also be a mistake to think of leadership and managemen t as the sole province of the chief and top command. As Drew Diamond of the Police Executive Research Forum notes, all people have both positional and personal power. The chief cl early has the top leadership po sition, and that position has power. But in almost any police department, it wouldn' t take long to come up with a list of sergeants with the positional and personal power to make or break any chief's best-laid plans. Or think of the officer who, by force of personality, can inspire his peers to do their best. The challenge is to harness the personal and positiona l potential at all levels in service of implementing community policing. 31 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Qualities of a Successful Police Manager Patience - managers must be calm and steadfast, despite opposition to t heir beliefs, opinions, and attitudes. Wisdom - managers must have the ability to fairly and equitably judge the behaviors and actions of subordinates. Virtue - managers must show moral excellence, not only speaking it, b ut also by everyday actions in dealing with departmental problems and personal issues. Empathy - managers must learn to accept and understand the feelings of their subordinates, always being prepared to see others in a positive light. Kindness - managers must try to be kind and gentle in all their dealing with others. Trust - managers must develop confidence in subordinates, not just respecting their position or knowledge, but also allowing them to achieve their personal goals as well as t hose of the organization. Knowledge - managers must constantly attempt to upgrade their knowledge of technical matters, the management theories being devel oped and implemented in governme nt and industry, and facts as they occur within their own department. Self-Control - managers must be able to restrain their emotions. Police Managers Can Deve lop These Qualities by: Showing a high frustration tolerance. Encouraging full participation of subordinates Emphasizing the subordinate's right to express another point of view Understanding the rules and acts of ethical competitive warfare Expressing hostility tactfully Accepting victory with controlled emotions Never permitting setbacks to defeat them Knowing how to \"be their own boss\" Continually seeking success Being experts in their field Tenets for the Modern Day Police Leader 1.

Harvard Business Review 37 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Action Plans POST Management Program 38 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Instructional Goal: Provide supervisors and managers information on how to create an action plan. Performance Objectives: Discuss action plans Discuss reason to create an action plan Review steps to complete an action Review action plan template 39 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] WHAT IS AN ACTION PLAN? An action plan is a document that lists what steps must be take n in order to achieve a specific goal. The purpose of an action plan is to clarify what resources are required to reach the goal, formulate a timeline for when specific tasks need to be completed and determine what res ources are required. A roadmap on where you are going and how you will get there. In some ways, an action plan is a \"heroic\" act: it helps us tur n our dreams into a reality. An action plan is a way to make sure your organization's vision is made concrete. It de scribes the way your group will use its strategies to meet its objectives. An action plan consists of a number of action steps or changes to be brought about. Each action step or change to be sought should include the following information: What actions or changes will occur Who will carry out these changes By when they will take pl ace, and for how long What resources (i.e., money, staff) are needed to carry out these c hanges Communication (who should know what?) WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR A GOOD ACTION PLAN? The action plan for your initiative should meet several criteri a. Is the action plan: Complete? Does it list all the action step s or changes to be sought in a ll relevant parts (e.g. agency, schools, business, government, etc.)? Clear? Is it apparent who will do what by when? Current? Does the action plan reflect the current work? Does it anticip ate newly emerging opportunities and barriers? WHY SHOULD YOU DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN? There is an inspirational adage that says, \"People don't plan t o fail. Instead they fail to plan.\" Because you certainly don't want to fail, it makes sense to take all of the steps necessary to ensure success, including developing an action plan. There are lots of good reasons to work out the details of your organization's work in an action plan, including: To lend credibility to your organization. An action plan shows members of the community (including grant makers) that your organiza tion is well ordered and dedica ted to getting things done. To be sure you don't overlook any of the details To understand what is and isn't possible for your organization to do For efficiency: to save time, energy, and resources in the long run For accountability: To increase the chances that people will do what needs to be done WHEN SHOULD YOU CREATE AN ACTION PLAN? It is developed after you have determined the vision, mission, objectives, and strategies of your group. If you develop an action plan when you are ready to start getting thin gs done, it will give you a blueprint for running your organization or initiative. Remember, though, that an action plan is always a work in progr ess. It is not something you can write, lock in your file drawers, and forget about. Keep it visible. Display i t prominently. As your organization changes and 40 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] grows, you will want to continually (usually monthly) revise yo ur action plan to fit the changing needs of your group and community. HOW TO WRITE AN ACTION PLAN Determine what people and sector s of the community should be changed and involved with finding solutions. If you have been using the VMOSA (Vision, Mission, Objectives, Strategies, Action Plans) model, you might have already done this, when you were deciding upon your group' s objectives. Again, try to be inclusive. Most issues that community partnership s deal with are community-wide , and thus need a community-wide solution. Possible sectors include the media, the business community, rel igious organizations, schools, youth organizations, social service organizations, health organizations, and others. Some members of the community you might consider asking to join the action planning group include: Influential people from all the parts of the community affected by your initiative (e.g., from churches and synagogues, the school sys tem, law enforcement, etc.) People who are directly involved in the problem Members of grassroots organizations Members of the various ethnic a nd cultural groups in your commu nity People you know who are interested in the problem or issue Newcomers or young people in the community who are not yet invo lved Convene a planning group in your community to design your actio n plan. This might be the same group of people who worked with you to decide your group's strategies an d objectives. If you are organizing a new group of people, try to make your pla nning committee as diverse and i nclusive as possible. Your group should look like the people most affected by the problem or issue. Once everyone is present, go over your organizations: Vision Mission Objectives Strategies Targets and agents of change P roposed changes for each sector o f the community Develop an action plan composed of action steps that address all proposed changes. The plan should be complete, clear, and current. Add itionally, the action plan sho uld include informati on and ideas you have already gathered while brainstorming about your objectives and your strategies. What are the steps you must take to carry out your objec tives while still fulfilling your v ision and mission? Now it's time for all of the VMOSA components to come together. While the plan might address general goals you want to see accomplished, the action steps will help you determine the spec ific actions you will take to help make your vision a reality. Here are some guidelines to follow to write a ction steps. Members of the community initiative will want to determine: What action or change will occur Who will carry it out When it will take place, an d for how long What resources (i.e., money, staff) are needed to carry out the change Communication (who should know what) Review your completed action plan carefully to check for comple teness. Make sure that each proposed change will help accomplish your group's mission. Also, be sure that the action plan taken as a whole will help you complete your mission; that is, make sure you aren't leavin g anything out. 41 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Follow through. One hard part (figuring out what to do) is finished. Now take your plan and run with it! Remember the 80-20 rule: successful efforts are 80% follow through on planned actions and 20% planning for success. Keep everyone informed about what's going on. Communicate to everyone involved how his or her input was incorporated. No one likes to feel like their wit and wisdom ha s been ignored. Keep track of what (and how well) you've done. Always keep track of what the group has actually done. If the community change (a new program or policy) took significant tim e or resources, it's also a good idea to evaluate what you have done, either formally or informally. Keep several questions in mind for both yourself and others: Are we doing what we said we'd do? Are we doing it well? Is what we are doing ad vancing the mission? You can address these questions informally (ask yourself, chat with friends and other people), as well as formally, through surveys and other evaluation methods. Celebrate a job well done! Celebrate your accomplishments; you and those you work with deserve it. Celebration helps keep everyone excited and interested in the w ork they are doing. A Guide for Creating Action Plans 1. Identify the issue, challenge, or problem to be addressed. The purpose of an action plan is to organize and develop soluti ons to address a specific issue, challenge, or problem. The challenge could range from lack of equipment, sta ff, training, etc. The best way to determine the issue, challenge, or problem would be to conduct a needs as sessment. 2. Evaluate the issue. Examine the list of challenges again and choose one that you fe el most committed and confident about addressing through a plan of action. Once you have done this, the next step is to evaluate the challenge more objectively and thoroughly . Evaluate the challenge in rel ation to five primary areas: 1) Background 2) Need 3) Constraints 4) Resources available 5) Resources needed Background refers to the history of the issue/challenge, including the ca use and other individuals and programs that have tried to address it. If you are not familia r with the issue, this may take a little research on your part. However, based upon what you understand now, what is the history of this issue in the given context. Need has to do more with solutions to the issue or challenge. Esse ntially ask yourself: \"What needs to happen to effectively address this issue?\" Constraints are those factors that are keeping you from addressing the cha llenge. They might include lack of time, money, education about the issue, volunteers, etc. Resources Available are those resources that are eas ily and readily available and accessible right now to address the issue. 42 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Resources Needed are those resources that are not easily and readily available and accessible right now to address the challenge. 3. Develop a Mission Statement Now that you have developed a more thorough conceptualization o f the issue/challenge, you can now work to refine the purpose of the action plan and the projects it will initiate. The Mission (or Vision) Statement aims to be a broad and concise description of your purpose for creating an action plan to address the problem. It does not establish specific tasks that the organiz ation/agency will accomplish, but rather what the problem is and genera lly how it will be addressed. 4. Create Goals Goals function as a kind of thesis statement for the action pla n. They explain exactly what the intended tasks will be in order to fulfill the mission. Keep in mind th at effective goals are action oriented, clear (who, what, where, by when), and are related directly to the problem. You may want to tailor your goals to mee the criteria of being SMART: S - specific M - measurable A - achievable R - realistic T - timed 5. Construct Action Steps Now you have arrived to the most crucial part of the action pla n: the action steps. Essentially, the action steps are a realistic list of s olutions and activities that wil l address the challenge, thus fulfilling the goals and working to achieve the mission. To develop the action steps, you must first brainstorm a list of possible solutions using your background evaluation earlier developed. Especially keep in mind your Nee d, Constraints, Resources Available, and Resources Needed assessment. Once you have developed this primary action step, determine (using your evaluation) if there are any constraints and if there are resources. Next, decide 3 more things: 1) Who will be responsible for coordinating or carrying out the ac tion? 2) A time by which that action might occur 3) The intended outcome of the action. 6. Format your action plan Now arrange the plan into a for mal document that you can easily distribute to those in your organization or anyone just interested in knowing your plans. Suggested action plan format: Title 1) Mission Statement 2) Goals 3) Issue and Background 4) Action Steps 43 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Action Plan Template Use this Action Plan Template to identify specific steps you ne ed to take in order to achieve the goals and objectives outlined in your business plan. This tool can also b e used to create the action plan that will accompany your marketing plan. Tip: Make each action step as simple and specific as possible, breaking down complex actions into single steps. Goal: Action Step What needs to be done? Responsible Person Who should take action to complete this step? Deadline When should this step be completed? Necessary Resources What do you need in order to complete this step? Potential Challenges Are there any potential challenges that may impede completion? How will you overcome them? Result Was this step successfully completed? Were any new steps identified in the process? Using Action Plans Use an Action Plan whenever you need to plan a small project. To draw up an Action Plan, simply list the tasks that you need to carry out to achieve your objective, in the order that you need to complete them. (This is very simple, but it is still very useful!) Use the three-step pro cess below to help you: Step 1: Identify Tasks Start by brainstorming all of the tasks that you need to complete to accomplish your objective. It's helpful to start this pro cess at the very beginning. What' s the very first action you' ll need to take? Once that task is complete, what comes next? Are there any steps that sho uld be prioritized to meet specific deadlines, or because of limits on other people's availability? Step 2: Analyze and Delegate Tasks Now that you can see the entire project from beginning to end, look at each task in greater detail. Are there any steps that you could drop, but still meet your ob jective? Which tasks could you delegate to someone else on your team, or could be dealt with by a freelanc er? Are there any deadlines for specific steps? Do you need to arrange additional resources? Step 3: Double-Check with SCHEMES Use the SCHEMES* mnemonic to check that your plan is comprehens ive. SCHEMES stands for: Space. Cash. Helpers/People. Equipment. Materials. Expertise. Systems. 44 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] You may not need to think about all of these to complete your project. For instance, for a small internal project to streamline the format of your team's reports, you might only need to think about \"Helpers/People,\" \"Expertise,\" and \"Systems.\" Note: Once you've completed your Action Plan, keep it by you as you c arry out the work, and update it with additional activities if required. Learning from Your Action Plan If you think you'll be trying to achieve a similar goal again, revise your Action Plan after the work is complete, by making a note of anything that you could have done better. For instance, perhaps you could have avoided a last-minute panic if you'd alerted a supplier in advance about the size of order you'd be placing. Or maybe you didn't allow enoug h time to do certain tasks. 45 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Refrences Action Coach. 9 steps to developing a plan for action.

Take a closer l ook at all the things you have achieved in your life. You may tend to focus more on what you do not have or what you have failed at, and this takes time and attention away from recognizing and using your skills and talents. 33-51 You are doing an OK job of recognizing your skills, and believing in your abilities. But perhaps you're a little too hard on your self, and this may stop you fro m getting the full benefit of your previous successes. 52-70 Excellent! You are doing a fabulous job of learning from every experience, and not allowing obstacles to affect the way you see yourself. But you need to nurture your self-confidence, to ensure that your life remains full of confidence-building success. 49 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Building Self-Confidence Believe in Yourself, and Find Success!! From the quietly confident docto r whose advice we rely on, to t he charismatic confidence of an inspiring speaker, self-confident people have qualities that everyone adm ires. Self-confidence is extremely important in almost every aspect o f our lives, yet so many people struggle to find it. Sadly, this can be a vicious circle: People who lack self-c onfidence can find it difficult to become successful. After all, most people are reluctant to back a project that's b eing pitched by someone who was nervous, fumbling and overly apologetic. On the other hand, you might be persuaded by someone who speaks clearly, who holds his or her head high, who answers questions assuredly , and who readily admits when he or she does not know something. Self-confident people inspire confidence in others: their audie nce, their peers, their bosses, their customers, and their friends. And gaining the confidence of others is one of t he key ways in which a self-confident person finds success. The good news is that self-confidence really can be learned and built on. And, whether you're working on your own self-confidence or building the confidence of people around you, it's well-worth the effort! So, how confident do you seem to others? Your level of self-confidence can show in many ways: your behav ior, your body language, how you speak, what you say, and so on. Look at the following comparisons of common confident behavior with behavior associated with low self-confidence. Which thoughts or actions do you reco gnize in yourself and people around you? Self-Confident Low Self-Confidence Doing what you believe to be right, even if others mock or criticize you for it. Governing your behavior based on what other people think. Being willing to take risks and go the extra mile to achieve better things. Staying in your comfort zone, fearing failure and so avoid taking risks. Admitting your mistakes, and learning from them. Working hard to cover up mistakes and hoping that you can fix the problem before anyone notices. Waiting for others to congratulate you on your accomplishments. Extolling your own virtues as often as possible to as many people as possible. Accepting compliments graciously. \"Thanks, I really worked hard on that pro spectus. I'm pleased you recognize my efforts.\" Dismissing compliments offhandedly. \"Oh that prospectus was nothing really, anyone could have done it.\" As you can see from these examples, low self-confidence can be self-destructive, and it often manifests itself as negativity. Self-confident people are generally more positive - they believe in themselves and their abilities, and they also believe in living life to the full. What is Self-Confidence? Two main things contribute to self-confidence: self-efficacy an d self-esteem. We gain a sense of self-efficacy when we see ourselves (and oth ers similar to ourselves) mastering skills and achieving goals that matter in t hose skill areas. This is the c onfidence that, if we learn and work hard in a particular area, we'll succeed; and it's this type of confidenc e that leads people to accept difficult challenges, and persist in the face of setbacks. This overlaps with the idea of self-esteem, which is a more general sense that we can cope with what's going on in our lives, and that we have a right to be happy. Partly, this comes from a feeling that the people around us 50 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] approve of us, which we may or may not be able to control. Howe ver, it also comes from the sense that we are behaving virtuously, that we're competent at what we do, and that we can compete successfully when we put our minds to it. Some people believe that self-confidence can be built with affi rmations and positive thinking. At Mind Tools, we believe that there's some truth in this, but that it's just as important to build self-confidence by setting and achieving goals - thereby building competence. Without this underlying competence, you don't have self- confidence: you have shallow over-confidence, with all of the i ssues, upset and failure that this brings. Building Self-Confidence So how do you build this sense of balanced self-confidence, fou nded on a firm appreciation of reality? The bad news is that there's no quick fix, or 5-minute solution . The good news is that building self-confidence is readily achievable, just as long as you have the focus and determination to carry things th rough. And what's even better is that the things you'll do to build self- confidence will also build succes s - after all, your confidence will come from real, solid achievement. No-one can take this away from you! So here are our three steps to self-confidence, for which we'll use the metaphor of a journey: preparing for your journey; setting out; and accelerating towards success. Step 1: Preparing for Your Journey The first step involves getting yourself ready for your journey to self-confidence. You need to take stock of where you are, think about where you want to go, get yourself i n the right mindset for your journey, and commit yourself to starting it and staying with it. In preparing for your journey, do these five things: 1. Look at what you've already achieved: Think about your life so far, and list the ten best things you've achieved in an \"Achievement Log.\" Perhaps you came top in an important test or exam, played a key role in an important team, produced the best sales figures in a period, did something that made a key difference in someone else's life, or delivered a p roject that meant a lot for your business. Put these into a smartly formatted document, which you can look at often. And then spend a few minutes each week enjoying the success you've already had! 2. Think about your strengths: Next, use a technique like SWOTT Analysis to take a look at who and where you are. Looking at your Achievement Log, and reflecti ng on your recent life, think about what your friends would consider to be your strengths and weaknesses. From these, think about the opportuni ties, threats and the trends that you face. Make sure that you enjoy a few minutes reflecting on your stren gths! 3. Think about what's important to you, and where you want to go: Next, think about the things that are really important to you, and what you want to achieve with your life. Setting and achieving goals is a key part of this, and real self-confidence comes from this. Goal setting is the process you use to set yourself targets, and measure your succe ssful hitting of those targets. 51 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Set goals that exploit your stre ngths, minimize your weaknesses , realize your opportunities, and control the threats you face. And having set the major goals i n your life, identify the first step in each. A tip: Make sure it's a very small step, perhaps taking no more than an hour to complete! 4. Start managing your mind: At this stage, you need to start managing your mind. Learn to p ick up and defeat the negative self-talk which can destroy your confidence. Further useful reading - this t eaches you how to use and create strong mental images of what you'll feel and experience as you achieve your maj or goals - there's something about doing this that makes even major goals seem achievable! 5. And then commit yourself to success! The final part of preparing for the journey is to make a clear and unequivocal promise to yourself that you are absolutely committed to your journey, and that you will do all in your power to achieve it. If as you're doing it, you find doubts starting to surface, write them down and challenge them calmly and rationally. If they dissolve under scrutiny, that's great. Howe ver, if they are based on genuine risks, make sure you set additional goals to ma nage these appropriately. Either way, make that promise! Tip: Balanced Self-Confidence Self-confidence is about balance . At one extreme, we have peopl e with low self-confidence. At the other end, we have people who may be over-confident. If you are under-confident, you'll avoid taking risks and stretching yourself; and you might not try at all. And if you're over-confident, you may take on too much risk, stretch y ourself beyond your capabilities, and crash badly. You may also find that you're so optimistic that you don 't try hard enough to truly succeed. Getting this right is a matter of having the right amount of co nfidence, founded in reality and on your true ability. With the right amount o f self-confidence, you will tak e informed risks, stretch yourself (but not beyond your abilities) and try hard. Step 2: Setting Out This is where you start, ever so slowly, moving towards your go al. By doing the right things, and starting with small, easy wins, you'll put y ourself on the path to success - and start building the self-confidence that comes with this. Build the knowledge you need to succeed: Looking at your goals, identify the skills you'll need to achie ve them. And then look at how you can acquire these skills confidently and well . Don't just accept a sketchy, just-good-enough solution - look for a solution, a program or a course that fully equips you to achieve what you w ant to achieve and, i deally, gives you a certificate or qualification you can be proud of. 52 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Focus on the basics: When you're starting, don't try to do anything clever or elabor ate. And don't reach for perfection - just enjoy doing simple things successfully and well. Set small goals, and achieve them: Starting with the very small goals you identified in step 1, ge t in the habit of setting them, achieving them, and celebrating that achievement. Don't make goals particularly cha llenging at this stage, just get into the habit of achieving them and celebrating them. And, little by little, sta rt piling up the successes! Keep managing your mind: Stay on top of that positive thinking, keep celebrating and enj oying success, and keep those mental images strong. You can also use a technique like Treasure Mapping to m ake your visualizations even stronger! And on the other side, learn to handle failure. Accept that mis takes happen when you're trying something new. In fact, if you get into the habit of treating mistakes as lear ning experiences, you can (almost) start to see them in a positive light. After all, the re's a lot to be said for th e saying \"if it doesn't kill y ou, it makes you stronger!\" Step 3: Accelerating Towards Success By this stage, you'll feel your self-confidence building. You'l l have completed some of the courses you started in step 2, and you' ll have plenty of success to celebrate! This is the time to start stretching yourself. Make the goals a bit bigger, and the challenges a bit tougher. Increase the size of your commitment. And extend the skills you've proven into new, but closely related arenas. Tip 1: Keep yourself grounded - this is where people tend to get over- confident and over-stretch themselves. And make sure you don't start enjo ying cleverness for its own sake... As long as you keep on stretching yourself enough, but not too much, you'll find your self-confidence building apace. What's more, you'll have earned your self-confidence - b ecause you'll have put in the hard graft necessary to be successful! 53 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Leadership Caffeine: 9 Ideas for Strengthening Your Self-Esteem January 31, 2011 by Art Petty One definition of self-esteem reflects, \"confidence in one's own worth or abilities.\" Another source, psychologist and author, Dr. Nathaniel Branden, offers: \"Self-esteem is the experience of being competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of happiness.\" While typically not a topic discussed over coffee, many leaders struggle with issues of low self-esteem. They question their abilities to cope with the problems at hand , they often doubt they are worthy of the position of leadership they occupy, and they most definitely agonize qui etly over much of their professional existence. Others manifest their low sel f-esteem with over-the-top aggress iveness and strong controlling behaviors. Regardless of how the self-esteem issue is expressed, the suffe rers struggle with a debilitating level of self- doubt. Unfounded criticism and minor setbacks easily derail the posit ive thought train. Instead of pursuing success, the leader with low self-esteem settles for a kind of tortured survival. Nine Ideas to Help Strengthen Your Leadership Self-Esteem 1. Recognize that you're not alone. The greatest historical figures and leaders throughout history struggled with self-doubt, and many of the most outwardly confident leade rs battle this same issue in private. You are most definitely not alone. 2. Cultivate \"bigger purpose\" thinking about your job. The focus on a large and compelling mission promotes action and helps set priorities. It also sets the stag e for self-esteem reinforcing behaviors and achievements. I crafted my Leader's Charter to remind me of my true role as a leader and serve as my \"bigg er purpose.\" A few moments reviewing and reflecting upon The Charter every morning, does wonders for your attitude and for providing a strong reason for being. The Leader's Charter: Your primary role as a leader is to: Create an environment that facilitates high individual and team performance, Support innovation in process, programs and approaches, Encourage collaboration where necessary, and Promote the development of your associates in rol es that leverage their talents and that challenge them to pursue new and greater accomplishments. With all of that \"purpose\" to focus on, it's hard to spend time wondering whether you are up to the job. Your actions and approaches towa rds others are inherent in The Charter. And as you live your day(s) according to the concepts, you cannot help but produce small victories. T hese small victories are rocket-fuel for self- esteem. 3. Small victories count! Keep tabs on yours. Keep a list of the small victories to reinforce your growing self-esteem and good attitude. And remember to share the wealt h by celebrating or praising the positive accomplishments of others. Your positive praise helps others b uild their own self-esteem. 4. Read something inspirational. My own doses of self-esteem fuel come from biographies of hist orical figures who battled overwhelmi ng odds, only to succeed. It's a mazing what looking at a truly bad situation faced by someone else will do to put your own situation in perspective. 5. Trust feedback from trusted sources. Not all feedback and not all fee dback providers are created equal. The comment from an audience member recently regarding a concep t that I \"failed to develop\" on one of my slides was interesting but fra nkly irrelevant. The talk had been a success however, it clearly bugged this 54 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] guy that I had not expanded up on the issue he felt so passionately about. I suggested he make it a self-study topic. 6. Pull out of a stall. Take action. Actions...and movement are impor tant steps in building self-este em. An internal preoccupation on your supposed negatives coupled with no action is truly self-reinforcing. 7. Focus your actions on your strengths. Just for a few moments, forge t about the weaknesses that you believe are holding you back. Preoccupying on your weaknesses r einforces low self-esteem thinking. 8. Don't overlook your physical appearance. Focus on getting in shape, los ing weight, getting a better haircut and/or improving your sty le of dress. Much of our self- esteem flows from how we feel about our looks and physical presence. 9. Selectively take action to strengthen weaknesses. As the small victories pile up, and as you build upon your strengths and refocus your efforts around your priorities (The Charter), selectively identify weaknesses to strengthen and take action . Buy and read and apply the lesso ns in a self-help book, take a course or seek a mentor to guide your efforts and offer reinforcement. 55 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Build Self Confidence Self-confidence is the differen ce between feeling unstoppable and feeling scared out of your wits. Your perception of yourself has an enormous impact on how others per ceive you. Perception is reality \u2014 the more self-confidence you have, the more likely it is you'll succeed. Although many of the factors affecting self-confidence are beyo nd your control, there are a number of things you can consciously do to build self-confidence. By using these 10 strategies you can get the mental edge you need to reach your potential. 1. Dress Sharp Although clothes don't make the man, they certainly affect the way he feels about himself. No one is more conscious of your physical appearance than you are. When you do n't look good, it changes the way you carry yourself and interact with other people. Use this to your advan tage by taking care of your personal appearance. In most cases, significant impr ovements can be made by bathing and shaving frequently, wearing clean clothes, and being cognizant of the latest styles. This doesn't mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. One great rule to follow is \"spe nd twice as much, buy half as much\". Rather than buying a bu nch of cheap clothes, buy half as many select, high quality items. In long run this decreases spending because e xpensive clothes wear out less easily and stay in style longer than cheap clothes. Buying less also helps r educe the clutter in your clos et. 2. Walk Faster One of the easiest ways to tell how a person feels about herself is to examine her walk. Is it slow? Tired? Painful? Or is it energetic and purposeful? People with confide nce walk quickly. They h ave places to go, people to see, and important work to do. Even if you aren't in a hurry , you can increase your self-confidence by putting some pep in your step. Walking 25% faster will make to you look and feel more important. 3. Good Posture Similarly, the way a person carries herself tells a story. Peop le with slumped shoulders and lethargic movements display a lack of self-confidence. They aren't enthusiastic abo ut what they're doing and they don't consider themselves important. By practicing good posture, you'll automa tically feel more confident. Stand up straight, keep your head up, and make eye contact. You'll make a positive impression on others and instantly feel more alert and empowered. 4. Personal Commercial One of the best ways to build confidence is listening to a moti vational speech. Unfortuna tely, opportunities to listen to a great speaker are few and far between. You can fill this need by creating a personal commercial. Write a 30-60 second speech that highlights your strengths and goals. Then recite it in front of the mirror aloud (or inside your head if you prefer) whenever you need a confidence boost. 5. Gratitude When you focus too much on what you want, the mind creates reas ons why you can't have it. This leads you to dwell on your weaknesses. The best way to avoid this is conscio usly focusing on gratitude. Set aside time each day to mentally list everything you have to be grateful for. Re call your past successes, unique skills, loving relationships, and positive momentum. You'll be amazed how much you have going for you and motivated to take that next step towards success. 6. Compliment other people When we think negatively about ourselves, we often project that feeling on to others in the form of insults and gossip. To break this cycle of neg ativity, get in the habit of praising other people. Refuse to engage in 56 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] backstabbing gossip and make an effort to complement those arou nd you. In the process , you'll become well liked and build self-confidence. By looking for the best in oth ers, you indirectly bring out the best in yourself. 7. Sit in the front row In schools, offices, and public assemblies around the world, pe ople constantly strive to sit at the back of the room. Most people prefer the back because they're afraid of being noticed. This reflects a lack of self- confidence. By deciding to sit in the front row, you can get ov er this irrational fear and build your self- confidence. You'll also be more vi sible to the important people talking from the front of the room. 8. Speak up During group discussions many peop le never speak up because the y're afraid that people will judge them for saying something stupid. This fear isn't really justified. Generally, people are much more accepting than we imagine. In fact most people are dealing with the exact same fears. By making an effort to speak up at least once in every group discussion, you' ll become a better public speake r, more confident in your own thoughts, and recognized as a leader by your peers. 9. Work out Along the same lines as personal appearance, physical fitness h as a huge effect on self-confidence. If you're out of shape, you'll feel insecure, unattractive, and less energeti c. By working out, you improve your physical appearance, energize yourself, and accomplish something positiv e. Having the discipline to work out not only makes you feel better, it creates positive momentum that you ca n build on the rest of the day. 10. Focus on contribution Too often we get caught up in our own desires. We focus too much on ourselves and not enough on the needs of other people. If you stop thinking about yourself and concentrate on the contribution you're making to the rest of the world, you won't worry as much about you own flaws. This will increase self-confidence and allow you to contribute with maximum efficiency. The more you contribute to the world the more you'll be rewarded with personal success and recognition. 57 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] How To Build Self-Confidence Whether you think you can or think you can't - you are right.\" Henry Ford When I was in my late teens a friend of mine, an elite athlete, gave me the most profound, yet simple advice that changed the way I would view myself forever. He told me: \"If you don't think very highly of yourself, you can't expect a nyone else think it of you.\" Translation - It means that we alone are responsible for building self-confidence. We cannot depend upon, or wait for anyone else's approval. We must see ourselves as worthy and capable of achieving anything we choose to achieve. Ultimately, how we see ourselves is more importa nt than how any one else sees us. If we don't work at loving and accepting ourselves, nothing any one else thinks matters. Tips For Building Self-Confidence Acknowledge Your Uniqueness. Believe in yourself and know that you are one of a kind. In the words of Walt Whitman know: \"That you are here--that life exists, and identity; That the powerful play goes on , and you will contribute a verse .\" There is no one else like you on this planet. No one looks like you, has the same talents, experiences, or perspective as you do. You are unique and are therefore here to make your unique contribution. If we each focus on what we bring into the world to share, there can be no comparisons, envy or r egret. We are here to \"contribute a verse\". Give it Your Best. When you do the best you can, with the best of what you've got, you can't help but feel good about yourself and that confidence comes through in everything that you do. Gi ving it your best makes you unafraid to take risks or step out of your comfort zone - both great confidence- builders. Persevere. Everybody has setbacks and obstacles to contend with. Don't let them undermine your confidence. Treat them as opportunities to strengthen your resolve and then perse vere. Overcome adversity. Overcoming adversity builds and strengthens self-confidence. Th e greatest songs, works of art and literary pieces have been written by those who have experienced the depths of despair, loss and emptiness and overcame them. Experiencing sadness and loss, and then rising a bove them, gives rise to hope and triumph. It makes you stretch and become more than you were. Accomplish something. Set goals for yourself and then push yourself to reach them. Se lf-confidence soars when you know you can do what you put your mind to. It makes you feel unstoppable. Likewise, achieve mastery. Mastery experiences are those in which you know you have worked hard and put in great effort to achieve success. Separate Yourself From the Event. You are not what happens to you , nor how you believe others see you. In other words, you are not defined by what happens to you, nor are you defined by how others see y ou. You are who you choose to be - a person of character, dignity and self-confidence. Confront your fears. There's nothing that destroys self-confidence more than succumb ing to fear. Everyone feels fear at various times; we're human, however facing circumstances with courage and poise strengthens character and builds 58 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] self-confidence. Put yourself out there! If you're afraid to me et new people, attend soci al events, etc. - don't stay home and fret. Doing builds confidence. Of course, you'll feel, and probably be awkward the first few times in new situations, however, the more you do it, the bette r you'll get, and therefore the better you'll feel about yourself. Good looks do not equal self-confidence. Some of the most attractive peopl e in the world are insecure an d lack self-confidence. Marilyn Monroe was considered to be one of the sex iest, most beautiful people in the world, yet she lacked a positive self-image. She misguidedly allowed extern al factors, such as the approval of others, to determine her self-worth. Good looks may help you feel good about yourself temporarily, but ar e by no means enough. Take good care of yourself. When you are in fit, in good health, and make a point of lookin g your best, you can't help but feel confident. This is different, of course, from comparing your looks to othe rs. It's about being comfortable with you. Everyone looks good when they're in good shape, well groomed, a nd healthy. You can't help but have a glow about you when you take good care of yourself. Learn how to give yourself a pep talk. We all have our down moments, mom ents of doubt, confusion and u ncertainty. When that happens, we must learn how to restore self-confidence. One way is to understand that everyone goes through such moments. Another is to remember past successes, visualize the desired ou tcome, and keep at it! Practice makes perfect. Self-confidence is absolutely essential to achieving success in any endeavor. You acquire it by doing, learning, accomplishing, and persisting. How to Build Self Confidence: 6 Essential and Timeless Tips by Henrik Edberg \"Never bend your head. Always hold it high. Look the world straight in the face.\" Helen Keller \"Whatever we expect with confidence b ecomes our own self-fulfilling prophecy.\" Brian Tracy \"Confidence is courage at ease.\" Daniel Maher I believe that one of the most common wishes is simply to feel more confident in various situations in life. But how? Confident friends may say: \"Well, just be confident, man!\" Howe ver, to a person that doesn't feel that confident this piece of advice may not be very helpful at all. Here are however some time-tes ted and timeless advice. I hope you will find is useful to improve and maintain your own levels of confidence. 1. Take action. Get it done. \"Having once decided to achieve a certain task, achieve it at all costs of tedium and distaste. The gain in self- confidence of having accomplished a tiresome labor is immense.\" Thomas A. Bennett \"Nothing builds self-esteem and self-confidence like accomplishment.\" Thomas Carlyle \"Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.\" Dale Carnegie The most important step in building self-confidence is simply t o take action. Working on something and getting it done. Sitting at home and thinki ng about it will just make y ou feel worse. Simple. But not always easy to do. To make it a bit easier, here are a three of my favorite ways t o make it easier to take action: 59 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Be present. This will help you snap out of over thinking and just go and d o whatever you want to get done. This is probably the best tip I have found so far for tak ing more action since it puts you in a state where you feel little emotional resistance to the work you'll d o. And it puts you in state where the right actions often just seem to flow out of you in a focused but relaxed way and without much effort. One of the simplest ways to connect with the present moment is just to keep your focus on your breathing for a minute or two. Lighten up. One way to dissuade yourself from taking action is to take wha tever you are about to do too seriously. That makes it feel too big, too difficult and to o scary. If you on the ot her hand relax a bit and lighten up you often realize that those problems and negati ve feelings are just something you are creating in your own mind. With a lighter state of mind your ta sks seems lighter and become easier to get started with. Really, really want it. Then taking action isn't something you have to force. Taking a ction becomes a very natural thing. It's something you can't wait to do. 2. Face your fear. \"The way to develop self-confidence is to do the thing you fear.\" William Jennings Bryan \"You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experien ce in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived thr ough this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do.\" Eleanor Roosevelt Look, I could tell you to do affirmations or other exercises for months in front of your mirror. It may have a positive effect. Just like preparing yourself it may help you t o take action with more confidence. But to be frank, if you don't listen to the quotes above and fa ce your fears you won't experience any better self- confidence on a deeper and more fundamental level. Having exper iences where you face your fear is what really builds self-confidence. There is no way around it. However, there are ways to face your fears that do not include that much shaking of the knees. There are ways to make it easier for yourself. Be curious. When you are stuck in fear you are closed up. You tend to crea te division in your world and mind. You create barriers between you and other things/people. When you shift to being curious your perceptions go SWOOSH! and the world just opens up. Curiosity i s filled with anticipation and enthusiasm. It opens you up. And when you are open and enthusia stic then you have more fun things to think about than focusing on your fear. How do you become more curious? One way is to remember how life has become more fun in the past thanks to your curiosi ty and to remember all the cool things it helped you to discover and experience. Realize that fear is often based on unhelpful interpretation. As humans we like to look for patterns. The problem is just that we often find negative and not so help ful patterns in our lives based on just one or two experiences. Or by misjudging situations. Or through som e silly miscommunication. When you get too identified with your thoughts you'll believe anything they tell you. A more helpful practise may be to not take your thoughts too seriously. A lot of the time t hey and your memory are pretty inaccurate. 3. Understand in what order things happen. One of my favorite snippets of movie-dialogue is this one from the 1999 film \"Three Kings\". In this scene Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) wants the sma ll team to save a fellow soldier and steal Saddam's gold just after the first Gulf War has ended. The you ng soldier Conrad V ig (Spike Jo nze) has his doubts about the plan: 60 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Archie Gates: You're scared, right? Conrad Vig: Maybe. Archie Gates: The way it works is, you do the thing you're scared shitless of, and you get the courage AFTER you do it, not before you do it. Conrad Vig: That's a dumbass way to work. It should be the other way around. Archie Gates: I know. That's the way it works. Great movie. Great little piece of dialogue. Even though it may not be what people want to hear. The thing is, when you do things you don't just build confidenc e in your ability to handle different situations. You also experience progressive d esensitization. What that mean s is that situations - like for example public speaking or maybe just showing your latest blog post to an audi ence out there - that made you feel all shaky become more and more normal in your life. It is no longer somet hing you psyche yourself up to do. It just becomes normal. Like tying your shoes, hanging out with your fr iends or taking a shower. It may seem scary now. But after having done whatever you fear a few to a dozen times or so you may think: \"Is that it?\" You almost feel disa ppointed of how anticlimactic it has become. You may even get a bit angry with yourself and wonder why you avoided doing it for so long. 4. Prepare. \"One important key to success is self-confidence. An im portant key to self- confidence is preparation.\" Arthur Ashe When you know nothing of what you are about to do it's very eas y to get lost in vague, foggy fear and start building big horror scenarios in y our mind of what may happen if you give it a try. Preparing yourself and educating yourself can be a big help her e. By for example rehearsing and rewriting your speech over and over you can pretty much learn it by heart. By doing research you can find breathing techniques that can quickly make you calme r and present. Or simple visuali zation techniques that make you feel more confident and positive as you step out on the stage. This is obviously more work than not doing anything about the s peech at all before you start giving it. But it can make a huge difference in your c onfidence levels if you take th e time to prepare yourself. And of course, the speech and the delivery of it will most likely be a lot better too. So prepare and you will feel more comfortable and confident. Ju st don't make the mistake of getting stuck in the preparation phase and using it as a way to avoid taking action and the possible pain that it may result in. 5. Realize that failure or being wrong will not kill you. \"Confidence comes not from always being right but from not fearing to be wrong.\" Peter T. Mcintyre \"I quit being afraid when my first venture failed and the sky didn't fall down.\" Allen H. Neuharth Again, you have to face your fear. Because it is only then that you discover the thing that billions of people throughout history have discovered before you. Failure won't ki ll you. Nor will being wrong. The sky will not fall down. That's just what peopl e that haven't faced their fea r yet think. The thing is to reframe failure from being something that makes your legs shake to something useful and important for the growth of your self-confidence and your overa ll growth as a human being. Here are four ways that failure can help you out: 61 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] You learn. Instead of seeing failure as something horrible you can start to view it more as a learning experience. When standing in the middle of a failure, you can a sk yourself questions like: What's awesome about this situation? W hat can I learn from this situat ion? You gain experiences you could not get any other way. Ideally, you probably want to learn from other people's mistakes and failures. That's not always easy to do though. Sometimes you just have to fail on your own to learn a lesson and to gain an experience no one can relate to you in mere words. You become stronger. Every time you fail you become more accustomed to it. You real ize more and more that it's not the end of the world. And, again, you get de sensitized. You can handle things that would have been very hard to handle a few years back. Failing c an also a have an exhilarating component because even though you failed you at least took a ch ance. You didn't just sit on your hands doing nothing. And that took quite a bit of courage and determi nation. Your chances of succeeding increases. Every time you fail you can learn and increase your inner strength. So every failure can make you more and more likely to succeed. And remember, the world doesn't revolve around you. You may like to think so. But it doesn't. People really don't care that much about what you do. They have their own lif e, problems and worries that the world revolves around them to focus on. They don't think that much about you o r are constantly monitoring what you do wrong or when you fail. Maybe a disappointing thought. But a liberating and relieving one too because now you can let go of that worry that everyone is watching you. 6. Get to know who you are and what you want out of life. \"The world has the habit of making room for the man who se words and actions show that he knows where he is going.\" Napoleon Hill \"Don't listen to anyone who tells you that you can't do this or that. That's nonsense. Make up your mind, you'll never use crutches or a stick, then have a go at everything. Go to school, join in all the games you can. Go anywhere you want to. But never, never let them persuade you that things are too difficult or impossible.\" Douglas Bader To build and find more confidence in yourself you have to get t o know yourself better. Go exploring. Face some of your fears. Fail over and over and understand that it isn't really that big of a deal. Grow stronger through such experiences and also become more internally relaxed. Figure out what really excites you by simply trying a whole bunch of stuff out. When you know more about who you are and what you want out of l ife - not other people say you want - you will have more confidence in y ourself and what you can do. What other people say or think will have less of an impact than it used to because you know who you are better than they do. And since you ha ve had all these experiences, sin ce you have taken time to really get to know yourself and stretch yourself you will trust your own opinion a nd ability more than anything outside of you. You become stable and centered in yourself. This will of course take time. It may be something that never r eally ends. So you might as well get started now. 62 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 62 Ways to Build Self Confidence Confidence is a tool you can use in your everyday life to do al l kinds of cool stuff, not least to stop second- guessing yourself, manage your fears and become able to do more of the things that really matter to you.

Go to a networking event and focus on how you can be helpful to other people rather than being nervous about your own stuff. 5. Get crystal clear on the things t hat truly matter to you. If t hey're not in your life, you need to bring them in. 6. Write a list of the things you're tolerating and putting up wit h in your life, then write down how you can remove, minimize or diminish each one. 7. Look at a great win or success you' ve experienced and give your self credit for your part in it. Recognizing your achievements is not egotistical, it's healthy. 8. Next time you're at a social e vent, don't just stick with the people you know - go and have a conversation with someone you don't know and you never know what - or who - you'll discover. 9. Next time you talk yourself out of doing something (a party inv ite, a challenging project or whatever else), say 'What the Heck' and go do it anyway. 10. Do one thing each day that mak es you smile (on the inside or on the outside). 11. Look for the patterns of thought that take you to a place where you start second-guessing or over-thinking. Now imagine that your best friend went through exactly the same thought process and ended up holding themselves back - what would you want to say to them? 12. Ask out that girl or guy you fancy the pants off (only if you're single, don't want to get you into trouble). 13. You have to keep your mind well fed, so write a list of 20 things that keeps your mind feeling nourished and make sure you're giving them room in your life. 14.

Scared of looking silly? You and everyone else. It's no biggie so don't let it stop you. Say it with me - \"It just doesn't matter.\" 19. Don't think fo r a second th at you can't be confident. There ar e already loads of things you do with natural self-confidence, you just have t o notice them and get familiar with how it feels. Look for the things you do where the question of whether you're confident enough never ari ses. 20. Listen to your doubts but be ready to make deliberate decisions once you've heard them. Sometimes your doubts are there to let you know what you need to prepare for, so you can use them to your benefit as you move forwards. 21. Think of a time when it felt like a whole bank of switches in y our head flicked to the on position and you were firing on all cylinders. What were you doing and what's the reason it felt so great? 63 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 22. You've got a whole bunch of outda ted rules that determine what you do, don't do, should do and shouldn't do. These rules limit your thinki ng and limit your behavior. Tear up your rule book and notice how free you are to make great decisions. 23. Do you get annoyed with yourself because you didn't make the mo st of something or stepped back form an opportunity? Don't beat yourself up because that's just going to make you feel worse. Instead, be brutally honest and ask yourself what you gained from the situation and what you lost out on. Based on this win/lose balance, what's a different c hoice you can make next time? 24. If you'd already done everything in life you'd have no need to be scared.

Always recognize that you're more than a match for any situatio n you might find yourself in, no matter how tough the going gets. 29. Don't get swept up in the drama of what's happening right now, look for more useful ways of engaging with what happens in your life. 30. Don't automatically give in to th e instant pay-off - it often m eans you're selling yourself short. 31. When you feel like stamping your foot and yelling \"I deserve be tter than this!\" take a step back and say \"I can BE better than this.\" 32. Confidence sometimes means adm itting you're wrong - always be r eady to hold your hands up and change your mind. 33. Trust your instincts. They know what they're talking about. 34.

Stop struggling against the things you don't like in your life - create a congruent environment around you that flows and allows you to be you. 40. No man's an island, and you need to be a part of the world you around to feel confident. What can you participate in that's important to you? 41. Forget the pros and cons - do something bold in the face of you r challenges and fears. 42. Work on developing the skills you need to win at the things tha t matter to you. What can you practice that would radically improve your chances of winning? 43. The body is a mirror for the mind, so shifting your body into a confident state can have surprising results. 44. Don't get disheartened or demo tivated when you get to 90% with something you're working on - push through and you'll see that the last 10% is where the magic hap pens. 45. Keep comparing yourself to others? Stop it, don't try to valid ate yourself through comparison - you're just peachy as you are. 46. Put your head above the parapet at work and speak up if there's something you think could be improved or if you have an idea you think has legs. 47. If there's something you've been struggling to understand for a while, stop trying to understand it. Accept it just as it is, fully and wholly. 64 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 48. Shy with new people? Not a pr oblem, there's nothing wrong with being shy and it doesn't mean you're not confident. Just don't over think it, start beating yourself up or thinking you're less than because you're shy - the more you think like that the worse it gets. 49. Your environment directly impacts your self-perception, so if y ou're surrounded by clutter, paperwork and rubbish put a morning aside to clean up your stuff and get orga nized. 50. Write yourself a list of the amazing things you'd love to do in your life, and make a start by simply looking into the first one or two things that leap out at you. 51. Don't make your happiness or self-worth dependent on being in a relationship or being validated by someone else. Find your inherent value first, and your relatio nships and confidence will be immeasurably better. 52. Your strengths can be used to overcome any of your weaknesses. We all have weaknesses but they only undermine your confidence if you let them. 53. The longer you leave that big thing on your to-do list the more it'll drain you and the bigger it'll seem - get it done and free yourself up. 54. What golden threads, themes, pa tterns and passions have always been in your life? If those things aren't present in your life right now, y ou need to shift your priorit ies. 55. Your body image does matter, because if you have a bad relation ship with your body you won't be feeling confident in yourself. Get trim if you need to, just make sure you get along with your body. 56. Being confident is an ongoing pr ocess. It isn't a goal or an e nd-point that you reach and then stop. Keep playing to the best of your ab ility and your confidence will al ways be there to support you. 57. Try a new path. The well-trodde n paths of your life can easily turn from familiarity to apathy and disconnection. A new path wakes you up. 58. Don't say \"Yes\" to taking on a task simply because you don't wa nt to rock the boat - you can politely decline requests you can't meet and don't need to create an exc use for it. 59. Look at the people you respect who seem confident - don't copy them, but identify what it is they do differently that conveys confidence and what you can learn from it. 60. Make a plan to do something, then make deliberate choices to fo llow through. Seeing progress gives you important self-reinforcement. 61. When you feel yourself focusing inwards and becoming paralyzed with doubt or fear, switch to focusing outwards at what you can engage and interact with. 62. Still beating yourself up for failing or screwing up? It might not be a barrel of laughs but it's not going to help you get through it. Much better to recognize that everyth ing, whether it turns out or not, is how you practice living a rich life. The Bottom-Line for Now: Your self-esteem is an intensely personal issue that impacts ot hers and affects your ability to succeed. A strong sense of your own self-worth is important for building self-confidence, and self-confidence is an important ingredient for success as a leader. If you're struggling with a sense of low self-esteem, it's important to do something. Try the items on the list, add in others, and if you 're still struggling seek help. You deserve a strong self-esteem, and your colleagues deserve a leader with enough self-confidence to help them strive and succeed. 65 of 744[POST Management Program on October 2011 at: www.artpetty.com/2011/01/31/leadership-caffeine-9-ideas-for... 66 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Critical Incidents POST Management Program 67 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Instructional Goal: To discuss critical incident protocol and the importance of m anaging critical stress reaction symptoms in self and their staff.

The true definition of a critical incident includes any situati on requiring swift, decisive action involving multiple components in response to and occurring outside of the normal course of routine business activities. A critical incident is any situation beyond the realm of a pers on's usual experience that overwhelms his/her sense of vulnerability and/or lack of control over the situatio n. A critical incident is any situation faced by emergency service personnel that causes them to experience unusually strong emotional reaction which have the potential to interfere with their ability to function whether at the scene or later. Critical Incident Assessment Assess possible event: Man-made or natural All potential threats and hazards must be identified Natural: tornadoes, floods, wint er storms, earthquakes, power outages, etc. Man-made: terrorist attacks, active shooter, workplace violenc e, explosions, bombings, accidents, fire, etc. 69 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Critical Incident Planning Planning is decision making prior to an actual crisis or disast er Including resources required to m anage and resolve the event Plan must also include necessary steps during and after the cri sis (recovery) Develop the Plan If a plan does not exist, create one If a plan does exist, review it (annually) Keep plans simple and flexible Consider likely events based on Intel and past experiences Identify resource gaps Exercise the Plan Drills or exercises Keep exercise scenarios realistic Keep exercises relatively simple Focus on one or two key threats Begin with tabletop exercises 70 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Types of Exercises Orientation Tabletop Functional Full-scale Remember that Exercises Clarify responsibilities Identify roles Enhance skills Assess capabilities Evaluate performance Measure resources Provide feedback Critical Incident - Size up Report Incident Type (fire, vehicle acci dent, HazMat spill, search and rescue, etc.) Location/Jurisdiction Incident Size Incident Status Weather Conditions Radio Frequencies Best Access Routes Special Hazards or Concerns Additional Resource Needs This reference is intended to assist in reporting key informati on regarding incident cond itions when first arriving on-scene.

Initial reports indicate that a gunman entered the plant and shot a receptionist. Employees and visitors are running from the plant in panic and the gunman is still inside. The following conditions exist: It is 2:15 PM, on a Thursday afternoon. The weather is a typic al mild spring day with no wind. Novelty Manufacturing is located next to a medium size strip ma ll. The company employs 125 workers. There is a school located immediately behind the Mall and schoo l gets out at 3:00 PM. Many students cut through the back lot of the plant to meet their friends at the shopping center after school. Two unarmed plant security officers are outside the plant. Wit nesses running from the plant have informed security that the gunman is also holding several containers of a liquid-like substance. One fleeing employee also informed security that she knows the receptionist who is shot. She believes the husband is the shooter. The employee also indicated that the r eceptionist just filed a restraining order against her husband. Police, fire, and emergency services are on the scene. The pla nt's manager is in the front parking lot. The police are requesting information on the victim, floor plan s, and if all employees are out of the plant. It is not known what visitors are still in the plant. The fire department wants to know where flammable materials or items are located in the plant. The press is on the scene and interviewing witnesses. They wan t a spokesperson from the responders to meet them and appear on camera. They want to know if there is a dan ger to the school and also other stores in the mall. Persons are calling Mall security wanting to know if any of the ir friends or relatives are hurt. Mall security wants a representative of the plant to handle the calls or come to their officer. Mall security has informed the plant manager that his home office wants him to call. Hysterical parents are calling the school and the police saying that they heard that there had been a shooting at the school. 72 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Step 1 - Individual Analysis (20 Minutes) Members of the emergency management team (public and private sector) should list their response actions based on the above information.

The process may be long or short; however, planning for the recovery phase will decrease recovery time Recovery should not conflict with the \"crime scene\" preservatio n and examination Operational Leadership The most essential element of s uccessful management of a critic al incident is competent and confident leadership. Leadership means providing purpose, direction, and motivation for personnel working to accomplish difficult tasks under dangerous, stressful circumstances. In confusing and uncertain situations, a good operational leade r will: TAKE CHARGE of assigned resources MOTIVATE personnel with a \"can do safely\" attitude. DEMONSTRATE INITIATIVE by taking action in the absence of orders. COMMUNICATE by giving specific in structions and asking for feed back. SUPERVISE at the scene of action. Be proficient in your job, bot h technically and as a leader Take charge when in charge. Adhere to professional standard operating procedures. Develop a plan to accomplish given objectives. Make sound and timely decisions Maintain situation awareness in o rder to anticipate needed acti ons. Develop contingencies a nd consider consequences. Improvise within the leader's intent to handle a rapidly changing environment. Ensure tasks are understood, supervised, and accomplished Issue clear instructions. Observe and assess actions in progress without micro-managing. 75 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Use positive feedback to modify duties, tasks, and assignments when appropriate.

Most importantly, participants should leave with a strong desir e to improve their proficiency. An AAR is performed as immediately after the event as possible by the personnel involved. The leader's role is to ensure skilled facilitation of the AAR. Reinforce that respectful disagreement is OK. Keep focused on the what, not the who. Make sure everyone participates. End the AAR on a positive note. What was planned? - What actually happened? - Why did it happen? What can we do next time? - (Correct weaknesses/sustain strengths) From the 'Lectric Law Library's Stacks Guide To Crisis Negotiations - www.lectlaw.com Incidents involving barricaded s ubjects, hostage takers, or per sons threatening suicide represent especially trying and stressful moments for law e nforcement personnel who respond to them. Officers first responding to the scene must quickly assess the tota lity of the situation, secure the area, gauge the threat to hostages or bystanders, and request additional units as appropriate. Crisis negotiators must establish contact with subjects, identify their demands, and work to resolve te nse and often volatile standoffs without loss of life. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams must prepare to neutralize subjects throug h swift tactical means. Field commanders assume ultimate responsibility for every aspect of the police response. For such a coordinated response to be successful, each component needs to understand clearly the functions of the others. This article clarifies the role of crisis negotiato rs for field commanders, of whatever rank, who find themselves in command of hostage or other critical incidents. Supervisors who understand the purpose behind the actions taken by negotiators will avoid delays at the scene that occur when negotiators must stop and explain or justify th eir intended courses of action. Such understanding has taken on particular importance in recent years. Negotiators hav e become very active, due in part to the reputations they have established for the su ccessful, peaceful resolution of various types of critical incidents. For example, i n 1993, the Hostage Negotiati ons Team of the Seattle, Washington, Police Department resolved 21 incident s, expending a total of 263 negotiator hours. In 1994, negotiators resolved 32 incidents, spending 407 hours in negotiations. TRAINING Although it might appear that nego tiators and tactical teams work at cross-purposes during a crisis, nothing could be further from the truth. Society requires that law enfo rcement exhausts all means available prior to launching a tactical resolution to an incident. If these means prove unsuccessful, then the transition from negotiation to tactical assault must be a smooth one. To enhance cooperation, negotia tors and personnel from tactical teams should train together on a regular basis. In Seattle, the Hostage Negotiations Team and the Emergency Res ponse Team conduct joint training exercises four to six times a year. These training sessions include four fully enacted crisis scenarios. Members of the department's command staff are en couraged to participate, and through this training, have learned how the two teams work together. 78 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Law enforcement agencies genera lly place a premium on the train ing provided to tactical teams. Administrators should place no less emphasis on the training provided to their negotiations teams. At a very minimum, negotiators should complete the F BI's Basic Hostage/Crisis Nego tiations course. Because the department's training qualifications may become sub ject to critical review in the courts should negotiations fail, negotiators should further their training through advanced courses, seminars, basic psychology classes, and detailed critical a nalysis of past incidents. TYPES OF INCIDENTS Most negotiations teams group incidents into three main categor ies -- hostage takings, barricade situations, and suicide attempts. Traditionally, hostage takings assume the highest profile. However, in recent years, the Seattle Police Department's Hostage Ne gotiations Team has responded to an increasing number of high-profile barricade situations. Field comma nders should remember that the peaceful resolution of a barricade situation is as important to negotiators as the resolution of an incident involving a person threatening to jump from a bridge or a hostage taking with e xtensive media coverage. THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS In negotiations, as in most end eavors, no absolutes exist. Each incident takes on a personality of its own. Field commanders can be sure of only one thing: Their decisions will be scrutinized by every \"Monday morning quarterback\" from city hall to the city desk. Therefore, they s hould base their decisions on an understanding of the negotiations process and the many factors that affect it. Untrained Personnel A successful negotiations process requires a good foundation. O ften, circumstances force the first responding officers to initiate some type of negotiation with the subject( s). However, once line officers or fir st-line supervisors realize that an incident appears to be heading for something other than a prompt resolution, they should immediately termina te negotiations and call in trained negotiators. Too many tragedies in communities across America demonstrate ho w negotiations should not be initiated. A bad start by well-intentioned, but untrained, personnel can have ne gative effects throughout the process. Simply put, personnel who are not trained ne gotiators should not negotiate. Time A negotiator's most important a lly in all situations is time. F ield commanders should not rush anything unless the loss of life appears imminent. Although it may seem as if n othing is happening because a suspect is not negotiating, this is not so. Dur ing these quiet times, many thi ngs occur that will eventually lead to a peaceful resolution. Negotiators refer to these quiet intervals as \"dynamic inactivi ty.\" As long as time passes without any harm to persons involved, then negotiators are making progress. The pas sing of time works for the police in many ways and only means that a resolution is closer at hand. Field commanders should keep in mind that patience is a virtue. The Negotiations Team Generally, the negotiations team consists of at least three mai n negotiators. Each team member plays a vital role in the successful resolutio n of critical incidents. The primary negotiator actually communicates with the subject. The secondary (or backup) negotiator assists the primary negotiator by offering a dvice, monitoring the negotiations, keeping notes, and ensuring that the primary negotiator sees and hears everythi ng in the proper perspective. The intelligence negotiator interviews persons associated with the suspect to compile a criminal history and a history of mental illness, as well as to gather other relevant information. 79 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Often, an additional negotiator will act as the chief negotiato r, whose primary responsibility is to act as a buffer between command personnel a nd the negotiations team. Invariably, and understandably, field commanders want to offer their advice to the negotiations team. Whenever possible, suggestions should be routed to the negotiations team via the chief negotiator. The Negotiations Area Typically, the negotiations team sets up away from the rest of the activity and maintains communications with the command post via a liaison. I n Seattle, a member of the Emergency Response Team generally monitors the negotiations and provides tactical intelligence to the arrest, entry, and perimeter teams. Only the Police Should Negotiate Often, well-meaning civilians o ffer to negotiate with subjects. Sometimes, these civilians insist that they be allowed to negotiate. A wide ra nge of individuals - from parent s, spouses, and lovers to friends, members of the clergy, attorneys, counselors, a nd mental health professionals - might offer to do the talking. As a general rule, direct civilian participation in negotiations is entirely unacc eptable. The tactical negotiations process is a police operation. When faced with these offers, fie ld commanders should keep in mind that the individual now so willing to help might have played a large part in driving the subject over the edge. While these individuals might be a useful source of information, only in very rare circumstances should t hey be allowed to speak directly with subjects. Instead, they should be escorted to the intelligence negotiator and kept well clear of the actual negotiations process. Containment and Control Basic police procedure dictates th at any crisis incident be contained using both inner and outer perimeters established and maintained by the police. Critical incidents su ch as hostage takings, barricade situations, or suicide attempts must be contained prior to the start of negoti ations. Mobile negotiations should not be attempted. While the need for a secure inner perimeter is obvious, crisis incidents also require an emphasis on a well- controlled outer perimeter. When arriving at the scene of a hos tage taking, barricade situation, or suicide intervention, negotiators often encounter a large crowd made up of bystanders, the press, and the subject's family members. It is important that the subject not be given a n audience to \"play to.\" Negotiation cannot succeed if negotiators must compet e with outside influences for the subject's attention. Individuals with potentially helpful information about a subjec t should be secured in an area where they can provide details to the intellige nce negotiator. Likewise, the press should be provided a designated gathering area away from the perimeter and be briefed regularly regarding the status of the negotiations process. Field commanders should remember that reporters have a job to d o. They will do that job, with or without the help of the police. It is far more preferable to provide them w ith the accurate information they need than to force them to gather it for themselves. The relationship need not be confrontational. In Sea ttle, the police generally enjoy good relations with the on-scene press. During protracted incidents, supervisors should request the assistance of the department's me dia relations personnel to hel p deal with the press. The highly unstable nature of t hese incidents also makes it imperative that an arrest team be prepared to take the subject(s) into custody at a moment's notice. In fact, the surr ender phase represents the most critical stage in any negotiated incident. In some cases, surrender can occur very ra pidly. Depending on the severity of the incident, the arrest team can be made up of patrol officers or members of specialized teams. Once the SWAT team sets up at a scene, it should assume this duty. Control of Phone Lines During a protracted crisi s, it is essential that the police con trol the p hone lines. Generally, one of the first actions negotiators take when arriving at an incident is to arrange with the telephone company to deny origination to 80 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] telephones at the subject's disposal. Once origination is denie d, the subject's telephones will no longer get a dial tone. At the negotiators' request, the telephone company then e stablishes a new number that serves as a direct line between negotiators and th e subject. Restricting telephone access in this way prohibits the subject from talking to family, friends, atto rneys, and most important, the press. It also prevents the suspect from gathering intelligence about police maneuvers from associates. The Throw Phone When there is no telephone accessible to the subject, or the te lephone has been disabled as a tactical move by SWAT, the police must reestablish a means of communication. Bec ause of the potential danger posed to negotiators, face-to-face negotiations do not represent an acce ptable option. In these situations, the SWAT team often tactically delivers a \"throw phone\"--a standard tele phone linked to a hardline system connected to the hostage phone system. Because telephone delivery places members of the SWAT team in dangerous situations, it should be practiced regularly during joint negotiator-SWAT t raining exercises. Controlling Utilities In Seattle, control of the phone lines generally can be secured without supervisory approval. However, in many instances, the negotiations team might determine a need to cont rol the electricity and water, as well. Only the on-scene commander can make the final decision to interrupt the se services. Negotiators will bring the specific reasons for disconnecting u tilities to the atten tion of the on-scene commander. Some of the most common reasons include taking away a subject's ability to monitor the incident on television; darkening the environment to provide a tactical advantage for SWAT; and eliminating comforts, such as toilet facilities. Tactical teams also might call for disconnection of plumbing se rvices to deny subjects the ability to neutralize chemical agents, as has occurred in several recent incidents in Seattle. For whatever reason, the denial (or resumption) of utilities provides negotiators with an effective bargaining tool. Different perspectives exist concerning the appropriate time to deny subjects utility services. Some experts believe that utilities should be disconnected before negotiatio ns begin. Others believe negotiators should save such steps for use as bargaining tools later. While this is a m atter of individual agency policy, administrators should ensure that the department adopts well-established polic y guidelines in this pivotal area. Demands and Deadlines It is preferable for field comma nders to resist the tendency to monitor the negotiations process personally. Supervisors who monitor negotia tions or hear demands, deadlines , and death threats related during briefings should not become overly concerned. They should remember that t he negotiating team is trained to deal with such scenarios. When a subject demands \"$1 million,\" the negoti ators actually hear \"a 6-pack of soda.\" Likewise, if the on-scene commander hears a subject say, \"If I don't get the car by 2:00, I'll kill a hostage,\" negotiators actually hear, \"Good, now we are really negotiating.\" Remarkably few hostages have ever been harmed as a result of missed deadlines. Of course, negotiators take deadlines and demands very seriously; however, skilled negotiators generally can work around them and even make them work to law enforcement's advantage. During an incident, a member of the negotiations team keeps the field commander informed of the negotiations. Commanders who find it absolutely necessary to monitor the nego tiations need to inform the negotiations team, which should have the capability to wire a speaker to the comma nd post to enable supervisors to listen to exchanges with the subject. However, field commanders' decisions should be based on the law , departmental policy, and the need for preservation of life and property. They should not make decisions based on exchanges they overhear between subjects and negotiators. The decision-making ability of comman ders who personally monitor the negotiations process may be affected by any nu mber of factors that have litt le actual bearing on the situation. 81 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Psychology Much of the insight into the minds of troubled subjects comes from the specialized psych ological training that crisis negotiators receive. As part of their training, negotiat ors learn a great deal about personality types, personality disorders, and the psychological motivations of hos tage takers, suicidal persons, and subjects who barricade themselves. This training enables negotiators to mani pulate a subject through their understanding of that person's state of mind. Acco rdingly, negotiators rely prim arily on mental rather than physical tactics to resolve conflicts. Checklist Each field commander with the Seattle Police Department carries a pocket-sized checklist of actions that must be performed during a negotiate d crisis. The checklist assists on-scene commanders to accomplish in an orderly fashion the various tasks required during a crisis. Other agenc ies might benefit from a similar checklist.1 During times of extreme pressure, even the most prepared and composed professionals might not always remember to do everything at the right time. A checklist can pr ove invaluable in assisting supervisors to keep tense situations under control. Debriefings Agencies should conduct debriefings after the resolution of any crisis incident. Whenever possible, these debriefings should take place imme diately following an incident , when details are still fr esh in the participants' minds. The debriefing should focus on how the various units handled their roles during the incident. Each component must be represented, and officers should feel free to offer criticism--both positive a nd negative. However, debriefings of this type should not be confused with or conduct ed in place of critical incident stress debriefings. Both serve valuable but distinct purposes. CONCLUSION Despite moves toward proactive policing methodologies, law enfo rcement remains an inherently reactive profession. When violent or troubled subjects create a crisis, they force the police to react to a situation in which the offenders already hold many o f the cards. The press and the public judge the police by how well they respond to such situations. Generally, concerns for hostage a nd officer safety, in addition to the well-being of often mentally disturbed subjects, dictate that the police respond at the lowest force l evel possible. Therefore, on-scene commanders s hould be prepared to supervise a negotiated settlement. The negotiations process can be tedious, complex, and at times, confusing. The b etter field commanders understand the many factors that affect it, the more likely that negotiators will g et the support necessary to resolve critical incidents peacefully. 82 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Critical Incident Stress Reactions What it is, how to recognize it, and what to do about it! What is Critical Incident Stress? Police work can be stressful on a regular basis. While continual stress will take its toll, Critical Incident stress is different in that it directly relates to a dramatic event or events in the life of an officer that results in a number of debilitating symptoms. Definitions of a Critical Incident include: Any situation beyond the realm of a person's usual experience that overwhelms his or her sense of vulnerability and or lack of control over the situation. - Roger Soloman, Ph.D Any Situation faced by emerge ncy service personnel that causes them to experience unusually strong emotional reactions which have the potentia l to interfere with their abil ity to function either at the scene or later. - Jeff Mitchell, Ph.D. A life experience or series of experiences that so seriously up sets the balance of the individual that it creates changes in the person's emotional, cognitive or behavioral func tioning. - Daniel A. Goldfarb, Ph.D. & Gary S. Aumiller, Ph.D. Perhaps the simplest definition of Critical Incident Stress is: A normal reaction to an abnormal event. Critical Incidents: Are sudden and unexpected Disrupt our sense of control Disrupt beliefs, values, and basic assumptions about the world in which we live, the people in it, and the work that we do Involve the perception of a life damaging threat May involve emotional or physical loss The police subculture holds man y myths that can lessen the officer's ability to deal with the situation. \"Real men can handle it!\"; \"If you can't deal, find a new line of work!\"; \"Keep it to yourself,\" Don't be a baby!\" The reality is that police officers, as all human beings, will experience d eep emotional reactions to a critical incident. Attempts to deny this fact often cause officers to suffer in silence, not seek help, and in some instances, truly disrupt their lives and the lives of their families. You have experienced a traumatic event or a critical incident ( any incident that [would cause most individuals] to experience unusually strong emotional reactions which have t he potential to interfere with their ability to function either at the scene or later). Even though the event m ay be over, you may now be experiencing or may experience later, some strong emotional or physical reactions. It is very common, in fact quite normal, for people to experience emotional aftershocks when they have passed through a horrible event. Sometimes the emotional aftershocks (or stress reactions) appea r immediately after the traumatic event. Sometimes they may appear a few hours or a few days later. And, in some cases, weeks or months may pass before the stress reactions appear. The signs and symptoms of a stress reaction may last a few days , a few weeks or a few months and occasionally longer depending on the severity of the traumatic event. With u nderstanding and the support of loved ones the stress reactions usually pass more quickly. Occasionally, the t raumatic event is so painful that professional assistance from a counselor may be necessary. This does not imp ly craziness or weakness. It simply indicates that the particular event was just too powerful for the person to manage by themselves. Police officers and rescue worker s in general, share personality traits that can feed into the stress of a critical incident. Personality factors of Law Enforcement Personnel incl ude: 83 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] A need to be in control Obsessive/perfectionist tendencies Compulsive/traditional values -- wanting things to remain uncha nged High levels of internal motivation Action-oriented High need for stimulation and excitement (easily bored) High need for immediate gratification Tendency to take risks Highly dedicated Invested in the job due to months of training and preparation, view job as life long career Identify strongly with their role as a police officer High need to be needed These personality factors not only make officers do a good job, but also make them more vulnerable to critical incidents. The demands of the j ob, in combination with these pe rsonality factors, are reasons why officers need to be more aware of stress. They also need to be especially awa re of the impact stress has on their everyday functioning. Types of critical incidents include: Line of duty death/injury/shooting. This event highlights the o fficers own mortality. In an instant, an incident shatters the \"myth\" of invulnerability that officers o ften need to function on a day to day basis. Suicide of a Co-worker. ...\"It can happen to anyone...Even me!\" The pressures of the job, a personal life and the toll both can take come i nto focus. Add to this the \"If only's...\" and guilt develops as well. The suicide of a co-worker can turn the officer's world upside down . Death of a child. The innocence represented by children can hav e a profound impact on an officer. The death of a child can push an officer over the edge. It can disr upt the \"natural order of things\". It can make everything the officer sta nds for seem useless. Should the officer have children or worse, children the same age, \"factors of identification\" can add even more str ess. Prolonged failed rescue attempt. This is especially true if the officer has come to know the victim. A great deal of stress is encountered in this situation. The officer is continually focused on the \"absolute necessity to succeed\". The officer's very reason \"for being\" is put on the line: someone needs him/her, their life depends on him/her. He cannot let them down! A deep sense of personnel failure, coupled with the stress of the situation, can trigger deep emotional consequ ences. Mass Casualty Incidents. Multiple victims, mass confusion, shortages of manpower and resources all add to make these situations ove rwhelming! The enormity of the situation can merely override an officer's ability to cope. Safety of the officer is unusually jeopardized. An officer sees the w orst side of life every day. He is constantly exposed to society' s underbelly. It can be difficult to maintain a view that there are any decent people out there. This is somewhat complicated since an officer faces potential danger on a daily basis. However, if an officer finds himself in a situation that focuses him on his vulnerability and lack of control, a critical incident stress reaction can be triggered. Victim is known to responder. Seeing death and tragedy is bad enough. If the officer finds he knows the victim, this can trigger a critical incident stress reaction. H e is unprepared, is close to the victim, and may believe that he/she is some how responsible. \"I should have driven faster, etc...\". Factors affecting magnitude of Response: Not all people exposed to a critical incident experience a stress reaction. In fact it appears to b e consistently divided into th irds such that: 1/3 experience little to no reaction 1/3 experience moderate symptoms 84 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 1/3 experience severe symptoms The symptoms may show up immediately after the incident. This is called an acute reaction. If symptoms are going to appear, this is as good a time for them as any. It is clear what caused the symptoms, support is usually at its highest, and help is often sought. Often future problems are avoided when reacti ons are acute since the symptoms are dealt with promptly. Symptoms may appear up to a few months later. Not all symptoms appear at once. After the onset of the first few (and it varies from person to person what those will be), other symptoms start to pile on. This is called a delayed reaction . It represents difficulty because there is not always a clear association between the event and the subsequent symptoms. As a result, the officer often thinks he/she is going \"crazy\" for no reason. They do not seek out support from family and friends. Often they will try t o deny they are having symptoms to others, even to themselves. They do not seek professional help. The result m ay be that symptoms needlessly worsen until the officer's life has become over-c omplicated and outside pressure is applied to seek some form of treatment. Even at this juncture, if the symptoms are not related to the event, treatment may be ineffective. As a peer team member, you can be helpful to individuals with delayed reaction s by pointing out to them that you see them having problems and that these problems may be connected to an incident that they went through. Symptoms of stress may also appear in officers who have had rep eated exposure to critical situations (i.e. emergency services). Years may elapse. Hundreds of incidents ma y have occurred. The officer may consider him/herself immune to stress problems. Then it hits: \"a cumulative stress reaction.\" This may be the most difficult person to help. There is almost no association betwee n these symptoms and the critical incidents the officer has faced. The symptoms appear to have come from \"out o f the blue\". The officer may fear he/she has suddenly become weak or \"lost it.\" They question their ability to go on with the job; a job which they may love. Often seeking help does not even cross their mind. Since there is no clear single incident, friends or peer team members may not realize that the stress symptoms shown are the result of the toll taken by experiencing just too many stressful calls. As a friend or peer, you can serve a crucial function in helpin g these officers. If you see symptoms appearing, and you are aware of their work history, you are in a unique po sition to help them put the puzzle of their symptoms together. You can help them understand that they are not \"crazy\" or \"weak.\" They just need to get on the right track as any human exposed repeatedly to high levels of stress will eventually show symptoms. As noted, not all people exposed to a critical incident will ex perience symptoms. This does not mean that some people are immune from the pressures of police work. In fact, a person who has been through a number of critical incidents without effect may find themselves terribly shaken by a particular call. The reverse is true. A person who took some time to recover from an incident may find that they have few symptoms after a particularly harrowing call. In fact, the effect of any call on an officer can be a complic ated mixture of his/her personality, combined with specific characteristics of the call itself. Some factors that may affect an officer's response include: The nature of the Event - How involved was the officer? How much control of the situat ion did he/she have? The less control -- the more traumatic the experience. What was the degree of threat or loss? How grotesque was the call? Remember, what a person considers grote sque will vary from person to person. How much did the call disrupt his/her expectations of the job/t he world/people in general? Degree of warning - The less warning often the more severe the response. Warning provides an officer with time to develop some coping strategies. Ego Strength/Coping Style - Ever yone com e s to a situation with a different character and personality. The individual's personality is molded through their genetics a nd past experiences. Some people have stronger coping mechanisms and higher degrees of awareness in t heir philosophical and spiritual life. All these characteristics will alte r the effects of a critical incident. Prior mastery of the experience - Practice makes better! Goi ng through a hairy call successfully may make it easier to go through the experience again. The past experience helps the officer think more 85 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] clearly and more positively in a similar situation. This can he lp not only with one's physical survival, but with the emotional survival once the call has ended. Proximity - The closer an officer is physically to the scene the greater the impact. Proximity is also created by psychological closeness. Seeing a dead three year ol d girl may have more of an impact on the officer with a three year old at home. Often there may be emoti onal links between the scene and the officer's life for which he/she is unaware. The officer may the n experience the stress symptoms, may even be able to relate it to the incident he/she just lived through, but may feel like some piece of the puzzle is missing, because they can 't make the connection to th eir own life. Many times these links need to be discovered in order for t he stress level to subside. This is an area where a professional may prove to be very helpful. The amount of stress in one's life -- It is better not to be going through a bitter divorce when one is responding to a particularly stressful call! The amount of stre ss in a person's life and how it is being handled can have a tremendous impact on the effects of added st ress. Nature and degree of social suppo rt available to an officer aft er a critical incident -- The officer's willingness to accept support is also important. If the officer pushes people away with the idea that he/she \"can handle it\", then they place themselves at greater r isk. This support includes all of the significant people in an officer's life: peers, supervisors, professionals, and family. The family especially plays a crucial role. Their degree of support, willingness to listen, and the officer's ability to open up and talk, all factor into the degree of response to a c ritical incident. So from the above, it can be seen that the likelihood and sever ity of an emotional response resulting from a critical incident is a combinati on of factors. These include bo th personality factors within the officer, as well as factors about the call itself, and even factors revolving aroun d the officers current life situation. 86 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 39 \"Real men can handle it.\" \"If you can't deal, find a new line of work.\" \"Keep it to yourself.\" \"If you don't cope, you can lose your job, or worse, no one will want to work with you.\" CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS REACTION SYMPTOMS The acute signals of distress exhibited by people after a criti cal incident can be observed in four spheres: Physical - Cognitive - Emotional - Behavioral Physical Signs Tension, aches, pains; trembling, poor coordination, chest pain s, dizziness, weakness, chills, thirst, fainting, twitches, elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate, shock symptoms Jumpiness: startle at sudden soun ds or movement; grinding of te eth Cold sweat; dry mouth; pale skin; eyes hard to focus; profuse sweating Feeling out of breath; hyperventilating until fingers and toes go numb or cramp Upset stomach; vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, frequent urina tion Fatigue: feel tired, drained; takes effort to move Distant, haunted, \"1000\" mile stare Cognitive Signs Difficulty making decisions; uncertainty; poor decision making Confusion; suspiciousness; Disorientation of time, place or person; increased or decreased awareness Poor concentration; heightened or lowered alertness, lack of at tention Memory loss, especially for recent events; difficulty identifyi ng objects or people Unable to perform multiple tasks Flashbacks (either visual or auditory) Nightmares; hyper vigilance; blaming someone; Poor problem Depression Anger Resentment Anxiety; Fear Feelings of numbness Feelings of being overwhelmed; Emotional outbursts; Loss of emo tional control; Constant second guessing/self-doubting Feeling detached from reality 87 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Behavioral Signs Decreased job performance Withdrawn from friend/colleagues/family Outbursts (either crying or laughing) Changes in normal humor patterns Excessive talkativeness or silence Hyperactive behavior Antisocial acts Inability to rest Intensified pacing; Erratic movements Change in social activity Loss or increase of appetite Increased consumption of alcohol and/or drugs Peer actions o Remove officer from scene as soon as possible. o Help him/her notify his/her family that he/she is safe. o Reassure officer that his/her symptoms are normal. o Allow and encourage officer to talk. It is important to let him/her tell and retell story, over and over. o Reassure officer that you and his friends will support him. o Encourage friends to contact officer and listen to him. o Encourage family to listen to officer. o Officer should be given plenty of fluids (no alcohol/coffee). o Officer should eat a healthy meal when able -- avoiding junk fo ods. o Officer should do physical exercise as soon as able. o Keep officer informed about on-go ing investigation and case fac ts. o Encourage officer to attend a Critical Incident Stress Debriefing with a qualified police mental health professional within 72 hours of the incident. NOTE: chest pain, hyperventilation, rapid heartbeat, shock, and heart arrhythmia's all indicate need for medical evaluation as soon as possible. 88 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Physical* Cognitive Emotional Behavioral chills confusion fear withdrawal thirst nightmares guilt antisocial acts fatigue uncertainty grief inability to rest nausea hyper vigilance panic intensified pacing fainting suspiciousness denial erratic movements twitches intrusive images anxiet y change in social activity vomiting blaming someone agitation change in speech patterns dizziness poor problem solving irritability loss or increase of appetite weakness poor abstract thinking depression hyper alert to envir onment chest pain poor attention/ decisi ons intense anger increased alcohol consumption headaches poor concentration/ memory apprehension change in usu al communications elevated BP disorientation of time, place or person emotional shock etc... rapid heart rate difficulty identifying objects or people emotional outbursts muscle tremors heightened or lowered alertness feeling overwhelmed shock symptoms increased or decreased awareness of surroundings loss of emotional control grinding of teeth etc... inappropriate emotional response visual difficulties etc... profuse sweating difficulty breathing * Any of these symptoms may indicate the need for medical evaluation. When in doubt, contact a physician. 89 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Things to Try WITHIN THE FIRST 24 - 48 HOURS periods of appropriate physical exercise, alternated with relaxation will alleviate some of the physical reactions. Structure your time - keep busy. You're normal and having normal reactions - don't label yoursel f crazy. Talk to people - talk is the most healing medicine. Be aware of numbing the pain with overuse of drugs or alcohol, you don't need to complicate this with a substance abuse problem. Reach out - people do care. Maintain as normal a schedule as possible. Spend time with others. Help your co-workers as much as possible by sharing feelings and checking out how they are doing. Give yourself permission to feel rotten and share your feelings with others. Keep a journal; write your way through those sleepless hours. Realize those around you are under stress. Don't make any big life changes. Do make as many daily decisions as possible which will give you a feeling of control over your life, i.e., if someone asks you what you want to eat - answer them even if yo u're not sure. Get plenty of rest. Reoccurring thoughts, dreams or flashbacks are normal - don't t ry to fight them - they'll decrease over time and become less painful. Eat well-balanced and regular meals (even if you don't feel lik e it). FOR FAMILY MEMBERS & FRIENDS Listen carefully. Spend time with the traumatized person. Offer your assistance and a listening ear if they have not aske d for help. Reassure them that they are safe. Help them with everyday tasks like cleaning, cooking, caring fo r the family, minding children. Give them some private time. Do not take their anger or other feelings personally. Do not tell them that they are \"lucky it wasn't worse\" - trauma tized people are not consoled by those statements. Instead, tell them t hat you are sorry such an event has occurred and you want to understand and assist them. DO NOT Second guess officer. Say \"Ever y thing will be fine\". Try to protect him/her by withholding information (do use judgm ent). Give too much advice. Make promises and not follow up. 90 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Critical Incident Stress Management - Written by Stephenie Slahor Whether it is an officer-involved shooting, a terrorist inciden t, an accident scene, a wide-scale disaster, or any of the other events that involve la w enforcement personnel as firs t responders, there will be stress associated with the event. That stress will be felt not only by the first respo nders, but also by those directly, or even indirectly, affected by the event. Strategic intervention planning is a nec essary component of responding to such stress- producing events. Offering help on group crisis intervention is Dr. Michael MacIntosh, chaplain with the San Diego, Calif., Police Department and Newport Beach, Ca lif., Police Department. He is a certified instructor in crisis intervention and has served as a reserve police officer. He is the author of \"Wh en Your World Falls Apart,\" which describes his experiences as one of the chapla ins on the scene of the terrori st attack against the Twin Towers in New York. He also served as a chaplain at the Oklahoma City Federal Build ing bombing site. MacIntosh held a two-day critical incident stress management tr aining seminar at the Palm Springs, Calif., Police Department Training Cent er. The seminar was one of the e vents of the \"Festival of Life\" that took place in the Coachella Valley of Calif ornia (in which Palm Springs is located) in alliance with Lighthouses of the Valley, a cross-denominational gr oup of Christian pastors, chur ches, para-church groups and community leaders. MacIntosh said that police depart ments need to form critical in cident stress management (CISM) teams composed of trained personnel who can guide individuals, small groups or large groups through recovery from a stress-provoking event. In a critical incident, those affected react in many different ways, but their tension and stress levels will be \"unbelievable,\" MacIntosh said. In a stress-provoking incident, \"The thoughts you're having are normal thoughts that any normal person would have in an abnormal situation,\" he said. It is the nature of the work of police personnel, fire fighters and emergency medical responders to face such abnormal situations almost daily. \"It's the situation that's nu ts,\" he said. \"You're OK. \" He added, \"It's only because of the work you're doing. It's not the end of the world at all.\" He pointed out that when first responders are asked why they ch ose their job, their answers are usually, \"I want to help people,\" and \"I want to make a difference.\" Those senti ments are key to being a first responder, and they result in what MacIntosh termed \"a love in the culture\" among t hose who do first responder work. First responders regard one another as brothers and sisters, and that camaraderie extends to their support workers as dispatchers and staff, too. The critical incidents that are a part of the work of first responders have the potential to create significant distress, so much so that a per son's normal coping mechanisms c annot handle the distress without help. CISM can help first responders through some of the rough spots, but CISM is not a clinical prescription or a substitute for further help or therapy. 91 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] \"It's not the cure-all,\" said MacIntosh, but a psychological cr isis faced by first responders can be lessened or assuaged if intervention is provi ded in a timely manner to give active, short-term, supportive help that can mitigate the significant distress, impairment or dysfunction that first responders experience after a critical incident. The goals of CISM are to stabili ze those affected, reduce their symptoms of impairment or dysfunction, help them return to adaptations that will assist them in functioning normally again, and facilitate access to further care, if needed. The help given by CISM should be as immediate as possible, because that immediacy can reduce impairment. CISM is much akin to first aid for a physical injury\u2014that tempo rary, immediate care during which there is assessment of need, immediate treatment, reduction of further i njury, and quicker recovery, said MacIntosh. In a way, crisis intervention is a kind of psychological or emotional first aid, he said. \"CISM is designed to keep you in the race,\" he stated. As positive as all this sounds, the re may be resistance to form ing CISM teams, he said. Such things as administrative misunderstanding o f CISM, turf wars, multi-agenc y conflicts, politics, untrained \"helpers\" or limited follow-up all need to be considered and rectified befor e a CISM team can be effective in its work. \"Each one of us is completely different,\" MacIntosh said, but p sychological distress will take a toll if a person's usual coping or defense mechanis ms are overwhelmed. A psycholog ical crisis will disrupt a person's natural, homeostatic balance between thinking and emotions. The crisis c an provoke stress that causes failure of the coping mechanisms. Crisis interv ention targets these changes an d responses, not the event, he emphasized. The intervention assesses the need in light of what is occurrin g. \"When you intervene quickly, you're saving someone\" from more sev ere mental damage that can occur hours, d ays, weeks or even months later, MacIntosh said. A variety of interventions can be used, but they must mat ch what is needed in the situation and among the people affected by the event. MacIntosh noted that police personnel are usually \"the most flexible people,\" adept at multitasking and coping. But even the most flexible may n eed help, and not just the peop le who have been especially close to the incident as it occurred or who were caught in its immediate aftermath. Right after the event is the best time to begin the process of intervention, MacIntosh recommended. \"Intervention reduces the stress levels, helps you get back to the job, and helps others get back to doing the job,\" he said, though adding, \"It is not reasonable to think that any one thing can help.\" There will likely be many processes and many people involved in the course of interventio n. Assessment, intervention and evaluation will occur all along the steps of the process of care, to lead to the resilience and recovery needed. MacIntosh pointed out that someti mes it is possible to create a \"resistance\" to distress through pre-incident training and preparation that t eaches people how to build their immunity to the manifestations of distress, dysfunction and impairment. Practices, drills and mock scenario s may be beneficial. Or maybe not! The event may be o f such magnitude that pre-incident training is not enough, or the personnel may be so close to the event tha t coping mechanisms cannot work effectively. Family of such personnel will also need assistance and interven tion for their safety, securit y, reactions, and spiritual and emotional care. In such cases, the intervention will focus on building resilience and helping toward recovery. Resilience means rebounding in an effective and quick manner from the psychologi cal effects of an incident. Recovery is the ability of someone to function adaptively, despite the incident . Both resilience and recovery can apply to individuals, small groups, large groups or entire populations. The intervention is only one part, MacIntosh reminded. There mu st be access to appropriate levels of care, as needed, and CISM teams must facilitat e that access. There must also be consideration of the various people 92 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] served: individuals, small groups , large groups, communities, neighborhoods, diverse populations, special populations, and so on. MacIntosh noted that most peopl e can cope with some stress if t hey have general well-being in their physical body and in their psychological, social, emotional and spiritua l domains. Most people are effective problem- solvers and make responsible lifestyle choices. Those factors a lso help them cope with stressful situations. A healthy sense of home and family, honor, strong social support, and faith also help. MacIntosh paraphrased Romans 13:1-6 saying that police officers , as part of the rulers of the people, are as ordained ministers of God, to strike fear in the wicked and bri ng hope to the good. While CISM usually means \"critical incident stress management,\" it also stands for a \"co mprehensive, integrated, systematic, multi- component\" approach to stressful situations, he said. Inner pea ce and character and pre-incident training will help, but when further intervention is needed, it must be given so that people can rebound and have \"the ability to get back into service,\" MacIntosh said. There are six core skills for teams in crisis intervention: ass essment (similar to triage), strategic planning, one- to-one crisis intervention, sma ll group intervention, large gro up intervention, and follow-up/referral to further help. The task for CISM teams is to learn the methods and tactical s kills to be used in CISM, and also to know strategically when and where to employ the most appropriat e intervention methods and skills for the people to be served, he said. CIS M is not psychotherapy, he rem inded, but only a part of a continuum of care needed after a critical incident. CISM mitigates the impact of the event and lowers the tension being felt, facilitates recovery in normal people who are experiencing an abnormal event, and restores those peop le to adaptive functioning. It is a focused form of crisis intervention to manage the traumatic stress of the cr itical incident. MacIntosh noted that not only does CISM apply intervention skills to a situation, but it also considers how and where that intervention takes pl ace. Immediacy is important, be cause rapid intervention is just like rapid first aid for a physical injury. Contact should be made quickly and in a place where there is a sense of safety, privacy and relaxation. He termed it a \"respite center\" and said pre-planning by the CI SM team should include decisions about where such a center can be quickly arra nged. Proximity to the site of the incident may be a factor, or the respite center can be at the station. But he said it should be \"your place whe re you're out of the limelight.\" MacIntosh said stress is created as a response to a physical, c ognitive, emotional, psychological and/or spiritual arousal. Stress is a normal reaction of the body, but the cumul ative effects of it can be damaging, eroding health and performance, and even causing disease. The \"fight, flight, freeze\" reaction to sudden stress, and the accompanying adrenaline rush it causes, can be debilitating. CI SM team members must learn what symptoms people might exhibit after a critical incident and the stress i t has caused. MacIntosh reminded that CISM assistance might need to be offere d not only to those directly impacted by an incident, but to support staff, dispatchers, family of those involved, the bereaved, people with pre-existing psychiatric problems, or those who ask for such help. While som e of the intervention will come almost immediately after the event, intervention may also be needed much later, for example, when a court trial stemming from the incident begins or is in progress. 93 of 74494 of 744Critical Incident Protocol \u2014A Public and Private Par tnership \u00a92000 Radford W.

Important elements include planning, mitigation, businessrecovery, lessons learned, best practices, and plan exercising. Whether it is a minor incident or a major terrorist activity involving weapons of mass destruction, the community's collective resources must unite and work to understand the processesnecessar y to resolve the matter. Surveys conducted on emergency planning and recovery reveal how important proper planning can be: Most businesses do not have an emergency or recovery plan even though they know it is impor tant. 47% of businesses that experience a fire or major theft go out of business within two years. 44% of companies that lose r ecords in a disaster never r esume business. 93% of companies that experience a significant data loss are out of business within five years. The majority of businesses spend less then 3% of their total budget on business recovery planning. Communities and businesses participating for the first time in a public/private critical incident partnership will become aware of the value of a joint planning process and those already engaged in public/private partnerships can gain new ideas andreinforce current practices. The Pr otocol will outline lessons lear ned in: Establishing partnerships in advance so the event can be managed and resolved with minimum loss to the community . Conducting individual and joint public/private evaluations of risk factors and understanding what business functions are critical to individual businesses and the community . Developing joint public/private sector emergency plans and how community resources can be identified and shared to respond to disasters. Facilitating business resumption and recovery. Developing training exercises and understanding the value of exercising the joint plan. Incorporating mitigation throughout the entire process and recognizing its significance in preventing a disaster and r educing its potential impact. The Protocol is not intended as a checklist since detailed planning lists and documents can be obtained from a number of resources, some of which are listed inthe Protocol Reference Section. A Glossary of terms is included to enhance mutual understanding of common ter minology between the public and private sectors.As one Fortune 100 Security Director stated, \"It is not if, but when.\" 3 98 of 744As one police chief said, \"We have to handle the small incidents prior to managing the major ones.\" A security director indicated that if the joint planning process has occurred, we can respond to a weapon of mass destr uction event as well as we do to other events. Joint planning will be for the good of the community. 4The Critical Incident Protocol was developed under a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office for State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support, Office of Justice Programs. The Protocol development process was facilitated by and this Protocol was written by the School of Criminal Justice, Michigan State University . Over 100 persons from the public and private sector participated in five regional meetings held throughout the state of Michigan and their collective expertise and per-sonal experience created the substance of the Protocol. A Focus Group comprised offire, police, emergency managers, and private security executives guided the Protocol development process. In 1998 the City of Sterling Heights Municipal Security Task Force, with represen- tatives from the public and private sectors, was formed to develop joint plans to reactto the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). They reviewed the Protocol and provided additional comments. The City of Sterling Heights and General Dynamics LandSystems participated in a tabletop exercise conducted by long distance interactive video conferencing to evaluate the use of that technology in conducting such exercises. Members of the Private Sector Liaison Committee, International Association of Chiefsof Police, wer e also involved in the review pr ocess. The participants stressed one over-riding principle: \"Denial of the potential for a critical incident must be eliminated, for it is not if but when disaster will strike.\" Critical Incident Defined A critical incident is any event or situation that threatens people and/or their homes, businesses, or community. While we often think of floods, tornadoes, hurri- canes, or armed assailants as posing critical incidents, the true definition of a critical incident includes any situation requiring swift, decisive action involving multiple components in response to and occurring outside of the normal course of routine busi-ness activities. For example, a company may experience loss of production due to mechanical breakdown or a retail merchant may encounter product spoilage but these are normaldisruptions within their business processes. But if these businesses are faced with workplace violence or a terrorist incident, a number of outside resources will be needed. The public sector (police or fire) routinely respond to emergency situations, but work-place violence, a terrorist act, or a community disaster will place abnormal strain on their resources and exper tise. The scope of many critical incidents such as natural disasters, workplace violence, or domestic terrorism, requires the cooperative efforts of business and public sectorplanners and responders. Protocol Objectives Create public and private sector understanding of their common goal to protect lives and pr operty while sustaining continuity of community life. Encourage the public and private sector entities that may have engaged in the assessment and planning process in isolation to form cooperativepartnerships. Assist those businesses and communities lacking emergency planning experience in the development of a joint emer gency planning process. Develop an understanding of mutual or respective goals and understand how public and private resources can complement and suppor t each other. Serve as a resource for those engaged in the joint planning pr ocess. 99 of 744It doesn't happen overnight but we can learn from our joint successes and failures. A fire chief said that a major industry in his community was talking about leaving town and as a result he had been informed by his city manager that the fir e truck the department was planning to buy was no longer budgeted. The same circumstances could occur in a community if a business was hit with a disaster. A police chief indicated that with today's extensive media coverage during a hostage situation, shooting, or other disaster, our citizens have become \"experts\" on the way these events should be handled and resolved. This yar dstick judges us and our communities. A number of police and fire chiefs stated they are still called to assist private businesses in searching for bombs. This shows a lack of knowledge of the role and capabilities of local responders. 5Overcoming Roadblocks Many obstacles such as denial, apathy, lack of trust, and misinformation may hinder cooperative public/private sector critical incident planning and response. We can overcome these obstacles if we acknowledge that communities are diverse and entities often per ceive themselves as having dif ferent needs and concer ns. First, initiate dialogue and develop a joint planning process road map that over- come lack of trust and create the understand that relationships don't just happen but take continuous communication and understanding. Next, increase the public sector's understanding of how the \"bottom line\" motivates the private sector and increase the private sector's understanding of the public sector's operating procedures, legal obligations, and political con- siderations. Foster the understanding that public/private sectors' motivations are not different, but actually are quite similar. It's a good idea to take advan- tage of joint preparedness opportunities when the economy is good or immediately following a disaster. There also is a need to obtain business and community leaders' commitment in the joint critical incident planning and re- sponse process. Disaster recovery planning must begin before tragedy strikes, not after a disaster is experienced. Often, this too late. Mutual Benefits of Joint Planning The public and private sectors can develop greater understanding of the value of joint emergency planning, and that can lead to other community partnerships. Joint planning provides community leaders with an understanding of the process and possible repercussions if cooperative planning does not occur. It can illuminate the potentialfinancial impact and liability resulting from the failure to adequately plan for a critical incident. The loss of a business can have dramatic real-life impact on the community. The planning process can identify how businesses contribute to the community and develop an understanding of community priorities in time of a disaster. Adequateplanning develops the understanding that risk assessment, emergency planning, response, and r ecovery are similar processes within the public and private sectors. Companies want to be involved and be viewed as good community citizens, and communities want to be held in esteem. Joint comprehensive emergency planning willimprove quality of life and attract business growth by making the community a saferplace to do business. Sample of a Community Br ochure Muskegon County, Michigan utilizes the Risk Management Planning process of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to create \"A Safer Community through a Joint Effort between Government and Industry.\" Muskegon County's purpose is: Go beyond required regulation and take a proactive safety appr oach. Inform residents of the risks and the way they are managed on a daily basis. Create a well-trained and infor med workforce to prevent incidents. Develop joint public and private sector planning and training programs. Respond quickly and know the personnel we will be working with. 100 of 744One private business manager said that the only time he sees someone from the public sector is when they want a donation or a sponsorship. \"I wish they would ask how they could help me at other times.\" A security manager indicated that with on-time delivery of parts or goods, a loss in one community has an immediate impact in other communities. We no longer maintain large storage areas. We no longer operate in isolation and must rely on that steady str eam of product to keep us going. A security manager r elated that he had an initial concern in divulging some of the products and chemicals his business used to public officials. However, once the joint partnership was in place, this became less of a concern. The community expressed approval and support for partnerships to protect them. In fact, many of the workers lived in the community. 6Why is joint planning impor tant to the public sector? Recognizes that media exposure of critical incidents has developed high public expectations on how emergency response efforts should be handled. Assists in understanding private sector r equirements and resources. Helps obtain the commitment of the private sector to become a part of the overall community emergency response planning process. Enhances communication with the private sector prior to an incident inform- ing them of available community r esources. Heightens awareness that the private sector may not be able to control everything inside the fence line and may need to involve others outside the fence line during recovery. Reduces liability and insurance costs through joint planning with the private sector. Why is joint planning impor tant to the private sector? Provides the private sector with community contacts and develops an understanding of the suppor t available from the public sector . Educates the public sector on why the bottom line is important to the private entity and how it af fects the community. Creates an understanding of why rapid business resumption is important and what basic community infrastructure may be needed to support business resumption following a disaster. Develops an accurate understanding of public sector resources and private sector responsibilities until public suppor t is available. Develops recognition of how the loss of one business may affect and impact other businesses in the community . Promotes involvement in the public sector' s establishment of priorities. Develops understanding that during a critical incident, no company is an island unto itself. Total cooperative efforts are needed and there can be no secrets. 101 of 744One fire marshall said that his main concern was to assist businesses in assessing their risk and developing emergency plans. V iolations, unless they were flagrant, were not his main concern. What he didn' t like was the arrogance displayed by some companies who didn't believe that the regulations applied to them. \"What we had to do is build tr ust, a relationship, an understanding of our respective objectives that, when you look closely at them, ar e not really that different. We both want to protect property and save lives.\" Both the public and private sectors commented that support for the partnership process must star t from the top. Too many top managers and community administrators are still in a state of denial or hoping disasters won't happen on their watch. In 1998 the City of Sterling Heights Office of Emergency Management initiated a forum of public and private sector partners to mitigate, respond to, and r ecover from major property damages and mass casualties that may impact the community. The Sterling Heights Municipal Security Task Force plans and trains to handle weapons of mass destruction and other major incidents in partnership. The gr oup meets monthly and has support of city and corporate management. 7Leadership Begins at the T op Commitment in both the public and private sectors must be driven from the top down through the entire organization. If this is not the case, there will be no real commitment. Trust must be developed in the beginning and if top management develops trust across sectors, it will trickle down to lower-level employees. Ultimately,trust must be developed thr ough all levels of the public and private sector . After obtaining top level support, the process must involve the people who will respond and manage the critical incident. The public sector must realize that fines andmandated regulations may inhibit open communication and they must eliminate fear of regulatory enforcement action during the joint planning process. Consider the possibility of a period of \"amnesty\" where a proactive, rather than a regulatoryapproach, could be used. The private sector must be concerned with liability resulting from a failure to plan. Public sector officials should assist in presenting the value of critical incident planningto top private sector management. Community leaders and private sector managers should make a financial commitment to plan correctly and openly and a community task force may be formed to address issues. In many cases, major industries or businessesmay lead the change pr ocess. 102 of 7448 103 of 744As a fire chief stated, \"Remember, if they don't invite you in, knock on the door.\" 9The Preparedness Process The ultimate goal of joint planning should be the establishment of an Integrated Emergency Management System (IEMS). Developing the concept of an IEMS requires community units to cooperate to reduce the consequences of natural, technological, and man-made disasters. Response is the central focus during a disaster, but anintegrated approach to planning will initiate mitigation activities to prevent or reduce the degree of risk, and to develop preparedness activities to increase response and recovery capabilities. The process of joint planning and r esponse encompasses a number of steps and various terms may be used interchangeably by the public or private sectors. Conse-quently, part of the planning process must include developing standard ter minology. Standard Terminology Hazard Mitigation: Activities to eliminate hazards and lessen their impact if an incident occurs. Response: Reaction to and managing the incident until it is r esolved. Recovery or Business Resumption : Processes focused on repair of damages, return to normal activities, and recover y of losses. Preparedness: Actions and initiatives developed prior to an incident and including the following phases of critical incident management: Risk Assessment - (both self assessment and joint assessment) Response Planning Training Exercising Planners should build on work done by successful businesses and look at those with good plans, but must not take for granted that large companies or communitieshave all the answers. 104 of 74410Risk Assessment Each public/private sector component must be involved in assessing possible events\u2014man-made or natural\u2014that may strike their operations, and they must calcu- late the potential impacts. This self-assessment of actual and potential events and related impacts will lay the foundation for the emergency response plan. When individual and community assessments are combined, a determination can be madeabout the adequacy of community resour ces to handle most community disasters. All potential thr eats and hazards must be identified. For example: Natural - Tornadoes, floods, winter storms, earthquakes, and power outages. Man made - Terrorist attack, workplace violence, explosion, bombing, and accidents. Businesses often focus on immediate, ongoing activities and not on the perils impacting long-term economic survival. They must appreciate a critical incident's potential impact on the profit margin and understand what a risk assessment and planning process can do to reduce or prevent such losses. Small businesses are the most vulnerable to economic r uin as a result of a critical incident. It may be necessar y to educate those responsible for the assessment process as they may lack the appropriate knowledge and skills to develop risk assessments. Thepublic sector or another private entity may be able to lend their expertise in theassessment process. This is not an overnight process and leadership and support may be obtained from those companies with good plans in place. The process can begin with small steps or pieces of the plan and planners should not get bogged down in theoverall process. Self Risk Assessment Use a building block pr ocess. Start with a piece of the plan. First, look at broadest categories of risk. Go from a generalized risk assessment to specific risks. Next, list previous incidents and/or potential threats or events. Begin with the obvious and work towar d the less likely . Then, determine what is vital for continued business operations and what might cause significant business inter ruptions. Plans must first be completed by individual private sector entities, as they know their own risks. Each business function or component within the entity must conductindividual risk assessments. The component must evaluate all the processes performedby the business unit and identify those critical areas or activities that are required for positive outcomes. Determine any function or process that, if interrupted, could result in significant loss of revenue, customers, or business operation. When combined, theseindividual assessments comprise the risk assessment for the entir e business. All operations performed by a particular unit or component must be listed, prioritized, and identified as to their importance to continued business operations. Forexample, operations can be classified as Critical, Essential, or Non-essential. 105 of 744Risk Assessment Matrix Business ABC Co.

The par tnership process can develop for ms specific to your own community situation.One community that had a ver y strong public/private par tnership in place received an excellent r eturn from their request for a risk sur vey. Fortunately, the value of the r eturns has not yet been put to a test. 11 Critical - Those operations a business cannot do without or a function that is vital to the operation and/or may pose a life safety risk. For each critical business activity, mitigation strategies should be implemented and a recovery process developed. Essential - Not critical, difficult to operate without, but the organization could function for a period of time. Non-essential - Disruption would merely be an inconvenience. Once critical business functions have been identified, they can be prioritized as to maximum allowable recovery or down time. This will help to determine the order of recovery, required recovery time, and necessary support services. Following is a suggested time frame, but each business must determine its own operational require- ments. Immediate - 0 to 24 hours. (May require immediate alternate or \"hot\" site) Delayed - 24 hours to 7 days. (Prearranged site that would be needed for a short period) Deferred - Beyond 7 days. (No immediate need for an of fsite location) Business functions can then be categorized as to their vulnerability to each potential threat or hazard: Highly Vulnerable - Those business functions that have a great risk of experiencing a threat or hazard. Vulnerable - May experience a thr eat or hazard. Not Vulnerable - Threat or hazard not likely to occur Shown below is an example of a Risk Assessment Matrix* 106 of 744One community said that they requested that each business conduct a self-assessment of their risk. They r eceived a very low return rate. Then, a downtown business fir e occurred and fire resources had problems resolving the incident. Another survey was requested and they received an 85% r eturn rate.

Also, plans must be put in place to assure business recovery while considering the maximum allowable recovery time. Cost-effective mitigation and planning approaches must be developedto obtain the support and financial commitment of top management. Without this commitment, the pr ocess will not move for ward. Some communities may prefer a numeric value for measuring risk. This would include assigning a numeric value for criticality and vulnerability or frequency of threat.This aids in overlooking something that rarely happens but, if it does, the impact would be devastating. Risk could be viewed on a 10-point scale (1-10 for low to high). Thehigher number would indicate priority for planning. 107 of 744One community building department was willing to work with private business to protect the proprietary aspects of their building plans from general public scrutiny. This minimized private sector fears that their future plans might become known to competitors. One community said they initially had concerns about their citizens learning what risks wer e out there. As they conducted joint assessments and planning, they soon learned that the community appreciated the interest in joint planning for disasters. Further, they realized that most people in the community were employed by those same industries that they were worried about. A community said their ability to prepare and respond to emergencies is a factor in the community's quality of life and attractiveness to new business. 13Joint Risk Assessment (Among public/private par tners) Joint risk assessment must follow individual self-assessments and involve more than police and fire operations. Joint public and private assessments will lead to community assessments and then plan development where all the potential events and available resources are considered. Lack of resources or knowledge may cause smallbusinesses to struggle with the process or lead to a lack of commitment. If they don't understand the process or potential business impact, they may not realize the value of partnering with the public sector . Factors to Consider Creating a level of cooperation between the public/private sectors is the proper starting place, although it still may be necessar y to mandate the process or it will notbe completed within an acceptable time frame. It is essential to develop an understand- ing of available public and private sector resources and of the expertise to respond to the identified risks. Partners must work together to ensure protection of proprietary information that may be exposed during the joint assessment process. For example the private sectormay have concerns that building plans may reveal future product or research trends thatthey would not want known to competitors. Another important task is to determine how identified risks can be corrected and potential liability reduced. It is necessary to ensure that personal safety issues areseparated and evaluated differently from property risks. Communication and joint understanding are very important and will result in the use of common terms and similar \"jargon.\" Partnerships can assist in eliminating incorrect assumptions of what otherscan do or how they may r espond. Multi-tenant facilities possess unique and different challenges and the landlord or overall facility manager must demonstrate leadership. A designated person must beresponsible for the assessment and planning process. Tenants should be part of plan development so their input and unique concerns are considered. Their \"buy-in\" is important. Public sector units may have to prioritize where they believe the greatest risk lies to the entire community so they know where to focus their resources for the greatest impact on community safety and well being. High priority items to consider when under taking joint risk assessments: Hold public and private sector meetings to discuss risks and identify the availability of community resources and assist in developing communityresponse plans. These meetings will outline risks, compare similarities and differences, and identify available community resour ces. Understand what the public and private sector can handle, start to prioritize risk, and determine deficiencies that must be acknowledged. Keep in mindthat during any disaster the day to day emergencies still occur and will tax community resources. Consider worst case scenarios and acknowledge that current government resources could be severely stressed in a widespread disaster. Don't beafraid of public perceptions. By working together, community fear can bereduced through joint planning and communication. Remember that many community leaders are also leaders in the private sector, and that only by working together can the potential cost of adisaster be r ecognized by the community . Learn how other entities are completing the assessment process. Lessons learned are invaluable and should be shared. 108 of 744Working Toward a Community Plan Private Sector Private/Public Sector Entire Community Company A Individual Self Assessment Joint Assessments Company B Individual Self Assessment Joint Assessments COMMUNITY PLAN Company C Individual Self Assessment Joint Assessments A corporate security director said that a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as mandated by EPA regulations, might be a good forum to critique actual event responses and to shar e lessons. These groups are found, typically, at the county level and can be a valuable resource. A police chief commented that when he hears of something that happened in another community, he contacts that police chief and learns all he can about the event and how it was handled. \"I use the network of professional association contacts and those I have met through the years. That is one of my r eal values to the community.\" A city fire official said their community hazardous materials response plans included suppor t personnel from a local chemical manufacturer. When company personnel were required to respond on a global basis and were not available to the city , the company offered to train and equip local responders. The city was able to respond with their personnel. This r epresents a continuous blend of public and private resources to respond to an assessed community risk. 14Critical Incident Planning Emergency planning is decision making prior to an actual crisis or disaster including the consideration of resources required to manage and resolve the event. The plan must also include the necessar y steps during and after the crisis is resolved (recovery). Successful joint risk assessments will help develop joint emergency plans. A clear understanding of community risks, manmade or natural, and the accessible resourcesand expertise will provide the community with options to manage critical incidents. However, it should be realized that all possible events are not foreseeable. The important part of joint emergency planning will be understanding how availableresources may respond together to any event. Joint planning is a learning process about perceptions of each other. Plans must NOT be developed in isolation. Joint meetings should occur early on so parties canagree up front on ground rules and confidentiality issues. The public and private sector plans must dovetail for maximum benefit. Begin to Develop the Plan If a plan doesn' t exist, cr eate one. If a plan does exist, r eview it (should be done annually anyway). Agree on common terminology, identify acronyms, and discard confusing jargon. Keep plans generic, simple, and flexible enough to address a variety of events. Consider likely events based on available intelligence and past experiences; remember to watch for potential threats to emergency responders themselves. Learn from the past. Be alert to events happening in other communities by networking with others and being prepar ed. Identify resource gaps and consider mutual aid pacts and contract resources. 109 of 744Community and business risk or insurance ratings may be based on emergency preparations and response capabilities, and these are important factors in determining if a community is a good place to locate business. These factors may af fect property assessments, ratings, and may reduce potential liabilities for the public/private sectors. 15Public and private sectors agree that the first concer ns in any critical incident are citizen and employee safety and security .Identifying Responsibilities The private and public sectors bring individual responsibilities to the joint planning process. Each sector must carry its own weight and bring an open, but well prepared mind to the joint planning process in order to win the trust and confidence of the other sector. Joint planning will develop an understanding of participants' roles, workingpartnerships, skills, and r espective areas of professionalism. Private Sector Responsibilities All local businesses must be involved in the planning process to gain maximum planning efficiencies. Major companies should demonstrate leadership in plan development and encourage/suppor t suppliers, contractors, and other community businesses. Learn what skills and resources are available in the private sector and determine who the on-site experts are. Progressive private sector leaders will develop detailed plans on who is in charge of a critical incident and who is responsible for coordination with thepublic sector. In small businesses, the emergency planning process may be the respon- sibility of the owner or manager who may have limited experience inemergency planning and may need assistance from the public sector or an experienced private sector partner, both during the planning or an actual critical incident. In large businesses, specialized personnel are dedicated to security, fire, or safety and emergency planning, and they will have primary responsibility forresponse. Other company staff (personnel, medical, public affairs, andoperations managers) may support them. Plans should include resources needed to support public sector responders. Identify the person who will interface with the public sector incident commander, have knowledge of thefacility and resources, and have decision-making authority . Top management must support mutual aid pacts, and financial responsibil- ity for resource sharing must be specified during the planning process. Each business must identify needed contractor resources and how they may be shared within the community. Joint planning will identify mutual expec-tations of the use of the same outside resources and create understandingof the limited r esources in the public sector . Planning must consider the Maximum Allowable or Acceptable Down Time before the continued existence of a business is threatened, and must iden-tify resources required to maintain or resume business activities at an acceptable level. Businesses must overcome the attitude that they can handle events by them- selves. During the planning process, confidence and trust must be exhibitedby both sectors. 110 of 744A fire chief stated that his primar y obligation is to the community and he will get to other situations as circumstances dictate. \"The private sector may have to wait until I get there,\" he said. \"In most cases, it will be at least twenty minutes.\" As one security dir ector states, \"When we train together, many of the perceived differences become similarities. W e are not that much different. In many cases, my personnel ar e also members of the local volunteer fire department or the Emergency Medical Services (EMS). A local fire chief says: \"I may have the gold badge, but in your company, you are the one who knows the how, the when, and what needs to be done.\" 16Public Sector Responsibilities The public sector's first duty is to maintain safety in the community . The anticipated public sector (local, state, and federal) response times to events may reveal that private companies must change their initial public sector response assumptions. The public sector must understand the private sector's limits on resources and the potential impact to the community . Define situations where public policy or legal mandates require public sector intervention even though the private sector has ample resources to handle the event. Volunteer fire department members may work at businesses and should be included in the planning process. They have excellent knowledge of theirfacilities and may already be part of the private sector response capability. Consider impact of actions that may cause additional repercussions to other areas. Mutual Responsibilities for the Public and Private Sectors The planning process is more than touring facilities. Take time to understand layouts, fire, and security systems. Bring public responders into facilitiesto obtain first-hand knowledge of risk locations, safety processes, and technologies. (* See appendix A Information Gathering Form.) Consider using current private/public sector liaisons (such as community policing officers, school liaison officers, fire prevention officials, facilitymanagers, and security managers) as catalysts for the joint planning process. Develop a joint public/private resources and expertise inventory for each identified risk. In mutual aid planning, determine if certifications, licenses, and other requirements for private sector emergency response personnel are accept- able in the af fected jurisdictions. Consider and develop mutual aid pacts that deal with resources or exper- tise that can be used or shared by other private or public entities during acritical incident. Mutual aid pacts between the public to private sector or private to private sec- tor can be letters of understanding or informal agreements that do not mandate resource use in a critical incident. They are voluntary agreements between companies and the public sector to suppor t each other in an emer gency. Include the media in the planning pr ocess. Disseminate plans throughout the organization and update them continually. Don't let them become a dusty book sitting on the shelf. Cross train public/private resources to create understanding of credentials and capabilities. All legal requirements and situations that determine how public and private sector r esources may be utilized must be understood. All personnel, both public and private, who are involved in a critical incident must understand the incident command sys tem. Egos must go out the window . 111 of 744One security manager said that he didn't think the public incident commander knew in some cases the tremendous resources available to them in an emergency. It is just there for the asking. 17Mutual Aid Pacts Some considerations: Type of resources (personnel, equipment, or other suppor t) to be furnished Contacts and pr ocedures for requesting resources Financial or reimbursement arrangements Use of equipment\u2014 How will it be deliver ed? How will it be r eturned?Will personnel be fur nished? Payment for lost or damaged r esources Labor and legal considerations or r estraints Confidentiality issues Understanding the Incident Command System (ICS) and Unified Command (UC) Many jurisdictions have adopted the Incident Command System (ICS) as endorsed by law enforcement and fire services. ICS is required by Environmental or OSHA regu- lation during incidents of hazardous substance releases. ICS establishes an organizedand structured approach to taking charge of a critical incident and coordinating resources to resolve the matter. The ICS should be understood and practiced by the private sector and the public sector should be aware of the private sector emergencyresponse procedures, which may var y within the business community . Joint planning will ensure that the incident commander is aware of all available private/public resources. The plan must include a communications process on how toobtain and coordinate the use of these resour ces. The private sector should develop an Incident Management Team (IMT) approach to identify first responders in an emergency and the person respon-sible for managing site-specific emergency procedures. The IMT manager must provide coordination and direction at the scene of an emergency. Even small businesses should designate a person to fill this r ole. The IMT manager is initially responsible for coordinating all private response personnel at the scene. Upon arrival of public resources, the IMT isintegrated into the public Incident Command System. The IMT manager and Incident Commander work in concert as a unified command to ensure the most effective use of all available r esources. The company may also have a Corporate Crisis Management T eam (CMT) to support the on scene IMT with company resources. The CMT should becomposed of the functional units of the company that may be needed by the IMT to resolve the critical incident. Representatives must understand theirresponsibilities and requirements. The CMT is analogous to the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) established by the public sector . 112 of 744Terminology PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR Incident Management Team (IMT) Incident Command System (ICS) (On scene commander r esponsible for resolving the incident) Crisis Management Team or Center Emergency Operations Center (Supports the IMT/ICS and provides additional company or community r esources as needed) These titles can be inter changeable but should be agreed upon.

The par tnership process can develop for ms specific to your own community situation. 19A public emergency authority stated, \"I want the most knowledgeable person from the facility with me, someone who can get me the information or resources I need.\"Unified Command (UC) is a recognition that the most effective response involves all parties working together to bring their respective expertise to the incident. UC uses a management structure to facilitate cooperation by all sectors with jurisdictional or functional responsibility for resolving the incident. They must work together to developa common set of objectives and strategies, share information, maximize utilization of resources, and enhance efficiency of the individual response organizations. Joint unified command training should be provided to the public and private sectors. The tools necessary to support the incident commander and emergency respond- ers should be available in advance (maps, contact numbers, and personnel resources). Resources available through computer aided design (CAD) and other computer systemsshould not be overlooked. Compatible radio communication systems should be planned in advance. In many cases coordination of communication can be established by providing radios to the other sector, having a private sector official with the incidentcommander, or a representative in the appr opriate coordination center. 114 of 744REMEMBER: Create the preparedness plan and then train to it. Exercises Clarify responsiblities Identify roles Enhance skills Assess capabilities Evaluate performance Measure resources Provide feedback 20Plans must not r emain in isolation and become stagnant.Exercise the Plan The final step in the preparedness process is the development of a drill or exer- cise. Any emergency response plan must be exercised. Exercises are not tests but opportunities to acquir e and enhance skills, r eveal weakness, identify r esource gaps, improve coordination and confidence, build teamwork, and validate the emergencyresponse plan. Exercises will reduce the problems, mistakes, or omissions that can occur during actual events. The time spent in conducting and participating in exercises will pay tremendous dividends during an actual event. An exercise is a challenge so regardless of how good or bad it turns out, something will be learned and team building will occur. If disappointed inthe outcome, don't be afraid to try another exercise. Do not look for blamebut look for opportunities to learn and correct mistakes. Exercises are the proper place to lear n, not during real events. Keep exercise scenarios realistic . Don't make exercise scenarios too complex. Remember, an exercise is compressing a two or three-day realsituation into a few hours. Don' t worry about completing the exer cise. Exercises should consist of a generic scenario with some local flavor and be indicative of an event that could happen in the area or it will not beperceived as realistic. Keep exercises relatively simple with only a few objectives even though, in reality, situations can be very complicated. Too many objectives will becounter productive in an exercise. Be sure to inform participants of the ob- jectives and goals of the exer cise. Focus on one or two key threats . Break the exercise into segments and don't be concerned about covering every potential hazard. This will help tosimplify exercise evaluations and enhance the lear ning process. Begin with tabletop exercises involving members of the public and private sector. Joint tabletop exercises should be conducted at least once a yearand twice is preferable. Tabletop exercises are a cost-effective way to evalu-ate the emergency response plan, develop participant skills, and enhance knowledge in the emer gency response process. Types of Exercises Orientation - Briefing or low stress training to familiarize participants with team roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Provides a good overview of the emergency response plan. Tabletop - Limited simulation or scenario of an emergency situation to evalu- ate plans, pr ocedures, coordination, and assignment of r esources. Functional - Limited involvement or simulation by field operations to test communication, preparedness, and availability/deployment of operational re-sources. Full-scale - Conducted in an environment created to simulate a real-life situation. 115 of 74421A public official indicated that several weeks after a tabletop exercise was conducted with a company a railroad tank car sprung a leak requiring evacuation of their employees. The emergency response went well due to the public private understanding of their respective responsibilities. This would not have occurred if a joint exercise had not been held. Following a tabletop exercise, one private sector exercise participant indicated he understood the value of proper planning. Public sector particpants also expressed greater understanding of the resources and needs of the private sector.Performing an Exercise An exercise design team should be created for each exercise and the team should consist of representatives from the participating departments. This will create a more realistic environment for participants and focus on issues broader then a particular function. Exercise design is time consuming . Tabletop exercises may last only 1 to 2 hours yet tabletop exercise design could take up to 40 hours of preparation. The quality of the exer cise will cor relate directly to the time put into its pr eparation. To be effective, and for learning to take place, the exercise must have some successes. An exercise is a good evaluation process and overall successes andfailures need to be conveyed to the participants. This is a good way for each partici- pant to see and understand their role within the team. The scenario should stimulateinvolvement by all persons participating in the exercise. If participants do not have an active role, they should not be asked to commit their time. Exercises need to be realistic and follow policies, protocols, and procedures actually in place or they will not be productive. Participants become frustrated if they receive information from the exercise designer that is not consistent with real proce- dures. Exercises help reduce the \"can't happen here\" attitude. If the scenario isplausible, par ticipants will see the potential for a real event of a similar natur e. Allow participants to interact, dialogue, or discuss learning points during the exercise. At the completion of the exercise, each participant should be asked todiscuss one item they have learned and they will take back to their work place. Consider bringing exercise participants together at a later date to discuss what changes they have implemented as a r esult of the exer cise. Exercise evaluators should be persons knowledgeable in the areas of emergency response and the local environment. However, most learning will take place by theparticipants themselves during the exercise. Provide constructive critiques and make it a learning experience . Complete an \"after action\" report and provide it to all participants. Business should consider conducting individual tabletop exercises within their own organizations on a regular basis. The media should be invited to participate in exercises, as they will be an active par ticipant in an actual event. Using long distance technology or interactive video conferencing to facilitate exercises involves additional locations, enhances participation, and is an excellentway to maximize exercise preparation, deployment, evaluation, and information shar- ing. This technology is available through universities, community colleges, schools, orbusinesses. Appendix B contains an example of a tabletop exer cise. 116 of 74422 117 of 74423Public and private officials said that much has been done in joint planning for hazardous material events. The HAZMAT response planning process has been streamlined over the years. \"But we need to be worried about other types of events and concentrate on planning for those as well.\"Mitigation Mitigation includes all efforts to eliminate hazards or lessen the impact of an event should it occur. Relocating structures from a flood plain to eliminate recurrent losses caused by flooding is a classic example of mitigation. Yet mitigation can take many other forms. Examples include off site storage for critical information backup, separatingredundant or duplicate essential manufacturing process so a fire or explosion to one area will not cause a loss of production, or reducing the potential damage of terrorist bombs by installing bar riers to eliminate parking in close pr oximity to buildings. During the risk assessment process, certain vulnerabilities (manmade or natural) will be identified for each facility or major function within a particular business unit. Toprevent or minimize the impact of an assessed risk, a mitigation process should beginwhen vulnerabilities ar e first identified. Hazard mitigation is defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as \"actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their ef fects.\" In 1995, FEMA developed the National Mitigation Strategy to encourage part- nerships between the public and private sectors with the specific goal of significantly reducing the impact of natural hazar ds. Comprehensive Plan/Hazar d Interface, A Publication of the Livingston County Depar tment of Planning, Winter 1998-1999. Public and private sector facilities should develop good prevention practices. The private sector must look beyond what is required by regulation and develop additionalapproaches to reduce or eliminate hazards or risks. Regulations do not cover allpotential hazards. For example, workplace violence, domestic terrorism, and weather related disasters are not addressed by regulation. Comprehensive planning involves forward thinking and bold decision making. Mitigation efforts can be applied to the most common business disr uptions: Electrical power outages have a high rate of business interruption. Alternate sources of power should be consider ed. Reduction in fire risk should be an integral part of business operations and personnel should be aware of their individual roles in preventing fires. Facility modifications must include fire prevention measures and qualified per-sonnel must maintain fir e suppression systems. 118 of 744Company management should keep abreast of intelligence regarding domestic terrorism. Appropriate expertise and public sector resources will be needed to develop accurate threat assessments. Proactive protective measures should be implemented when appropriate. Good records of past incidents should be maintained. During the assessment and planning process, consider what can be done to prevent these incidents from reoccur-ring. Following an actual event or exercise, gather all persons involved in the incidentand determine how the event could have been prevented. Post event critiques are an important element of mitigation. All long-term strategic planning should include identification of mitigation opportu- nities. A joint public/private sector process will identify the broadest opportunities formitigation. The joint mitigation process necessitates trust and confidence in protect- ing competitive business strategies. 24 119 of 744Emergency Response Coordinating public and private responses to an emergency or critical incident is the culmination of all preceding activities, i.e. risk assessment, critical incident planning, exercises, and mitigation. The effort put into planning will pay dividends and enhance management of a critical incident when it occurs. The initial response to an incident, in many cases, will involve some element of the private sector. If the business has a security department, they may be the first respond-ers. In other cases, it may be an employee with little or no emergency response skills.Proper response and correct actions within the first few minutes of an incident lay the foundation on which the joint emergency response will be based and the matter eventually resolved. The smooth \"trade off\" or transfer of control to the public Incident Commander (IC) and continued teamwork will enhance the successful resolution of the incident. Response from the private sector, whether it is an employee or a formally established Incident Management Team (IMT) or Emergency Response Team (ERT) will begin the emergency response process. The manager of the IMT/ERT is in charge of the incident until relieved by the public sectorincident commander. If the incident is a major disaster requiring additional business resources, the company Crisis Management Team (CMT) may be activated to support the IMT. The CMT is usually located away from the incident site, and does not make operational decisions, but supports the IMT manager as required. The CMT may be located in the company's Crisis Management Center . The CMT should have an alter nate meeting site. The Crisis Management Center's (CMC) function is to support the Emergency Response Team by directing the proper allocation and coordina-tion of internal resources and obtaining assistance from external public and private resources. The local private sector and/or company Crisis Management Team (CMT) when activated will support the incident commander. The CMT must workin concert with the public sector Emer gency Operation Center . Upon arrival of the public sector, the private Incident Management Team (IMT) will be prepared to work in concert with the public sector. The Incident Command System (ICS ) will be implemented following a smooth transfer of authority, and where appropriate, joint decision making. 25 120 of 744DISASTER One security manager said their company has a crisis management team comprised of the top company executives. This team can get the incident commander any company resource that is needed. The resources are there for the asking.DISASTER Private Sector Response Private Sector or Incident Management T eam Public Sector Response Incident Commander Unified Command System Incident Management Team (IMT) Incident Command System (ICS) Crisis Management Team Emer gency Operations Center 26Communication among all aspects of the public and private sector must be estab- lished immediately. Prior joint emergency planning will enable responders to get to the business of handling the disaster during an actual event. Preparation in understand- ing respective public and private sector needs and requirements will reduce conflict and enable immediate activation of all available resources. The incident commander canfocus all energies to the task at hand, which is management, control, and resolution of the disaster . When an incident occurs, the main focus must be the successful resolution of the issue at hand, not why it happened. Participants must focus on the emergency response and not the cause. The cause can be determined after the incident is under control or resolved. Good planning will have designated responsibility for the determination of cause. Everyone must understand that when an event happens, it is never as planned. Be flexible. Top management must demonstrate overall leadership and support during the event but operational control and management must be in the hands of the first respondersand incident commander. The private sector should have persons available who know the facility and can support the incident commander. This may be the facility manager, maintenance person, facility engineer, or security staff. In large complexes, someoneneeds to be stationed at the \"front gate\" of the facility to lead public responders. A \"pathfinder\" approach is required. The private sector interface with public sectorresponders must be a person with authority to make decisions and support the incident commander. 121 of 744A fire chief said, \"I want to see a familiar face when I arrive on the scene. If not a familiar face, then someone who knows wher e I should go and what the situation is.\" Below is an example of a Public/Private Resour ce Matrix* PUBLIC/PRIVATE RESOURCE MATRIX Required Resource Private Sector Public Sector Other Name, Address, and Phone Number of Pr ovider Structural Engineer X ABC Manufacturing, Main Street, Anytown, Engineer Jeff Jones, 313-555-1212 Chemist X X Robert Smith, Anytown, 313-555-1212 Dean Jones, ABC Manufacturing, 313-555-1212 *This is just an example for m. The par tnership process can develop for ms specific to your own community situation. One fire chief said, \"I do not know all the dangers inside the gate, and I want someone by my side who does.\" 27Mass casualties resulting from hazardous materials incidents may also include injury and exposure to first responders. These events will tax the emergency response process and will resemble events mostly likely to occur in a weapon of mass destruc- tion attack. Evacuation of personnel will require close coordination between the publicand private sectors. The private sector may have to \"defend in place\" as the situation dictates. No one group can do it alone; all must work together. If existing on-site resources are unable to handle the event, the Incident Commander must not only know what isavailable on-site, but what is available from other sources within the community. The IC should be familiar with the private sector's qualifications. Combined training of public andprivate resources will create understanding and confidence in each other' s abilities. If joint resources are to be used, both sectors must train, drill, and work together. It is a never-ending process. A level of trust and confidence must be establishedbefore the critical incident. The public sector must understand the commitment requiredin training of first line private sector responders. Top management must support the process. Initiate a unified command structure and engage public and private sector resources. This teamwork approach will maximize the effectiveness of allavailable resources to resolve the critical incident. Eliminate the perception that public responders are always the exper ts. Establish and coordinate communication between the incident commander and private sector response teams and company crisis management teamsfor damage assessments, prioritization and allocation of resources, andemergency operations. Don't overlook contract security forces who understand their role and are trained to meet their responsibilities. Do not underestimate the knowledgeand expertise available in the ranks of contract security for ces. 122 of 744A fire chief said that they made a decision to let a fir e burn since the water run-off would have contaminated the local environment. This was the understanding they had with the local business in advance . 28Be certain the private sector understands the legal responsibilities of the public sector. When the public sector responds, they must carry through with their responsibilities. Determine who is authorized to approve response expenses and establish a process of cost documentation. Determine if there is a cost recoveryordinance and keep track of costs associated with the emergency. Difficulty can occur when bills star t coming in. Develop a critical incident debriefing plan . Be candid and learn from mistakes for lessons learned are invaluable. Mitigation must be initiatedas needed. 123 of 744A community indicated they had involved the media in the planning process. During an actual air craft disaster, the media had a clear understanding of the emergency management system and their r ole. As one officer said, \"It sur e made our job easier.\" One city says their r elationship with the media and the establishment of a community hotline at the time of an emergency was working so well that the citizens expected to be informed of even very minor events. The local media cooperated in getting information to the public, which requires a close working relationship among the media, public sector, and private sector. 29Media Relations Public information is a vital component of any critical incident response. The media must be a part of the preparedness process and media involvement in the planning process will help reduce misunderstanding during an incident. Accurate information should be available to the public as soon as possible. The media needs to know where they can obtain information or receive briefings. Plan for an off-site PublicInformation Office/Media assembly and briefing area. An informed public is an educated and understanding one. Here are some steps to smooth media/public r elations: Develop a policy on who will handle the media. Employees must leave media contact to professionals. Small companies may not have a person skilled in handling the media during a crisis. Determine who will be the lead spokesperson. That person needs to have public relations experience. In most cases, the public sector should takethe lead but they need support and information from the private sector. Consider joint pr ess releases. Be cooperative but careful in speaking with the media since they can help get vital information to the public. Do not speculate. Media relations must be an ongoing joint public/private process. If you deal directly and honestly with the local media, they can be of assistance in dealing with national media. Watch using \"I think\" and becertain of facts including the time frames to release pertinent information so the actions of first responders ar e not circumvented. Let the emergency responders focus on the event. Create a community information plan so persons can call one number and obtain information on the crisis. Remember that people are \"data driven\" and need information. 124 of 74430 125 of 744In an emergency, neighbors have to deal with neighbors and after the crisis, they still have to live and associate with each other . The public and private sectors agreed that there is no disaster that cannot be managed if they have joined in the planning, response, recovery, and mitigation process. W ith their joint expertise and resources, a terrible event can be resolved and the public's confidence in their community can be maintained. 31A private sector executive was surprised that his company could be shut down for several weeks while crime scene activities were conducted by the public sector. A tabletop exercise had exposed this possibility and, as a r esult, recovery and business resumption plans were being modified.Recovery and Business Resumption The recovery or business resumption process can begin during the emergency response process, or it may be initiated in stages until the normal business operations are restored. The recovery process must factor in the criticality of the business function and the maximum allowable down time. A quick recovery from an incident will start the community back on the path to normal activity. The process may be of short or long duration; however, planning for the recovery phase in the assessment, planning, and response process will definitelydecrease recovery time. Both sectors must strive for quick recovery. The private sector crisis management team should immediately initiate their recovery process. The Incident Commandershould be kept informed of the recovery process but nothing should be done to conflict with response activities. Accurate damage assessment is important to the recovery process. Recovery should not conflict with \"crime scene\" preservation and examination, and crime scene investigators must be trained and sensitive to recovery needs. Fastrecovery is desirable but the cause of the incident must be established. Determine the extent of damage and communicate it to the public. Accurate projections of recovery times should be provided and publicsupport and understanding should be solicited during the recovery process. Developing a system to bring in \"the right people at the right time\" is very important for long term recovery. Emergency responders and the privatesector have to work side by side in the recovery as well as in the response. Work with outside resources to support the recovery process. Verify that the same resource provider is not planned or obligated to other communitybusinesses. Identify and make certain that unscrupulous persons do notvictimize the community. Advance planning for needed resources will reduce this from happening. Develop understanding of the financial impact to the community if the private sector is delayed in the resumption of business operations. In a wide-spread disaster, determine who needs to be \"recovered first\" and understand the impact on the welfar e of the community. Use all available community resources to assist persons in recovering from traumatic events. Reestablishment of the individual sense of well being isan essential part of the community's recovery process. In this age oftechnology the public expectations may be overly optimistic. 126 of 74432MITIGATION DISASTER NORMAL OPERATIONSNORMALOPERATIONSDISRUPTION TONORMAL OPERATIONS Preparedness Risk Assessment Critical Incident Planning Training ExercisingEmergency Response Unified Command System (Public/Private) Supported by: Private Sector - Crisis Management T eam Public Sector - Emergency Operation Center Business Resumption/Recover y ProcessPreparedness Process ResumesCritical Incident Pr ocessFlow Chart 127 of 744Off-site emergency resources: Company Contract Mutual Aid pact (for mal or informal) Emergency information: Material Safety Data Sheets Hazardous material and locationsNumber and training of emergency personnel Number of medical personnel at facilitySecurity/fire control central station Facility diagram and/or photographs : Other information considered pertinent: Name and telephone number of person completing information sheet:Appendix A: Components of a Basic Infor mation Form The following is a consolidation of for ms, information sheets, and guides used by regional par ticipants.

Par ticipants are provided the following information: SEGMENT 1 \u2014 Response The local police just r eceived a call fr om Novelty Manufacturing Company Security that a shooting has occurred at their plant. Initial repor ts indicate that a gunman enter ed the plant and shot a r eceptionist. Employees and visitors ar e running from the plant in panic and the gunman is still inside. The following conditions exist. It is 2:15 PM, on a Thursday after noon. The weather is a typical mild spring day with no wind. Novelty Manufacturing is located next to a medium size strip mall. The company employs 125 workers. There is a school located immediately behind the Mall and school gets out at 2:30 PM. Many students cut thr ough the back lot of the plant to meet their friends at the shopping center after school. Two unarmed plant security of ficers are outside the plant. Witnesses r unning from the planthave informed security that the gunman is also holding several containers of a liquid-like substance. One fleeing employee also infor med security that she knows the r eceptionist who is shot. She believes the husband is the shooter . The employee also indicated that the receptionist just filed a restraining order against her husband. Police, fire, and emergency services are on the scene. The plant' s manager is in the front parking lot. The police ar e requesting information on the victim, floor plans, and if all employees ar e out of the plant. It is not known what visitors ar e still in the plant. The fir e department wants to know wher e flammable materials or items are located in the plant. The press is on the scene and inter viewing witnesses. They want a spokesperson fr om the responders tomeet them and appear on camera. They want to know if ther e is a danger to the school and also other stores in the mall. Persons are calling Mall security wanting to know if any of their friends or relatives ar e hurt. Mall security wants a representative of the plant to handle the calls or come to their of fice. Mall security has infor med the plant manager that his home of fice wants him to call. Hysterical parents are calling the school and the police saying that they heard that ther e had been a shooting at the school. 9:20 AM Step 1 - Individual Analysis (10 minutes) Members of the emer gency management team (public and private sector) should take appr oximately 10 minutes to list their r esponse actions based on the above infor mation. Any r esources needed and contemplated actions should be noted. Any emer gency planning documents should be refer red to. 34 129 of 7449:30 AM Step 2 - Group Analysis (30 minutes) Members should pr esent their recommended actions to the emer gency management team. Team discussion should occur and any action(s) should be listed. A gr oup list of priorities andnext steps should be developed. 10:00 AM SEGMENT 2 \u2014 Response continued The following additional infor mation is provided to par ticipants: Contact has been made with the gunman inside the building. He acknowledges he has shot his wife and is holding several hostages. He has threatened to kill them. T o show he means business he claims to have star ted a fire in the stor e room at the back of the building. Police units in back of the Mall r eport smoke coming from inside the dock ar ea of the plant. 10:15 AM Group Analysis (30 minutes) Each emergency management team should discuss the new infor mation and what resources will be needed to respond to the cur rent situation. 10:45 AM Exercise scenario concludes when gunman surr enders to police Critique & Discussion: (45 minutes) Some points to consider: What type of incident command str ucture was used? Who was in char ge? Was there a joint command center established? Where was it located? What information was needed fr om the public and private sector respectively? Were plant diagrams and employee infor mation readily available? Was there an evacuation of sur rounding stores and the school? How was it handled? Where was the press staged and who was the primary spokesperson? How was accurate in- formation obtained by the spokesperson? How was the fire in the back of the stor e handled? How was information on the shooter obtained? Was there any concern for the liquid that he was carrying? What role did plant management, Mall management, and private security play? Based on the lessons learned in this exercise, what are the next steps for participants to take individually and as a group? What is the time frame for taking these steps? When will the par- ticipants reconvene to report on the accomplishment of their respective actions? 11:30 AM Exercise Concludes 35 130 of 744References Here are some helpful r eferences if additional infor mation is desir ed.

The following definitions will be helpful during the planning and implementation process. Acceptable Down Time - The period of time a function or activity can be disrupted without significant impact to production, customer service, revenue, or public confidence. Each business activity must develop its individual maximum allowable down time. Also referred to as Maximum Allowable Recover y Time. Business Resumption - See Recover y Community - A political entity, within a defined boundary, having authority to adopt and enforce laws and provides services and leadership to its residents. Crisis - An incident or event that cannot be adequately handled within the normal scope of business operations. See Critical Incident.Crisis Management Team (CMT) - CMT is comprised of senior private sector executives who represent the central business functions. In a disas- ter that exceeds the scope of normal business operations, the CMT provides strategy and support to the on-scene Incident Management Team. Analo- gous to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) established by the public sector. Crisis Management Center (CMC) - Location where the Crisis Management Team meets. Primary and alternate location must be preplanned. May be at the facility where the incident is occurring or a distant location, as the main office, headquar ters of the business function, or alternate site. Critical Incident - Any manmade or natural event or situation that threat- ens people, property, business , or the community and occurs outside the normal scope of routine business operations. Typically requires coordina- tion of numerous resources. Critical Incident Plan - Action plan developed to mitigate, respond to, and recover from a critical incident. Includes steps to guide the response and recovery efforts. Identifies persons, equipment, and resources for activa- tion in a disaster and outlines how they will be coor dinated. Disaster - see Critical Incident. Emergency - An event that threatens people, property , business continu- ity, or the community and may develop into a disaster or critical incident. Emergency Operations Center (EOC) - The EOC is a location where senior public sector officials who represent primary governmental functions assemble to resolve a critical incident. Monitors and directs emergency response and recovery activities. Supplies the public sector Incident Commander with the necessary resources to resolve the critical incident. Analogous to the private sector Crisis Management T eam (CMT). Emergency Planning - see Critical Incident Planning. Emergency Response - Coordinated public and private response to a critical incident. Emergency Response Team - See Incident Management T eam Exercise - A planned, staged implementation of the critical incident plan to evaluate processes that work and identify those needing improvement. Exercises may be classified as Orientation, Tabletop, Functional, or Full-scale and involve scenarios to respond to and resolve the assessed risks. See definitions of exer cise types. Full Scale Exercise - Conducted in an environment created to simulate a real-life situation. Involves functional ar eas of response r esources . Functional Exercise - Limited involvement or simulation by field operations to test communication, preparedness, and available/deployment of opera- tional resources. Hazards - Any circumstances, natural or manmade, that may adversely affect or attack the community' s businesses or r esidences.Incident Commander - Public sector official (usually fire or police) in charge of coordinating resources and developing strategies to resolve the critical incident. Incident Command System (ICS) - ICS establishes an organized approach to take charge of a critical incident and coordinate the response. Joint private/public sector planning enables a smooth transfer of authority from the private sector to the public sector Incident Commander when they arrive on the scene. Unified command may occur after this transfer . Incident Management Team (IMT) - The private sector response team at the scene to resolve the critical incident. If a company Crisis Management Team is available, the IMT may request additional private sector resources. May also be known as Emer gency Response T eam (ERT) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) - Process established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for particular hazards and suggested as a method for local business and government to partner in the critical in- cident planning process. Maximum Allowable Recover y Time - See Acceptable Down T ime Mitigation - Activities to eliminate hazards in advance or to lessen their impact if an incident occurs. Includes all types of prevention activities, control or containment, forward planning, and risk reduction. Should be considered throughout the entire planning, response, and recovery process. Orientation exercise - Low stress training exercise to familiarize teams with their roles and expectations. Usually provided in a partial briefing format. Provides an over view of the critical incident r esponse plan. Preparedness - Actions and initiatives developed prior to an incident that includes risk assessment, planning, training, and exercising.Private Sector - A business or company not owned or managed by the government.Public Sector - A particular element or component of government, i.e. police, fire, emergency services, public works, local, state, or federal government entity.

Complainant must establish a pr ima facie case by showing that: He/she is a member of a protected class. He/she suffered some adverse action. A similarly situated individual outside of his/her class was tr eated more favorably. Intent to discriminate is proven by three types of evidence: direct, circumstantial (comparative), and statistical Shifting Burden: Once a prima facie case is established the burden shifts to th e employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for taking the action; th en shifts back to complainant to argue pretext. Adverse Impact Discrimination Exists when a facially neutral employment policy/practice dispr oportionately impacts members of a protected class. The burden shifts to the agency to provide a business justifica tion for the challenged policy/practice. After management meets its burden, the complainant may prevail by providing an alternative practice that would accomplish the same business objective with a less adverse impact on the protected class. 140 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Discriminatory motive is not required. Examples of policies that may adversely impact some groups: Educational Requirements, Tests, Height and Weight Requirements, Subjective Standards for Hiring, Promotions, and Assignments. Griggs v. Duke Power Co. 401 U.S. 424 (1971) Griggs was an African American male; He was denied a ditch digger job because he failed to meet selection criteria (possession of high school diploma or passing grade on a written test); Supreme Court found that the facially neutral employment criter ia violated Title VII because: o It had a disproportionate impact on Griggs' protected group and o It was not job-related or consis tent with business necessity. Title VII Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against worke rs because of: Age Race Color Religion Sex National Origin Under Title VII, the ADA, and the ADEA, it is illegal to discri minate in any aspect of employment, including: Hiring and firing Compensation, assignment, or classification Transfer, promotion, layoff, or recall Job advertisements Recruitment Testing Use of company facilities Training and apprenticeship programs Fringe benefits Pay, retirement plans, disability leave; or Other terms and conditions of employment Equal Employment Opportunity Laws (EEO) Protect employees from discrimination on the basis of: Race Age 40+ Ancestry Mental Disability Color 141 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Creed Medical Condition Marital Status Sex Religion Pregnancy Family Medical Leave National Origin Physical Disability Sexual Orientation Retaliation Eight Overall Factors: Race Color Religion Sex or gender National Origin Disability/Handicap Condition Age (+40) Retaliation and/or reprisal Discriminatory Practices include: Harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age; Retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination Employment decisions based on stereotypes; and Denying employment opportunities to a person because of marriag e to, or association with, and individual of a particular race, religion, national origin, or an individual with a disability. Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA): Prohibits an employer from refusing to hiring, firing, or other wise discriminating against an employee age 40 or older, solely on the basis of age Equal Pay Act (EPA): Prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the payment of wages or benefits Wage differences permitted for: Seniority, Merit, Quantity/quality of Production, any other fac tor other than sex 142 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] What is a BFOQ?????? (BFOQ) are employment qualifications that employers are allowed to consider while making decisions about hiring and retention of employ ees. The qualification should rel ate to an essential job du ty and is considered necessary for operation of t he particular business. The Bona Fide Occupational Qualif ications rule allows for the h iring of individuals based on race, sex, age, and national origin if these characteristics are bona fide occupati onal qualifications. This is an exception and complete defense to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which protects employees from discrimination based on religion, sex, age, national origin and color at the w orkplace. In order to establish the defense of bona fide occupational qua lification, an employer must prove the requirement is necessary to the success of the business and tha t a definable group or class of employees would be unable to perform the job safely and efficiently. An employe r should demonstrate a necessity for a certain type of workers because all others do not have certain characte ristics necessary for employment success. However, the employer's motivation for excluding the protected class is not significant in evaluating the BFOQ defense. The inquiry focuses on the necessity of using an expre ssly forbidden classification. Examples of BFOQ's are: mandatory retirement ages for bus drivers and airplane pilots for safety reasons, churches requiring members of its clergy to be of a certain den omination and may lawfully bar, from employment, anyone who is not a m ember. However, for positions at a church such as janitors, discrimination based on religious denomination would be illegal because religi on has no effect on a person's ability to fulfill the duties of the job. Other examples of bona fide occupation quali fications include the use of models and actors for the purpose of authenticity or g enuineness, the requirement of emergency personnel to be bilingual, judged on language competency, not national origin. Sex Discrimination Sexual Harassment a form of sex discrimination Pregnancy Based Discrimination Pregnancy, childbirth, and rel ated medical conditions must be t reated in the same way as other temporary illnesses or conditions. Additional rights are available to parents and others under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) enforced by the Department of Labor Sexual Orientation Protected under state law - NRS 613.330 Unlawful employment practices: Discrimination on basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual o rientation, age, disability or national origin; Interference with aid or appliance for disability; Refusal to permit service animal at place of employment. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all employment practices. An individual with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities Major life activities include: w alking, breathing, seeing, hear ing, speaking, learning, and working Persons currently engaging in ille gal use of drugs are not prot ected by ADA 143 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Reasonable Accommodation May include, but is not limited to: Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities Job restructuring Modification of work schedules Providing additional unpaid leave Reassignment to a vacant position Acquiring or modifying equipment or devices Adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials or poli cies Providing qualified readers or interpreters An employer is not required to lower production standards to ma ke an accommodation Elements of Employment Opportunity Equal opportunity to ___________________________ Equal opportunity to ___________________________ Equal opportunity to be _________________________ Sexual Harassment Form of ____________________ discrimination Violation of Section 703 of Title VII Must occur at ____________________ or a ____________________ en vironment Sexual Harassment - Violation Section 703 Title VII Definition: \"____________________sexual a dvances, ____________ _______ ____________________ or ____________________ __________________ __ of a sexual nature constitutes ____________________when: 1. _____________________ to such conduct is made either __________ __________or ____________________ a term or condition of an individual's____ ________________ 2.

Burlington Northern v. White 548 U.S. 53 (2006) Facts: White, the only woman working in her department, operated a fo rklift at the Tennessee yard of Burlington. After she complained of sexual harassment, her immediate superv isor was disciplined. Thereafter, White was removed fro m forklift duty to less desira ble (more arduous and dirtier) duties as a track laborer, although her job classification remained the sam e. Further, she was suspended for 37 days without pay for alleged insubordination but was eventually reinstated and given back pay in full. Burlington asserted that White did not suffer an \"adverse emplo yment action\" because she was not fired, demoted, denied promotion or denied wages. The Court held that White suffere d retaliatory discrimination w hen she was reassigned to less desirable duties and suspended without pay. Although, the duties were within the same job classification an d pay was eventually reinstated, the actions were sufficiently harsh to constitute discrimination an d deter a reasonable employee from complaining about discrimination. 150 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The Future of Retaliation Claims - Source: HR Magazine 1/1/20 11 Retaliation claims are increasing, so take steps to limit them. Some HR professionals and lawyers predicted that the U.S. Supr eme Court's 2006 decision in Burlington Northern v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), would open th e floodgates for retaliation charges and lawsuits. Although cause and effect is hard to determine, the f ollowing facts are undeniable: Through 2009, when the most recent U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissi on statistics were available, there was a steady increase in retaliation charges filed. There was also an increase in state and federal retaliation lawsuits filed. In its Burlington Northern decision, the Supreme Court lowered the standard of proof for retaliation claims, making it much easier for employees to prove those kind s of cases. Typically, an employee who engages in an alleged protected activity, such as filing an internal co mplaint, is subsequently di sciplined or treated in an adverse way. The employee will claim that the discipline or adv erse action was motivated by the protected activity. To succeed, the employee need only show that retaliation was a motivating factor in the employer's later decision. In Burlington Northern, the U .S. Supreme Court expanded the sc ope of unlawful retaliatory adverse employment actions to those viewed by a reasonable person in th e employee's position as materially adverse but not necessarily ultimate employment actions. Burlington Northern represented a significant departure from prior legal consideration as to the re quired proof in employees' reta liation complaints. This article revisits Burlington Northern in light of the reta liation cases that followed, and suggests ways to avoid or reduce retaliation claims. Burlington Northern The Burlington Northern case w as filed by Sheila White, who worked as a \"track laborer\" for Burlington Northern Railroad Company. Her assignment was to operate a forklift, one of the least physically demanding and cleanest job assignm ents at White's facility. The forklift driver position was considered one of the most desirable jobs. White complained that her supervisor repeatedly made comments that women should not work in his department. Burlington Northern investigated White's claim, fou nd that it had merit and suspended her supervisor for 10 days. The supe rvisor was required to attend a sexual harassment class. But Burlington Northern's investigation had another consequenc e. During the investigation, several employees complained that, because they were senior to White, i t was unfair that she was given the forklift assignment. Burlington Northern decided that these complaints h ad merit and reassigned White, giving her forklift assignment to a senior male co-worker. White filed a charge with the U .S. Equal Employment Opportunit y Commission (EEOC), alleging that she was reassigned in retaliation for complaining about her sup ervisor. She claimed that she was placed under surveillance by her employer. Later, White was accused of being insubordinate to another supervisor and was suspended without pay for 37 days. White filed and won an inter nal grievance, and received back pay for those 37 days. She filed a second charge with the EEOC about the susp ension. White's lawsuit alleged retalia tion for the reassignment and t he suspension. A jury agreed with White and awarded her $43,500 in compens atory damages. Burlington Northern appealed. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that White's reassignment was not an adverse employment action that could form the basis for a retaliation claim because White's title and compensation remain ed the same. When the Supreme Court heard the case, it disagreed, reversed in favor of White and widely expanded the definition of \"adverse employment action\" to include reassi gnment to a less-desirable job. Rather than focus on the negative financial impact, courts now must look at wheth er the alleged adverse employment action is material in that it would dissuade a reasonable individual from reporting harassment or discrimination. 151 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Subsequent Cases After Burlington Northern, many predicted that retaliation cla ims would skyrocket, and they have. In addition, retaliation cases that p reviously would have ended at summary judgment are now going to juries, who are often sympathetic to employees- especially in this economy. More U.S. courts are holding that job transfers and changes in work assignments can be considered retaliatory a dverse employment actions. In fact, a federal court in Michigan has even held that a job transfer that involved a one-time bonus and nominal pay increase was an adverse action because it resulted in less opportunity for advancement and less prestige for the employee (Pitts v. Kone Inc., Case No. 05CV714 36 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 16, 2006)). Courts are finding that negative performance evaluations and d iscipline notices can be considered retaliatory adverse employment actions. This is true when the e valuations are less favorable than previous ones or when they result in denial of a bonus. Even a suspension ove rturned by a grievance process can constitute an adverse employment action. Other adverse employment actions in cases where employees have avoided summary judgment include threats of losing pay, benefits or a job; investigations that f ocus on character rather than the complaint or harassment; and denial of oppor tunities for advancement or use of accrued sick leave. But not every employer action that makes an employee unhappy w ill be considered an adverse employment action by the courts . For example, courts have found that performance improve ment plans are not, on their own, materially adverse employment actions. Keep in mi nd that courts in different parts of the country are coming to different resu lts, and it is not easy to discern what distinguishes cases that win on summary judgment from cases that go to a jury. It does seem, however, that courts are making an effort to distinguish trivial actions and petty slights from material adverse actions that would deter a reasonable emp loyee from engaging in protected activity. Several appellate courts, for exa mple, have held that rude comm ents by supervisors do not amount to retaliation, even when a supervisor refers to an employee as a \"troublemaker \" for making complaints. Back to the Basics So, in light of Burlington Northern and cases decided in favor of employees since then, what can employers do to protect themselves? They can and should be proa ctive and consider the basics. Most successful retaliation claims result from employers taking so-called \"adve rse employment actions,\" including terminations and other discipline, without enough due diligence and planning . This may be particularly true when line managers come to you and declare, \"I have had it. I want him fi red today.\" Too often, this may be the first time an HR professional has h eard about this employee. While there are no silver bullets, there are basi c actions that may help avoid or reduce the likelihood of a retaliation charge or lawsuit. When confronted with termination or other discipline of an employee, consider the following steps as part of due diligence: * Implement and follow a zero-tolerance anti-discrimination and a nti-retaliation policy. It will inform employees that such beha viors are prohibited. * Have a toll-free telephone number for complaints. Such a proces s may allow employees to resolve complaints internally. * * Reflect on what discipline to take. Seldom is it necessary to terminate an employee on the spot. Even when immediate termination is the appropriate sanction, it is r ecommended that the employee be suspended pending investigation subject to discharge. * * Recognize employee-protected activity. Knowing what employee behavior is protected, such as filing an internal complaint, and knowing when it occurred, may keep y ou from retaliating against the 152 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] employee. Retaliatory actions m ay include job transfers; change s in work assignments; negative performance evaluations; discipline notices; threats of losing pay, benefits or a job; internal investigations; denial of career advancement opportunities; and more. * * Timing is important. Discipline closely linked in time to pro tected activity may create a presumption of retaliation. * * Listen to the employee's version. Fairness requires that you give the employee the opportunity to tell his or her side. Sometimes, motive may be critical in your decision as to what discipline, if any, to administer. * Conduct a complete investigation. Investigate all leads and int erview all relevant witnesses. * Take appropriate action. If a vi olation is found and discipline warranted, take the action and document it. * Follow up on discrimination and harassment complaints. Speak with complainants after the initial investigation to ensure that they feel comfortable in the workp lace and do not perceive retaliation. Follow up quarterly, at least for a while. * * Don't overreact. It is easy to act in haste and based on the facts as they appear at the moment. A suspension pending further investigation allows you time to ref lect, in case the facts are not as they first appear. * Be consistent. Discrimination a nd retaliation charges often suc ceed because employers are inconsistent in following policies and procedures or adhering to past practi ce. * * Document, but don't over-document. Documentation should be ti mely, thorough and accurate. Sometimes there is a tendency to document everything a \"bad\" em ployee does. Advise your managers to resist the urge. Documentation should be consistent with past practice and the same for all employees. If you use a progressive process, document within that process. * Train supervisors on the basics. L ine managers may not remember HR policies and procedures. Revisit them regularly. * Review EEOC guidelines. These guidelines can often provide guid ance for particular situations. * Consult with legal support before taking severe disciplinary ac tion. * Don't retaliate. Enough said. First Line of Defense HR professionals represent the employer's first line of defens e to charges and complaints of retaliation. Be proactive and prepare for such cases in advance of the charge or lawsuit being filed. No matter what safeguards you have in place, or how fair your discipline or ot her processes, certain employees will consider them unfair. Therefore, some em ployees inevitably will file ret aliation charges or lawsuits. That's the price of doing business. Being proactive, considering the basics and conducting due dil igence reviews should minimize their number and effect. Most successful retaliation claims result from employers takin g adverse employment actions without enough due diligence and planning.

Complaint Process - Manager's/Supervisor's Responsibilities: Treat all complaints seriously and confidentially. Make sure that notices for the timely filing of a discriminatio n complaint are prominently posted in the workplace. Attempt to resolve complaints at the earliest stage, i.e., the informal stage. Participate in mediation at any stage of the complaint process. Cooperate with EEO officials and investigators throughout the c omplaint process. Respond to requests for information and documents in a timely a nd accurate manner. Do not engage in behavior that may be viewed as retaliatory or obstructive to the complaint process. Best Practices - For Supervisors and Managers Set example (managers are role models). Be accessible (have an \"open door policy\"). Communicate regularly with staff (reiterate EEO policies in mee tings). Monitor workplace behaviors (enforce respect in the workplace). Investigate complaints promptly Expand recruitment efforts thro ugh outreach (not preferences). Maintain accurate Position Descr iptions (use valid selection criteria). Use diverse interview panels in the hiring process. Use standardized questions (no medical/personal). Take notes/quantify responses/use matrix. Review process for equity and consistency. Keep records/document. Title VII Complaint Filing Must be filed with the appropriate agency: Nevada Equal Rights Commission (NERC) - ____________________ da ys Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) - ______________ ______days The 10 Employment Laws Every Manager Should Know - published by HR Specialist Overtime pay. Discrimination. F amily leave. Harassment ...Federal employment laws govern all of these issues - and many more - that you deal with at some point in your care er. It's important for supe rvisors and managers to know the basics of how to comply with those laws. Here's a l ist of the top 10 most important federal employment laws: 1. Job discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits you from d iscriminating in hiring, firing or pay based on a person's race, religion, sex or national origin. It also prohibits sexual harassment. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov ) Action: Treat all employees and applicants equally, without regard to their race, religion, gender or any other characteristics not related to job performance. Demand th e same from anyone you supervise and don't tolerate any kind of harassment. 154 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 2. Overtime/minimum wage. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is the nation's main wage law. It sets the federal minimum wage (many stat es have higher minimums) and req uires time-and-a-half overtime pay for hourly employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also limits the hours and type of duties that teens can work. (Resource: www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages ) Action: Always pay employees above the minimum wage and pay overtime w hen applicable. Contact HR when making major changes to employees' duties, which could make the employee eligible or ineligible for overtime pay. 3. Family leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) says eligible employee s - those with at least a year of service - can take up to 1 2 weeks per year of unpaid, j ob-protected time off for the birth of a child or adoption of a child or to care for themselves or a sick child, spouse or parent who has a \"serious\" health condition. The FMLA applies to o rganizations with 50 or more em ployees. (Resource: www.dol.gov/whd/fmla ) Action: When employees request leave, listen for requests that would m eet the FMLA criteria. Employees don't need to use the words \"FMLA leave\" to gain protection und er the law. Contact HR when hearing such requests. 4. Age discrimination. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act says you can't discri minate in any way against applicants or employees older than 40 because of their age. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/age.cfm ) Action: Never take a person's age or pr oximity to retirement into account when making decisions on hiring, firing, pay, benefits or promotions. 5. Disability discrimination. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits job discrimination against qualified people with disabilities (i.e., those who can perform the job's essential functions with or without a reasonable accommodation). (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/disability.cfm ) Action: Never immediately reject app licants because you think their di sability would prevent them from doing the job. When hiring, stick to questions about the applic ant's ability to perform the job's essential functions; don't ask questions that would reveal an applicant's disability. Work with HR to help create reasonable accommodations for disabled employees. 6. Military leave. The Uniformed Services Employme nt and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) makes it illegal to discriminate against employees who volunteer or are called to military duty. When reservists return from active duty tours of less than five years, you must reemploy them to their old jobs or to equal jobs. (Resource: www.esgr.org/site/USERRA/FAQ.aspx ) Action: Don't challenge a returning reser vist's bid to get his old job back; courts typically side with employees in USERRA disputes. 7. Gender-pay differences. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) says employers can't pay female employees less than male employees for equal work on jobs that require equal skill, effort and responsibility. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sex.cfm. ) Action: Review department pay scales to identify possible equal-pay co mplaints. Different pay for the same job title is fine as long as you can point to varying levels of responsibility, duties, skill requirements or education requirements. 8. Workplace safety. The Occupational Safety and Hea lth Act (OSHA) requires employe rs to run a business free from recognized hazards. (Resource: www.osha.gov ) Action: Provide a safe work environment for your staff, and point out any noticeable hazards or potential safety problems as soon as possible. 9. Pregnancy discrimination. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) prohibits job discrimination on the basis of \"pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions. \" You can't deny a job or promotion merely because an employee is pregnant o r had an abortion. She can't b e fired for her condition or forced to go on leave. (Resource: www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/pregnancy.cfm ) Action: Treat pregnant employees the same as other employees on the basis of their ability or inability to work. Example: If you provide light duty for an employee who ca n't lift boxes because of a bad back, you must make similar arrangements for a pregnant employee. 155 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 10. Immigration. The Immigration Reform and Cont rol Act (IRCA) makes it illegal to hire and employ illegal aliens. Employers must verify i dentification and workplace elig ibility for all hires by completing I-9 Forms. (Resource: www.uscis.gov) Action: Managers should note that it's still illegal to discriminate a gainst illegal aliens - via harassment or subminimum pay - even if the illegal immigrant is hired inadver tently. How to Respond to an EEOC Complaint: 10 Steps to Success The EEOC and state and local age ncies have been filing more adm inistrative charges in recent years and that trend is likely to continue. Because administrative charges can be precursors to discrimination lawsuits, it's critical for you to handle them properly. These 10 tips will help you prepare to respond: 1. Tell the whole story Often, an EEOC charge contains just one or two paragraphs, containing little more than conclusory allegations of discrimination. Resist the temptation to put minimal effort into your response. It's usually advisable to provide a comprehensive response, det ailing the circumstances surrounding the employment relationship and the reasons for adverse employment actions. Try to nip the claim in the bud by giving the agency all the facts . Demonstrate that there were legitimate business reasons for your actions. 2. Use documentation If you have documents supporting yo ur version of events, consid er including them in your response. Documentation dating from the time of the adverse employment ac tion can be the best way of discrediting the allegations. Attendance records , sales reports and e-mail messa ges can all help prove that events happened as you say they did, and that the company's concerns were bona fid e. 3. Verify the response's accuracy Attorneys love catching an emplo yer in a lie. Since the informa tion you submit could be used in later legal proceedings, make sure everyone involved reviews the response a nd verifies the accuracy of every statement. 4. Highlight consistent past decisions One of the best ways to demonstrate that a decision was not mot ivated by unlawful discrimination is to point to the same actions being taken against similarly situated employe es who are not members of the charging party's protected class. For example, if the charging par ty alleges that her termination was motivated by discrimination against women, tell the agency of instances when you terminated men for the sa me misconduct. 5. Remember, the agency doesn't know your business In telling your version of the e vents, share details about your business that will help the agency understand your actions. Think about why the charging party's performance concerned you. Would that be readily apparent to an outsider? For example, if you are legally r equired to have a certain numb er of staff on hand at all times, explaining this will emphasize why poor attendan ce would be a significant probl em in your workplace. 6. Maintain confidentiality Information about the charge should be on a need-to-know basis, especially if the charging party is still employed. If you know investigators will cont act employees, couch your message in terms like this: \"While we do not feel there is any merit to the allegations, we respect Employee X's right to bring this charge. If you are contacted by the agency, you should cooperate and be completely honest with the investigator.\" 156 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 7. Be prompt and cooperative Don't put off preparing your response. Anti-discrimination agen cies are less inclined to provide extensions than they once were. Failure to respond to a charge in a timely way can result in an adverse determination. 8. Work with legal counsel Because a discrimination charge can be the first step in a chai n of legal actions, you must protect your company's interests. Many empl oyers ask their attorneys to inve stigate and prepare the response. At the very least, have an attorney review a draft before you submit it. 9. Contact your insurer Insurance policies require insured parties to provide prompt no tice of claims. Many employment-practices liability policies define claims to include discrimination char ges. Failing to apprise the insurer of a charge could result in denial of coverage, not only for the charge but all s ubsequent legal claims. 10. Preserve all documents Courts are increasingly imposing harsh sanctions on companies t hat fail to adequately preserve relevant evidence. When you receive an administrative charge, collect an d preserve all documents that could be relevant. You may also want to suspend any routine practices that might r esult in the destruction of relevant records, particularly electronic information like e-mails, voice mails a nd Internet usage records. Final note: Taking the charge process seriously, and defending against the allegations at this stage can increase the likelihood of a favorable determination and help prevent fu rther legal actions.

How to Wipe Out Fraud and Abuse Under FMLA published by The HR Specialist Use of the medical certification process is the biggest weapon employers have in combating potential fraud under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). It gives you the right to obtain information from the employee's physician about the medical condition and, at least for the first certification, to obtain a second or third opinion from an independent physician. Because of the strict limits on what an employer may ask an emp loyee, the following steps are important parts of an effective anti-fraud program: 1. Obtain a medical certification for each request for leave due to a serious health condition. It's important that the employer's sick leave or attendance policies require a doctor's certification for all absences of three or more days for the leave to b e excused. If there is no such r equirement and the employer intends to require paid leave to run concurrent with FMLA leave, the employer migh t not be able to require a medical certification, which is the first step in the anti-fraud progra m. 2. Enforce a policy denying the leave request if an employee fails to submit certification within 15 days. In each instance, assess any a ppropriate penalties for failure to be at work. 3. Examine the certification closely to ensure that it has been properly and fully completed. Many doctors will complete the form in a hu rried fashion. In some cases, the y'll intentionally l eave some sections incomplete in order to remain \"truthful\" while accommodating the desires of the patient/employee for leave. If you're not satisfied with an em ployee's certification, you m ay contact the employee's health care provider directly to clarify or authenticate a certification form so long as you first give the e mployee seven days to clear up any deficiencies on the form. Of course, if the medical certification does not support the ex istence of a serious health condition, the leave request should be denied. 157 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 4. Require a second opinion if the circumstances are even slightly suspicious and it is an original certification. 5. Once the certification is approved, make a limited inquiry each time the employee requests more leave, particularly in the case of inter mittent leave. The goal is to determine whether the leave is for the same qualifying reason. 6. Watch the schedule of absences closely in cases of intermittent leave to determine whether a suspicio us pattern develops (e.g., immediate ly before and after weekends or days off) or whether there is a change in the frequency or timing. Such ac tions could suggest a change in condition that enables the employer to request a recertification. Require that employees who take inte rmittent leave follow your normal call-in procedures for reporting an absence, unless there are unusual circumstances. 7. Request recertifications as often as the law allows. The frequency of recertification p ermitted will differ depending on the type of leave and the type of serious health c ondition. 8. Require accrued leave to run concurrently with FMLA leave when allowed by law. When an employee realizes that taking leave today will affect future vacation ti me, he or she is more likely to take FMLA only when the need is legitimate. 9. Ask the physician to verify that the medical certification is exactly as he or she signed it and has not been altered. 10. Inquire about the intended method of transportation if an employee requests to leave work early because of his or her own serious health condition. If the empl oyee cannot work, perhaps an ambulance is needed. 11. Aggressively pursue potential fraud and, if strong, concrete eviden ce of fraud is discovered, take appropriate disciplinary action. Always follow up on reports from fellow employees or other sources that the employee does not, in fact, need leave. Following these steps will help e liminate fraud by employees wh o are inclined to \"work\" the system. Because of the limitations placed on the employer, however, determined eff orts are unlikely to be detected. Yet even if no fraud is uncovered, your effor ts will still reap dividends. Once employees become aware tha t you intend to use these tools to detect fraud, many of those otherwise inclined to take inappropriate a dvantage of the FMLA will wait until a legitimate need arises. 25 Off-Limits Interview Questions Job interviews present a minefield of legal problems. One wrong question could spark a discrimination lawsuit. That's why you should never \"wing it\" during interviews. Instea d, create a list of interview questions and make sure every question asks for j ob-related information that will help in the selection process. Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of an applicant's race, color, n ational origin, religion, sex, age or disability. Some state laws also prohibit discrimin ation based on factors such as marital status or sexual orientation. If you ask a job applicant a question speci fically relating to one of those characteristics, you're subject to being sued. Every question you ask should somehow relate to this central th eme: \"How are you qualified to perform the job you are applying for?\" Managers usually land in trouble when they ask for information that's irrelevant to a candidate's ability to do the job. To avoid the appearance of discrimination during interviews, do not ask the following 25 questions: 1. Are you married? Divorced? 2. If you're single, are you living with anyone? 3. How old are you? 4. Do you have children? If so, how many and how old are they? 5. Do you own or rent your home? 6. What church do you attend? 158 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 7. Do you have any debts? 8. Do you belong to any social or political groups? 9. How much and what kinds o f insurance do you have? The following questions could result in an Americans with Disab ilities Act (ADA) lawsuit: 10. Do you suffer from an illness or disability? 11. Have you ever had or been treated for any of these conditions o r diseases? (followed by a checklist) 12. Have you been hospitalized? What for? 13. Have you ever been treated by a psychiatrist or psychologist? 14. Have you had a major illness recently? 15. How many days of work did you miss last year because of illness ? 16. Do you have any disabilities or impairments that might affect y our performance in this job? 17. Are you taking any prescribed drugs? 18. Have you ever been treated for d rug addiction or alcoholism? Many companies ask female applican ts questions they don't ask m ales. Not smart. Here are some questions to avoid with female applicants: 19. Do you plan to get married? 20. Do you intend to start a family? 21. What are your day care plans? 22. Are you comfortable supervising men? 23. What would you do if your hus band were transferred? 24. Do you think you could perform the job as well as a man? 25. Are you likely to take time off under the Family and Medical Le ave Act? Final point: If a job candidate reveals information that you're not allowed to ask, don't pursue the topic further. The \"she brought it up\" excuse won't fly in court, so change the subject right away.

Personal experience is inherently flawed; it rests on subjective impressions filtered through biased expectations. Officers often remember when a technique to a problem works, bu t forget the many times in which a similar approach did not work. Police Information Sources Over reliance on emotional sources: Under reliance on factual sources War stories Established procedures Personal experiences Training Rumors Research reports Fictional crime stories Case law Organizational mythology Professional journals, text books Police Subculture Corrosive influence. Emphasizes collective experience over training and procedure. Emphasizes group loyalty over duty. Built on distrust of outsiders.

Each officer must make it clear to colleagues that improper behavior will not be tolerated in his/her presence. Each officer must intervene quickly to prevent/stop improper conduct from fellow officers. Ethics and the Supervisor Too many supervisors are more in terested in being liked by officers than in holding them accountable for their behavior. Supervision is not a popularity contest. Supervisors must make expectations clear and hold subordinates accountable for their behavior. Ethics and the Middle Management Mid-level managers must clarify and solidify department expecta tions. Managers must hold supervisors accountable for the behavior of their officers. People who will/cannot supervise others must be removed from su pervision. Ethics and the Chief The chief creates the ethical climate of the department. Internal affairs is only as effective as the chief wants it to be. The chief must be fair, but abuses of authority and inappropria te conduct must be handled quickly and firmly. 168 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 10 Deadly Ethical Sins In law enforcement, we train to p revent officer deaths by remembering the \"10 Deadly Sins of Officer Safety\". However, what about our ethical safety? How do we Train Officers about ethics and the consequences for unethical behavior? Here are ten topics to start this very relevant conversation. #1: LYING No doubt about it, lying can and will get you fired. Even small lies, which seem insignificant, can evolve into something much more harmful. Do cumented lying is discoverable by defense attorneys. Officers who lie to internal affairs generally annihilate their careers. Committing perjur y in court is the kiss of deat h. Remember...if you lie, you die. Never ever lie. #2: ALCOHOL Alcohol doesn't make bad things happen, it just makes bad thing s possible. DUI/DWI will severely impact, if not kill, your career. Drinking before or on-duty puts everyone at risk. #3: STEALING PROPERTY Opportunities for theft are ever ywhere. Evidence rooms, vehicl e searches, checks of unoccupied businesses, the opp ortunities are endless. This includes stealing from \"Street People\" such as drug-dealers and gang-bangers, bas ed on the logic that it's not like we are stealing from real people. When it does occur, it is most often a felony. #4: STEALING TIME Doing personal business on-duty, non-work related Internet surfing (such as porn sites), using department cell phones for personal calls and bus iness, and generally having fun and \"screw ing off\". This comes down to be ing a theft of money, because you are being paid while not actually working. #5: MONEY Criminals and criminal organizations have lots of cash to spend. Additionally, officers often encounter large amounts of loose money related to criminal investigations they are conducting. The first time an officer accepts or steals money is a pivotal m oment in their move toward being corrupt. Don't touch money. Remember these words: \"MONEY BURNS\". 169 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] #6: CYNICISM There is no lack of cynicism in law enforcement. This is one of the most unappreciated cop killers, for it is easier to rationalize committing corruption when you feel like you have been victimized by the public and your agency. The more bitter some one is, the more likely they will self-destruct. #7: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE Studies have shown that at least 40% of law enforcement familie s experience domestic violence, while the gener al population has only a 10% rate. Charges of domestic violence, rather real or not, will severely impact your career. With the Brady Laws relating to domestic v iolence, you are done in law e nforcement because you will not be allowe d to possess a firearm. #8: INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONDUCT The big danger here is sex. It may be consensual at the time, but what is said afterward can be very different. The temptations of lust and sexual favors when they are offered (and they will be offered) will destroy career s and families. Even if the accusation is false, it still negatively impacts an offi cer's career by the doubt it causes. #9: Excessive Force (\"Smile for the camera\") The use of force by law enforceme nt officers is among the most controversial subjects we deal with. Excessive force which rises to the \"shock the conscience\" standard will e nd or severely impact your career. Attitude and anger will kill you. It is never ethical to take your anger ou t on the public. Here's the other problem: Cameras and video recorders. These are ubiquitous to every electronic device sold, particularly cellular phones. Everyone has one, and if you think you're not being recorded, y ou're wrong (Just ask the officers in the Oakland BART Station shooting). Always act as if you are being filmed, because now you likely are. #10: Text Messaging, E-mail, & Social Networking This is a new killer of careers. Sending electronic messages m ay not sound like they could be a career danger, but there are many officers who wish they had never hit \"send\" for their messages. Sexist, racial, vulgar or hate- driven remarks, photographs, and videos can demolish careers. Saying stupid things or putting \"career ending\" photos on your Face book page now gets many officers fired each year, and gets a lot more in deep trouble. 170 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Controlling Corruption Controlling Corruption High moral standards Police policies and discipline Proactive internal affairs investigations unit Uniform enforcement of the law Outside review and special prosecutors Court review and oversight The Six Pillars of Character Trustworthiness (Blue - think being \"true blue\") Be honest Don't deceive, cheat, or steal Be reliable \u2014 do w hat you say you'll do Have the courage to do the right thing Build a good reputation Be loyal \u2014 stand by your family, friends, and country Respect (Yellow - think \"The Golden Rule\") Treat others with respect; follow the Golden Rule Be tolerant and accepting of differences Use good manners, not bad language Be c onsiderate of the feelings of others Don't threaten, hit or hurt anyone Deal peacefully with anger, insults, and disagreements Responsibility (green - think being responsible for a garden or finances or being solid and reliable like an oak) Do what you are supposed to do Plan ahead Persevere: keep o n trying!

This is also relevant to an officer's ethical survival state of mind. All of the following are relevant to why misconduct and unethic al behavior occur, and how officers justify and let it occur: 1. Corruption is prevalent i n the rest of society. 2. We live in an unethical world, everyone does it. 3. Doctrine of Relative Filth- \"Sure, I'm unethical, but look how bad that guy is\" 4. Law enforcement has a history of corruption. 5. Most officers have never received ethical decision-making train ing. 6. Officers experience temporary selfishness. 7. Many officers do not have strong, ethical role models. 8. Many officers are afraid of paying the price for \"doing the rig ht thing\". 9. Officers sometimes make bad decisions. 10.

Fitch, Ph.D. \"To know the good is to do the good\" \u2014Socrates.1 Law enforcement agencies strive to recruit, hire, and train onl y those who demonstrate strong moral values before they enter the academy. Yet, even departments' best efforts will not prevent instances of police misconduct from garnering attention. Such incidents undermine p ublic trust, jeopardize important investigations, and expose agencies to considerab le liability. Many departments respond to these events by adopting formal ethics training programs that focus on character development, w hich Aristotle referred to as virtue ethics .2 Like the Socrates quote, Aristotle's philosophy teaches that as cond uct reflects officers' character and, thus, the various ways that they respond to moral dilemmas, this illustrates fundamental differences in their personal values. Virtue ethics relies on dispositional qualities, such as person ality traits, values, or attitudes, to explain deviant behavior. For example, if officers fabricate evidence to obtain search warrants, their actions reflect their dishonest character. According to this view, character predispo ses officers to act certain ways, regardless of the situation. An honest officer feels obligated to tell the truth, while a dishonest one feels inclined to steal. Similarly, a brave officer strives to act courageously, whereas a coward recoils at danger. In either case, officers possess long-term, stable dispositions, and they behave in high ly predictable ways. Unfortunately, decades of research contradict the theory that p eople differ strongly in their basic character; nearly everyone holds virtuous a t the abstract level, and most individuals endorse a similar set of high-level moral values.3 For example, studies have found that delinquent juveniles subs cribe to the same set of conceptual values as their less troubled counterparts, despite their unrul y behavior\u2014which suggests that lofty moral values often matter much less than what is commonly believed.4 Proponents of virtue ethics argue that certain officers misbeha ve because they lack character. These \"bad apples\" managed to \"slip through the cracks\" despite their unet hical values. They argue that police abuse occurs in isolated incidents and involves a few immoral opportunists w ho were corrupt before they became officers. Unfortunately, this interpretation fails to explain how otherwi se exemplary officers with no prior history of wrongdoing, many of whom are ster ling role models in their fami lies, churches, and communities, can become involved in misconduct. Certainly, officers' character, or virtue ethics, still are cru cial to their success. However, this narrow view concentrates almost exclusively on moral values and thus ignore s the situational and psychological factors that influence behavior. Mitigating the risk for officer misconduct requires a more complete understanding of human behavior and motivation. This ar ticle offers law enforcement professionals a new way to think about misconduct. This explanation emphasizes moral development, social learning, and cognitive rationalization and suggests tactics to foster a culture of ethics in any agency. \"Mitigating the risk for officer misconduct requires a more complete understanding of human behavior and motivation.\" 173 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Moral Development Before officers can behave ethi cally, they must recognize the m orals at stake in the situation, understand the principles and values involved, and choose the proper course of action.5 To explain this reasoning process, psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg proposed perhaps the most influe ntial theory of moral development. He believed that moral development proceeds along three highly pre dictable, invariant levels, termed pre- conventional, conventional, and post-conventional , with each one organized into two distinct stages.6 According to Kohlberg, at each stage, people employ increasingly sophisti cated explanations and problem-solving strategies to address moral dilemmas. At the simplest level of reasoning, the pre-conventional, exter nal consequences guide individuals' sense of right and wrong\u2014punishment in stage one and self-interest in stage tw o. At this point, they possess no internalized values or rules to guide behavior. As people progress to the conventional level, they determine ri ght and wrong based on social expectations (stage three) and the desire to maintain social order by following laws and showing respect for authority (stage four). They determine moral reasoning through conformity to social rul es, norms, and expectations. Finally, at the post-conventiona l level, people judge morality based on the desire to prot ect the basic liberties of all members of society. In sta ge five, individuals only uphold legal principles that promote fairness, justice, and equity; by stage six, they follow self-selected ethical and mor al principles that encourage respect for human life, equality, and human dignity. If these internal principles conflict with societal laws, the self-chosen principles reign supreme. While officers' stages of moral development obviously impact th eir on-the-job behavior, most adults determine proper behavior, as well as the moral implications of those actions, after they observe other group members. This especially rings true in unfamiliar or ambiguous circumsta nces, which often describes the situation of newly assigned officers. In the 1960s, Yale University ps ychologist Stanley Milgram demo nstrated how external factors influence moral judgment in a series of experiments on obedience.7 The experiment involved teams of three people: an experimenter, a \"learner,\" and a teacher (the only actual subje ct of the experiment). The experimenter instructed the teacher to quiz the learner, a confederate of the researche r, on a list of word pairs. Each time the learner answered incorrectly, the teacher administered shocks from what they thought was an electroshock generator. The learner, located in another room and hidden from view, pret ended to express increasing discomfort, even banging on the walls and remindi ng the teacher of a \"preexistin g heart condition.\" As t he shocks approached 135 volts, many of the teachers beg an to question the experimen t. Almost invariably, the subjects (teachers) looked to the experimenter for eth ical guidance. When the exper imenter instructed the teachers to persist, the majority of subjects delivered shocks to the maximum level of 4 50 volts despite the learner's desperate pleas. Milgram's findings were unsettli ng, to say the least. However, a set of follow-up experiments designed to test a second person's influence on participants' behavior yielded ver y different results. When the second \"teacher\" (another confederate of Milgram) declined to administer shocks past 210 volts, the majority of experimental subjects also refused. This result implies that the mere presen ce of a second person sufficed to motivate the subjects to \"vote their conscience\" (i.e., to follow their best judgment and stop the experiment). Despite the forecast of a group of psychiatrists who predicted that only 1 percent of subjects would administer the maximum shock of 450 volts, 2/3 of subjects (65 percent) in the original set of trials delivered the maximum shock. During the follow-up expe riments, however, when a second teacher refused to proceed past 210 volts, \"...most adults determine proper behavior, as well as the moral implications of those actions, after they observe other group members.\" 174 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] only 10 percent of the subjects continued to the maximum level of 450 volts. Milgram concluded that the presence of an authority figure (experimenter) significantly influenced the teachers' decisions to continue the shocks in the first set of experiments; however, the mere prese nce of another conscientious observer overcame those effects. Milgram's findings provide strong evidence for the theory that most people look to others for moral guidance, especially in unfamiliar situati ons. For law enforcement leader s, the lesson is clear\u2014with ethics, most officers need to be led. Additionally, the formal and informal leaders who provide this guidance play a critical role in officers' moral development and conduct. Social Learning Most officers enter law enforcem ent with minimal experience in the field or in handling the moral dilemmas that officers typically encounter. They learn how to perform their j obs, as well as recognize the organizational norms, values, and culture, from their peers and supervisors. While supervisors provide direct, formal reinforcement, officers' peers offer friendship and informal rewards that, in many cases, hold greater influence than official recognition from the agency. Also, police often s pend considerable time socializing with other officers, both on and off the job. This sense of community driv es officers to adopt the behaviors, values, and attitudes of the group in order to gain acceptance. Because behavior results from consequences, law enforcement off icers learn about acceptable and unacceptable practices through a consistent, timely, and meaningful system of reward and punishment. Officers likely will repeat behaviors that lead to reinforcing outcomes, while they rarely will duplicate behaviors that lead to punishment\u2014an occurrence referr ed to as the Law of Effect. 8 If officers receive positive reinforcement after they perform certain actions, e ven illegal ones, they likely will behave similarly in the future despite organizational policies or prohibitions. \u00a9 Thinkstock.com Officers observe how other group members receive recognition, b oth formally by the organization and informally by their peers, to learn what constitutes appropriat e behavior in a process known as vicarious learning.9 Psychologists discovered that the most effective vicarious lea rning models possess specific attributes. Competence: Most police officers take great pride in the ability to perform their duties with minimal supervision, even in demanding circumstances. Therefore, they m odel the behavior of the most competent and experienced officers. Status: Typically, officers respect those with impressive organ izational status. In law enforcement, though, an individual may hold status not within the larger age ncy, but only among an informal group or specialized unit. Informal peer leaders shape the behavior of l ess experienced officers who aspire to a similarly prominent position. Power: Those who can reward or punish an officer's performance, either formally or informally, tend to wield the most influence. Like recognition, power can be either formal or informal, and sometimes those with unofficial power hold significantly more sway than officia l organizational policies or formal supervision. These informal power networks can exacerbate unethical behavior by transmitting a set of shared values, beliefs, and norms that depart from agen cy policy. Research finds that o fficers engage in certain forms of conduct to 175 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] secure and maintain peer-group approval.10 If officers remain unsure about the legality or morality of a particular behavior, they look to the peer group for assurance, just as Milgram's subjects relied on the experimenter for ethical guidan ce. When officers engage in immo ral conduct, they often justify their actions through the values and beliefs of the peer group. Cognitive Rationalizations Regardless of external influen ces, most individuals first convince themselves of the morality of their actions. Unethical officers might employ cognitive rationalizations, men tal and linguistic strategies that sanitize or neutralize deviant behavior, to make their actions appear socia lly acceptable. Interestingly, research on white- collar crime indicates that corrupt individuals do not view the mselves as such, and they explain their behaviors as part of normal, acceptable business practices. Similar studies of law enforcement found that police officers define misconduct in very narrow terms, while citizens define i t more broadly. Officers may employ specific strategies to nullify their negative feelings or regrets about misconduct.11 Denial of victim: With this strategy, officers argue that the v iolated party deserved to be victimized. For example, an officer who steals cash from a suspected drug deale r during a search argues that the dealer holds no entitlement to the mone y because he earned it illegiti mately. Denial of responsibility: Police convince themselves that they acted improperly because no other options existed. The circumstances may involve peer pressure, a n unethical supervisor, or an environment where \"everyone else was doing it.\" These officers view themselves as victims with no real choice but to participate in the misconduct. Denial of injury: In this form of rationalization, guilty parties convince themselves that their actions did not harm anybody and, thus, were not really corrupt. For exampl e, officers might feel tempted to justify stealing profits from a drug dealer when the dealer did not rig htfully earn the money, and it would be difficult to identify an aggrieved party. Police neutralize thi s behavior by comparing their actions to the crimes of the drug dealer. Social weighting: When relying on this form of explanation, cor rupt police make selective social comparisons to justify their unethical conduct. For instance, o fficers who falsify a police report to convict a robbery suspect might m inimize their participation in the misconduct and vilify a coworker who \"lies all the time on reports.\" Moral justification: At times, people claim that they must brea k certain rules to achieve a more important goal. For example, officers may violate strict search and seizure laws to arrest a pedophile because, given the high stakes of the crime, they believe that the ends justify the means. Officers with this attitude feel that if the laws prevent them from effective ly executing their job, then they must bend the rules or make an exception to arrest a dangerous felon. Unlike other rationalizations, moral justification not only excuses deviant conduct but can actually glorify such acts in the name of justice. Officers often convince themselves that their jobs demand such actions for the \"greater good.\" In law enforcement, officers can invoke these rationalizations either prospectively (before the corrupt act) to forestall guilt and resistance or retrospectively (after the misconduct) to erase any regrets. Law enforcement leaders must remain alert to the presence of rationalization in their agency's cultur e because rationalization alters the definition of unethical conduct to make immoral beha vior seem socially acceptable. Culture of Ethics Law enforcement leaders must cre ate a culture of ethics within their agency. First, the o rganization must ascribe to a mission statement and a clear set of operating values that represent more than hollow promises, but, rather, \"...law enforcement officers learn about acceptable and unacceptable practices through a consistent, timely, and meaningful system of reward and punishment.\" 176 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] establish standards for employees' behavior at all levels and illustrate that ethics play a crucial role in an officer's success in the agency.12 If managers neglect ethics or, even worse, behave poorly thems elves, this demonstrates to officers that neither the agency nor its leader s care about proper conduct . Strong moral behavior at all levels sends officers a clear, consistent message that t he agency will not tolerate inappropriate behavior. Next, supervisors should work dili gently to reward appropriate conduct and correct inappropriate behavior.13 Because informal leaders signi ficantly impact officers' attitud es and behaviors, formal managers must confront ethical problems immediately and penalize immoral conduct quick ly and appropriately. For an effective culture of ethics, officers must observe that ethical officers advance their careers and immoral ones receive punishment. \u00a9 Photos.com Often, supervisors struggle to accept that members of their age ncy behave unethically. Even when they openly acknowledge wrongdoing, senior mana gement can blame the miscond uct on rogue officers and argue that they misrepresent the larger agency. Law enforcement leaders must ac cept the possibility of pervasive unethical conduct and quickly address such incidents. Finally, law enforcement agencies should frequently discuss eth ics in the workplace. 14 Like physical fitness, ethical fitness requires constant practice. Case studies provide an effective tool for this continual reinforcement; they allow officers to test their moral reasoning skills, discu ss their views, and share their experiences in a safe environment. Supervisors who facilitate case studies should select relevant, real-world examples that challenge officers to think critically. The facilitator should not recite a lengthy, theoretical monologue on the importance of ethics, but, rather, challenge students on key issues, promote discussi on, and examine the consequences of different actions. Depending on the topi c, the facilitator can showcase v ideo documentaries, news stories, or fictional examples. Ultimately, an honest e xchange of information and ide as stimulates moral development and proper ethical conduct. Conclusion Law enforcement officers must safeguard the public's trust to p erform their jobs effectively. Because ethical conduct greatly impacts public tru st, law enforcement agencies must closely examine their policies, reward systems, and training to ensure that their agency fosters a culture of firm ethical values. Instead of expecting that officers already possess a firmly engrained set of values (good or bad) when they enter the police force, managers must remember that all officers have the potential to act virtuously; but, when the work environment allows misbehavior either implicitly or explicitly, the potenti al for abuse skyrockets. Theognis of Megara, another ancient Greek philosopher, said, \"Fairly examined, trul y understood, no man is wholly bad, nor wholly good.\"15 Police officers are not exempt from this idea. Effective law e nforcement leaders bring out the best in their staff by ensuring that officers not only understand the r ight thing to do but actually do it. Endnotes 1 Steven M.

That's how people seem to react toward the deputies and police officers who swear to protect and serve. Last month, a Palm Springs police sergeant raced into a burning home and pulled a man to safety \u2014 and mydesert.com readers rushed to praise him. \"It truly takes a special person to be a police officer. Thank God we have them here in Palm Springs p rotecting us,\" one reader wrote . When the interrogation spotlight turns on an officer, though, t he public voices the opposite. During the last month, a trio of Coachella Valley officers has been in the news for criminal cases against them. A Desert Hot Springs police sergeant is awaiting a federal tria l on charges he abused a s uspect, and prosecutors accuse a Cathedral City police o fficer of jumping into a pool naked while on duty. Most recently, police announced an investigation into domestic abuse and kidnapping c laims against a Palm Springs police lieutenant. None of the officers have been tried yet \u2014 but many were alread y convicted in the court of public opinion. \"Just another criminal who hides behind the badge to gain the t rust of all the gullible morons who will then let him do as he pleases,\" one reader wrote on mydesert.com. \"Gut tells me this will even tually be a murder case where he beat her to death and dumped her somewhere,\" another chimed in about the Palm Springs lieutenant, hours before police found the woman he was accused of kidnappin g alive. Residents have high expectations of police officers \u2014 and right fully so \u2014 for one simple reason: They should know better. \"If anyone knows w hat the law is, you should,\" said Chris Madigan, director of the Public Safety Academy at College of the Desert . \"You should be able to preven t mishaps yourself or being involved in things that are either unethical or i llegal because that's your job. T hat's what you do every day.\" It could easily be argued that some know how to live by high va lues and others can never learn to do so. Madigan said he hopes to weed out those who cannot abide by the standards before they' re handed a badge and gun. 178 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] That's why ethics and professionalism are the foundation for each of the 42 learning topics students cover at the academy. \"You have the power to take away someone's freedom in stantly, just on your say so, and if the public doesn't trust in you in that role, you're not going to be successful,\" he said. \"It's everything we do. It's every decision we make,\" he said. Law Enforcement Ethics . . . The Continuum of Compromise Published by: The Police Chief Magazine Written by: Kevin M. Gilmartin, Ph.D. John (Jack) J. Harris, M.Ed. Police corruption is often seen as a distant problem peculiar t o \"big city cops\" or \"other departments.\" Denial and refusal to accept the potential for ethical compromise and corruption at \"our department\" prevents administrators and officers from developing an in-depth understanding and appreciation of the issues. Without a clear understanding, adequate info rmation and practical strategies, officers who are exposed to a risk-filled environment are more likely to e ngage in inappropriate behavior s that can destroy their professional and personal lives . . . as well as the reputation and credibility of their organizations. The transformation from an idealistic, highly ethical officer into a self-serving individu al who believes \"if we don't look out for ourselves who will?\" is a subtle process that usually occurs before the officers knows what has happened. For ethics training to be effective, officer s have to see the information as relevant and credible. The typical \"soap box\" approach, whether taught by inte rnal affairs, supervisors and commanders, attorneys or o thers is often seen as scolding, warning and threatening. This approach, even when the information is interesting and enlightening, is rarely internalized by the officers nor incorporated into their day-to-day activities. The Continuum of Compromise In this article, the authors explain the \"continuum of compromise' (Gilmartin & Harris, 1995). It is a frame work for understanding and teaching how the transition from \"ho nest cop\" to \"compromised officer\" can occur. Law enforcement agencies can help prepare their officers for the ethical challenges they face during their careers. However, that will requi re changing the way this topi c is approached by the organization and teaching and integrating the information throughout the organization. Officers live and work in a constantly changing and dynamically social context in which they are exposed to a myriad of ethical conflicts. When either unprepared or unaware , officers are more likely to \"go with the flow\" than they would be if they were adequately prepared to face potentially ethical risks. Everyday, officers practice mental preparation as it relates to tactical situations. Offic ers who are mentally prepared to face a lethal encounter are more likely to be successful than other officers who are tactically proficient but mentally unprepared. Just like lethal e ncounters, ethical dilemmas occu r at the most inopportune times, frequently without warning and with little time to stop and think about si tuation. When inadequate ly prepared, even the most honest, above reproach officers can make inappropriate spl it-second ethical decisions . . . decisions that can result in life-changing con sequences. If officers are goin g to survive ethical dilemmas they need to be as mentally prepared as they would be for tactical encounters. While police work is seductive and exhilarating, it can also lead officers down the path of ethical compromise. The \"continuum of compromise\" outlines the path of ethical comp romise and can be used to help officers understand and mentally prepare for the ethical dilemmas they w ill face. Understanding the issues and being mentally prepared will help officers assume responsibility for and make more appropriate decisions. Compromising behavior has to be seen as something that can pote ntially affect all law enforcement officers . . . not just those in \"corruption ri ch\" environments. Officers who view compromise or corruption as an \"all or none\" phenomenon will not see themselves as \"at risk.\" When th e potential for compromise is not recognized, officers will see compromise as an unlikely event, training wil l be viewed as a waste of time and officers will 179 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] not become mentally prepared. Understanding the continuum of c ompromise will allow officers to recognize the risks, assess their own potential for compromise and develo p an effective strategy to ensure ethical integrity. When teaching ethics the goal must be to develop an understandi ng of the progression towards compromise and the development of self-monitori ng strategies to prevent becoming embroiled in compromising events. The Continuum of Compromise A Perceived Sense of Victimization can lead to the Rationalizat ion & Justification of: Acts of Omission Acts of Commission - Administrative Act of Commission - Criminal Entitlement versus Accountability Loyalty versus Integrity Officers frequently develop a pe rceived sense of victimization over time. Officers typically begin their careers as enthusiastic, highly motivated people. However, when these young officers over-invest in and over-identify with their professional role they will develop a sense of singu lar-identity based on their job and an increased sense of victimization. At greatest risk are officers whose jobs literally become their lives. For them, \"I am a cop.\" is not just a clich\u00e9 but r ather a way of life. Over-iden tification and over-investment causes people to link their sense of self to their police role . . . a role they do n ot control. While this builds camaraderie, it can also cause officers to eventually hate and resent the job they once loved. While officers have absolute control over their own integrity a nd professionalism, the rest of their police role is controlled by someone else. Dep artment rules, procedures, poli cies, equipment, budget allocations, assignments, dress codes, and many other day-to-day and long-te rm activities are controlled by the chief, commanders, supervisors, prosecuti ng attorneys, the criminal justice system, laws, the c ourts, politicians, etc. Officers who over-identify with the job soon experience a loss of control over other aspects of their lives. Professional over-investment, coupled with a loss of personal control puts officers at ser ious risk . . . a risk, that in some ways is more dangerous t han the physical risks they fac e on the street. \"I t doesn't matter how guilty you are, but how slick your lawyer is,\" can become the officers cynical yet reality-based perception of the legal system. These realities combine with over-investment to develo p an \"Us versus them\" perception in terms of how officers see the world. The physical risks that officers are exposed to each day requir e them to see the world as potentially lethal. To survive, they have to develop a \"hypervigilant\" (Gilmartin, 198 4) mind-set. Hypervigilance coupled with over- investment leads officers to believe the only person you can re ally trust is another cop . . . a \"real cop\" that is, not some \"pencil-neck in the administration.\" While officers first become alienated from the public, they can soon distance themselves from the criminal justice system and finally from their own department administration. \"I can handle the morons on the street, I just can't handle the morons in the administration,\" is often heard among officers. It is ironic how quickly idealism and trust in the administration can change . . . often times even before the first set of uniforms wears out. As a sense of perce ived victimization intensifies, officers become more distrusting and resentful of anyone who controls their job role. At this point, without any conscious awareness and certainly without any unethical intent, unsuspecting officers can begin a journey down the continuum of compromise. As the over-invested officer det aches from non-work related int erests or activities, a perceived sense of victimization will increase. Peer groups, friends, co-workers and potentially their entire frame of reference of life begins to change. By itself, feeling like a victim is by n o means equivalent to being ethically compromised. However, feeling like a victim (whether real or imagined) is th e first stop on the continuum of compromise. 180 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Acts of Omission When officers (or anyone for that matter) feel victimized, in t heir own mind they can rationalize and justify behaviors they may not normally engage in. \"Acts of Omission\" o ccur when officers rationalize and justify not doing things they are responsible for doing. At this point, officers can feel quite justified in not doing things that, from their own perspective, app ear to \"even the score.\" \"If the y (whomever it may be) don't care about us, why should we care about them.\" Acts of omission can include select ive non-productivity (ignoring traffic violations or certain criminal violations , etc.), \"not seeing\" or avoiding on-sight activity, superficial investigations, omitting paperwork, lack of follo w up, doing enough to just \"ge t by\" and many other activities which officers can easily omit. \"You will never get in trouble for the stop yo u don't make!\" typifies the mind-set of officers during this stage. This results in decreased productivity and produces passive resistance to organizational mandates. \"Acts of Omission\" rarely face critical scrutiny from peers who themselv es are frequently experiencing the same sense of victimization and socialization process. Peer acceptance and lo yalty become more important than following some arbitrary set of professional principles. The perceived sense of being victimized can allow officers to rationalize and justify other acts of omission such as not repo rting another officer's inappropriate behavior (sometimes regardless of how extreme or criminal the behavior m ay be). Acts of Commission - Administrative Once officers routinely omit job responsibilities, the journey to the next step is not a difficult one to make . . . \"Acts of Commission - Administra tive.\" Instead of just omitting duties and responsibilities, officers commit administrative violations. Breaking small rules, that seem inco nsequential or which stand in the way of \"real police work\" is the first step. This can set the stage for cont inued progression down t he continuum. Acts of administrative commission are seen in many ways . . . carrying unauthorized equipment and/or weapons, engaging in prohibited pursuits and other activities, drinking on duty, romantic interludes at work, not reporting accidents and firing warning shots are just a few examples. Dep artment sanctions are typically the only risk that officers will face at this point. For most officers this is the extent of their personal journey down the continuum of compromise. Acts of omission and acts of administrative commission are significant in terms of professional accountability and personal integrity. When discovered, they ca n erode community trust and damage police/community relations. Howev er, they rarely place officers at risk for criminal prosecution. The initially honest and highly motivated officer s can now rationalize their behavior along the lines of \"I'm not a naive rookie out trying to change the world . . . I know what it's really like on the streets and we (the police) have to look out for each other because no one else will.\" Acts of Commission - Criminal Unsuspecting officers can unwittingly travel to the next and final stage of the continuum . . . \"Acts of Commission - Criminal.\" In the final stage on the continuum of compromise officers engage in and rationalize behavior that just a few years before could not be imagined. At first, acts of criminal commission may appear benign and not terribly different from acts of administrative c ommission. Evidence that w ill never be of any use is thrown away instead of being turned in, overtime or payroll records are embellished, needed police equipment is inappropriately purchased with money seized from a drug deal er, expecting \"a little something in the envelope\" when the officers drop by are but a few examples that officers have easily rationalized. \"What the hell, we put our lives on the line and they owe us\". A gun not turned into evidence and kept by the officer can become \"it's just a doper's gun anyway and would probably be us ed to kill some innocent person or even a cop.\" Theft and misappropriation of seized assets is a problem, but i t's not \"like real theft where there is a real victim, nobody is getting hurt but the dopers, what's the big deal?\" Th e \"Loyalty versus Integrity\" dilemma can permit criminal actions to develop into conspiracies . . . whether oth er officers are actively involved or passively remain loyal and accept what takes place. 181 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Now, the risks are far beyond ju st administrative reprimands or suspension . . . officers' face being fired and criminal sanctions when they are caught. The initially honest, dedicated, above reproach officers now ask, \"Where did it all go wrong,\" \"how did this happen\" as they face the realities of personal and professional devastation and criminal prosecution. Officers who reach the fi nal stage did not wake up one day and take a quantum leap from being honest hard working officers to crimina l defendants. Entitlement versus Accountability Officers can develop an overwhelming sense of victimization and an intense resentment toward the supervisors and administrators who control their job-role. This can lead to another dilemma . . . a sense of entitlement. Entitlement is a mindset that suggests \"we stick together\" and \"we deserve special treatment.\" The off-duty officer who is driving 30 mph over the speed limit and weaving in and out of traffic who tells his passenger, a concerned co-worker, \"Relax, I have Mastershield!\" implies a se nse of entitlement and feeling of impunity. Entitlement allows both on and o ff duty officers to operate wit h the belief that many of the rules don't apply to them. \"Professional courtesy\" goes far beyond just giving anoth er officer a break on a traffic violation. Officers are constantly faced with the dilemma of \"doing the right thing \" or \"doing what they know is right.\" The only way to change this sense of entitlement is to foster an environ ment of accountability . . . both organizational and personal accountability. Loyalty versus Integrity Most officers want to be known as loyal and a man or woman of i ntegrity. A problem occurs, however, when a sense of victimization and over-identification with the job sets into motion the dile mma of \"loyalty versus integrity\" (Mollen Commission, 1994). Here is where officers ca lled in to Internal Affairs and asked questions about another officer lie, many times about a minor issue. When this occurs, the officer has traded his/her integrity for \"loyalty\" to a fellow officer. Unfortunately, law enforcement agencies across the country can give many examples of \"innocent\" officers not telling the truth in a n attempt to protect a partner or co-worker, only to find themselves facing serious or career ending discipline. Early exposure to such statements as \"How will the department find out about it if w e all hang together?\" \"Cops don't snitch on other cops\" can help foster the \"loyalty v. integrity\" dilemma t hat officers will likely face during the course of their careers. What Can Be Done? When officers are ill-prepared t o face the ethical dilemmas to which they will be exposed and unaware of the continuum of compromise, they can blindly and over a period of time allow mild job frustration to develop into pathological anger and rage . . . leading to devastating conseq uences. This progression is clearly predictable and is often preventable. The time and resources spent preventing e thical compromise through credible instruction and proactive supervision is infinitely smaller than what it ta kes to conduct internal and criminal investigations, convene investigative commissions or restore community trust and repair police/community relations. If law enforcement agencies are going to foster an atmosphere of unreproachable ethics, they must implement a comprehensive strategy throughout the agency. Officers have to be aware of and accept the \"Continuum of Compromise\" as a potential reality that can affect all members of the agency. They must learn skills to help them change the \"Victim Perception\" and internalize a \"Survivor Mentality.\" Teaching officers to appreciate and understand the difference between what they do and do not contr ol is essential for creating ethically sound officers. Strategies for accepting the fact that officers do no t control their police role, but do have absolute control over their integrity and professionalism have to taught and practiced. While the ultimate responsibility for behaving in an ethical manner lies with the individual officer, management shares some responsibilities. Supervisors have to recognize and proactively address potential ethical violations before major problems develop. Supervisory acts of omission occur frequently. Not taking care of the \"little things\" can ultimately be devast ating to individual officers and organizations as well. Supervisors need practical 182 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] skills, a willingness to use these sk ills and they have to be held accountable for fulfilling their responsibilities. Supervisors, commanders and chief executive officers have to appreciate their own vulnerabilities and the mixed messages they sometimes send. They do not have the luxury of simply talking about ethics . . . they have to \"walk the talk\" and be day-to-da y role models. Unethical behavi or by supervisory and command personnel only models unethical behavior and sends the message, \"Do as I say, not as I do.\" Is an executive-level officer who registers at a police conference (at taxpayer expense) and play s golf instead of attending the conference any less unethical than the line officer who is unavailable for calls be cause he/she is conducting personal business on duty? Politics, organizational history or institutional traditions should never be used to rationalize or justify unethical behavior. As long as wh at goes on in the department is inconsistent with what is being taught, any ethical training program will be nothing more than lip service and a waste of valuable time and resources. The \"continuum of compromise\" can be found at all levels of an organization. Ethics training and a commitment to the highest level of professional and personal integrity app ly to all members and ha ve to be consistently demonstrated throughout the department. If law enforcement is t o enjoy, maintain and in some jurisdictions regain the status of a respected profession in our society, it has to change the way it approaches integrity and ethical issues. A sincere organizational commitment and meaning ful training has to focus on preventing small incidents from developing into m ajor situations with potentiall y devastating consequences. Despite the headline stories, law enforcement organizations can regain lost trust, improve police/community relations, protect the reputations of good, hardworking and eth ical law enforcement professionals and help prevent officers from destroying their professional careers and personal lives. Ethics training can no longer be seen as window dressing that mak es good press after an embarras sing incident hits the front page. The topics of ethics, integrity, compromise and corruption have to become as important as other critical areas of law enforcement training if signifi cant changes can occur. By making a serious commitment and taking a proactive role, organizations can look forward to spending less time inve stigating, disciplining and prosecuting officers for unethical or criminal behaviors. Training to Think with Sgt. Steve \"Pappy\" Papenfuhs Ethical dilemmas cops face daily The impact of human factors upon individual performance must coincide with timely and fair discipline \u2014 both in a positive and a negative sense In February of 2011, the commander of a drug task force and a private investigator were arrested by federal agents on allegations that they conspired to sell drugs (Solanga & Fraley, 2011). An officer in the Seattle Police Department resigned after learning that his department intended to terminate his employment after a controversia l police shooting that was partially captured on the officer's dash-cam (McNerthney & Pulkkinen, 2011). A Dallas police officer was fired after a video surfaced that s howed him kicking a handcuffed prisoner in the face (Mitchell, 2011). In Baltimore, 10 officers were arrested on corruption charges w hen they were found to have taken kickbacks for steering motorists to a tow yard that was not licensed to do bu siness with the city (Fenten & Calvert, 2011). In Quebec, Canada two patrol officers were caught sleeping on t he job by a citizen armed with a cell phone camera (Arsenault, 2011). The investigations of these even ts are ongoing and the outcomes yet unknown, however these controversial incidents are highly publicized and can lead to the public's di strust of public safety professionals. Law enforcement professionals are not immune from feelings of mistrust. Often these fact-based emotions are directed towards their very own employers. When promotional exa ms are based upon race rather than upon merit \u2014 as the United States Supreme Court determined in the ca se of the New Haven, Connecticut Fire 183 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Department's 2003 promotional exam (Liptak, 2009) \u2014 public safe ty is compromised both by the presence of less-than-competent personnel in positions of authority, and be cause of a decrease in the morale of the line-staff. Safety-critical professions dema nd that their personnel functio n continuously at a high le vel of performance, and with a high degree of inter personal trust among cohorts. In public service, those cohorts i nclude the members of the pub lic at large. All of the situations mentioned above produce an ethical dilemm a across all ranks of the respective departments. An ethical dilemma is: 1.) a situation in which the officer did not know what the right co urse of action was, or 2.) a situation in which the course of action the officer considere d right was difficult to do, or 3.) a situation in which the wrong course of action was very tempti ng (Braswell, McCarthy B.R., and McCarthy, B.J. 2002). Strategies to Mitigate the Ethical Breaches Once one understands how ethical dilemmas are framed in this co ntext, it then becomes possible to formulate strategies to eradicate or at least mitigate the ethical breach es of behavior performed by those within the public safety sectors. Remedies to lapses of ethical beh avior on the part of police officers begin first with the selection and hiring of qualified individuals. Department heads should no longer actively find \"work-arounds\" of minimum hiring standards in order to recruit a member of a special interest group- no matter what Attorney General Eric Holder recently indicated with regard to Dayton, Ohio Police Departmen t. No agency should ever again be found in the position that the Los Angeles Police Department found itself wh en they had recruits working the streets and their background checks had yet to be completed. The Next Step is Ethics Training Leadership, professionalism, and ethics is considered so critic al to the California Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) that it is the very first learnin g domain presented to new recruits in police academies. But learning is not a one-time event. Rather it is a continuous process of review and reinforcement. Therefore, ethics training should continue throughout an office r's career. This training should be both formal and presented in a structured format, as well as informally presented in settings such as briefings and team meetings. In addition to particip ating in the ethics training r eceived by those at the officer rank, first line supervisors and middle management should also receive training in the investigation of ethical breaches. But no amount of training is suffi cient if department leadershi p fails to set an \"ethical-leadership\" example. Upper management needs to understand the influences they have o n those in their command through the decisions they make. Decisions s uch as policy development, disc ipline, and promotions must inculcate a \"just- culture\" within the organization. Make Ethics Training Real Ethical training must be feature-intensive (Sharps, 2010) and m ust address rather than ignore the human emotions involved. For instan ce, in the case of the Dallas offi cer who kicked the prone and handcuffed suspect, it is reasonable to understand that the officer was emotionally charged. Human beings do not have an emotional \"on-off\" switch. The \"chemical c ocktails\" that are delivered into the system during a fight or flight response do not suddenly and magically disappear once a physical altercatio n is over. Rather than simply telling an officer that he needs to control his use of force, feature-intensive training would include explaining to an officer that, \"You are going to be adr enalized, you are going to feel the physical effects of that adrenaline, you may very well feel a need to continue to strike the suspect, that need may even persist after the suspect is handcuffed. It is completely normal and ac ceptable to feel that way, but when the time 184 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] comes, you must recognize the feelings for what they are \u2014 phys ical and emotional responses to the chemicals in your system \u2014 and you need to breathe and re-engage you higher thinking brain and process the situation.\" By presenting this information at this level of comprehension, you are educating and preparing the officer for the inevitable and predictable realities he or she will face on e day during his or her career. Additionally, from an ethical standpoint the leaders of the agency are recognizing th e human factors involved rather than succumbing to the belief that an officer i s an automaton; and subsequently failing to provide the n ecessary preparation in order for their personnel to perform at their best. With an und erstanding of these human dimensions, agency managers are in a better position to identify and explain their officer's performance to a citizenry uneducated in the realities of force encounters between law enforcement offic ers and criminal subjects. Once a programmed model of ethics training has been instituted, a process of disciplin e can be established. While many consider \"discipline\" to have a completely negative connotation, discipline can in fact have positive attributes. Correct behavior should be reinforced, while negati ve behavior should be promptly yet fairly rebuked. For instance, using the Dallas officer's alleged exces sive force as an example, the officer's on-scene partners first attempted to intervene in his inappropriate beha vior. After being restrained and pushed away from the handcuffed suspect by his partners, the officer returned to the suspect, sprayed him with OC spray, and kicked him in the head. The par tner officers then reported what they believed to be excessive force to their superiors. While the known outcome of this event was the firing of the subject officer, one would hope that the reporting officers were commended by the executive staff of the agency as an example of the high ethical standards expected of all pers onnel. By doing so, the management reinforces the ethical culture of the agency. Seeing the Big Picture In order to maintain a just culture with fairness, respect, and integrity, agency heads must understand the impact of their every decision. Shift-work is a reality in police work . While many officers by necessity work while most of society sleeps, those same officers are often required to at tend to business related activities during normal waking hours. Some of those activities include: court attendanc e, training, and atte ndance at mandatory meetings. This invasive adjustment of sleep hours can lead to e xcessive fatigue; and in the public safety world, fatigue can kill. According to the Force Science Research Cente r (FSRC), Dr. Bryn Vila believes that with appropriate shift scheduling, s hift lengths, and controlled napping, high-liability events s uch as traffic accidents can be reduced (Vila, 2011). There fore, rather than default to a position that any officer who falls asleep on duty is shirking his duties and should be reprimanded, the progressi ve executive officer can proactively plan sleep deprivation countermeasures a nd should support his personnel by enlightening the community about the preemptive measures he has taken to best ensure public safety. Chief executives should honestly pla n for the future of the department. This means scrupulously abiding by merit-based promotions rather than advancing the careers of ind ividuals that will favor special interest groups, thus advancing the career of the chief himself. Other than covering up for the criminal activity of another, there is no greater breach of ethics on the part of executive staff t han the promotion of the less capable employee for purely selfish reasons. Promoting less-than competent personnel in order to fulfill some stated or imaginary \"quota\" is an ethical violation that will one day lead to disas trous consequences \u2014 in fact, many will say it has already. A supervisor or middle-manager who has been appointed to a position of leadership based upon political concerns or because of a close relationship with exec utive staff rather than upon competence places the lives of officers and civilians i n jeopardy. In fact, a common axiom among senior sergeants and officers is, \"Let's get this call handled before the lieutenant arrives and screw s this whole thing up.\" It would be humorous if there was not more than a little truth to this adage. Beyo nd the catastrophic concerns \u2014 such as the potential loss of life \u2014 are the more mundane personnel issues that these very same less-than competent managers are often una ble to resolve. Maintaining high ethical standards within the workplace and between employees is an admi nistrative function with which management is charged. Failure to address petty squabbles, animosities, and vindictive employees is a failure of leadership. If a 185 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] leader does not have the courag e to address these trivial issue s, how then can he or she be counted on to make critical decisions in life-or-death situations? In order to eradicate many of the ethical dilemmas faced by pub lic safety professionals, leadership must be service-centered. The impact of human factors upon individual p erformance must coincide with timely and fair discipline \u2014 both in a positive and a negative sense. Chief Officers must reach out to all members of the community and, while keeping in mind that there will always be a political component to operating a police department, the leadership must make it clear that they also se rve another constituency- that is, the sworn officers themselves. Finally, tho se that are promoted within a police department must be promoted based upon merit and must have demonstrated the requisite courage to make the tough decisions in both critical and mundane situations.

Schafer, Associate Professor, Center for the Study of Crime, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois This article reviews highlights of the advances of professional policing in recent decades and illuminates the obstacles that continue to preven t the image of police from becoming more positive. Also included is a discussion of the future of police ethics, including pre-servic e behavior standards, evolving forms of off-duty behavior that might be problematic for police agencies, the rol e technology may play in preserving a healthy police image, and the future o f accountability to citizens and communities. Pre-service Behavior Standards Questions and debate surrounding th e regulation of pre-service behavior are not new . The use of alcohol, and especially underage drinking, by candidates is a long-standing issue. Contemporary manifestations of the behavior standard discussion now center on issues such as youth ful experimentation with controlled substances as well as digital and online behavior. In a time of dwindling applicant pools and high employee attrition, some agencies have questioned whether conventional zero-tolerance stances are feasible and responsible. Agencies currently struggle with the question of whether pre-se rvice experimental use of controlled substances should disqualify an applicant. Does such use reflect poor char acter or judgment, suggesting that an applicant is ill suited for police work? Does it suggest that the applicant might have credibility issues when testifying in court? If some drug use is allowed, what are the parameters on the type of drugs, the frequency of use, and the time lapse since the last use?1 With the rise of computer and network technology comes the need for candidate accountability for digital and online behavior. Would it be appr opriate to refuse employment t o an otherwise exemplary candidate who downloaded audio, video, or other computer files without proper purchase or permission? Does an applicant who made an illegal copy of a co llege roommate's CD have serious flaws in judgment and character? Does the response to these questions differ depending on the position fo r which a candidate is applying\u2014for example, a local patrol officer position versus a federal special agent position? As with controlled substances and underage consumption of alcohol, the debate focuses on the parameters of acceptable digital and online conduct. Social-networking sites on the Internet provide people with a p ortal for connecting with others, sharing information and the opportunity to express their creativity. To day, many future police officers make extensive use of online profiles, photographs, videos, and blogs. Departm ents have found these sites to be rich in information for evaluating candidates and therefore mine data f rom these sites during background checks. It has been found that users of the networking sites often feel uninhi bited online and express themselves in manners different from how they behave i n person. In addition, some use rs even create false profiles of themselves. Confronted with this new source of personal information about c andidates, agencies need to decide on acceptable parameters of creativity expressed on personal Web s ites. Agencies certainly seek to hire candidates of integrity, whose character and conduct will not be assailed on the witness stand. At the same time , those preparing to enter police work may have different views and values about their behavior than their potential employers.2 At present, it is not clear whe ther an occasional \"music pirat e\" will make a poor or non-credible police officer. Executives would be well advised to cons ult with local human- resources experts to understand how and even whether to account for such behaviors in the screening process. Digital Technologies and Off-Duty Behavior Besides raising concerns at the pre-employment screening phase, digital technologies create new opportunities for existing personnel to engage in off-duty conduct that may be lawful but may still promote a negative image of their agency. Recent years ha ve produced many instances wher e officers of various ranks and their families have been discovered in compromis ing or morally questionable on line behavior. Online conduct that is sexually overt or morally questionable or that demonstrates bias or poor judgment can be a real problem for agencies. 187 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] How should agencies handle officers using eBay to sell images of themselves masturbating?3 What about officers posting pictures of themselves engaging in group sexua l relations? Are there parameters on what officers can post on their blog or personal page at a social-ne tworking site? Arbitration procedures and the courts are constantly shaping the parameters of protected and p unishable behaviors. Police departments must keep themselves updated on these rulings. The moral and legal parameters governing off-duty behavior exem plify the notion of a gray area for a standard of conduct. Currently there is limited information available to guide agencies and executives in setting appropriate and lawful parameter s in the personal use of modern technology. As the volume of relevant incidents increases with time, policies and procedures to assis t executives in handling these incidents will need to be prepared. Poor handling of these matters may actually com pound the problem by bringing media attention and public scrutiny to the agency. Executives considering actio n against an officer should seek the advice of their agency's legal counsel to ensure that their actions are w ithin the boundaries of the law. Technology and the Police Image In the last decade, in-car video camera systems have become bot h a tool for law enforcement (e.g., recorded evidence of field sobriety testing) as well as a means of ensur ing police transparency. The audio and video images provided by these systems have allowed countless officer s to rebut false claims of abuse and inappropriate conduct.4 Video-recording capabilities are diversifying rapidly. Many cel lular telephones now incorporate low-resolution recording devices. These first-generation devices are small in size, have limited quality, and may not include audio recording, and they can usually capture video for only a short period of time before reaching the system's memory capacity. However, as technologies expand into second an d third generations, significant improvements are typical. This means that in the next decade agencies will likely deploy small, high-quality wearable video- recording devices in the field with officers. The military is a lready using expensive and somewhat cumbersome systems in combat zones. It is only a matter of time before improved, streamlined, and c ost-effective systems can accompany officers on patrol. These devices will be able to record every interaction officers have with citizens, creating evidence supporting officers when they perform their duties in an approp riate manner. Averting just a few lawsuits could offset the expense of such a system. But would the culture of a given police agency embrace this technology? At times, officers have resisted in-car systems because of the fee ling they create that Big Brother is watching. Although these systems can provide evidence that officers are p erforming their duties in an appropriate manner, their presence also carries an implicit assumption that officer s might not behave in a lawful and respectful manner. Reasonable people can di sagree on whether an agency should compel its professional officers to be recorded during the course of the ir duties. In agencies where they are able to speak for officers, labor organizations likely have views on the use of such devices. Beyond audio and video recordi ng, other technologies are enhanc ing the level of transparency within police operations. Some departmental Web sites allow citizens to map r ecent crimes in their neighborhood.5 Computer systems and expanded telephone/ voicemail networks (for both entire agencies and specific officers in an agency) make an organization more open and improve access to em ployees. At the same time, the expansion of inexpensive, handheld video- recording technology in the hands of citizens has also enhanced the transpare ncy of policing, although citizens have used these devices mostly to highlight cases where officers have overstepped their rights in effecting arrests. Proper use of audio, video, and Web-based information systems can help to create an image of police officers and agencies as open, honest, and accessible. Agencies should c ontinue to work with technology manufacturers to develop new tools and applications that will both preserve t he integrity of policing and enhance the image of police professionalism. 188 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Accountability Regrettably, there are daily re ports of officers and agencies t hat have allegedly violated their oath and duty to the community they serve. While many of these allegations will ultimately be found frivolous, others illustrate failures in ethics and accountability systems. The volume of na tional news on this matter obscures the tremendous advances the police profession has made in recent de cades. Although each contemporary misdeed still provides cause for concern, it is important to recognize the achievements in improving officer professionalism and agency account ability. Unfortunate incident s do occur, but policing has succeeded in laying the foundation for a strong and pervasive culture of integrity. The remaining question is how to improve street- level police operations. Although accountability mechanisms, hi gher educational standards, and ethics awareness training are all laudabl e steps, do they suffice to bring about a fundamental improvement in the routine behaviors of police officers on the street?6 Agencies must embrace the devel opment of new technological applications not only to enhance officer safety and improve the success of prosecution efforts, but also to allow citizens to better unders tand crime and policing in their community. Police execu tives need to provide effective leadership to ensure a culture of true integrity and accountability in their agency. Those who design ethics tra ining and other educational seminars must seek out ways to move beyond simply telling officers to do the right thing; ethics training should ideally empower officers to anticipate the complex moral choices they must make , sometimes in a matte r of seconds. Agencies must continue to reinforce the notion that officers and agencie s serve the public; this service includes an element of transparency and accountability. Plan for the Realities of Tomorrow For decades, police agencies have struggled to generate and sustain a positive police image and an ethical organizational environment. Num erous advances have been realized, but the process continues. Police officials and community leaders must continue their dialogue in the searc h for ways to strengthen their organization's culture of integrity. In looking toward the future, police exec utives should consider how technological and social change creates both new challe nges and new opportunities. Shifting social values and behaviors mean different prior experiences that prospectiv e employees bring to an agency . These values, coupled with emerging technologies, also modify how some officers will express themse lves when off duty. Professional organizations must begin to explore the legal and ethical parameters of pre-s ervice and off-duty behavior, with the goal of providing executives with a better understanding of the rights of employees and agencies. Technological and social changes also represent an important opportunity for agencies to enhance their image and improve their ethics. Technological applications provide ne w ways to monitor officer conduct, which has the potential to enhance officer safety, improve offender prose cution, and protect officers from frivolous complaints and lawsuits. At the same time, however, these benef its can be offset by po tential opposition from officers and labor associations that view these technologies as invasive and unnecessary. Agencies now have increasing oppor tunities to provide transpare ncy in various aspects of their operations. Transparency enhances accountability and can improve the overal l image of an agency, yet it can also provide critics with ammunition to make distorted claims. Police execut ives must understand both the opportunities and difficulties presented by technological and social change. The implications of these developments may vary from agency to agency, but the k ey for all police executives is to plan today for the realities of tomorrow. Notes: 1See William J.

Principles & Values By Bob Vernon | From the October 2011 Issue of Law Officer Maga zine Great organizations, from the top to the bottom, benefit from p rinciple-based leaders There are, in my opinion, six b asic essentials of leadership: 1 ) provide clear direction, 2) develop a team spirit, 3) ensure continuing developmen t/improvement of staff, 4) culti vate shared principles and values, 5) promote open communication, and 6) establish controls to ensure executi on. In this article, I will address the topic of cultivating principles and values , perhaps the most important a spect of them all. Why is the ability to cultivate p rinciples and values so import ant? Because it's what separates great organizations from good ones. It's difficult to explain how thi s is done, but it's worth the effort it takes to comprehend. The ability to cultivate principles and values is precisely what makes some leaders so powerful in their ability to influence and persuade others. This article isn't intended to describe a formula or lock-step process. Rather, it's meant to explain the intangible, sometimes illusive reason that causes some organizations to ris e to greatness. Many great leaders don't consciously think about this format or these terms. They just d o what comes naturally. They have an intuitive gift for effective leadership. For the rest of us, this can be a very important insight. Recognition & Reward When I was a two-star chief over one quarter of the city of Los Angeles, I conducted a strategic planning process with all division commanders (five area stations and on e traffic division). We decided to focus our attention on five outcomes: 1) reduce the repressible crime rat e, 2) reduce the rate of in jury traffic collisions, 3) reduce the response time for 911 emergency calls for service, 4 ) increase the detective clearance rate (crimes solved), and 5) reduce the rate of outside-initiated personnel complaints. At an implementation planning m eeting with the commanders, I an nounced what I thought would be a great program. I would purchase a trophy. We'd award the trophy each quarter to the station that was the most successful in achieving our five goals. It would be a perpetual trophy that would be displayed in the lobby of the police station that earned it that quarter. The trophy would be engraved with the name of the area station and the dates (quarter) of this achievement. This recognition strategy, based on the important leadership principle of recognition, would inject some friendly competition into the mi x and focus everyone's attention on the goals. In my mind, it was a done deal. 190 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] I was very disappointed when several of the station commanders opposed my \"brilliant\" plan. They explained that few officers ever went into the lobby of their station. Th ose coming into the lobby were victims, bail bondsmen or complainants, all of w hom wouldn't be interested in the trophy. However, the commanders underst ood the principle of recognition, and they graciously offered an alternative. Design and purchase a flag, they said. The flag would be a fiel d of midnight blue with a silver \"No. 1\" (LAPD colors) thereon. We'd fly this flag over the station that won t he honor for the quarter, under the U.S. and California flags. I was convinced, and accepted their proposal. Bottom line: It was a great success and a matter of pride and honor, and officers enjoyed explaining the flag to the many who asked about it. This experience taught me an important lesson. When a leadershi p team has shared princi ples and values, their combined wisdom will exceed the s um of their individual abiliti es and insights. Effective leaders recognize the importance of establishing a foundation that supports their leadership. They understand that the structure, s taffing, policies, procedures a nd even the operational tactics they set up or endorse should be based upon logi c and reason. Logic and reason are the foundation of the Below 100 initiative (www.Below100.com ). For example, the first of the mandates \"Wear your belt\" is based upon hard data: Traffic collisions were the leading cause of officer fatalities in 2010 . For the last three decades, 42% of officers killed in traffic collisions weren't weari ng a seatbelt. There's no argui ng with the factual importance then of wearing your seatbelt. So how do you take a concept like Below 100 and bring it to your organization so that they embrace it? I believe that building a strong foundation for your leadership begins with identifying a few basic principles. Upon these principles policies are developed. Strategies are th en formed to move the policies toward implementation. Finally, tactics or procedures are created and practiced to put the strategies into action. Some practitioners refer to this syste m as \"Principle-Based Leadership.\" Principle-Based Leadership Tactics Tactics Tactics Tac tics Tactics Tactics Tactics Strategy Strategy Strategy Strategy Strategy Strategy Policy Policy Policy Policy Policy PRINCIPLE Foundation to Actions Principles Because principles are broad statements of truth, they never ch ange. Principles explain reality and give logic to leadership. Most organizations are founded on several principle s. Much of the American police ideology and practices find their origins in nine principles identified with Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850) and the London Metropolitan Police. One of those principles states: \"...the powe r of the police to fulfill their functions and duties is dependent on public a pproval of their existence, acti ons and behavior and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect.\" This is a broad statement of truth that's still relevant today . When a police department secures the respect and approval of the public they serve, they're empowered with suppo rt and cooperation. Another principle of Peel states: \"The true effectiveness of a police agency is the preve ntion and reduction of criminal behavior rather than the measurement of police activities such as arrests and/or investigations.\" Principles, such as those illu strated here, form a foundation upon which all of the other components of your leadership can be based. Principl es answer the \"why\" questions. In the case of Below 100, the principle is to reduce unnecessary police deaths. \"Why are we doing this?\" \"Why should we use this strategy?\" \"Why do we 191 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] have this policy?\" \"Why are we measuring these events or rate s?\" The answer: To save lives and improve officer safety. Policies Policies are intended to give gui dance. They help focus attenti on on preferred actions from several alternatives. They're usually statements of intent to apply a principle. Poli cies differ from rules or procedures in that they're broader in scope. They give som e latitude in how goals and obje ctives are accomplished. They point the members of the organization in the right direction. They offer support and approval that still allows followers to exercise their initiative. The so-called Peelian principle about public approval described above begs a policy that encourages a partnership and communication with the community served. Such a policy could read: \"It's our policy to pursue the philosophy of community-oriented policing. Officers should take appropriate action to establish open lines of communication with all segment s of our community and work wi th them in developing strategies to achieve our mission.\" Note: This statement gives direction, but, at the same time, encoura ges creativity and some flexibility. It moves the principle of community appr oval toward a reality without li miting the options that can be developed. Other policy statements that would supp ort the principle of public ap proval could address pres s relations, personnel complaints, organizational transp arency and other similar issue s. Field operations should also be gui ded by statements of policy, based upon principles. Example: A vehicle pursuit policy that minimizes risk to officers and community me mbers will also support the principle of securing public confidence. Sample: \"When the risk to the officer a nd/or the community exceeds the benefits of apprehending the violator (cons idering road conditions, speed, presence of pedestrians, possibility of future apprehension, nature of the violation) the vehicle pursuit shou ld be terminated.\" This policy statement gives guidance, but also allows discretion. Strategies Strategies are the means to offe r maximum support for adopted p olicies. Strategies are well thought out plans or methods to pursue goals and objectives articulated by policy. T he policy of adopting the philosophy of community-oriented policing can lead to developing the strategi es of problem-oriented policing vs. reactive policing, career criminal focus programs (TRAP) and collaborative community meetings. The formation of strategies should involve those actually doing the job. Field supervisors and beat officers can often come up with much more effe ctive strategies and tactics t han top management. Usually, several strategies should be developed to support a single policy. Unlike principl es, strategies can and should be changed according to current conditions a nd changing challenges. Polici es can also be revised or changed but more rarely than strategies. Example: A press relations policy statement from the LAPD Manual, Vol. 1 (Policy) 115.75: \"Officers should make every reasonable effort to serve the needs of the media in informing the public about crime and other police issues\" could be supported by the appointment of a press relations officer; an ongoing system of scheduling of press conferences on matters of high interest; al lowing members of the media to accompany officers on significant operations where the investigation won' t be compromised or the rights of individuals abridged; and allowing the media access to personnel, at the lo west level, who are fully informed about the subject of a press inquiry. Tactics A tactic is a method of implem enting the plan. The y're m ore spe cific steps taken toward accomplishing a goal. Tactics are actions or procedures that get the job done. They'r e often mandates and even rules. 192 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] There are usually several tactics within a given strategy. For example, pursuing the strategy of problem-oriented policing could involve several tactics, including hardening the target; scanning, analysis, response and assessment (SARA) crime analysis; property identification; educ ating probable victims (\"Lady Beware\" rape prevention video); and graffiti removal. Each of these steps, t aken together, constitutes the strategy in support of the principle. Broad participation in the pro cess of developing principle-base d leadership is important at all levels. The higher up the inverted pyramid on the chart, the more beat officers, detectives and other street officers should be involved. When top leadership does a good job of identifying an d communicating the foundational principles, exceptional contributions to the rest of the process will occur . Bringing everyone in on the thinking and logic of top leadership demonstrates resp ect and confidence in them. Com bine that with a sincere invitation for all to help with the development of superb strategies and tactics and you have a winning combination. It's impossible to have a procedure or tactic that will cover e very contingency faced by officers. But when they have a foundation of logical principles and policies (Below 100 ) to guide them, they can create the tactic to fit the situation and constantly improve current procedures. Values The presence of deeply shared va lues results in willing and dil igent work toward the organizations goals rather than the need for forced complia nce. Values are those issues that members deem important , significant or having worth. Values are determined in various ways. Measuring behavio r or accomplishments communicates values. The very fact that top leadership is measuring something tells operating personnel it's im portant. Giving positive reinforcement to certain behav ior communicates values. Taking disciplinary action against prohibited acts communicates values. Punishing those who fail to accept assigned responsibilities communicates values. This is critical to making Below 100 work. Those in leadership position s, and that's just about everyone who reads this magazine, must understand that it's important to \"catch\" people doing things right and have the courageous conversation or initiate discipline when they're doing things w rong (such as failing to wear body armor or driving faster than necessary to a call.) Finally, perhaps the most powerfu l way of developing shared values is the process involved in implementing principle-based leadership that I've attempted to describe in t his article. The procedures, methods or tactics mandated by leadership can work to some degree without foundati onal support. But the y will be accepted and even highly valued more readily within the logical matrix of pr inciple-based leadership. Benefits of Principle-Based Leadership 1.) Increased willing compliance by followers: People are more like ly to follow leadership when they understand the purpose behind the direction they receive. 2.) More team work when members em ploying different strategies or tactics can see how they're linked together by the same principl es and policies. Less compartmenta lized thinking. 3.) Support from personnel in specialized units when they can see how their activities are connected to other entities of the department. 4.) Increased creativity when members are encouraged to help form s trategy and tactics based upon adopted principles and policies. 5.) Shared values. The clarifica tion of the values of the organization is a powerful by- p roduct of the process of developing this model of lead ership. The very identification and wording of the foundational principles is a strong statement of what the members of the organization are to value and pursue.

I will constantly strive to achieve t hese objectives and ideals, dedi cating myself before God to my chosen profession.....law enforcement. 195 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] LAW ENFORCEMENT CODE OF ETHICS All law enforcement officers mus t be fully aware of the ethical responsibilities of their position and must strive constantly to live up to the highest possible standards of prof essional policing. It is important police officers have clear advice and counsel ava ilable to help them perform th eir duties consistent with these standards. The following ethical mandates are guidelines to meet this end: Primary Responsibilities of Police Officer: A police officer acts as an official representative of the government; he is required and tr usted to work within the law. The officer's powers and duties are conferred by statute. The fundamental duties of a police officer include se rving the community; safe-guarding lives and property; protecting the innocen t; keeping the peace; and ensur ing the rights of all to liberty, equality and justice. Performance of the Duties of a Police Officer: A police officer performs all duties impartially, without fav or, affection or ill will and without regard to status, sex, race, religion, political belief or aspiration. All citizens are treated equally with courtesy, con sideration and dignity. Offi cers never allow personal feelings, animosities or friendships to influence official conduct. Laws are enforced a ppropriately and courteously and, in carrying out their responsibilities, officers strive to obtain maximum coope ration from the public. They conduct themselves, in appearance and deportment, in a way that inspires confidence and respect for the position of public trust they hold. Discretion: A police officer uses responsibly the discretion vested in the position and exercises it within the law. The principle of reasonabl eness guide the officer's concl usions, and the officer considers all surrounding circumstances in determining wh ether any legal action will be t aken. Consistent and wise use of discretion, based on professional policing competence, does much to preserv e good relationships and retain the confidence of the public. It can be diffic ult to choose between conflicti ng courses of action. It is important to remember that a timely word of advice rat her than arrest which may be co rrect in appropriate circumstances can be a more effective means of achieving a desired end. Use of Force: A police officer never employs unnecessary force or violence and uses only such force in the discharge of duty as is reasonabl e in all circumstances. Force is used only with greatest restraint and only after discussion, negotiation, and persuasion have been found to be inappropriate or ineffective. While the use of force is occasionally unavoidable, every police officer refrain s from the unnecessary infliction of pain or suffering and never engages in c ruel, degrading or inhuman trea tment of any person. Confidentiality: Whatever a police officer sees, hears, or learns of, which is of a confidential nature, is kept secret unless the performance of duty or legal provision requir es otherwise. The public has a right to security and privacy, and information obtained about members of the publ ic must not be improperly divulged. Integrity: A police officer does not engage in acts of corruption or bri bery, nor does an officer condone such acts by other police officers. The public demands that the int egrity of police officers be above reproach. Police officers must, therefore, avoid any conduct that might compromi se their integrity and that undercut the public confidence in a law enforcement agency. Officers refuse to acc ept any gifts, presents, subscriptions, favors, gratuities or promises that could be interpreted as seeking to cause the officer to refrain from performing official responsibilities honestly and within the law. Police officers must not receive private or special advantages from their official status. Respect from the public cannot be bought; it can only be earned and cultivated. Cooperation with Other Officers and Agencies: Police officers cooperate with all legally authorized agencie s and their representatives in the pursuit of justice. An office r or agency may be one among many organizations that may provide law enforcement services to a jurisdiction. It is essential that a poli ce officer help colleagues fully and completely and with respect and consideration. 196 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Personal/Professional Capabilities: Police officers are responsible f or maintaining a high standard of professionalism and take every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve their level of knowledge and competence. Through st udy and experience, a police officer can acquire the high level of knowledge and comp etence that is essential for efficient and effective performance. The acquisition of knowledge is a never-ending pr ocess of personal and professional development that should be pursued constantly. Private Life: Police officers will behave in a manner that does not bring d iscredit to their agencies or themselves. A police officer's character and conduct while off duty must always be exemplary, thus maintaining a position of respect in the community in which he or she lives and serves. The officer's personal behavior must be beyond reproach. Canon of Police Ethics Article 1: PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF JOB The primary responsibility of the police service, and of the in dividual officer, is the protection of people of the United States through the uphol ding of laws. Chief among these laws is the Constitution of the United States and its Amendments. The law enforcement officer always represen ts the whole of the community and its legally expressed will and is never the a rm of any political party or c lique. Article 2: LIMITATIONS OF AUTHORITY The first duty of a law enforcement officer, as upholder of the law, is to know its bounds upon him in enforcing the law. Because he represents the legal will of the community, be it local, state, or federal, he must be aware of the limitations and proscriptions which the people, through the law, have placed upon him. He must recognize the genius of the American system of government, which gives to no man, groups of men or institutions, absolute power; and he must ensu re that he, as a prime defender of that system, does not pervert its character. Article 3: DUTY TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAW AND WITH RESPONSIBILITIES OF SELF AND OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS The law enforcement officer sha ll assiduously apply himself to the study of the principles of the laws, which he is sworn to uphold. He will make certain of his responsibilitie s in the particulars of t heir enforcement, seeking aid from his superiors in matters of technicality or principle when these are not clear to him. He will make special effort to fully understand his relationship to other public officials, including other law enforcement agencies, particularly on matters of jurisdiction, both geograp hically and substantively. Article 4: UTILIZATION OF PROP ER MEANS TO GAIN PROPER ENDS The law enforcement officer sha ll be mindful of his responsibil ity to pay strict attention to the selection of means in discharging the duties of his office. Violations of law or disregard for public safety and property on the part of an officer are intrinsica lly wrong; they are self-defea ting in that they instill in the public mind a like disposition. The employment of illegal means, no matter how wor thy the end, is certain to encourage disrespect for the law and its officers. If the law is to be honored, it m ust be by those who enforce it. Article 5: COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN THE DISCHARGE O F THEIR AUTHORIZED DUTIES The law enforcement officer sha ll cooperate fully with other pu blic officials in the discharge of authorized duties, regardless of party affiliation or personal prejudice. He shall be meticulous, however, in assuring himself of the propriety, under the law, of such actions and shall guar d against the use of his office or person, whether knowingly or unknowingly, in any improper or illegal action. In any situation open to question, he shall seek authority from his superior officer, giving him a full report o f the proposed service or action. 197 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Article 6: PRIVATE CONDUCT The law enforcement officer shall be mindful of his special ide ntification by the public as an upholder of the law. Laxity of conduct or manne r in private life, expressing either disrespect for the law or seeking to gain special privilege, cannot but reflect upon the police officer a nd the police service. The community and the service require that the law enforcement officer lead the life of a decent and honorable person. Following the career of a police officer gives no person special prerequisite s. It does give the satisfaction and pride of following and furthering an unbroken tradition of safeguarding the American republic. The officer who reflects upon this tradition will not degrade it. Rather, he will so con duct his private life that t he public will regard him as an example of stability, fidelity, and morality. Article 7: CONDUCT TOWARD THE PUBLIC The law enforcement officer, mindful of his responsibility to t he whole community, shall deal with individuals of the community in a manner calculated to instill respect for its laws and its police service. The law enforcement officer shall conduct his official life in a manner such as will inspire confidence and trust. Thus, he will be neither overbearing nor subservient, as no individual c itizen has an obligation to stand in awe of him nor a right to command him. The officer will give service where he can, and will require compliance with the law. He will do neither from personal preference or prejudice but ra ther as a duly appointed officer of the law discharging his sworn obligation. Article 8: CONDUCT IN ARRESTING AND DEALING WITH LAW VIOLATORS The law enforcement officer sha ll use his powers of arrest strictly in accordance with the law and with due regard to the rights of the citizen concerned. His office gives him no right to prosecute t he violator nor to mete out punishment for the offense. He shall, at all times, have a clear appreciation of his responsibilities and limitations regarding detention of the violator. He shall condu ct himself in such a manner as will minimize the possibility of having to use for ce. To this end, he shall cultivate a dedication to the service of the people and the equitable upholding of their laws, whether in the handling of l aw violators or in dealing with the law abiding. Article 9: GIFTS AND FAVORS The law enforcement officer, rep resenting government, bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining, in his own conduct, the honor and integrity of all government institutions . He shall, therefore, guard against placing himself in a position in which any pers on can expect special consideration or in which the public can reasonably assume that special consideration is b eing given. Thus, he should be f irm in refusing gifts, favors or gratuities, large or small, which can, in the public m ind, be interpreted as capable of influencing his judgment in the discharge of his duties. Article 10: PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE The law enforcement officer sha ll be concerned equally in the p rosecution of the wrongdoer and the defense of the innocent. He shall ascertain what constitutes evidence and shall present such evidence impartially and without malice. In so doing, he will ignore social, political, and all other distinctions among the persons involved, strengthening the tra dition of the reliability and in tegrity of an officer's word. Article 11: ATTITUDE TOWARD PROFESSION The law enforcement officer shall regard the discharge of his d uties as a public trust and recognize his responsibility as a public servant. By diligent study and since re attention to self-improvement, he shall strive to make the best possible application of science to the solution o f crime, and in the field of human relationships, shall strive for effective leader ship and public influence in m atters affecting public safety. He shall appreciate the importance and responsibility of his office and shall hold police work to be an honorable profession rendering valuable service to his community and country. 198 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] References Ethics, Integrity, and Professionalism.

A problem is something that concerns or causes harm to citizens , not just the police. Things that concern only police officers are important, but they are not problems i n this sense of the term. Addressing problems means more than quick fixes: it means deali ng with conditions that create problems. Police officers must routinely and systematically analyze probl ems before trying to solve them, just as they routinely and systematically investigate crimes before making a n arrest. Individual officers and the department as a whole must develop routines and systems for ana lyzing problems. The analysis of problems must be thorough even though it may not need to be complicated. This principle is as true for problem analysis as it is for criminal investigatio n. Problems must be described precisely and accurately and broken down into specific aspects of the problem. Problems often aren't what they first appear to be. Problems must be understood in terms of the various interests a t stake. Individuals and groups of people are affected in different ways by a p roblem and have different ideas about what should be done about the problem. The way the problem is currently being handled must be understo od and the limits of effectiveness must be openly acknowledged in order to come up with a better response. Initially, any and all possible responses to a problem should be considered so as not to cut short potentially effective responses. Suggested responses should follow from what is learned during the analysis. They should not be limited to, nor rule out, the use of arrest. The police must pro-actively try to solve problems rather than just react to the harmful consequences of problems. The police department must increase police officers' freedom to make or participate in important decisions. At the same time, officers must be accountable for their decisi on-making. The effectiveness of new responses must be evaluated so these r esults can be shared with other police officers and so the department can systematically learn what do es and does not work. The concept of problem-oriente d policing can be illustrated by an example. Suppose police find themselves responding several times a day to calls about drug dealing and vandalism in a neighborhood park. The common approach of dispatching an officer to the scene and repeatedly arresting offenders may do little to resolve the long term crime and disorder pr oblem. If, instead, police were to incorporate problem-oriented policing techniques into their approach, they would examine the conditio ns underlying the problem. This would likely include collecting additional information\u2014perhaps by surveying neighborhood residents and park users, analyzing the time of day when in cidents occur, determining who the offenders are and why they favor the park, and examining the particular are as of the park that are most co nducive to the activity and evaluating their environmental design characteristics. The findings could form t he basis of a response to the problem behaviors. While enforcement might be a component of the response, it woul d unlikely be the sole solution because, in this case, an alysis would likel y indicate the need to invol ve neighb orhood residents, parks and recreation officials and others. Problem-oriented policing can be applied at various levels of community problems and at various levels in the police organization. It can be applied to problems that affect an entire community, involving the highest level of police agency, government, and community resources. It can be a pplied at intermediate levels (for example, a neighborhood or a police district), involving an intermediate l evel of resources. Or it can be applied at a very localized level (for example, a single location or a small grou p of problem individuals), involving the resources of only a few police officers and other individuals. 212 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Community Oriented Policing Three components: Community Partnerships Organizational Transformation Problem Solving Defined by its programs: Neighborhood mini-stations Customer satisfaction surveys Foot patrols School Resource Officers Neighborhood watch programs Enhanced officer empowerment and discretion Purpose - increase police effectivenes s and legitimacy; enhance community quality of life C.O.P.

Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large and these partnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing public safety problems. Other Government Agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation and parole, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human services, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community Members/Groups Individuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for identifying community concerns. Partnerships with these factions of the community can engage the community in achieving specific goals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices/storefronts in the community, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits/Service Providers Advocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share certain interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. Private Businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they often bring considerable resources to bear on problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and community outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating information about police and business partnerships and initiatives. 218 of 7446Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. 219 of 7447Organizational Transformation The alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and information systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how the infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency Management Under the community policing model, police management needs to infuse community policing ideals throughout the agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations, decentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture Changing the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community policing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing's vision, values, and mission within their organization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the dominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing implementation. Decision-making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized decision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in 220 of 7448community policing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision-making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk-taking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing the officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community policing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their efforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization's mission and value statement should be simple and communicated widely. Everything should connect back to it. Policies Community policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime rates) community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks at how feedback information is used, not only how it measures outcomes. Transparency Community policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on crime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. 221 of 7449Organizational Structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensures that local patrol officers have decision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments, the development of officers who are \"generalists,\" and using special units appropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing a strong relationship and mutual accountability. Beat boundaries should correspond to neighborhood boundaries and other government services should recognize these boundaries when coordinating government public-service activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although there may be a need for some specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources and finances Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources to support community policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and effective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, including sworn officers, nonsworn officers, civilians, and volunteers, as well as personnel evaluations, supervision, and training. Recruitment, hiring, and selection Agencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment, selection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving responsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a \"spirit of service,\" instead of only a \"spirit of adventure.\" A community policing agency also has to thoughtfully examine where it is seeking recruits, whom it is 222 of 74410recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Some community policing agencies also look for involvement of the community in this process through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Supervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are incorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional structures should support sound problem-solving activities, proactive policing and community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with police services. Training Training at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and techniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify and correct conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information Systems (Technology) Community policing is information-intensive and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready access to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective and ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition, technological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and in developing agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public and internally with their own staff. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet to provide online reports, reverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion forums, and feedback on interactive applications (surveys, maps), thereby creating ongoing dialogs and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, e-mail and enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for more efficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop 223 of 74411accountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of measures and information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely information on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis functions by enabling agencies to gather information about the greater aspects of events including more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source and, therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and checked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance measurement. 224 of 74412Problem Solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and rigorously evaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than responding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem Analysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking Who?, What?, When?, Where?, How?, Why?, and Why Not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. 225 of 74413Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of problems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an identified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response should follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem. The goals of the response can range from either totally eliminating the problem, substantially reducing the problem, reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem, or improving the quality of community cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses Assessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by determining if the problem declined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but also gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim, offender, and location (the crime triangle) and those aspects that could have an impact on them, for example, capable guardians for victims, handlers for offenders, and managers for locations. Rather than focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within their reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating risk with unwanted behavior.

In the 1990s it has expanded to become the dominant strategy of policing - so much that the 100,000 new police officers funded by the 1994 Crime Bill must be engaged in community policing. Community policing (COP) is o ften misunderstood. Four essential principles should be recognized: COP is not a panacea. It is not the answer to all the problems facing any one depart ment. However, COP is an answer to some of the problem s facing modern policing and it may be an answer to some of the problems facing any one department. COP is not totally new. Some police departments or individual police officers report t hat they are already doing it, or even that they have always practiced COP. This ma y be true. Even so, there are some specific aspects of community policing that are relatively new; also, ve ry few agencies can claim that they have fully adopted the entire gamut of COP department-wide. COP is not \"hug a thug.\" It is not anti-law enforcement or anti-crime fighting. It does not seek to turn police work into social work. In fact, COP is more serious about reducing crime and disorder than the superficial brand of incident-or iented \"911 policing\" that most departments have been doing for the past few decades. COP is not a cookbook. There is no ironclad precise definition of community policing nor a set of specific activities that must always be included. A set of universally a pplicable principles and elements can be identified, but exactly how they are implemented should and mus t vary from place to place, because jurisdictions and police agencies have differing needs and circ umstances. In order to describe the full breadth of community policing, it is helpful to identify four m ajor dimensions of COP and the most common elements occurring within each. The four dimensions are: The Philosophical Dimension The Strategic Dimension The Tactical Dimension The Organizational Dimension The Philosophical Dimension Many of its most thoughtful and forceful advocates emphasize th e community policing is a new philosophy of policing, perhaps constituting even a paradigm shift away from professional-model policing and not just a particular program or specialized activity. The philosophical d imension includes the central ideas and beliefs 232 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] underlying community policing. Three of the most important of t hese are citizen input, broad function, and personal service. (1) Citizen Input - Community policing incorporates a firm commitment to the val ue and necessity of citizen input to police policies and prioriti es. In a free and democratic society, citizens are supposed to have a say in how they are governed. Police departments, like other agencies of government, are supposed to be responsive and accountable. Also, from a more selfish standpoin t, law enforcement agencies are most likely to obtain the citizen support and cooperation they need when th ey display interest in input from citizens. A few of the techniques utilized to enhance citizen input are: Agency Advisory Boards - groups of citizens who meet regularly with the chief/sheriff and other top commanders to provide input and advice on overall agency polici es, priorities, and issues. Unit Advisory Boards - groups of citizens who meet regularly with unit commanders and related personnel to provide input and a dvice on unit policies, priorit ies, and issues (e.g. precinct advisory boards, victim/witness advisory councils, family abuse advisory boards, etc.). Beat Advisory Boards - groups of citizens who meet regularly with their beat office r or beat team to provide input and advice about priorities and issues. Special Advisory Boards - groups of citizens with speci al interests who meet regularly with the chief/sheriff, top commanders, or related personnel to provide input and advice on policies, priorities, and issues related to their special interests (e.g. ministry al liance, business council, mental health council, etc.). Community Surveys - surveys conducted in various w ays (telephone, mail, in-perso n, in the newspaper, etc.) to obtain citizen views on policies, priorities, and issu es. Electronic Mail/Home Page - use of the Internet, on-line services, computer bulletin boa rds, etc., to obtain citizen views on policies, priorities and issues. Radio/Television Call-In Shows - use of radio and TV call-in s hows to obtain citizen views on policies, priorities and issues. Town Meetings - public meetings to which citi zens are invited in order to pr ovide input and advice on policies, priorities, and issues. (2) Broad Function - COP recognizes policing as a broad function, not a narrow law enforcement or crime fighting role. The job of poli ce officers is seen as working wi th residents to enhance neighborhood safety. This includes resolving conflic ts, helping victims, preventing accidents, solving problems, and fighting fear as well as reducing crime through apprehension and enforcement. Policing is inherently a multi-faceted government function - arbitrarily narrowing it to just call-handling and law enforcement reduces its effectiveness in accomplishing the multiple objectives that the public expects police to achieve. Some exam ples of the broad function of policing i nclude: Traffic Safety - good police departments pursue traffic safety through educat ion and engineering as well as selective enforcement. Drug Abuse - many agencies eek to reduce drug abuse through public educat ion, DARE, regulation of prescriptions, and control of che micals as well as through a v ariety of enforcement efforts. Fear Reduction - many agencies attempt to redu ce fear of crime (especially wh en it is out of proportion to actual risk) through public education, high-interaction patr ol, problem solving, and enforcement focused on nuisance crimes (e.g., panhandling and loitering). Domestic Violence - most police departments now o ffer domestic violence victims an array of services (referral, transportation, protection, probable cause arrest, e tc.) rather than merely explaining how to obtain an arrest warrant. Zoning - some agencies take the opportunity to participate in zoning decisions and related matters (e.g., issuance of building permits) in order to offer input related t o traffic safety, crime prevention, etc. 233 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] (3) Personal Service - Community policing emphasizes personal service to the public, not bureaucratic behavior. This is designed to overcome one of the most common complaints that the public has about government employees, including police officers - that they do not seem to care, and that they treat citizens as numbers, not real people. Of c ourse, not every police-citize n encounter can be amicable and friendly. But whenever possible, officers shoul d deal with citizens in a frie ndly, open, and persona l manner designed to turn them into satisfied customers. This can be best done by el iminating as many artificial bureaucratic barriers as possible, so that citizens can deal directly with \"their\" officer. A few of the methods that have been adopted in order to impleme nt personalized service are: Officer Business Cards - officers are provided personalized business cards to distribute to victims, complainants, and other citizen s with whom they have contact. Officer Pagers and Voice Mail - officers have their own pagers and voice mail so that victim s, complainants, and other citizens can contact them directly. Recontact Procedures - all or a subset of victims, c omplainants, and others are rec ontacted by the officer who handled their situa tion, the officer's supervisor, or some other staff member (e.g., a volunteer) to see if further assistance is needed. Slogans and Symbols - many departments adopt slogans, mission statements, value s tatements, and other devices designed to reinforce the importance of provi ding personalized service to the public. The Strategic Dimension The strategic dimension of community policing includes the key operational concepts that translate philosophy into action. These strategic concepts are the links between the broad ideas and beliefs t hat underlie community policing and the specific programs and practices by which it is implemented. They assure that agency policies, priorities, and resource allocati on are consistent with the COP philosophy. Three important strategic elements are re-oriented operations, prevention emphasis, and geographic focus. (1) Re-Oriented Operations - Community policing recommends re-oriented operations, with l ess reliance on the patrol car and more emphasis on face-to-face interactions. One objective is to replace in effective or isolating operational practices (e .g., motorized patrol and rap id response to low priority calls) with more effective and more interactive practices. A related objective i s to find ways of performing necessary traditional functions (e.g., hand ling emergency calls and conducting follow-up investigations) more efficiently, in order to save time and resources that can then be devoted to more community-oriented activities. Some illustrations of re-ori ented operations include: Foot Patrol - where appropriate, many agenc ies have instituted foot patrol to supplement or even replace motorized patrol. Other Modes of Patrol - many agencies have adopted other modes of patrol, such as bi cycle patrol, scooter patrol, dirt bike patrol, and horse patrol. Walk and Ride - many agencies require officers engaged in motorized patrol t o park their cars periodically and engage in foot p atrol in shopping centers, mal ls, business districts, parks, and residential areas. Directed Patrol - many agencies give motorized p atrol officers specific assign ments (sometimes called \"D-runs\") to carry out during time periods when they are not bu sy handling calls. Differential Patrol - many agencies have adopted d ifferential responses (e.g., del ayed response, telephone reporting, walk-in repor ting) tailored to the needs o f different types of calls, instead of dispatching a marked unit to the scene of every call for servic e. Case Screening - many agencies have adopted different investigative responses (e.g., no follow-up, follow-up by patrol, follow-up by detectives) tailored to meet the needs of different types of criminal and non-criminal cases, instead of assigning every case to a de tective. 234 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] (2) Prevention Emphasis - Community policing tries to implement a prevention emphasis , based on the common sense idea that although citizens appreciate and value rapid response, reactive investigations, and apprehension of wrongdoers, they would always prefer that their victimizations be prevented in the first place. Most modern police departments devote some resources to crime prevention, in the form of a specialist officer or unit. COP a ttempts to go farther by empha sizing that prevention is a big part of every officer's job. A few of the approaches to focusing on prevention that departme nts have adopted are: Situational Crime Prevention - the most promising general a pproach to crime prevention is to tailor specific preventive measures to each situation's specific chara cteristics. CPTED - one set of measures used by many departments is CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design), which focuses on the physical characteri stics of locations that make them conducive to crime. Community Crime Prevention - many departments now work cl osely with individual residents and with groups of residents (e.g., b lock watch) in a cooperative m anner to prevent crime. Youth-Oriented Prevention - many departments have implemented programs or collaborated w ith others to provide programs desi gned to prevent youth crime (e.g ., recreation, tutoring, and mentoring programs). Business Crime Prevention - many departments work clo sely with businesses to recommend p ersonnel practices, retail procedures, and other security measures desig ned to prevent crime. (3) Geographic Focus - Community policing adopts a g eographic focus to establish stronger bonds between officers and neighborhoods in order to increase mutual recognition, identification, responsibility, and accountability. Although most police departments have long assi gned patrol officers to beats, the officers' accountability has usually be temporal (for their shift) rather than geographic. More specialized personnel within law enforcement agencies have been accountable for performing their functions but not for any geogr aphic areas. By its very name, h owever, community policing implies an emphasis on places more so than on times or functions. Some of the methods by which COP attempts to emphasize geograph y are as follows: Permanent Beat Assignment - patrol officers are assigned to geographic beats for extende d periods of time, instead of being rotated frequently. Lead Officers - since several different offi cers will be assigned to a beat across 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, often one officer is desi gnated as the lead officer responsible for problem identification and coordination of the efforts of all the officers. Beat Teams - the basic bu ilding block for patrol can be the beat team (al l the officers who work in a particular beat) rather than the temporal squad or shift. Cop-of-the-Block - the beat can be sub-divided into smaller areas of individual accountability, so that every patrol officer has general responsibility for a beat and special responsibility for smaller areas. Area Commanders - middle-level managers (typica lly lieutenants) can be given r esponsibility for geographic areas consisting of several beats, instead of being shift or squad commanders. Mini-Stations - each beat or combination of beats can have its own facility (mini-station, sub-station, or storefront) to give it additional geographic focus for officers and area residents. Area Specialists - some detectives and other specialists can be assigned to geographic areas instead of to narrow sub-specialties (e.g ., a detective handles all, or at least most, of the crime occurring in a particular neighborhood, instead of handling car thefts from al l over the jurisdiction). The Tactical Dimension The tactical dimension of community policing ultimately transla tes ideas, philosophies, and strategies into concrete programs, tac tics, and behaviors. Even those who insis t that \"community policin g is a philosophy, not a 235 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] program\" must concede that unless community policing eventually leads to some action, some new or different behavior, it is all rhetoric and no reality. Indeed, many comme ntators have taken the view that community policing is little more than a new police marketing strategy th at has left the core elements of the police role untouched. Three of the most impor tant tactical elements of com munity policing are positive interaction, partnerships, and problem solving. (1) Positive Interaction - Policing inevitably involves some negative contacts between officers and citizens - arrests, tickets, stops for suspicion, orders to desist, inabil ity to make things much better for victims, etc. Community policing recognizes th is fact and recommends that off icers offset it as much as they can by engaging in positive interactions whenever possible. Positive interactions have several benefits, of course: they generally build familiarity , trust and confidence on both sides; they remind officers that most citizens respect and support them; they make the officer more knowledgea ble about people and conditions in the beat; they provide specific info rmation for criminal investigat ions and problem solving; and they break up the monotony of motorized patrol. Some methods for engaging in po sitive interaction include: Routine Call Handling - officers can take the time to engage in more positive intera ction in the course of handling calls, instead of rushing to clear calls in order t o return to motorized patrol. Meetings - officers can take every opportunity to attend neighborhood m eetings, block watch meetings, civic club meetings, etc.; these can yield productive non- enforcement interactions with a wide spectrum of the community. School-Based Policing - officers who take the trouble to go into the schools get man y opportunities to interact positively with youth, not to mention teachers and other school staff. Interactive Patrol - too many officers patrol primarily by watching what goes on in public spaces; officers should stop and talk with more people so that their pa trolling relies more on interacting than on watching. (2) Partnerships - Community policing stresses the importance of active partnerships between police, other agencies, and citizens, in which all parties really work togeth er to identify and solve problems. Citizens can take a greater role in public safety than has been typical over the past few decades, and other public and private agencies can leverage their own resources and authority toward the solution of public safety problems. Obviously, there are some legal and safety limitation s on how extensive a role citizens can play in \"co-producing\" public safety. Jus t as obviously, it is a mistak e for the police to try to assume the entire burden for controlling crime and disorder. Citizen Patrols - in many jurisdictions citizens actively patrol their neighbo rhoods, usually in cooperation with the police and often in radio or cellular phon e communication with police dispatch. Citizen Police Academies - many departments now operate citizen police academies, typic ally held in the evenings, that inform interested citizens about the police department and often prepare them for roles as volunteers or citizen patrols. Volunteers - many departments utilize volunteers, auxiliaries, and reserves in a variety of sworn and non-sworn roles. Schools - many police departments today work much more closely with sc hools than in the past, not just with DARE programs but also with school resource officers, truancy programs, etc. Code Enforcement - many of the problem locations that police deal with are susc eptible to code enforcement for various building and safety violations. Nuisance Abatement - some locations have such a multitude and history of criminal and civil law violations that procedures can be followed to close them down, demolish them, and/or forfeit their ownership to the government. Landlords & Tenants - many police departments work c losely with apartment managers , public housing managers, tenant associa tions, and similar groups in or der to improve leasing practices and prevent problems in rental properties. 236 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] (3) Problem Solving - Community policing urges the adoption of a problem solving orientation toward policing, as opposed to the incident-oriented approach that has tended to prevail in conjunction with the professional model. Naturally, emergency calls must still be ha ndled right away, and officers will still spend much of their time handling individual incidents. Whenever pos sible, however, officers should search for the underlying conditions that give rise to single and multiple incidents. When such conditions are identified, officers should try to affect them as a means of co ntrolling and preventing future incidents. Basically, officers should strive to have more substantive and meaningful impact than occurs from 15- minute treatments of individual calls for service. Some of the more promising approaches to problem solving includ e: The SARA Process - many departments use the SA RA model (scanning, analysis, res ponse, assessment) as a guide to the problem solving process for all k inds of crime and noncrime problems. Guardians - when searching for solutions to problems, it is often helpfu l to identify so-called guardians, who are people who ha ve an incentive or the opportun ity to help rectify the problem (e.g., landlords, school principals, etc.). Beat Meetings - some departments utilize mee tings between neighborhood resid ents and their beat officers to identify problems, analyze them, and brainstorm pos sible solutions. Hot Spots - many departments analyze their calls for service to identify locations that have disproportionate numbers of calls and then do problem solving t o try to lower the call volume in those places. Multi-Agency Teams - some jurisdictions use problem solving teams comprised not just of police, but also of representatives of other agencies (public works, sanita tion, parks and recreation, code enforcement, etc.) so that an a rray of information and resource s can be brought to bear once problems are identified. The Organizational Dimension It is important to recognize an Organizational Dimension that surrounds community policing and greatly affects its implementation. In order to support and facilitate communit y policing, police departments often consider a variety of changes in organizati on, administration, management, and supervision. The elements of the organizational dimension are not really part of community polic ing per se, but they are frequently crucial to its successful implementation. Three important organizational eleme nts of COP are structure, management, and information. (1) Structure - Community policing looks at various ways of restructuring po lice agencies in order to facilitate and support implementation of t he philosophical, strategic, and tactical elements described above. Any organization's structure should correspond with its mission and the nature of the work performed by its members. Some aspects of traditional police organization struct ure seem more suited to routine bureaucratic work than to the discretion and creativity required for COP. The types of restructuring associ ated with community policing include: Decentralization - authority and responsibility can sometimes be delegated more widely so that commanders, supervisors, and offi cers can act m ore independentl y and be more responsive. Flattening - the number of layers of hierarchy in the police organization can sometimes be reduced in order to improve communications and reduce waste, rigidity and bureaucracy. De-specialization - the number of specialized units and personnel can sometimes be reduced with more resources devoted to the direct delivery of police services (including COP) to the general public. Teams - efficiency and effectiveness can sometimes be improved by ge tting employees working together as teams to perform work, solve problems, or look for ways of improving quality. 237 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Civilianization - positions currently held by s worn personnel can sometimes be reclassified or redesigned for non-sworn personne l, allowing both cost savings and better utilization of sworn personnel. (2) Management - Community policing is often association with styles of leade rship, management, and supervision that give more emph asis to organizational culture and values and less emphasis to written rules and formal discipline. The general argument is that when employ ees are guided by a set of officially sanctioned values they will usual ly make good decisions and tak e appropriate actions. Although many formal rules will still probably be necessary, managers will ne ed to resort to them much less often in order to maintain control over subordinates. Management practices consistent with this emphasis on organizat ional culture and values include: Mission - agencies should develop concise statements of their m ission and values and use them consistently in making decisions, guiding employees, and training new recruits. Strategic Planning - agencies should engage in c ontinuous strategic planning aime d at ensuring that resources and energy are focused on mission accomplishment and adherence to core values; otherwise organizations tend to get off track, confused about their missi on and about what really matters. Coaching - supervisors should coach and guide their subordinates more, instead of restricting their roles to review of paperwork and enforcement of rules and regulations. Mentoring - young employees need mentoring from managers, supervisors, a nd/or peers - not just to learn how to do their job right but also to learn what constitutes the right job; in other words, to learn about ethics and values and what it means to be a good police o fficer. Empowerment - under COP, employees are encouraged to be risk takers who de monstrate imagination and creativity in their work - t his kind of empowerment can on ly succeed, however, when employees are thoroughly familiar with the organization's core values and firmly committed to them. Selective Discipline - in their disciplinary processes, agencies should make distin ctions between intentional and unintentional errors made by employees and betw een employee actions that violate core values versus those that merely violate technical rules. (3) Information - Doing community policing and managing it effectively require certain types of information that have not traditionally been available in all police depart ments. In the never-ending quality vs. quantity debate, for example, community policing tends to emphasize qual ity. This emphasis on quality shows up in many areas; avoidance of traditional bean-counting (arrests, ti ckets) to measure success, more concern for how well calls are handled than me rely for how quickly they are handled, etc. Also, the geographic focus of community policing increases the need for detailed information based on neighborhoods as the unit of analysis. The emphasis on problem solving highlights the need f or information systems that aid in identif y ing and analyzing a variety of community-level problems . And so on. Several aspects of police administration under COP that have im plications for information are: Performance Appraisal - individual officers can be evaluated on the quality of the t heir community policing and problem solving activities, and perhaps on results achieved, instead of on traditional performance indicators (tickets, arrests, calls handled, etc.). Program Evaluation - police programs and strategies can be evaluated more on the basis of their effectiveness (outcomes, results, quality) than just on their e fficiency (effort, outputs, quantity). Departmental Assessment - the police agency's overall performance can be measured and assessed on the basis of a wide variety of indicators (including customer satisfaction, fear levels, problem solving, etc.) instead of a narrow band of traditional indicators (repor ted crime, response time, etc.). Information Systems - an agency's information syst ems need to collect and produce information on the whole range of the police function, not just on enforcement and call-handling activities, in order to support more quality- oriented appraisal, evaluation and assess ment efforts. 238 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Crime Analysis - individual officers need more timely and complete crime anal ysis information pertaining to their specific geographic areas of responsibility to facilitate problem identification, analysis, fear reduction, etc. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) - sophisticated and user friendly computerized mapping software available today makes it possible for officers and citizens to obtain customized maps that geographically identify \"hot spot s\" and help them more easily p icture the geographic locations and distribution of crime related problems.

Led to significant reduction in crime within one year of implementation. CompStat is a data driven method for managing operations and leads to sound decisions for directing resources. Data is also be used to monitor and track results and hold upper level management accountable for outcomes. CompStat Defined: CompStat is an organizational management tool which reduces crime through systematic data collection, crime analysis , and heightened managerial acco untability CompStat shifts most of the responsibility for reducing crime a nd strategic decision making from patrol officers and first line supervisors to command staff CompStat relies heavily on the la test geographic information systems technology and computer crime statistics to facilitate timely and ta rgeted responses to crime CompStat involves six core principles: Mission clarification Data driven statistical analysis and timely intelligence report s Internal accountability Organizational flexibility Innovative, rapid problem-solving tactics, rapid deployment Relentless follow-up and assessm ent of problem-solving efforts Critical Characteristics of Crime Data: Accurate - databases must contain specific, accurate data that differen tiates between crimes and includes modus operandi Complete - data must include the when, where, and how Available - data must be in useful format, readily available to staff Timely - data must be timely! Visible - pin mapping and other useful visual formats should be used Leader's role in CompStat: Leaders must establish the vision and goals for CompStat progra m Leaders must be intimately familia r with crime data for their a rea of responsibility Leaders must be involved in generating creative strategies for addressing crime trends identified by data Leaders must be empowered to direct resources as needed 248 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Leaders must monitor strategies employed for positive results a nd change strategies as necessary The CompStat process can be summarized in one simple statement: \"Collect, analyze, and map crime data and other essential police performance measures on a regular basis, and hold police managers accountable for their performance as measured by these data.\" This statement reflects the para digm of modern policing: accoun tability at all levels of a police agency. Since the CompStat process was introduced by the New York City Police Department in 1994 , it has been widely adopted and is partly responsible for contributing to significa nt improvements in the way many organizations control crime and conduct daily business. The process has recen tly been described as an \"emerging police managerial paradigm\" or \"a new paradigm revolutionizing law enforcement management and practice\" while others have called it \"perhaps the single most important organizational/administrative innovation in policing during the latter half of the 20th century.\" It is undeniable that the core management theories of CompStat, \"directing and controlling,\" have been demonstrated to be effective means for controlling crime. But t he CompStat process also has an inherent opportunity for developing leaders and improving the leadership process. According to D. V. Day, leader development concentrates on deve loping, maintaining, or enhanci ng individual attributes like knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). But Day distinguishes between leader deve lopment and leadership development, emphasizing that leadership development focuses on the nature o f the leader-follower re lationship and not just the KSAs of the leader. In this model, the most important leade r ability is interpersonal competence in fostering a spirit of cooperation in problem solving and embracing, creat ing, and implementing change. The leadership aspect of the Comp-Stat process must instill in people a sense of willingness to accomplish the goals of the organization using initiative and innovation. \"The chief executive should create a thirst for leadership in an environment in which all officers feel they can attain and exercise leadership capacities, not simply attain hierarchical leadership posts,\" as an IACP report on leadership put it. \"This includes imparting leadership knowledge and understanding of the organizational culture.\" In a recent national survey, 58 pe rcent of large agencies (thos e with 100 or more sworn officers) had either adopted or were planning to imple ment a CompStat-like program. As the proliferation of CompStat continues, the model is becoming firmly entrenched in modern police curric ula and will clearly be embraced by future police leaders. By adding the man agement concepts outlined in t his article to an agency's CompStat model, police executives can create the leaders that law enforcement a gencies (and communities) so desire.

The ILP approach is a process for enhancing law enforcement agency effectiveness. It also provides an organizational approach to gather and use many sources of information and intelligence to make timely and targeted strategic, operational, and tactical decisions, thereby enhancing law enforcement effectiveness. This document provides information on how the ILP framework can support existing law enforcement policing strategies. The key elements of ILP include executive commitment and involvement; collaboration and coordination throughout all levels of the agency; tasking and coordination; collection, planning, and operation; analytic capabilities; awareness, education, and training; end-user feedback; and reassessment of the process. Overarching all of these factors are effective information sharing processes. Understanding each of these elements provides the planning, organizational, and administrative steps necessary to implement ILP. This document also provides insight regarding the challenges of ILP implementation. The issues outlined can be mitigated through proper planning and preparation. Executive Summary 260 of 7442 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 261 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 3Introduction and Overview Intelligence-led policing (ILP) is a business process for systematically collecting, organizing, analyzing, and utilizing intelligence to guide law enforcement operational and tactical decisions. ILP aids law enforcement in identifying, examining, and formulating preventative, protective, and responsive operations to specific targets, threats, and problems. It is important to note that ILP is not a new policing model; rather, it is an integrated enhancement that can contribute to public safety. The ILP process can provide a meaningful contribution by supporting the agency's existing policing strategy, whether it is community-oriented policing, problem-oriented policing, or other methodology. ILP is a proactive application of analysis, borrowing from the established processes of the intelligence analytic function and using the best practices from existing policing models. The Though often used interchangeably and incorrectly, there is a difference between information and intelligence. Unprocessed information helps raise awareness and understanding. When this information is analyzed and evaluated, it becomes intelligence. Intelligence provides situational understanding that enables better decision making. Information plus analysis equals intelligence.Information Plus Analysis Equals Intelligence 262 of 7444 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policingability to collect, examine, vet, and compare vast quantities of information enables law enforcement agencies to understand crime patterns and identify individuals, enterprises, and locations that represent the highest threat to the community and concentration of criminal and/or terrorist-related activity. Through this method, law enforcement agencies can prioritize the deployment of resources in a manner that efficiently achieves the greatest crime-reduction and prevention outcomes. Assessment and vetting of criminal information and intelligence over a continuum also enables law enforcement agencies to examine the effectiveness of their responses, monitor shifts in the criminal environment, and make operational adjustments as the environment changes. ILP encourages the development and use of analytical products and tools (assessment reports, statistics, and maps) to aid personnel in defining strategic priorities for the agency (i.e., what the agency needs to do and what resources are needed to do it). ILP encourages the use of both overt and covert information gathering. This approach also maximizes the use of available resources and partnerships, such as those capabilities available through the state and local fusion centers and local/regional intelligence centers. There are many different definitions of ILP, and each is appropriate for its specific use and purpose. The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has defined ILP as: \"A collaborative law enforcement approach combining problem-solving policing, information sharing, and police accountability, with enhanced intelligence operations.\" For the purposes of this document, the BJA definition has been narrowed to the following: \"ILP is executive implementation of the intelligence cycle to support proactive decision making for resource allocation and crime prevention. In order to ILP Case Study\u2014 Steering Investigations An investigations branch commander, concerned about the spread of gang violence in his area of responsibility, charged his analytical force to identify the \"worst of the worst\" in terms of gangs employing violence. The analytical force, after assessing the environment, provided the commander with an intelligence product that identified a street gang with widespread influence throughout the region who were responsible for heightened levels of violence. Utilizing this intelligence, the commander outlined his priorities to his investigative units and obliged them to realign their own priorities in terms of the investigative project. After a nine-month-long \"full-frontal\" investigation, investigators dismantled the leadership of the identified street gang, arresting close to 100 members. successfully implement this business process, police executives must have clearly defined priorities as part of their policing strategy.\" At its core, ILP helps leaders make informed decisions to address agency priorities. These priorities can include issues such as crime prevention, crime reduction, case management, resource allocation, case clearance, anticipation of future threats, or crime problems. This process provides guidance and support to the agency leader, regardless of the type of priority established. 263 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 5Agency leaders are not the only members of an agency who make decisions. Every day, personnel at all levels make decisions that affect the outcome of operations and impact the overall performance of the agency; however, the scope of this discussion will focus on the role of the chief executive or command staff. These leaders have the responsibility of implementing the strategic vision for the agency. Using the ILP approach will assist these leaders as they seek to address the identified priorities. There is no single method for implementing ILP. The size of the agency, complexity of the threat environment, the local political environment, and resource availability within each jurisdiction vary greatly across the country; therefore, how ILP implementation \"looks\" within each agency will vary accordingly. However, adopting ILP as a philosophy and business framework, to whatever degree is appropriate, can and will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of any policing organization. The end goal of ILP is to enhance proactive policing efforts and further the positive outcomes of law enforcement actions toward reducing crime and protecting the community against a variety of threats. 264 of 7446 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 265 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 7The ILP philosophy centers on several key elements: executive commitment and involvement; collaboration and coordination throughout all levels of the agency; tasking and coordination; collection, planning, and operation; analytic capabilities; awareness, education, and training; end-user feedback; and reassessment of the process. These planning, organizational, and administrative steps are vital to ensure that the ILP framework is implemented in the way most appropriate for each agency's needs. ILP is not and should not be confused with CompStat or other statistical management tools; ILP is purely a complementary process to these tools.Executive Commitment and Involvement Successful implementation and sustainment of the ILP framework within a law enforcement agency require strong commitment by the agency's leadership. The agency leader should be able to clearly articulate the goals of ILP: how it will address the agency's priorities, how it will affect agency operations, and how the agency will benefit from its use. Executives must lead by example\u2014fully integrating intelligence into their strategic, operational, and tactical decisions\u2014thereby demonstrating their confidence in the ILP approach and providing evidence of how using intelligence leads to better decisions. Because ILP is an agencywide approach, implementation requires agencywide Fundamentals of Intelligence-Led Policing 266 of 7448 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing understanding and adoption\u2014tantamount to an agencywide cultural shift. Creating cultural change is difficult and requires strong, consistent leadership from the agency's executives. This represents a significant challenge. It requires changing attitudes, values, and beliefs about policing processes and redefining organizational procedures, including how personnel view crime problems, how information is shared, and how to integrate threat prevention with crime prevention. There are several things executives can do to implement and institutionalize ILP: Develop a vision that is founded upon ILP. \u0090 Communicate the vision: \u0090 Communicate the vision to the agency's \u009c governing body, e.g., mayor or city council members. Educate and incorporate the command \u009c staff so they understand and \"buy into\" the vision, as they will be instrumental in creating the final implemented process. Communicate to all levels of the agency, \u009c and demonstrate how the intelligence provided through the ILP approach works to address the agency's top priorities. Continuously lead by example\u2014show \u0090 personnel how analysis and intelligence products are used to make strategic, operational, and tactical decisions at the highest level. Ensure that ILP gets sufficient and continued \u0090 support to achieve full implementation. This includes the assignment of personnel and resources to fulfill the agency's ILP framework. Promote crime and intelligence analysis: \u0090 Quote: \"The integration of the intelligence and crime analysis function is essential to uncovering crimes linked to organized groups of criminals (groups of juveniles in a neighborhood, gang-related activity, and so on).

Develop a strategic plan to address the \u009c priorities.Identify intelligence capabilities and \u009c leverage existing resources, such as fusion centers, to avoid duplication of efforts. Organize an intelligence apparatus or \u009c leverage another's to collect, analyze, and develop intelligence to address the identified priorities. Prepare the agency to implement \u009c ILP through training, education, and awareness. Continuously reinforce the ILP approach. \u009c Build in evaluation and rewards that \u009c recognize the individuals that adopt and utilize the ILP concepts. Strive for timely, accurate, and reconciled \u009c data.Reevaluate the agency's priorities on a \u009c regular basis. In addition to the executive ownership of process, agency leaders must construct their agency's framework to explain how ILP works within the law enforcement organization. It is important that leaders describe how ILP coordinates and collaborates with other ongoing state and regional efforts. This process includes the development of policies and procedures that support the implementation of ILP. These documents must not only provide clear direction on the agency's internal policies but also support external issues, such as the protection of privacy and civil liberties. In order to provide direction and guidance, it is imperative that each person understand his or her role and responsibility. It is beneficial to outline these roles and responsibilities by job title. For example: Role of Officers in the Field : For officers in the field, ILP requires becoming both better data collectors and better consumers of intelligence-related products. This means shifting from emphasizing postevent evidence collection to constantly gathering all relevant data and ensuring it is provided for entry into appropriate databases, as well as drawing from the intelligence analysts and relevant databases all the information that is needed to support ongoing operations. Role of Analysts : For analysts, the key components of the ILP process include the creation of tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence products that support immediate needs, promote situational awareness, and provide the foundation for longer-term planning. 1 Collaboration and Coordination In order to implement ILP and make efficient resource allocation decisions, agencies must collaborate and coordinate with other information sharing partners. It is critical that existing resources be leveraged. Partner agencies and other stakeholders are also a main component of ILP implementation. They often have a unique, strategic understanding of the community that will provide additional information and intelligence. Frequent and ongoing communications with all of the agency's ILP stakeholders is vital for success. Receiving a broad base of input from internal and external 1 New Jersey State Police Practical Guide to Intelligence-Led Policing , Center for Policing Terrorism at the Manhattan Institute, September 2006 ( http://www.cpt-mi.org/pdf/NJPoliceGuide.pd f). 268 of 74410 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policingstakeholders will contribute to the integrity of the design for the ILP function. Interacting with other members of the law enforcement and public safety communities will create valuable conduits for future information and intelligence sharing. Cooperation, partnerships, and effective two-way information sharing are key components of successful ILP. It is important that agencies update or implement a privacy policy that addresses their information sharing processes. This policy should clearly address how the ILP framework is utilized. There are several different groups whose participation in the ILP process will be instrumental for success: Federal, State, Local, and Tribal Law \u0090 Enforcement Agencies Build and develop regional relationships. \u009c Learn from other agencies. \u009c Leverage existing collaboration and tools. \u009c Fusion Center Partnership \u0090 Facilitate the establishment of a \u009c trusted partnership among all levels of government. Participate with the primary state or \u009c regional fusion center to institutionalize the \"culture of information sharing.\" Fusion centers have the ability to fuse \u009c and analyze information from multiple local jurisdictions into a regional or state picture and create intelligence products that support management decisions for the most effective allocation of resources and personnel. Public Sector \u0090 Educate agency governing authorities \u009c (e.g., mayor, city council, or agency leaders) on how they will benefit from ILP in securing necessary resources. Seek input from governing authorities on \u009c elements/priorities to incorporate into the agency's ILP design. Liaise and collaborate with other public \u009c safety agencies and organizations\u2014such as fire, emergency medical services, public health, health care, energy, water, transportation, schools, and hospitals. Investigate the agency's ability to \u009c access other government resources, including motor vehicle and corrections information. Private Sector \u0090 Partnering with the private critical \u009c infrastructure and key resources sectors has the same positive effect as working with public safety agencies\u2014a wide variety of perspectives on existing and emerging threats and a vast network of new information sources. Community \u0090 Engaging the community to work with \u009c the law enforcement agency produces a greater sense of community trust in the agency's operations and raises community awareness regarding how citizens can positively contribute (e.g., \"see something, say something\"). This can foster a collaborative process for citizens to provide input to understand ILP builds upon many of the tenets of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. As agencies work to collaborate and coordinate, the information and resources available as part of the COPS program can serve as a valuable resource. For additional information, see www.cops.usdoj.govCommunity Oriented Policing COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 269 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 11and solve community crime issues. The reporting of suspicious activity is an example of this collaboration. Citizen Awareness\u2014Providing \u009c transparency during the ILP design and implementation process, seeking community input, and providing education on how ILP will improve public safety will help the agency gain community support for the initiative. Tasking and Coordination Fundamentally, it is necessary to view ILP as a core management philosophy of the command and control functions of a law enforcement agency. This allows commanders, supervisors, analysts, and officers in the field to understand, adopt, and value a centralized tasking and coordination function required for advancing ILP. Law enforcement agencies have to balance a myriad of duties and responsibilities in their jurisdictions. This often presents unique challenges for command personnel on where to expend resources and focus operations. A robust tasking and coordination system allows organizations to synchronize these efforts by aligning personnel and resources toward strategic, operational, and tactical goals. The following four recommendations can be adopted by commanders for building a tasking and coordination function within their organizations: Direct analytical resources to produce a 1) specific threat assessment for the jurisdiction being policed. 2 Use the threat assessment to identify 2) command priorities. Establish a tasking and coordination group to 3) assist command-level staff. 2 Organizations that do not have analytical resources should work with their regional fusion center, Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Center, or High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) group for assistance in the production of a threat assessment.Coordinate a monthly or quarterly tasking 4) and coordination meeting among staff and supervisors to: Identify intelligence and investigative \u009c gaps with regard to outreach, patrol, enforcement, and investigative initiatives. Coordinate resource allocation and effort. \u009c Task personnel concerning intelligence \u009c and investigative initiatives. Ensure that command priorities are being \u009c carried out. Collection, Planning, and Operation Although ILP should not be considered a \"collection strategy,\" denoting an uncoordinated effort aimed at collecting information for the sake of collecting it, the capacity for an organization to collect pertinent information is vital to an ILP framework. Law enforcement agencies should ensure that they have the ability to collect information from the following sources: 3 Open sources \u0090 Community outreach \u0090 Acquisition and analysis of physical evidence \u0090 Interviews and interrogation \u0090 Financial investigations \u0090 Surveillance \u0090 Informants \u0090 Electronic surveillance \u0090 Undercover operations \u0090 The daily interaction that officers have with the community in terms of community-policing efforts, motor vehicle stops, and calls for service offers them a unique ability to gather information that may lead to identifying suspicious activity related to criminal or terrorist operations. 3 As with any other police operation, information collection efforts should always consider the ramifications related to privacy and civil rights issues. 270 of 74412 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led PolicingHowever, to ensure that collection activities are focused, they should be guided by: Analytical needs \u0090 Intelligence requirements \u0090 Investigative needs \u0090 Threat identification \u0090 Collecting information about the environment in which an agency polices allows for the interpretation of the threats that are occurring within the environment. The tasking and coordination group identified within the previous section can ensure that collection efforts within an organization are focused and conducted in a manner that is legal and ethical and adds value to the ILP effort. Analytic Capabilities In order for ILP to be successful, agency leaders must develop some level of analytic capability to support the identified agency priorities. These capabilities support the decision-making process by providing the right information to the right person, at the right time. There are several steps in the development of these capabilities, including: Collection Plan Development \u2014A collection plan identifies priority information that should be collected/gathered, outlines the process for gathering relevant information from all law enforcement sources, and describes how that information is developed into an intelligence product. Information collected is analyzed using the intelligence cycle, 4 and the reliable information is developed into intelligence products used to monitor and address the strategic priorities. Analysis\u2014As dictated by the collection plan, information is transformed into intelligence through analysis. This analysis connects the data through the linking of 4 A full description of the intelligence cycle is available in Appendix B. incidents, activities, or behaviors. The goal of analysis is to produce intelligence products that help the agency's decision makers identify potential or future threats, respond to relevant threats, understand potential issues, and plan for proactive action. Not every agency will have the ability to complete this phase. Agencies should partner with other organizations who may have the ability (i.e., fusion centers), and they should share their collected/gather information and receive analyzed products back. Intelligence Products \u2014Providing a mechanism to communicate the results of the analytic process, intelligence products are a key element in the ILP process. Agencies use a variety of intelligence products, including reports, Communities Against Terrorism Based on the community-policing concept, the State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training Program's Communities Against Terrorism program is a law enforcement resource tool to educate and engage the community, private sector, and public sector regarding suspicious activities. This program is funded by the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Call (850) 385-0600, extension 261, to receive a Communities Against Terrorism CD. For additional information regarding this program, please visit www.slatt.org 271 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 13briefings, and multimedia presentations. The effectiveness of intelligence reports is directly related to the quality of the information and analysis used. Ensuring the quality of these products should be an agencywide goal. Operational Responses\u2014The intelligence products better equip agency decision makers to provide operational direction and command. These products may help identify where potential threats currently exist or may occur; it is the decision maker's responsibility to develop an operational mitigation or response strategy. Often untapped for the development of operational responses, analysts can offer a unique perspective of the threat and can provide details to enhance the eventual response. Review of the Process\u2014Evaluation of the analytical process helps identify any new or emerging information gaps. The agency's ILP efforts will benefit from knowing whether the analytical process is addressing the appropriate issues, at the appropriate time, for the appropriate purpose. Additionally, it is important to gather feedback from the end-user of intelligence to help focus the product and ensure the final product has value. 5 Agency leaders are constantly required to make agency-impacting decisions. It is important that these decisions be informed decisions based on information gathered and analyzed through the analytical process. ILP provides the tools to make these decisions accurate, based on empirical data, rather than intuitive ideas. 5 Carter, David L., Ph.D. (2009). Law Enforcement Intelligence: A Guide for State, Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies , 2d. ed., Washington, DC: Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, U.S. Department of Justice, Chapter 6: \"The Implementation of Intelligence-Led Policing.\"Awareness, Education, and Training Agency decision makers should, at a minimum, obtain training regarding the intelligence process, indicators and warnings regarding potential criminal or terrorist activity, legal and privacy issues, and information sharing networks and resources. In order to learn more about ILP, leaders should review professional resources on ILP from BJA publications and training, 6 the NCISP,7 the National Criminal Intelligence Resource Center,8 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Lessons Learned Information Sharing System, 9 and the COPS-funded intelligence guide.10 As agencies adopt ILP, it is important that they implement a privacy policy, or if they have an existing policy, it should be reviewed and, if necessary, amended to ensure the protection of individuals' privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties so that they correspond with the ILP approach. Additionally, these policies and procedures should be reinforced throughout the agency so that personnel understand the importance and sensitivity of these issues. Using information from the training activities, decision makers should educate all of the agency personnel regarding information collection and sharing tenets as well as appropriate measures to safeguard and handle information. Depending on their responsibilities, agency personnel should also have in-depth training on how to collect information, how to analyze the information, how to develop intelligence products, and how to evaluate their work. ILP training goes beyond the classroom. Training agency personnel requires a coordinated, agencywide approach that involves daily awareness and education regarding the goals and objectives of ILP. 6 See http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bja, as well as the National Criminal Justice Reference Service at http://www.ncjrs.org./. 7 See http://www.it.ojp.gov/ncisp. 8 See http://www.ncirc.gov/. 9 See https://www.llis.dhs.gov/. 10 The guide may be downloaded from https://intellprogram.msu .edu/resources/publications.ph p. 272 of 74414 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led PolicingEnd-User Feedback One method of evaluating the success of the ILP implementation is to review end-user feedback concerning the process. End users come in a variety of forms, including the analyst who receives the raw data from the field, the commander who reviews the analytical product, the agency head who reviews intelligence products, and the officer in the field who receives orders based on the conclusions drawn from the intelligence. Each user has a unique perspective to provide. Incorporating this feedback into the evaluation process will help agencies improve their ILP process by continuously providing new information on which processes and products can advance, and users can see ILP implementation from the collection of information to the products resulting from this information. If intelligence products cannot be translated into operational and tactical strategies, then the products need to be redesigned. Reassessment of the Process Agency leaders must use an evaluation process to assess whether activities are being performed in a manner consistent with the identified strategic priorities. Using performance measures will provide a consistent method of evaluating program development progress. This evaluation will determine whether the agency's implementation of ILP is successful or whether adjustments to the ILP strategy need to made. Leaders must constantly evaluate the ILP outcomes to determine whether the implementation has allowed the agency to address its priorities. If so, the existing priorities must be adjusted to accommodate this accomplishment. If not, the ILP strategy should be attuned. This includes the identification of gaps throughout the process and a method to address and solve the identified issues. Additionally, leaders must also evaluate the effectiveness of the procedures and processes to ensure that they are performing efficiently. Ultimately, the goal of this evaluation process will be a stronger analytic capacity, better intelligence products, and better operational responses to identified issues. 273 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 15Challenges of Intelligence-Led Policing Implementation analytical component; however, not all agencies will employ all of the available analytical capabilities. Agencies can adopt analytical tactics that are relevant and necessary to meet their specific needs or leverage resources from other agencies and entities, such as fusion centers. Intelligence products do not have to be elaborate; they can be as simple as a daily briefing. Human resources \u0090 \u2014Rather than requiring additional manpower, ILP supports the existing staff by providing better intelligence to make more informed decisions. Just as in the case of CompStat's approach to crime control, ILP allows the agencies' manpower to be utilized in a coordinated fashion based on empirical knowledge that supports the organization's priorities in order to effectively manage threats. There are many challenges associated with implementing ILP. As stated earlier, there is no one type of ILP implementation. Although this makes the framework flexible for use in all types of agencies, it also provides some potential impediments, including: Sequence of implementation \u0090 \u2014Deciding the order of ILP implementation can be a daunting task. Small agencies or agencies with limited existing analytical functions may see this approach as overwhelming. It is important to remember that not all agencies will implement every piece of the ILP process. This approach allows agencies to choose those ILP steps that support their policing philosophy. Perception of a complicated analytical \u0090 function \u2014ILP does have a significant 274 of 74416 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led PolicingTimeliness of data, data accuracy, and \u0090 data review\u2014It is important that the data received be provided to the appropriate stakeholders in a timely fashion. It is also equally important to have a data accuracy evaluation and review process. ILP will not be effective with outdated and/or inaccurate data. Institutionalizing the process \u0090 \u2014It is essential that the tenets of ILP be consistently communicated throughout the agency. Without institutionalizing the process, personnel will not fully understand the benefits of this approach. Agency leaders should show personnel relevant results from using ILP. Agency business process \u0090 \u2014The agency executive should outline the existing agency business process and how ILP will be integrated into the process. Measuring performance \u0090 \u2014It is important to measure the effectiveness of any new initiative. To gauge the effectiveness of the ILP implementation, both the process and impact evaluations must be considered. The process evaluation focuses on how the initiative was executed and the activities, efforts, and workflow associated with the response. Process evaluations ask whether the response occurred as planned and whether all components worked as intended. Impact evaluations focus on the output of the initiative (products and services) and the outcome (results, accomplishment, impact). Once the evaluations are complete, the results should be used to improve the agency's ILP process.Conclusion In today's complex environment\u2014including constrained budgets, threats from criminals and terrorists, and concerns about privacy and civil liberties\u2014it is important for law enforcement agencies to do more with less. ILP enables law enforcement agencies to access and share comprehensive intelligence, and it helps to ensure that succinct and timely information is available to all decision makers. It provides agencies with the capability to draw meaningful conclusions from analyzed information and make strategic, operational, and tactical decisions for effective crime reduction and threat mitigation. The ILP framework requires a systematic implementation approach that is organized to avoid some of the common challenges and issues. Throughout the implementation of ILP, it is important to remember that ILP does not change the mission of the law enforcement agency; it changes how the law enforcement agency executes its mission. 275 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 17Appendix A: Additional ILP Case Studies Force Allocation A regional fusion center's analytical element provided \"hot spot\" analysis and criminal intelligence to a police executive responsible for policing a township burdened by violent crime, street gangs, and drug distribution. The executive applied the customized intelligence products to her crime control plan by allocating patrol and surveillance resources based on the temporal and spatial analytical assessments. The reliance on intelligence products to drive operational planning proved to be a more efficient and effective use of the agency's finite resources. 276 of 74418 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led PolicingPolicy Planning A senior-level law enforcement policymaker responsible for grant management, strategy, and funding sought the assistance of an intelligence unit to assess neighborhood violence across a region. The intelligence unit developed an information sharing process by which participating jurisdictions could record and exchange shooting information on victims who were struck by a projectile. The theory behind the project stemmed from the notion that shootings are the best indicator of violence as opposed to relying on murder data or assault data. Analysts viewing the exchanged information could now develop intelligence products identifying patterns in the modus operandi of shootings across a region and the demographics of each of the identified shooters and victims. The information proved to be instrumental in developing crime prevention and community outreach programs. Knowledge Transfer A local police commander returning to an investigative assignment after years of administrative work opted to rely upon her intelligence bureau to assist with her decision making. In her new assignment, she found herself faced with an investigative dilemma that required her to focus on crime guns entering her jurisdiction. When the commander was a field detective, crime guns entering her state had come from the southeast region of the country. By relying on the research and analysis of her intelligence bureau, she quickly learned that the trends present in this domain reflected crime guns entering her region from a neighboring state. The knowledge transfer provided by her intelligence bureau focused her investigative efforts and saved time and resources. Tactical Assistance Analysts from a regional fusion center, answering a Standing Information Need outlined by executive management and approved by their Governance Committee, collected and analyzed information related to recidivist offenders and street gang members. Their purpose was to reveal criminal relationships among street gang members and recidivist offenders responsible for violence in a specific area. The intelligence products published by these analysts were stored in a federal guidelines-compliant database and made available to uniform officers and investigators to query in support of tactical operations. On numerous occasions, queries from the field resulted in the development of lead information to develop criminal cases while aiding in officer safety efforts. Crisis Planning Law enforcement planners concerned that a Category 3 or higher hurricane hitting their coastline would overwhelm their capability to police a specific jurisdiction requested their analytical unit to assess the condition from a law enforcement perspective as opposed to an emergency management position. Analysts provided an intelligence product outlining significant challenges to police, which included displaced criminal groups in neighborhoods not capable of handling the influx, suppressing opportunities to loot and burglarize, and planning for the debilitating effect of the storm on present law enforcement logistics. The executive decision maker of the organization used the analytical product to exercise his force through a tabletop exercise that extended outside traditional emergency management exercises. 277 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 19An ILP Success Story A large metropolitan area with a county police force and more than 30 local law enforcement jurisdictions was experiencing an array of armed robberies. Over the course of three months, the number of robberies escalated, and at a countywide meeting, it was learned that several jurisdictions, primarily the county, had more than 40 similar robberies. The robberies involved numerous subjects in multiple vehicles. In the early morning hours, the armed subjects would approach businesses that were preparing to open\u2014primarily fast-food restaurants and grocery stores\u2014and as the employee would unlock the door, subjects would throw a block through the front glass as a diversion, force the employee(s) in, and rob them. All the robberies had occurred in one specific geographical area of the county. Detectives from five agencies were working the robberies independent of each other and had no physical evidence from which to make an identity. The agencies began conducting surveillances at other locations in their jurisdiction, but there was no clear direction or methodology, other than hoping the subjects would be encountered. Through the use of sources and tactical intelligence analysis, a pattern was discerned and information developed that demonstrated the possibility of subjects coming from another distinct area within the county. The analysis also showed a clear and concise connection between all the cases. Analytical and intelligence personnel were able to provide pattern analysis within one week and assist investigative personnel in developing an operational plan that would culminate in surveillances in an area several miles away from the surveillances of the businesses that could be potentially targeted. Initial reactions from investigative personnel and commanders were met with skepticism as to why the intelligence would lead to personnel not being near any of the potential targets, since it was clear that all the robberies were confined to a specific geographical area. Furthermore, the surveillances that were derived from the intelligence led the operations to be conducted on the midnight shift and holiday weekends\u2014all of which did not appear possible in the initial investigative findings of any of the agencies. Based on the intelligence, commanders implemented the surveillance as suggested, and within two days, two additional robberies occurred in an area of the county which had not been targeted and which was, in fact, in the completely opposite direction. However, since the intelligence-led surveillance directed personnel to an area of potential \"suspect\" activity, the surveillance teams were able to identify vehicles that were seen fleeing the robberies as they entered the area of the surveillance. Within moments, investigators were able to apprehend six subjects and recover weapons and currency, as well as clear or close more than 40 armed robberies that had taken place in a period of over three months. 278 of 74420 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 279 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 21Appendix B: Intelligence Cycle The production of criminal intelligence is accomplished by following the six steps of the intelligence cycle\u2014planning and direction, collection, processing/collation, analysis, dissemination, and reevaluation. The intelligence cycle used by the intelligence community is the foundation of the ILP framework; therefore, it is imperative to understand and follow each step in the cycle in order to develop and sustain an effective and efficient intelligence function. Step 1: Planning and Direction\u2014 Define intelligence requirements and develop an intelligence unit mission statement to guide intelligence efforts. Step 2: Collection\u2014 Gather raw data from multiple sources, including field reports, open The Intelligence Cycle 280 of 74422 Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policingsource records, the Internet, citizen accounts, informants, covert operations, and the media. Step 3: Processing/Collation\u2014 Evaluate the validity and reliability of the information; sort, combine, categorize, and arrange the data so relationships can be detected. Step 4: Analysis\u2014 Connect information in a logical and meaningful way to produce intelligence reports that contain valid judgments based on analyzed information. Step 5: Dissemination\u2014 Share timely, credible intelligence with other law enforcement, public safety, and private sector individuals/entities that have a right and need to know. Step 6: Reevaluation\u2014Evaluate the process performed and the products produced to assess effectiveness, efficiency, relevancy, and weaknesses. 281 of 744Navigating Your Agency's Path to Intelligence-Led Policing 23There are many ILP resources available, and it is important that these existing resources be reviewed and leveraged.

Sworn to protect and serve the public, la w enforcement faces a bleak outlook. The nation's law enforcement agenci es are confronting severe budget cuts and unmanageable layoffs, and they are fundamentally changing how they keep the public safe. COPS comp iled data from a number of current surveys and data sets, which show the imp act that the current economic climate has had on law enforcement agencies nationwide.** Layoffs, furloughs, and unfilled jobs mean less public safety By the end of the year, it's expected that nearly 12,000 police officers and sheriff's deputies will have been laid off. An estimated 28,000 officers and deputies have faced week-long furloughs in 2010. An estimated 53 percent of counties are working with fewer staf f today than just one year ago. 2011 could produce the first national decline in law enforcemen t officer positions in at least the last 25 years. 291 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Budget cuts have a heavy impact Over one-third of the agencies that applied for 2011 COPS officer hiring funding reported an operating budget drop of greater than 5 percent between 2009 & 2011. Nearly a quarter of American citi es surveyed have made cuts to public safety budgets. The delivery of law enforcement services will fundamentally cha nge as a result of today's economic climate Some agencies have stopped responding to all motor vehicle thefts, burglar alarms, and non-injury motor vehicle accidents. Agencies have also reported decreases in investigations of prop erty crimes, fugitive tracking, a variety of white collar crimes, and even low-level narcotics cases. Many agencies have greatly redu ced training opportunities for t heir officers. Investments in technology and co mmunications systems are being slashed in many agencies facing budget reductions. Sink or Swim; Scarcity of Resou rces Create Opportunities for Ch ange Bob Dylan sang in \"The times ar e a changing\" that \"Is worth sav in', then you better start swimmin', Or you'll sink like a stone, For the times they are a-changin'. Does tha t sound like your term as chief of police? My fellow chiefs, I'm here to tell you that if you haven't already begun the freestyle or butterfly, you may be up to your eyes in the flood of resource scarcity. 292 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Two things I've learned are that the recruitment brochure for c hief of police never mentions fiscal depravation nor diminishing resources. Doing more with less is an admirable quality and a courteous way of saying, the city is going broke. As good soldiers we accept it, look forward, a nd drive back to our office in the fleet of refurbished Crown Vics. Unfortunately, these are the times facing today's chiefs, and i n the spirit of Stalin's c ommand of \"not one step back\", we move onward with promises of reductions in social har ms while continuing to deliver a full menu of services. We are the chief of po lice, and be darn if our legacy is going to be recorded as one of mediocrity. The water is rising, so what a re we going to do? First, don't panic; unless your office has been relocated to a cardboard box under an overpass. Otherwise, stop, think and cr eate. Create opportunity and explore options outside the traditional framework of policing. Take a deep bre ath and dive into exactly what it is your agency is doing to ensure optimum efficiency of operations. What are officers responding to day after day. How is their time spent on shift, and is there a better, truly more effective alternative to deliv er policing services? Do you know what your top calls for service are? Looking back over the five years prior to my administration, we learned that false alarms, general information calls and unl ocking cars occupied three of the top five requests for service. We asked ourselves how could this be, and how lon g have we wasted resources responding to these calls? Did we ignore the calls for service? Of course not, but we did identify fiscally efficient solutions. We immediately stopped sending law enforcement officers as priority to these \"lock jobs\" and trained civilian staff such as Animal Control Offi cers to provide this courtesy. We identified frequent false alarms offenders and asked them to obtain vendor service upgrades. We also make them aware of the fine schedule for habitual offenses. To address the third category monopolizing our resou rces, we opted to route requests for general information to a supervisor's cell phone instead of asking an o fficer to meet them. Often times callers had questions concerned basic themes such as what time does city co urt open, and what to do if someone is bothering you. We are still delivering quality of life service s, but minimizing wasteful expenditures of policing energies. On the issue of threats to staffing allocations, there are vari ous formulas used to determine how many officers a jurisdiction requires. The IACP even avoids locking an agency into an arbitrary figure based on the popular but misdirected formula of 1 officer per 1,000 population. It is a very subjective guesstimate for determining the proper staffing levels, and has t oo many jurisdictionally speci fic characteristics to rely on a simple equation. Often staffing levels are deter mined by a city's budget toleran ce. Ask your city's administration or council how the current number of officers wa s determined. The common resp onse will be without scientific calculations or formulas, but that it was what they could afford. We chiefs as sume that prior to our arrival, some ingenious consideration of geography, census population, density, operati onal population, historical demands for service and potential responses to extenua ting circumstances synthesized to deliver an optimum staffing decision. Nope. Just the expense of personnel costs alone consumes the overwhelming majority of an agency's budget. Poorly performing or managed pension pl ans are costing agencies extrem ely high contribution percentages. Insurance rates, unemployment, earned leave and the overtime needed to cover those absences take a heavy toll on departmental budgets. Solution? After articulating to the city's administration your best argument based on quantitative information is shot down, accept it for what it is. You can either quit, or rise up to show why you were selected as the chief executive officer. Prioritizing resource allocations based on statistical analysis is critical. You will learn when officers are most and least need ed. This is similar to the cap italist model of on-demand production. Does it make sense to invent ory s now boo ts in June? 293 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] How do some businesses thrive in this economy while others fail ? The successful businesses seek quality-based operations, while eliminating w aste accumulated through traditi on. We must either work to eradicate the phrase, \"That's the way we always did it\", or learn the saying, \"Brothe r can you spare a dime?\" Consider the concept of \"lean\" pioneered by the Toyota Producti on System, and imagine it's application for addressing your lack of resour ces. Lean focuses on only those expenditures of resources bringing value to the customer. Any other effort is considered a waste of energy or expense, and is eliminated from the production model, i.e... cops unlocking cars. Success is built into the process up front; not hoped for after production begins. It is about delivering va lue to our consumers by using less effort. It is about working smarter than hard! Ronald Reagan said it is hard to drain the swamp when you are up to your armpits in alligators. The political, public and professional demands can be overwhelming, and data i s the best known alligator repellant. It is also the only way to effectively operate in today's climate of scarc e resources. Talking about diminishing assets, what happened to federal gran t money? Gone are the days of recurring grants and entitlement funds. Even congressionally earmarked monies a re limited for law enfor cement agencies. The post-911 windfall is a memory a nd the term \"competitive grant\" has never been a more accurate description. Agencies should consider combining multiple jurisdictions for projects meriting the awarding of limited grant funding. Academic partnerships are now required in many fundin g opportunities to ensure autonomous and credible reporting of program deliverables. Create opportuniti es for new partnerships by working with non- profits, academics and private businesses to help prepare the documents necessary and fresh perspectives sought out for competing with other age ncies over the dwindling pool o f monies. Partnerships are a difficult concept, but consolidation is a cu rse word chiefs refuse to utter. We are proprietary by nature. We define ourselves by the number of people we comm and. We keep our resources close so they are available when we want them. We do not surrender resources, we accumulate them. We must drop the proprietary posture and open ourselves to the possibilities of consolidation. Maybe using the term \"force multipliers\" will make it less pa inful and politically acceptab le. The continuing militarization of American policing through the creation of SWAT units is not justified by the steady decreases in their activations and increasing costs of e quipping and training. I'm not talking about the LAPDs or NYPDs, but the agencies where 6 of the 7 officers are SWAT. Because you put on black TDU pants and a tight black UA shirt while strapping on a thigh holster d oes not make you an operator. Consolidation of emergency response capabilities has become the model for local agencies, and provides a multiplier of resources in the rare times of need without draining an otherwise exhaust ed agency budget. Look for other consolidation options such as communications ope rations. Private businesses outsource call taking to foreign countries, is it such a stretch to assign cit y dispatchers to the county call center? How about fleet management and maintenance? Won't the same wrench used o n a public works truck work on a police cruiser? Seems like every agency has their own \"regional\" trai ning academy. Here's an idea. Agree upon a centrally located complex and provide officers the best trainers in the business by developing a cadre of dynamic instructors regardless what patch is on their shoulder. Information technology is anothe r budgetary black hole. I've i nstructed agencies around the country that have numerous neighboring agencies using the same CAD and RMS but on proprietary platforms that do not share data. The annual maintenance fe es alone make purchasing the be st software cost prohibitive, but seamlessly integrating your data and expenses through contractual cost sha ring makes previously unattainable system purchases a reality. Law enforcement is not and should not be a revenue generating p rofession. We are bound by the budgets and powers that be. Dehy drating peop le do not refuse water because it isn't iced tea. You use what it takes to get the m ission accomplished. Meanwhile be on the lookout for oppor tunity. Hint; you'll never see opportunity 294 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] with your head buried in your hands. It's out there, and it's up to the individual earning the honor of serving at the tip of the organization' s spear to lead the way. Progressively seek advice, actively listen to those who have retooled operations and achieved success, and purposefully avoid those who chose to sink beneath the tide bec ause of their refusal to release the weight of tradition or egotistical resistance to change. Is help on the way? Maybe and maybe that help is a pair of lea d-filled floaties. Don't risk it. Instead take the creative initiative by learning to swim, tread or surf in the c hange that is here. Creat e opportunities for success by peering outside the fraternal policing bubble. Inspire othe rs to multiply forces along the way to accomplishing multiple goals specific to maximizing energies ex pended serving the public. I'm not going to ask you to keep your head above the water, I'm extolling you to have fa ith and walk on top of it.

Closing Out a Grant Prior to end date (60-90 days), notify the Program Manager of r emaining balances Check requirements for the final fiscal and programmatic report s Non-profit guides (Grant-writing tools for non-profit organizations) Successful grant-writing involves solid advance planning and pr eparation. It takes time to coordinate your planning and research, organize , write and package your proposa l, submit your proposal to the funder, and follow-up. Preparation (planning and researc h) is vital to the grant-writi ng process. Solid preliminary work will simplify the writing stage. A well-written proposal follows the basic steps outlined below. Organize your proposal, pay attention to detail and specifications, use concise, persuasive writing, and request reasonable funding. Make sure the grant maker's goals and obje ctives match your grant seeking purposes. Clearly understand the grant maker's guidelines before you write your proposal. Always follow the exact specifications of the grant make rs in their applications, Reque st for Proposals (RFPs) and guidelines. Use these basic steps to guide you: 1. Prove that you have a significant need or problem in your propo sal. 2. Deliver an answer to the need, o r solution to the problem based on experience, ability, logic, and imagination throughout your proposal. 3. Reflect planning, research and vi sion throughout your proposal. 4. Research grant makers, including funding purposes and priorities, and applicant eligibility. 5. Determine whether the grant ma ker's goals and objectives math y our purposes. 6. Target your proposal to grant ma kers appropriate to your field and project, but do not limit your funding request to one source. 7. Contact the grant makers, before you write your proposal, to be sure you clearly understand the grant maker's guide lines. 8. Present your proposal in the appropriate and complete format, a nd include all required attachments. 9. State clearly and concisely your organization's needs and objec tives. Write well; use proper grammar and correct spelling. Prepare a n interesting and unique propos al. 10. Always cover the following important criteria: project purpose , feasibility, community need, funds needed, applicant accountab ility and competence. 11. Answer these questions: Who are you? How do you qualify? What do you want? What problem will you address and how? Who will benefit and how? What specific objectives will you accomplish and how? How will you measure your results? How does yo ur funding request com ply with the grant maker's pur pose, goals and objectives? 315 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 12. Demonstrate project logic and outcomes, impact of funds, and co mmunity support. 13. Always follow the exact specifica tions of the grant makers in their applications, Request for Proposals (RFP) and guidelines. 14. Contact the grant maker about the status, evaluation, and outco me of your proposal after it is submitted. Request feedback about your propo sal's strengths and weaknesses . Non-Profit Guidelines Full Proposal There are different forms and formats for full funding proposal s. Every funder has different guidelines and priorities, deadlines and timetables. Some funders accept a Co mmon Application Form (CAF), a single proposal accepted by a number of grant makers to help grant seekers save time and streamline the grant application process. Always follow the exact specifica tions of the grant makers in t heir grant applications, Request for proposals (RFPs) and guidelines. Full Proposals are generally a maximum of 15 pages (single-spaced) and include a Cover Letter, Cove r Sheet, Narrative, Budget, Qualifications, Conclusion and Appendices, as follows: Cover Sheet - a case statemen t and proposal summary; Needs Assessment - a concise dem onstration of the specific situation, opportunity, problem, issue, need, and the community your proposal addresses; Program Goals and Objectives - a succinct description of the pr oposed project/program's outcome and accomplishments in measurable terms, and how it matches the fu nder's interests; Methodology - a rational, direct, chronological description of the proposed project and the process used to achieve the outcome and accomplishments; Evaluation - the plan for meeting performance and producing the program/project; Budget/Funding Requirements - a realistic budget with a detaile d explanation of the funding request, committed matching funds, evidence of sound fiscal management, and long term funding plan; Qualifications - your organiza tions background, its funding history, board involvement and staff qualifications, and its capacity to carry out your proposal; Conclusion - a brief, concise summary of your proposal; Appendices - additional attachments required by the funder, such as proof of tax-exempt status, organizational and financial documents, staff/board lists, supp ort/commitment letters. Present your full proposal nea tly, professionally, and in an or ganized package. Type and single-space all proposals. Write, organize and present your proposal in the or der listed in the applica tion and guidelines. Only include the information and materials specifically requested by the grant maker. The proposal is judged on content and presentation, not weight. Unless required, do not include an index or table of contest, o r bind the proposal, and be sure to sign it and submit the number of copies requested by the grant maker. 316 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Sample Grant Proposal Over the years the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services (OC JS) has received requests from grant applicants for copies of successful grants , to tailor future proposals off these \"model\" grants.

Jones Director C O V E R L E T T E R 318 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] SUMMARY The Summerville Police Department, having served the City of Su mmerville for 147 years, is experiencing a high incidence of cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal problems among its sworn officer, resulting in fewer officers on the street. This problem has reached a point where public safety may be in jeopardy. Research shows that regular exercise will help keep law enforcement officer fit for duty. Project objectives include reducing by 20 percent the use of sick leave due to these probl ems. It is proposed that a fitness center be developed where Summerville officers can regularly exercise. This project involves the renovation of the basement of the Pol ice Department as a workout room, the purchase of exercise equipment, and training of all participants. The p roposed program will be conducted under the close supervision of medical and exe rcise professionals, with request ed funds totaling $33,696.00. Future maintenance of the project will be possible through appropriati ons from the Summerville City Council and volunteer fund-raising efforts carried out by the friends of th e Summerville Police Department. INTRODUCTION The Summerville Police Department began serving the City of Sum merville in 1865. It was in that year that Zeke Foster, on returning from military service in the War Betw een the States, was sworn in as the first chief of Police. Chief Foster was the only police officer until 1882, w hen the City Council appropriated monies to hire three additional officers to hel p keep order in the expanding community. Since the late 1880's, both Su mmerville and it Police Departmen t have continued to grow. The 2010 U.S. Bureau of Census figures indicate that Summerville has a population of 22,481. This represents a population increase of 15 percent over the 2000 census. New businesses an d industries, attracted by the ample labor force resulting from bankrupt farming, have provided an unexpected so urce of economic growth. To serve this community, the Summe rville Police Department now has 45 full-time sworn officers. The current police force is 65 percent male, 35 percent female. Exactly half are between the ages of 35 and 45. Of the remaining 50 percent, half are younger than 35 and half are old er than 45. The average tenure for officers is 18 years. All sworn personnel have completed the required basic law enfor cement training. Eighty percent of these officers have at least 120 hours of advanced training in such s ubjects as homicide investigation, accident investigation, SWAT techniques , baton and other non-lethal forc e, crime prevention and missing children investigation. The Summerville Police Department was one of only two Ohio law enforcement agencies that successfully underwent certification by the Na tional Council of Law Enforcem ent Excellence. This designation denotes that the Department has achieved excep tionally high standards of per formance in all six bureaus. In addition, fifteen officers have been awarded the Mayor's Medal of Merit for riski ng their lives to save others. PROBLEM STATEMENT One of the consequences of an experienced police force is that a number of officers have become statistically more likely to suffer from health problems, most notably muscul o-skeletal and cardio-vascular problems. A recent examination of employee absentee records revealed that 3 3 percent of all sworn pe rsonnel have missed at least 15 days in previous calendar year. On closer, examinatio n of the records, it was discovered that the sick leave was used for heart attacks, arteriosclerosis, back proble ms, torn ligaments and tendons, pulled muscles and other fitness-related conditions. Contact with Morgan Feinberg, N.D. revealed that the officers h e treated suffered from health problems including all the above conditi ons. Similar contact with other Summerville area physicians confirmed this pattern. S U M M A R Y / I N T R O D U C T I O N P R O B L E M S T A T E M E N T 319 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] In a recent presentation to the Summerville Police Department e xecutive staff, Dr. Farron Updike of the Department of Exercise Physiology at the University of Summervi lle stated that the majority of work-related musculo-skeletal problems are preventable through a regular reg imen of weight training. Citing the works of Baker (2010) and Oldfield (2011), Dr. Updike indicated that exe rcise to stretch and to ne body musculature at least three times per week will reduce these problems by a stat istically significant margin. He also stated that the same is true of cardio-vascular disease: aerobic exercise a t least three times a week will significantly reduce the incidence of heart and other circulatory disorders in any n on-smoking adult population. Research on job-related health problems among law enforcement o fficers mirrors what occurs in general population. In a task analysis of police officers, Lewis (2011 ) documented the regular necessity to run, jump and lift. All these activities contribute to the need for exce ptional fitness. Conversely, where such fitness is absent among police officers, the likelihood of cardio-vascular and musculo-skeletal problems increases. Draught (2010) discovered that police officers that exercise re gularly, whether on their own or as part of a department fitness program, experienced significantly less card io-vascular and musculo-skeletal problems than officers who did not regularly work out. When law enforcement officers ar e off work, whether for health problems or other reasons, the community they serve is at greater risk of criminal victimization. One Study (Fisk, 2011) shows that the response time for police-related 911 calls is significantly longer when shifts are staffed at below recommended strength. A closely related problem is the added stress suffered by officer s who must try to serve the community short- handed. Another line of research on the consequences of under-staffed f orces explored the ability of officers to engage in proactive policing. Traditionally, when officers are not respo nding to assigned calls, t hey patrol designated areas in an attempt to proactively enforce laws. However, when a substantial number of officers are off work due to health problems, the remaining officers are barely able to handle assigned calls. The most important consequence of having a substa ntial number of disable officers off work, then, is a community whose safety needs are not being met. In the most extreme cases such as tho se detailed by Farber (2010), the issue becomes one of life and death. OBJECTIVES Given the importance of making steady, incremental progress tow ard employee health, it is unlikely that demonstrable results will be possible in the first year. Durin g the first year, emphasis will be placed on setting up the project, evaluating the pre-program health of the partic ipants and training various participants. To assess the extent to which the proposed project remedies the problems noted above, it will be necessary to quantify the results to measure the project's effectiveness. T he following are the project objectives: A. To reduce the use of employee sick leave for cardio-vascular pr oblems by 20% during the second full year of the project. On the basis of organizational health studies by Grafmiller et. al. (2010), there is reason to believe that a regular exercise program such as that proposed in this project will result in a 20-25% decrease in the amount of requested sick leave due to cardio-vascular illness. B. To reduce the use of employee sick leave for musculo-skeletal problems by 40% during the second full year of the project. Research undertaken at University of Stockholm's Institute for Adult Health Studies (Lindstrom et al, 2012) revealed that the effects of regular weight training are dramatic or even adults who have not been involved in any type of fitness regime. As compared to the con trol subjects, who were identical to the experimental subjects in all respects? Lindstrom's subjects cut in half the amount of time off work due to illness and injury. OB J E C T I V E S 320 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] C. To lower the average resting pul se of unfit employees by five b eats per minute. Studies by Moritz, Delker, and St orer (2011) and Pratt (2012) s uggest that eight months of regular fitness training, on average, lowers the pre-program resting pulse rate by 20%, or 16 beats per minute for the individual whose original resting pulse was 80. The subjects i n this study, however, consisted of adult males between the ages of 18 a nd 35. Given the fact that the S ummerville officers are older than Pratt's subjects, a more conservative objective has been chosen. PROJECT DESCRIPTION The proposed project is comprised of several different, but related activities: A. Physical Evaluation of the Officers The first component of this project is the physical examination of all Summerville P.D. sworn employees. Of special interest for purposes of the project are resting pulse rate, target pulse rate, blood pressure and percentage of body fat of the program participants. Dr. Feinbe rg will perform the physical examinations of all participating officers. The measurement of body fat will be conducted at the Unive rsity of Summerville's Health Center under the direc tion of Dr. Farron Updike. B. Renovation of Basement Another phase of this project i nvolves the renovation of the ba sement of police headquarters. The space is currently being used for storing Christmas decorations for City Hall. The main storage room will be c onverted into a gym. This room will accommodate the Universe weight machine, the stationery bike, the treadmill and the rowing mach ine. Renovation will consist of first transferring all the Christmas decorations to the basement of t he new City Hall. Once that is accomplished, it will be necessary to paint the walls, install indoor/outdoor carpeting and set up the equipment. A second, smaller room will be converted into a locker room. R enovation will include painting the floors and the installation of lockers and benches. To complete the fitness center, a third basement room will be e quipped as a shower room. A local plumber will tap into existing plumbing to install several showerheads. C. Purchase of Fitness Equipment The Department of Public Safety has identified five vendors of exercise equipment in the greater Summerville area. Each of these vendors' submitted bids for th e following equipment: Universe Weight Machine Atlas Stationary Bike Yale Rowing Machine Speedster Treadmill D. Training of Officers Participating officers must be trained in the safe, responsible use of the exercise equipment. Dr. Updike of the University of Summerville will hold periodic training sessi ons at the department's facility. EVALUATION To determine whether project objectives are being met, Dr. N. C runcher of the Department of Statistics at the University of Summerville will formally evaluate the project. The evaluation Dr. Cruncher has proposed consists of two strategies for assessing project success: A. Process Evaluation It is necessary to determine the extent to which the officers h ave been adequately evaluated prior to beginning the fitness program. It will also be necessary to en sure that participating officers are working out P RO J E C T D E S C R I P T I O N EV A L U A T I O N 321 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] the required three times per week. If the evaluator determines that any of these conditions are not being met, he will advise the project director who will correct the problem. B. Outcome Evaluation Of primary interest is whether the proposed fitness regimen actually improves the fitness of officers and reduces their time off from work. T o determine the extent to w hich the project is responsible for the improved fitness to the officers, Dr. Cruncher will collect extensive data on the pre-project health statistics of the participants. Variables will include resting pulse, tar get pulse, blood pressure, percentage of body fat, and the maximum amount of weight the participants can safely an d comfortable bench press. At six-week intervals throughout t he project period, Dr. Cruncher will collect the same data on all participants. The pre- and post- project data will be compared using t-tests and analysis of variance. FUTURE FUNDING Despite the fact that most of the costs involve one-time purcha ses, it will be necessary to p lan for future funding of certain aspects of the proj ect. These costs include mainten ance of the fitness equipment, periodic training of new officers in the proper uses of equipment, and supplies such as towels and soap. The Summerville City Council has indicated that if the project is funded, it will appropriate maintenance. A similar commitment from the Frie nds of the Summerville Police D epartment will ensure that the Department can sustain the project in the future.

I offer the following comments in support of the program. Our board has had a number of discussions with the Chief of Pol ice and the Director of the Department of Public Safety. We informed them that while we wholeheartedly s upport their idea, our organization cannot fund a project of this magnitude. We are, however, in a position to fund the maintenance of the project once the major objectives have been accomplished. We therefore support the Summerville Police Department Fitness Project and hope you w ill act favorably on their requests. Sincerely, Ida Mae Tucker Chairperson A Nonprofit Service Organization L E T T E R O F S U P P O R T 324 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Grants 101 with Sarah Wilson - ' Tis the Season... Lessons Lear ned Add PoliceGrantsHelp on Facebook and visit our blog so we can help you get what you need The team at PoliceGrantsHelp is pretty lucky. What I mean to say is we have the privilege of talking to offic ers every day about their department needs, what's going on in their communities, a nd ultimately their grant projects. Taking into account all the conversations we have had over the past year, the re are a number of trends we se e for departments who are successful when it comes to following through with a grant project. As we embark on a new grant year - here are some lessons learne d from the team at PGH for your department to plan for as you start navigating grants for 2013. Lesson Learned #1: A Top Priority for the Department? Have you asked permission? What I mean to say is before you sta rt looking into grants to fund a project, do the \"powers that be\" (Chief, Mayor, etc.) know you are looking into this project? Grants are a legal, binding contract between the grant maker and your department. Grants re quire a partnership on behalf of the department that includes some kind of match (cash or in kind services) and reporting requirements. Let's say you believe that drugs a re the biggest problem impact ing your community and you think your department needs thermal imaging equipment to counter this issu e. Coincidentally, your department also identified a drug problem through the most recent strategic planning session. Knowing this, they have elected/delegated/volunteered you to research and put together a grant proposal to apply for thermal-imaging cameras. This is of course an i deal scenario and I recognize it doesn't always happen this way. At least you know that all of your efforts to look into and secure funding won't be wasted when you find out that there are about 5 other projects ahead of yours that the department has e lected to focus on. Some things to think about: When was the last time your department did any planning or strategic thinking? Is the identified problem and solution included as part of this pl an? Do you have permission to apply for grants on behalf of the department? Lesson Learned #2: Identify the Problem You know that your department has a need for equipment, training, programs etc. - but what grant makers (or any funding sources) want to know is what problem this grant re quest will solve in your community. The first question we ask every departmen t is: What will happen in your c ommunity if you do not get this equipment, training, etc.? What will be the impact if you receive this fun ding? What will happen if you do not? Cause and effect. For example - say your department needs a thermal imaging camer a. You have this need because there is a problem with drugs in your comm unity. You have done your homework and gathered data that proves there is an increase or \"hotspots\" for drugs in your community. Therefor e, the problem is drugs and its impact on the community. One solution is to patrol the rural areas with therm al imaging cameras where drugs are being distributed. Thermal imaging cameras will enable your officers to identify and apprehend drug suspects, thus decreasing the distribution of drugs in your community. The equipment you wish to purchase or the programs you seek to fund are considered the \"solution\" to a problem. To determine the appr opriate funding source, your department must first define the problem to justify the need. 325 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Lessons Learned #3: Data Support You know you have a problem; you see it every day in your commu nity. The thing is, the funding source for the grant most likely doesn't live or work or patrol in your commun ity. You need to demonstrate that there is in fact a problem not just by identifying it (reference Lessons Learned 1 and 2) but by supporting the claims. Using our example from Lessons Learned 1 and 2, let's say that drug arrests were the largest percentage of Part I Crimes, patrol/criminal arrests made in the past 3 years for your department. You would reference this data to support the claim that drugs are in fact a problem in your community. Another data source is to contact community partners such as the local hospital to see how many drug related emergencies have occurred over the same timeline. Is there a trend of increasing drug overdoses co rresponding with drug arrests? If yes, then you have 2 data resources justifying your claim. When you identify a problem to justify a need think to yourself : \"Where can I find data to support this claim?\" Make sure your data reinforces y our identified problem. We have created a data reference guide to direct you with some ideas: www.policegrantshelp.com/grant-data-collection/ Lesson Learned #4: Find the Right Grant Ok - so you've identified the problem, you've found the solutio n, you have data to support this claim, you have sign off from top brass, phew - now what? NOW you can look for funding. The reason we suggest going this route is to make sure you have e verything you will need to matc h your department with the right grant. Quite honestly reading the RFP (request for proposal) also know n as the Solicitation is the best way to determine what grant will work for your department. You will wa nt to focus on whether or not your department is eligible to apply, when the grant is due, how much you can a pply for, as well as the application requirements. If the grant is currently not open for applications, request a copy of the previous year RFP. Contact a person listed on the past RFP to inquire if that grant program will be re-issued. This will he lp you plan ahead as you start gathering information for when the grant does open. Building upon what we learned fro m Lessons 1-3 above, let's say we are in a community with an identified and data supported drug problem. Our solution to this problem is to supply thermal-imaging cameras to apprehend suspects and counteract drug sales and distribution. A good gra nt for this is going to be something like the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program or a local Community Development Grant that suppor ts Crime Reduction. So where can you find these target ed grant opportunities? Some of the places you can find them are www.policegrantshelp.com/ , grants.gov/, and foundationcenter.org/ (access at your local library for free). Next Steps Let's be honest - grants are te dious and time consuming. The fl ip side is they are incredibly rewarding. The team here is ready to support you through your project and provide as many resources as possible in the coming year. We try to post as many grant opportunities as possible on Polic eGrantsHelp. You can also ask questions on our policesafetygrants.blogspot.com/ , our Facebook page or receive new grant ale rts announcements by signing up to be a member of PGH. If you are interested in talking to us in person or getting training - here is a list of where we will be in 2013. 326 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Gathering the right data to write a grant with Sarah Wilson According to Denise Schlegel, Supe rvisory Instructor at NCTC an d Grants Consultant with Allutiq, grants are defined as \"a negotiation through analysis, skill in problem so lving, professionalism through project design and lots of good, old fashioned effort.\" Most of the effort Denise refers to happens in the preparation for the grant. Defining your organization by taking basic data about your depa rtment, the community you serve and trends in call statistics can build the b asis for a successful grant appl ication. The first thing you will need to do before writing your proposal is gather the documentation or data to support your proposal request. If you are part of a small department wi th no staff, a knowledgeable chief, city leader or board member are the logical resource for this information. If you are in a larger agency, there should be administrative, operational and financial support staff that ca n help you. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of data you should collect prior to beginning your grant project. This information is useful for all organizations in the data collection process and can be the starting point for all future grant applications. Mission Statement/Vision Statement It is important that you have a good sense of how the grant project fits with the mission and vision of your agency. A mission statement shoul d clearly define your organiza tions purpose whereas a vision statement describes a realistic desired outcome of your organization. Col lecting background data on your organization and on the needs to be addressed will help document your arguments for funding. Funders want to know that a project they might fund reinforces the overall direction of you r public safety organization. Strategic Plan Individual public safety agencies may not have their own strate gic plan, but the community, county, or city you service should have one. Most chambers of commerce have a strat egic plan as do offices of emergency services. Make sure you get a copy of the plan to find out where your ser vice fits and more importantly if you are set up to respond accordingly. A lot of organizations you work with ha ve already done the strategic planning \u2014 so tap into that work. Demographics The demographics of your response area are going to be a substa ntial data resource within your grant application. You have more than likely drawn conclusions about why your area has seen an increase in call volume \u2014 demographic trends w ill help support these conclusions . To research and describe the demographics of the community you serve \u2014 population, economy, geography, and community issues \u2014 you can find from factfinder2.census.gov. Decision Makers and Financing In order to get anywhere with grants you need to know who to kn ow in order to get support for your project. The decisions in your department coul d be made by your chief, a com mission, a board of directors or even city leaders. Try to find out who makes the decisions for programs a nd equipment and how that selection is made. These decisions should be based on the community needs, departm ent needs or ideally both. The final decision maker should be the person who si gns your grant \u2014 make sure you have access to them. Many of the private foundations will request copies of an organ izational chart, biographies and current job descriptions. At a minimum you should include the decision-make rs and their direct reports. Generally human resources or administrative personnel can assist you with obtai ning this information. All grant applications will ask for a project budget. You will need to show why you do not have budget for this grant project. Before you do that, do some due diligence on how your department is financially supported. How 327 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] is your operating budget financed ? Is it through taxes, bonds, donations? Make sure you get a copy of your most recent annual budget from your chief, accounting department or city manager. Community Services and Grant History Your department is providing a number of services to your community. These could include K9, Narcotics, SROs, First response, Disaster Response, etc. Make a list of al l the services your organi zation currently provides or is expected to provide. Find out if any programs have been the result of grants funding and if any community organizations were included as part of this project. This will help you figure out your organizations grant history and if you have ever been funded before. You should have an idea at this point as to what other funders have given your organization money \u2014 private donations, corporate donations or other state or federal funds. Equipment Think about the equipment and new programs that are of interest to your organization. Prioritize them in a list. Now, what equipment in this list will you need to make your grant project successful? Equipment included as part of a grant application should directly assist in solving the problem in your community you are addressing. Sustainability Last and most importantly, think about how your organization will sustain/fund the new equipment or program after the grant. Talk to the per son who manages the department budget. You want to make sure your department considers the budget beyond the grant funding timeframe and bui ld in funding for things like replacements, insurance costs, training, upgrades or repairs. Conclusion While tedious and a bit time consuming, this data-gathering pro cess makes the actual grant writing much easier. Involving other vested interest parties in the process helps ke y people within your agenc y seriously consider the project's value to the organization.

Take advantage of Mr. Paddock's wealth of grants knowle dge and experience so that your department is well prepared for the grant seeking and application process, giving you the best chance for a successful grant submission. Where does grant funding come from? Public safety funding comes from two primary sources, the Depar tment of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice. Although a dditional funding for various elements of public safety may come from other agencies, these two provide the bulk of funding to police depar tments across the country. The funding actually comes through grant programs administered by each of these agencies. Most grant programs are focused on a partic ular issue, topic, or agency ty pe, such as the Methamphetamine Enforcement Grants or COPS Technology Grants, but other grants may be more general, as the Homeland Security Grants Program and Justice Assistance Grants demonstrate. Who can receive funding? While all types of organizations are eligible to receive fundin g, eligibility to apply for and receive funding through a grant program is usually established by the authorizi ng statute that defines that program. The Small Business Innovation Research grants are set aside for small bus inesses, for example, while the Public Safety Interoperable Communications grants could go to nearly any agen cy engaged in a public safety function. How can I apply for a grant? Any agency engaged in public safety can apply for a grant. The important first step is to identify the best program to apply under. Several elements will determine whether a particular program is a good fit for your project, including: Total funding available - gives you an idea how broad the progr am will be and how competitive Application burden - some programs require 100 page narrative, while others may look for 10 pages or less. Matching requirements - some pr ograms require a dollar for doll ar match, while others may require a 5% match or no cost sharing at all. Scale - your customer probably won't want to write 100 $5,000 r equests to get a $500,000 project funded. Collaboration/partnering requirements - some grants application s require an organization to work in collaboration with others, which complicates the application pr ocess. Lead time - more lead time generally means more time to develop the project - six weeks is good, and three weeks is almost essential. Track record with the funder - gen erally more important for loc al funders than federal sources, but a consideration nonetheless. Once you've decided upon a program that fits with your project objectives, you'll need to prepare an application to the program. Be sure to follo w all the application requirements provided by the agenc y, since a failure to do so may result in your proposal being returned without review. 329 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] What happened to the Public Safety Interoperability Communicati ons (PSIC) Program? The PSIC program was only ever intended to be a one-time opport unity to share in $1 billion in funding. However, the Interoperable Emergency Communications program (au thorized in the Recommendations of the 911 Commission Act of 2007) mirrors the PSIC program and could provide up to $400 million each year through 2012. How can I find out what was funded? The federal government provides information on funding at www.usaspending.gov . How long does it take from the t ime I submit a grant until I ge t funded? Although there is no statutory decision timeframe for most grants (an exception would be the Homeland Security Grants Program), agencies generally announce awards 4- 6 months after the application deadline. How soon can I begin spending the money after I receive the awa rd notification? After you receive an award notif ication, but before you can beg in spending money, you will need to enter into a contract with the funder that defines the payment and deliverab les schedule for the grant period (based largely on your application). Once the contract has been executed by bo th parties, you can begin to spend money, subject to the terms of the contract. How can I get reviewers' comments for an unfunded proposal? Reviewers' comments provide a valuable insight into the strengths and weaknesses of your proposal, as determined by individuals using the actual scoring criteria for the program. If you have any inkling of applying again in the future, it's worth requesting the reviewers' comments on your proposal. Generally you can obtain these co mments by simply calling the p rogram officer listed on the application guidance. If they are unresponsive, you can send a letter to the program officer requesting the reviewers' comments. Be sure to include the CFDA number and title for the program, your agency's DUNS number, and the title of the project you proposed. If you copy your Congres sional representative on the letter as well, the Congressional staff can help you follow up. How can I tell how competitive a grant program is going to be? Although you can divide the previous year's number of awards by the number of applications (if those numbers are publicly available) to get a funding percentage, you can generally determine how competitive a grant will be just by looking at how much tota l funding is available. Programs with less than $10 million available nationwide will be more competitive than one with $500 million to give awa y. How do I figure out a whol e matching requirement? Matching requirements can be tricky, because they are usually calculated as a function of the total program budget (the matching funds you provide PLUS the grant award), u sing the following formula: Grant award + Matching funds = Total project Since your matching requirement is based on the total project c ost (NOT on the amount you're requesting from the funder), the formula for your matching requirement based on your award will be as follows: Award amount \u00f7 (1-required matching % as a decimal) x required matching % as a decimal. Where do I find information on grant sources and programs? In addition to the information on policegrantshelp.com, the fed eral government provides grants information through the Federal Electronic Grants Clearinghouse at www.grants.gov . Grants Office LLC also provides 330 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] federal, state, and foundation information along with a variety of tools to manage and enhance your grantseeking activities on its Upstream\u00ae O nline Knowledge Base at www.grantsoffice.com . Who can I contact about a particular program? Each program is assigned a program manager, identified in the application guidance, who can answer most questions about the mechanics of a particular program. For stra tegy questions, contact the Cisco Grants Support Program through your Cisco account manager (if the project is t echnology-oriented) or the Grants Office helpdesk at 585-473-1430. Do I need to hire a professional grant writer? There is no requirement in any grant program that you have to h ire a professional grant writer in order to obtain funding. When considering whether to hire a professional grant writer to provide assistance in applying for a grant, consider: Your available time to dedicate to reviewing the application requirements and preparing all the required documentation Your ability to articulate the project vs. explaining it to som eone else who will then articulate it Your agency's access to a grant writer and ability to pay a fee for the writing. Reputable grant writers will require an upfront fee for writing a grant proposal. Be wary of any writers who try to take a percentage of your award as payment. What is required to administer a grant once I get funded? Administration requirements vary by program, but most include t he following activities: Contract negotiation Project work plan development Training for those participating in grant-funded activities Financial, activity, and outcome reporting to the funder at reg ular intervals. Police Grants Help 101 STRATEGIC POSITIONING Look at your budget: Departments can sabotage themselves because of how line items are listed in their budget. There is a clause attached to most Federal and State grants tha t state you cannot supplant funds. This means that if your budget has a line item for a new vehicle and you get a grant, which gives you that vehicle, you will still have to buy that vehicle. You ca nnot transfer the money intende d for that vehicle to another line item and use the money budgeted for something else. Set aside funding for matching dollars: While it may surprise you, coun tless fire and EMS agencies cho ose not to pursue grant funding for department projects. Whether your d epartment needs NFPA compliant PPE, new fire apparatus, advanced life support equipment or funding to hire additional staff, grants can help bridge the gap between a budget shortfall and successfully funding your project. Most grant programs have specific eligibility requirements and are often intended to provide funding for a pa rticular operational area of your department. Careful grant research will ensure that your department's proje ct meets any program requirements. Record and Report: Something very critical to grants is statistical data and reco rd keeping. Keep a record of everything that your department does and keep it updated regula rly. In addition, maintain reporting to state and federal agencies is necessary c omponent in the grants process. This is especially true in law enforcement where how much you are legible to receive is based on a formula used by computing your Uniform Crime Index numbers vs. your population. 331 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Use generic terms like \"equipment\" in budget line items. This way if you get the grant you will still be able to use the money towards another piece of equipment and would not be violating the supplanting rule. FORMING A GRANTS TEAM Pick the internal right skillsets: Look for interested motivated members of your organization. A good team will consist of someone from each t he following areas: accounting, o perations, training, and management. Think about the external impact: Who and what are the organiza tions and individuals that will be impacted if your department is awarded a grant. Individuals and organizatio ns who have had a chance to participate in planning are much more likely to cooperate with efforts to run a grant program and a lot less likely to file a complaint with the city council or media. Try to identify those who will benefit from the proposed project and leverage these organizations for input DUNS NUMBER Duns Universal Numbering System: Since 2003, the Federal Government has required all applicant s and recipients of Federal funding to obtain a DUNS number. The Duns Universal Numbering System allows the government to track where federal money is being distributed an d how it's being utilized. It can take 24 - 48 hours to get a DUNS number. If you need one call 866-705-5711 or apply online at fedgov.dnb.com/webform NIMS COMPLIANCE National Incident Management System Compliance: NIMS is a comprehensive, na tional approach to incident management that is applicable to all jurisdictional levels acro ss all functional disciplines. Departments must participate in NIMS in order to qualify for DHS grants after Oc tober 1, 2006. The intent of NIMS has two parts . 1) Be applicable across a full spectrum of potential incidents and hazard scenarios, regardless of size or complexity and 2) improve coor dination and corporation between public and private entities in a variety of domestic incident management a ctivities. It is highly recommended that departments follow current and future instructions issued by the NIMS Integration Center . You should be full prepared in any grant applicati on to discuss and relate your ag ency's compliance with NIMS. National Incident Management System, An Introduction - IS 700 is offered free of charge through the Emergency Management Institute FINDING FUNDING Grant Resources: There are many grants available to law enforcement agencies th roughout the year. These grants are from the Federal, S tate, and Local governments as we ll as Corporations and Foundations. Once your grant strategy has been set up and identified, it's time to search for available grant opportunities. Use the PoliceGrantsHelp.com search engine to locate available gran ts. You can perform a search by category (Federal, State or Corporate) or by selecting your state on our interactive grant map to show all available opportunities.

You may find a pdf version of the proposed budget here. This document includes proposed expenditures for all expansi ons, reductions and new initiatives for 2012. It is recommended that every police department considering grant app lications in 2013 review this document and then monitor the progress of the 2012 FY Federal budget outcomes. T he six proposed appropriation accounts are as follows: Salaries and Expenses of the adm inistrative function of the Office of Justice Programs Justice Assistance responsibility State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Juvenile Justice Programs Public Safety Officer's Benefits Crime Victim's Fund Please keep in mind this draft budget may go through a lot of c hanges prior to final approval by Congress but now is a good time to take a look at the proposed programs for law enforcement and related fields. The budget must be reviewed by both the US House and Senate and then retur n to the President's Office for signature. Once the budget and the proposed grant funding have been authorized, it may then be posted as a grant announcement. You may find the US Department of Justice grant announcements b y visiting www.ojp.gov or for a more complete federal listing of all grants at www.grants.gov . Please review the document referenced above for complete detail s about the proposed grant funding amounts within the 2012 Proposed Document. According to the draft budge t plan, OJP proposes to continue to address the following key areas for increasing public safety and improv ing fair administration of justice across America. 1) Violence, Gangs, and Drugs While the nation as a whole is m aking modest progress in reduci ng violent crime rates, many communities and areas are struggling with violent crime issues, especially when commingled with the problems of gangs and drugs. Targeting \"high impact players\" is an effective strategy for preventing and reducing future crimes. Community-based strategies that bring together law enforcement with other community g roups and institutions to coordinate activities to halt the spread of violence also pr oduce safer communities. OJP will promote multi- jurisdictional, multidivisiona l, and multi-disciplinary program s and partnerships that increase the capacity of communities to prevent and control these serious crime problems. 2) Law Enforcement and Information Sharing Law enforcement in the United St ates, unlike in most other indu strialized countries, has several levels and is comprised of thousands of federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. Ensuring that all elements of the justice community share information, adopt the best practices, and resp ond to emerging issues with the same level of effectiveness and timeliness is a daunting task. OJP is providi ng national leadership and serving as a resource for the justice community throug h the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative, among others, that focuses on defining core justice information sharing requirements and identifying challenges and solutions. 3) Tribal Justice Violent crime rates in Indian Country are unusually high, yet t ribal law enforcement resources are typically scarce, a problem exacerbated by the geographic isolation and/o r vast size of many reservations. OJP targets 333 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] these conditions with training a nd resources for problem-solving courts and coordinated law enforcement information sharing and data collection. OJP will continue to coordinate with the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs and other agencies to bring better focus to these issues. 4) Forensics, DNA, Missing Persons, and Cold Cases From crime scene to courtroom, forensics plays a vital role in the criminal justice system. OJP develops forensic tools and technologies that will save time and money, initiates evaluations to better unde rstanding the impact of forensic science, provides technology assistance and training, and enhances laboratory capabilities and capacity. OJP funds these activities in order to bolster the investigative power of forensics, thereby supporting the successful and informed use of DNA and other forensic evidence in court and improving the administration of justice. 5) Offender Reentry Repeat offenders who cycle in a nd out of the justice system commit a significant portion of all crime and drive up the cost of operating justice agencies. These offenders often have risk factors such as mental health problems and substance abuse, limited e ducation and literacy, inadequate job skills, and a lack of positive support systems that, if addressed, reduce the likelihood of re-offending. OJP can address these issues with three strategies: 1) community-based options for less serious offenders, such as pro blem-solving courts; 2) intensive, multiphase reentry programs for those who are incarcerated; and 3) researc h to determine effective strategies for prisoner reentry programs. 6) Juvenile Delinquency, Prevention, and Intervention Our nation faces many challenges related to juvenile delinquenc y, including youth gangs and high juvenile recidivism rates. OJP strives to strengthen the capability and capacity of our juvenile-justice system to confront these challenges through prevention and intervention. OJP is wo rking to prevent and reduce youth involvement in gangs by addressing specific risk and protective factors ass ociated with the likelihood of delinquent behavior and the needs and desires that underlie the decision to join a gang. 7) Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Every day, thousands of childre n and teens go online to researc h homework assignments, play games, and chat with friends. And, everyday, sexual predators roam the Internet , posting and/or looking for child pornography and soliciting minors to engage in sexual activity. Not only ar e these sex-related crimes intolerable, they pose formidable challenges for law en forcement, which must adapt its investigative techniques to a constantly evolving array of technology. One way OJP addresses the proliferation of internet crimes against children is through its ICAC Task Forces, which help state and local law en forcement agencies develop an effective response to cyber enticement a nd child pornography cases. 8) The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Ac t) The Recovery Act was signed into law by President Obama on Febr uary 17, 2009. It is a n unprecedented effort to jumpstart our economy, create or save millions of jobs, and put a down payment on addressing long-neglected challenges so our country can thrive in the 21st century. The A ct is an extraordinary response to a crisis unlike any since the Great Depression, and includes measures to modernize our nation's infrastructure, enhance energy independence, expand educational opportunities, preserve and improve affordable health care, provide tax relief, and protect those in greatest need. The Recovery Act injected $ 787 billion into the economy, providing jobs and much needed resources for states and local co mmunities. Among t hese resources was more than $4 billion for state and local law enforcement and other criminal and juvenile justice activities, including $2.76 billion for OJP programs. In FY 2009, OJP awarded over 3,800 additional grants to carry o ut the terms of the Recovery Act, which is more than the total number of a wards made in FY 2008. However, making awards is only one part of administering a grants program. These additional awards will al so drive a significant increase in workload throughout the lifetime of the g rants. Each grant will require programmatic and financia l monitoring, training and technical assistance, outreach, auditing, etc. The Recovery Act grants will generally have periods of 334 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] performance of three or four year s, with the programmatic and financial closure of the grant occurring in the following year. This means the additional workload and resultin g resource challenges associated with the Recovery Act will last approximately five years for OJP, at lea st through FY 2013. In addition to the workload increase resulting from the number of additional grant awards, OJP provided over 1,700 awards to localities that had never received a Justice A ssistance Grant award. These new recipients will require a significantly higher level of support (outreach, training and technical assistance, monitoring, etc.) than experienced recipients would need. 9) Environmental Accountability OJP has implemented several in itiatives to ensure a safe and he althy work environment for its building occupants and to protect the environment by conserving energy. We have collaborated with building owners to develop opportunities to conserve both energy and water through the installation of light sensors and automatic faucets and toilets. Through our contractual efforts, priority is given to purchasing ene rgy-efficient appliances and information technology equipment. Highlights from this proposed budget include both increases, de creases elimination and new initiative programs: Increases National Institute of Justice research, evaluation and demonstr ation program $70,800 (FY 2010 $48,000) Bureau of Justice Criminal Justice Statistics Progra ms $62,500 (FY 2010 $60,000) Decreases Regional Information Sharing 2010 $45,000) Byrne Competitive Grants $30,000 ($40,000 FY 2010) Flat lined Byrne Justice Assistance Grants $519,000 (same as FY 2010) Bullet Proof Vest Partnership $30,000 (same as FY 2010) Zero Fu nding Byrne Discretionary Grants eliminated ($186,268 on FY 2010) Drug Court Program elimina ted ($45,000 FY 2010) In FY 2011, funding for this program will be redirected to the new Drug, Mental Health, and Problem Solving Courts initiative, which consolidates the funding strea m with the Mentally Ill Offender Program, providing OJP with the flexibility to continue these efforts Indian Country Assistance In itiative eliminated ($90,000 FY 201 0) Although no specific funding is requested for these programs in FY 2011, OJP is requesting a seven percent set-aside for a new flexible tribal criminal justice as sistance program. This set-aside will provide $139.5 million. Weed and Seed Program (CCDO) eliminated Although no funding is requested for this program in FY 2011, OJP is requesting $40.0 million for a new Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program designed to replace and build on concepts employed in the Weed and Seed Program. These are just a few of the highlights from the proposed budget. If you want to review the document in greater detail please download a copy for your desktop at www.justice.gov . This is the time to review and research the new proposed programs, what is most likely not to be funded and what changes may be coming Begin now to evaluate your needs for your Fiscal Year 2011 budget. Gather your data and determine your crime and community demographics to det ermine if your needs align with the proposed funding. It may also help to inform your local, state and federal elected officials of the F Y 2011 proposed budget details which may directly impact your department. If they are aware of the impact they ca n more effectively work to advocate for you in the budgetary process. 335 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Back to basics: The art of gathering grant data Once you have researched and gathered the basics, the data requ ired by the grant will seem much easier to approach For most people, data collection conjures up images of clicking through the endless sources of information late into the night. We all know that getting the right data from the right sources can be daunting, so where should you start? How about the data related to the reason you are applying for a grant? Every grant requires data to validate the assumptions made by the grant writer to prove that what they state in the application is valid. You mus t paint a really good picture. First, get yourself organized After reading the funding announcement you must decide which fa cts or statistics are needed to support your grant project. Your data must be specific and offer a clear pic ture. You will need data to describe the problem, the target population, your police department and your community. You need to provide a balance between the data and the scope of the project. Second, demonstrate what is working You must give the reader hope that there are organizational ser vices working on some aspect of the community problems. You want to avoid painting a grim and hopeless image of your community. Avoid overstatement and overly emotional appeals. Seek data that clearly defines the pr oblem. For example: Youth drug and alcohol abuse is served by schools, ci vic organizations, faith-based or ganizations, and court systems as well as police departments. Outside of your police department, what other organizations are active in serving youth who have drug and alcohol abuse issues? A good place to start locating c ommunity data is your local Chamber of Commerce or your local community coalitions to get some of the data you need. They have already done the work for their own needs. Effective begging works faster and ea sier for data collection than clicking!! Third, evaluate your approach Review other community projects dealing with the same problem a s you are planning and decide if your approach to the problem addresses the need differently or bette r than other projects within your community. Take a look at what other police departments in other communities are doing with the same problem within the same population. Make sure you select an approach that is approved or supported by the Federal Government if you are applying for a Federal grant. Much research and development has gone into the projects which offer grant funding. For these grants you will not be able to be comp letely creative. Best practices and promising programs are the most secure way to get funding. Forth, avoid circular reasoning When putting your data together you want to avoid presenting the absence of something as the actual problem. Avoid statements like all of your prisons are full so we need a new prison building. Define why the jails are full and then determine through a feasibility study if a new building is the needed or is there another more pro-active approach to the problem. Sometimes you will be surprised at the findings! Fifth, identify the data Once you have determined the scope and depth of the problem ide ntify what types of clearly defined data you need to present a strong image of who is impacted. Compile a list of the data you need to gather. Determine what sources of data are reliable and valid for your use. Grant funders prefer data which is less than three years old. Use only enough data to define the actual problem. Overdos ing the reader of your grant with too much data can cause them to lose sight of t he reason the grant is being s ubmitted 336 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Data Resources Start first with your local community contacts. Start with your county or city offi ces of health and human services, local chamber of commerce, drug free community coalitions, HIDA, gang task forces, drug taskforces have all gather and aggregated date which may be related to you department's grant. Start there when looking for local community data. It is always better to check first, i t will save you a lot of time. State resources vary within each state but the rule of thumb is that most of the sta te agencies mirror the Federal government. For example, if you are looking for justice statistics you would search your State Department of Justice Federal Data Resources The Federal Government has many libraries of data. Here are som e easy to use databases and websites you should know about. Census Bureau Population Estimates Codebooks and Datasets Crime and Justice Electronic Data Abstract spreadsheets These are aggregated data from a wide variety of published sources and are intended for analytic use. Files are in .csv format which can be easily read by most spreadsheet and statistical programs, and many word processors. Crime trends from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports This provides custom data tables by State including U.S. totals (since 1960), and by rep orting local agency (since 1985) Data Online This is a dynamic interface that allows users to construct cust om data tables on: a) Crime trends from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports by State including U.S. totals (since 196 0), and by reporting local agency (since 1985) b) Justice expenditures and empl oyment for multiple activities (police, judicial, corrections), types of employment (full-time, part-time) and types of expenditures (di rect, capital outlay, intergovernmental), since 1982. Easy Access Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) data analysis tools Easy Access is a family of web-based data analysis tools on juv enile crime and the juvenile justice system provided by the Office of Juven ile Justice and Delinquency Prev ention (OJJDP. The applications provide information on national, state , and county population counts, a s well as information on homicide victims and offenders, juvenile court case pr ocessing, and juvenile offende rs in residential placement facilities. Federal Criminal Case Processing Statistics - FCCPS This compiles comprehensive info rmation provided by selected federal criminal justice agencies ranging from arrest to reentry. The Federal Criminal Case Processing Statist ics (FCCPS) tool permits on-line analysis of suspects and defendants processed across stages of the Federal criminal justice system from 1994. Homicide trends and characteristics Provides statistics on the total number of homicides reported a nnually in UCR and characteristics of those homicides from SHR including: Age of victim (in age groups), Ra ce of victim (White, Black, Other), Gender of victim (Male, Female), Race a nd gender of victim (White Male, B lack Male, etc.) and Weapon used (Gun, Knife, Other weapon). The characteristics are presented as perc entages of the total since not all homicides are reported in the SHR. Justice Expenditures and Employment data query tool Using this tool, customized justice expenditures and employment data tables can be generated for multiple activities (police, judicial, corrections), types of employment (full-time, part-time) and types of expenditures (direct, capital outlay, intergovernmental). Data is available since 1982. 337 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) Provides statistics on Primary St ate law enforcement agencies ( 49 State police or highway patrol's) and Local police and Sheriffs' agencies w ith 100 or more sworn officers a nd 50 or more uniformed officers assigned to respond to calls for service. Prosecutors' Offices Statistics Provides statistics on prosecutors' offices organized by districts (e.g. judicial districts) that cover one or more counties. Finally, prepare early Before you have a grant funding announcement, gather the basic data you need for almost all grant applications. Here is a suggested list of information you will need: History of your Police Department Types of services provided: community policing, gang taskforce, bicycle safety, etc. Basic Community demographics: population, educational levels, b usiness and industry, etc. Crime Data: Part 1 and Part 2 Internal Police Department Crime Data Grant History: types and names of grants, successes, amount, fu nder source It takes time to gather the basic data. However, once you have researched and gathered the basics, the data required by the grant will seem ea sier to do. If you have any q uestions about grant data please contact me at Denise.Schlegel@policegrantshelp.com . Best wishes with your funding endeavors. Back to the basics: Developing a federal grant budget Everything we do costs money. Just sitting at a desk in an office requires a long list of things which relate to the department's budget. The phone, e lectricity, heat, air conditioning, paper, pens, laptop, ink for the printer, insurance, stickies, stapler and the list goes on. When develop ing a grant, you must determine the cost of the project or equipment and present it to the funder. It is all ab out the details. Read the request for proposal fully and carefully to assure that the grant you are considering will actually pay for the project and its supporting needs. Once you have developed your grant project, you must apply a co st to everything that project requires full implementation. For example, if you are going to purchase a pie ce of equipment for the department with the grant funding, you must think through all of the related costs for the acquisition, use and sustainability of that equipment. The cost of the entir e project may not be fully paid for by the funding source but it is your responsibility as the grant writer to calculate the actual total cost of the project. This will allow you and your chief to understand the department's financial commitment to th e project. Below is a list of sample of all the budget categories to consider when purchasing equipment: Personnel time: manage/implement/order/process/install/test/rep ort Personnel Benefits Actual equipment cost Equipment peripherals/cables/other supplies Officer's time for training on use of equipment Additional officer's time to replace the one in training Trainer fees/travel/per diem/other Indirect costs rate Training supplies Any Increase in insurance coverage 338 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Future maintenance costs/licenses/parts/upgrades Leases Evaluation systems Accounting systems Phase-down costs Although the degree of detail each funder requires differs grea tly, as well as well as the types of allowable costs which can be paid for by each gra nt, the total project cost is critical for the police department to be able to understand and calculate the department's full financial commit ment to the project. Your detailed list will assure that you have covered all of the things needed to complete the equipment purchase and implementation. Your application may only pay for the cost of the equipment but the total budget is significantly higher when you look at total project cost. The more grants your department has received, the higher the co st to the department's budget for those things which have been designated as an in-kind contribution or as a r equired financial match given under the in-kind category. Many departments offe r personnel time as in-kind. Tha t time not paid for by the grant can be a considerable dollar amount. If personnel time is included as in-kind or a match for the multiple grants the total departmental financial commi tment could be substantial! A well prepared grant budget should be reasonable and demonstrate that the funds will be used wisely. Your application must also determine the need for the equipment. It must be concrete with sound as well as accurate using budgeting principles. It should be clear and understandab le. It should be formatted properly using excel spreadsheets or the form provided by the funder. All salaries must be comparable t o those within the department. You cannot hire a new person or shift an existing person into a grant funded position which pays a much higher rate than if you would have hired them under you existing budget. If it is a new hire, you must demons trate that you have existing space and equipment for that person or include it in the budget either as your cont ribution to the project or if allowable, must be attributed to the funder's costs for the project. All federal grant projects requi re the designation of an indire ct cost rate. Indirect costs are costs that are not readily assignable to a particular project, but are necessary t o the operation of the organization and the performance of the project (like the cost of operating and maintaining facilities, depreciation, and administrative salaries). Sometimes the federal funder make s budget adjustments after the grant award. This is a lengthy process and can be avoided by researching the financial guidelines while develo ping your grant project. You must assure a complete budget by considering all of the costs upfront. In ord er to assure your budget meets all of the federal financial requirements, you should download the Bureau of Justi ce Federal Financial Guide. The Office of Justice has a new t ool for law enforcement agenci es to use as a guide for grant writing titled: Grants 101. If you are planning to apply for a grant from the D epartment of Justice you may want to take some time to review the tips and tricks shared at this new website. Budgetary details are defined and explained in this tool kit. Using the Financial Guide, the OJP budget detail worksheet and the instructions provided to you in the request for proposal will guide you through the development and completion of a grant budget. If you are new to budgeting, work with your financial director to assure you have the correct details for all costs especially personnel. Creating a grant budget takes time and effort. You must researc h each cost center listed on your total project budget. This will assure that your n umbers are r eal an d not \"a best guess effort'. The funders who review the 339 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] budget section of your grant are w ell aware of the costs of doi ng business whether you live in Chicago, Illinois or Hegins, Pennsylvania. So ma ke sure you use sound resources f or developing your budget. A well-researched and fully deve loped budget will go a long way to getting your grant application awarded. Best wishes with your next budget. Tips and tricks for finding private funding for police The private world of philanthr opy is filled with resources for funding just about everything related to community, people, our world and its sustainability. Sorting through the more than 88,000 foundations in the United States, to find the right match for your project may see m daunting. The task of searching for a fit is not as hard as you might think. Developing a relationship with a pr ivate grantmaker can pr ove to be a rewarding and fulfilling adventure. Law enforcement organizations need to be creative in their approach in garnering this important funding resource. According to the \"Highlights of Foundation Giving Trends 2008\" published by the Foundation Center, the largest U.S. private and commun ity foundations increased their funding for all major subject areas in 2006. Overall, grant dollars rose 16.4% to $19.1 billion dollars in 2 006. That funding breaks down into the following categories: 11% Public Affairs/Society benefits, 23% to Health, 23% to Education, and 14% to Human Services, Social Sciences 1%, Science and Technology 3%, Religion 2%, Int ernational Affairs 5%, Environment and Animals 6%, Arts and Culture 12% . A total of 71% of the $19.1 b illion dollars were awarded to help people live better lives in related LEO categories. Law Enforcement and its partnering organizations are included in those totals. Partnering with related c ommunity organizations with similar target population, offers LEOs a way to access this large pool of private funding. Completing a proper and full search for a private grant maker is your primary task in identifying the right prospect for the purpose your law enforcement organization has in mind. Foundations may not be able to fulfill all of your organizational needs but can play a major role as a partner in helping your organization accomplish its goals. Never make the mistak e of limiting your search for t he \"perfect\" funder. But approach your search with the basic criteria which meet your needs and an open mind for selecting several candidates for consideration. Match your mission with the grantmaker's mission . You must also consider what type of support you are seeking. Foundation grantmakers typically fund nonprofits. For law enforcement entities, this is a good opportunity to develop traditional and non-traditional partnerships within your community. You might consider schools, drug demand reduction service providers, domestic abuse service providers, other justice system partners, private employers, etc. Within th is type of partnership, law en forcement organizations can provide required support and obtain valuable and needed equipment, tools and oth er resources within the scope of the project. This partnership will \"lend\" you the nonprofit 501 (c) 3 status needed to obtain the funding desired. Grantmakers are looking for potential grantees that demonstrate a strong relationship w ith their community and for that reason encourage partnering. The Foundation Center is the premier site for beginning your re search on foundations. The Center has the largest collection of training materials, research resources, publications and the Foundation Center Directory. The Directory is the one-stop-shop for obtaining critical infor mation about how to approach the foundation and for what purposes they provide g rant funding. Anyone seeking fo undation support needs to spend time at this website learning about foundati ons, how to approach them and ho w to find them. There are cooperating collections of the Foundation Directory found at libraries acro ss all 50 states. The listing for these locations may be found at the website under '\" Cooperating Collections\". The D irectory provides the most complete profiles available of all 88,000 foundations. At the local libraries a c omputer is available for your free research. All potential foundation profiles may be saved to a thumb drive for your use at home. Once you have selected some potential funders, you will then need to dig in deeper to determine which of these potential candidates is the best foundation for meeting your ne eds. Always do your HOMEWORK, RESEARCH 340 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] and GROUNDWORK BEFORE you ever contact a potential grantmaker! It is best to send appropriate applications to the right grant makers. Never try than to apply the catch-as-catch-can\" approach by sending the same concept proposal to many potential grantmakers. Each priva te foundation has its own mission, vision, and priorities for funding. The latter can have rather tragic results as the foundation staff can usually see through this type of campaign. And they all know when you have not done your homework. There are three basic research strategies that you can use to define and identify a funder. You can divi de your search into subject matter, geogr aphic approach and type of sup port. The Foundation Directory allows the grant seeker to search by any of these categories. The cooperating li braries will also have do zens of other directories and guides for finding funding available at their grant researc h center. You might want to try the following categories for your search: law enforcement, law enforcement eq uipment, substance abuse, domestic abuse, juvenile justice, gangs, etc. The Directory provides a list of all searchable topics. In addition to the Foundation Dir ectory profiles, you need to c omplete the research on a funder by looking for other sources of information to round out the prospective grant maker's profile. These resources are websites, annual reports, 990-PF tax returns (available at the IRS or the Foundation Center website; the foundation's own guidelines and request for proposal document, newsletters, and press releases and grant lists. The Foundation Center website will provide information on how to obtain many o f the documents you need to complete your research. Please keep in mind th at less than 4000 foundations have community websites. The rest of the research is completed the 'old fashioned way\": hard copy! Once you have identified the right prospect, completed your res earch and understand how the funder wishes to be contacted the first time, you need to prepare a concept paper in the form of a letter of inquiry. This letter will contain a summary of your project, identification of the t arget population, partner, cost, goals, expected outcomes and the benefit of the funding partnership to the comm unity. It is a \"mini presentation\" of the project you wish them to fund. The grantmaker will review this letter a nd then contact you to either invite you to apply or to turn you down. Yes, we all get turned down at some point! Just don't let this stop you from pursuing other potential candidates. Creative thinking is required to find money for LEOs within the private foundation world. Let's brainstorm for a moment. For canines, search the corporate foun dations who make dog food, for traffic tools and equipment search the corporate insurance foundations, for drug demand reduction search pharmaceutical corporate foundations and founda tions with priority funding for youth, schools, drug demand reduction service providers, for law enforcement health and fitness search the co rporate foundations who produce sports equipment, power bars, sneakers etc. Hopefully this is developi ng some additional ideas for you. Step out of your normal thinking and into the creative brainstorming proces s of imagining who might have money related to your needs. The relationship which develops with the \"right funder\" brings many rewards to your organization and your community. There are many funders out there who would like to m eet you and support the work you are doing. For more resources, training and information please spend some well invested time with the Foundation Center website. www.foundationcenter.org. And if you every have the opportunity to visit one of the Fou ndation Centers Offices or one of their cooperating collections, you wi ll find a lot more information and world-class support from their staff. 341 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Successful grant writing for chiefs and administrators It just recently dawned on me how grant writing and law enforcement are alike in many ways. Each grant application is like presenting a case to the judge. The grant w riter/investigator has to gather all of the facts, data, history, information, and a clear description of the problem and its outcome. Each grant proposal is a presentation of a case statement. It differs due to the fact that each case statement for the grant application also requires proof of your departmental capacity to make the case, offer proof that the problem is real and gather data to demonstrate the scope of the problem. Grant writing also requires the oversight of the chief. To be successful in obtaining essential funding for technology and equipment, someone needs t o be the range master and assist the entire department in keeping the eye on the front sight. Grant funders require a strong, demonstrated capacity within ea ch police department to acquire, manage and implement the grant. They are looking for police departments wh ich have learned to strategically develop their case statements for funding and included with the case statement is data which demonstrates that the problem is real. When preparing for the money, the chief and other management need to achieve the following: Create a departmental targeted approach for the funding. 1. Develop a strategic plan with goals and objectives for your dep artment. Gather the crime data and analyze trends within your community. Your grants should focus on the tools, projects and technology to meet those trends. Identify and prioritize your key operational needs. Create a task assignment sheet for each objective and assign someone to complete the task. Monitor and measure annual progress and outcomes of your plan. Create an annual progress report for the funders, politicians and your community 2. Develop a written plan for strat egic acquisition and dispositio n of technology and equipment. Use life cycle planning for equipment and technology and attach a fund d evelopment plan and cost benefit analysis to the life cycle. All equipment and technology grows old and needs to be replaced at certain, planned intervals. Create in Microsoft Excel a digital inventory management process for all equipment and technology to help you keep your eye on the target. 3. Develop a written plan for perso nnel training and staff expansion based on the crime data and other needs based information. Plan for personnel sustainabilit y, training and professional d evelopment. Keep yourself and your department up-to -date with current trends and best practices in the law enforcement industry. Use your crime data to demonstrate the need for expanded hiring in high crime areas. Eliminate the \"Wants Syndrome\" Create a departmental grant writing culture of a \"department of demonstrated need\". So many officers come into my grant writing class with a list of things they WAN T to buy with grant funding. Today, there are more and more police tools, technologies and fun \"gadgets\" whic h make many people see grant funding more like making a selection in the toy shop than a business contrac t. Officers in charge of writing grants need to be trained to develop a case statemen t for new ideas and for demonstrating the actual need and cost benefit of acquiring the tool or technology through a grant. Grant money i s not free, nor is it without strings. A significant financial commitment by the police department is required with every grant. In-kind contributions (personnel time, office space, vehicles, etc .), may seem innocuous, but co me at a huge cost to the annual budget. Close monitoring is required to manag e that commitment, to assure tha t the department is not stretching itself too thin by accepting the \"free' money from the funder. A cost benefit a nalysis helps in understanding the depth of the commitment 342 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Gather data and more data Develop a baseline database of crime statistics and community i ssues indicators. Partner with the community organizations who have a connection to the same target population your department serves. Use the baseline data and indicators to c ompare your community with sis ter communities. You can a lso use the baseline data in your grants to serve as a comparison to your outcomes data at the end of a grant project. Develop a resource and asset list within you r community. Target those community organizations who can serve as partners with you in acquiring grant funding such as schools, county ser vice programs, other law enforcement agencies, etc. Eliminate any barriers to funding 1. Prepare your organization for funding by identifying any barrie rs to easily completing grant applications in a short period of time. For example, take a hard look at your internal policies for acquisition of equipment and technology. If it takes a long tim e to get approval for a purchase the grant application deadline will be long closed before a decision is m ade. Grant funders usually offer only a few short weeks from the publication of the request for proposal to the closing date for application. Find ways to address the Municipal Purchasing Ordinances and other municipal policies which inhibit your ability to apply for grants. By planning and presenting a strong case stat ement you can justify your needs more clearly to the people who hold your purse strings 2. Keep a close eye on civil libert ies, legal issues, standards and differing policy barriers to acquiring equipment and technology. Personal privacy, civil rights and \"right-to-know\" may get in the way of effective tools for crime mapping technology 3. Develop strategies to ov ercome community barriers. After writing grants for over 30 years, and teaching grant writing for over 11 of those years to law enforcement, th e biggest community barrier I see is the hesitation of both community organizations and police departmen ts to approach each other. Through their class evaluations, my class participants which include both law enforcement and community organizations, they unanimously agree that they did not even know they had so much in common and could work together in a way that provides the funding they both need. Many funders now require those types of partnerships as they have realized the same thi ng. Develop horizontal and vertical partnerships to max imize your eligibility for grants. Horizontal partnership s with fellow law enforcement agencies can enhance your ability to access funding for regionally shared technology and equipment. Vertica l community partnerships will enhance your chances of partnering for grant funding which only a non-profit can access, expanding your grant options. 4. To lessen the burden of preparing for grant writing, you might want to consider hiring a retired officer to help with grant writing. Recruit interns from colleges a nd universities to do the resea rch and data gathering. Locate a retired senior professional who wants to give back the community to help with strategic planning. 5. Consider developing internal skills within your staff to address the many facets of creating a \"grant ready\" department. Hire a \"high tech savvy\" staff person who also understands law enforcement. Take time to educate your community, e lected officials, corporations and non-profit organizations about law enforcement needs. Sometimes we only have to ask for help and s ave the time of writing a grant! 6. Lastly, send a staff member who is good a t expressive writing, analytic al thinking, and up-to-date on the state-of-the-art police strategies, tools and technologies. It takes special skills to be a grant writer and not everyone fits that profile. Keeping your eye on your organizational front sight will enable you to develop competitive grant applications and take accurate aim at those critical tools and technologies you are seeking. Careful planning and execution of new approaches to funding will reward both your department and your community. 343 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Get a head start: Prep are for grant writing Your Chief has handed you a funding announcement for a grant an d you see that it is due in three weeks. Congratulations, you have been selected to write the grant and \"get the money\"! As you sit there fingering through the request for proposal, you wonder how much time this is going to take. You are also wondering how you are going to get this done with all of your other duties yo u have as an officer. You may even be thinking that you haven't a clue how to get started. A grant is a formal written requ est for money submitted to a fu nder for a specific purpose. The process is highly competitive. A strong competitive proposal is a clear, data driven, strategically developed project proposal which fits into your department's goals and objectives. Given t hese facts, there are many things your department must do to prepare for successful grant writing before the Chie f puts a current announcement on your desk. Your entire police department n eeds to be prepared and committe d to compete for grant funding. The funders award grants to police departments which have taken the time to plan and prepare to c ompete for the money. That means that considerable thought has been given to strategi cally preparing for department needs (not wants), data to demonstrate that need is real, community partners willi ng to assure their commitment to the process and the internal capacity to manage and implement the funding proje ct. This may sound like an impossible mountain to climb, but it is not if you take the time to gather the essential information prior to any funding announcement landing on your d esk. As the grant writer for your organization, there is a lot of front end work you can do bit-by-bit to prepa re for a successful grant application. First, you need to develop a file or drawer or designated thumb drive dedicated solely for grant funding materials and information. The type of storage is not as important as what goes into that storage space. By gathering the appropriate information needed, keeping it updated and close at hand, you begin the preparation process for successfully obtaining grant funding. Once you have decided how best to store your information you can move on to the details. Locate your department mission statement: Do you know your police department mission statement? Locate it and keep an electronic version of it in the grant funding fi le. A mission statement is not meant to be a paragraph or a one page disserta tion. It is meant to be a sound bite like: \"To protect and serve the town of Hegins\". Anything longer and you could lose the attention of th e funder and that is a very bad idea. You will need it for most grant applications and for any planning docume nt your department develops. Locate a copy of your department strategic plan: Has your department developed a written plan for the purchase of equipment, officer training requirements and essent ial law enforcement tools from point of purchase to depreciation? Does your department project what staffing and programs will be needed in the upcoming three years? Is this plan based on th e critical community demographic s, crime statistics and department experience? The funder is seeking well oiled , well organized departments wh ich have completed a needs assessment process, and as a result of that process determined their current and fu ture budgetary requireme nts for operation. As we are all aware, resources and money have become scarce over the past couple of years and grant funders are looking harder at the departments they fund. They want to be as sured that your department has worked to determine needs and how those needs will be built into a soundl y prepared plan. Find out how financial decisions are made: Funders will ask you to demonstrate your departmental capacity to meet your needs for your daily operations. They also want to know that your leadership is determining how those needs will be supported. Str ong organized leadership is a key trait the funder is seeking. Does your department manage \"by the seat of your pants\" or does your depa rtment stay focused and purposeful in its approach to law enforcement services for your community? Gather the grant history of your department: Locate past and current grant applications as well as all financial and programmatic grant reports submitted to each of t he funders. Many funders will ask you to list both past and/or current funding received by your department. T hey are interested in seeing the financial support 344 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] you have garnered from other funde rs. Research and develop a ca se statement concerning any grant projects where money had been returned to the funder or did not pass an audit. Being able to explain these situations to a new funder will help get you p ast their concerns about funding you in the future. Many times there are sound reasons why the grant was not com pleted or expended appropriate ly. Staff turnover, community crisis, or other such issues can prevent a grantee from completing a grant proje ct. Be ready to explain any past problems! Gather job descriptions, resumes and biographies of essential s taff: You will be asked to provide information for the people involved in any grant project funded. Prior to any grant writing, gather the job descriptions of the various positions within your police depart ment. Collect one page resumes from management personnel. Have all management personnel create short one parag raph biographies and add them to your files. This will save you much frustration if you are on a short deadline and the person you need to locate is on vacation or out sick. Create a report on successful law enforcement services and prog rams: Create a report listing all the successful law enforcement progr ams initiated by your departmen t. This list should include the name of the program, type of program, equipment purchased and community imp act. Internal department improvement grants including officer training should be list as well. List programs such as Weed and Seed, COPS, Project Safe Neighborhoods, Save Our Schools, G.R.E.A.T, etc. Include a ll activities outside of grant funding such as community policing, bicycle safety, car seat safety and any oth er community service or education program implemented. This report can be used to copy and paste any hist ory of programs requested by the funders. These programs demonstrate your comm unity involvement, in addition to your normal law enforcement activities. Create a list of equipment purch ases over the past three to fiv e years: This list would be best developed in a data base format such as Excel. Inc lude the name of the equipment, serial numbers, style numbers, cost, funding source, projected depreciation schedule, rotation date for taki ng that equipment out of service and anticipated replacement date. In addition to specific law enforcement equipment, also include any computers and software. All equipment has a shelf life and must be worked into your budget planning process fo r replacement. Funders support equipment purchases if you can demonstrate the need for the equipment along with the appropriate management process. Develop a sustainability case statement: All funders require applicants t o address sustainability of pr ograms, new staffing and equipment pur chases made with the grant fundin g. All grantees must develop a sound, plausible plan for \"keeping the program going\". Develop a statement about past history of assuring the continued financial support for the new staff and equipment onc e the grant funding has been expended. Create a description of how your department has assured in the past that the vehicles purchased will be maintained and utilized beyond the grant funding. By completing this strategic thinking prior to having an open funding announcement on your desk, you can save a great deal of time and effort with preparing a last minute funding opportunity. Identify community partners: All funders expect you to have pa rtners within your community. These partners may be horizontal, such as other law enforcement departments, task forces, initiatives and programs in which your department is involved. Partners may also be vertical. Ver tical partners are those community organizational involvements related to special initiatives and programs. Victi ms' advocacy groups, schools, neighborhood watch groups, local mental health services, drug and alcohol pr ograms are good examples of vertical partners. After listing the partners, creat e a description of the relatio nship and successes or positive outco mes these partnerships have created. Include the names of the people invo lved, their job titles, and the dates of the programs. Many grants require formal partnerships and will requ ire evidence that the p artnership is real. Meeting minutes and sign in sheets should be created for all me etings. By establishing this practice you can leverage funding sooner rather than later. Gather your community demographics and crime statistics: You must begin to gather your community crime statistics. If your departm ent has a strategic plan, the data must be available somewhere in your office. Locate the plan and determine what additional data is needed. M any community organizations have the data you 345 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] will need to acquire. Don't reinvent the wheel if someone else has done the work for you. Community statistics may be found at the state departments of labor, health, educati on and welfare, your local chamber of commerce, school district, community and economic development office, dru g and alcohol commission, to name a few. Using the internet, you can locate Part I and Part II crimes, g eographic boundaries of your community and census tract information. Make sure you track the source of you r data. Also make sure you are using a legitimate source of data and never rely on Wikipedia. Funders know this i s a \"self-reported\" unreliable data source. All grants will require data to support your funding request. This task is a good community service project for a college student. 1. Organizational and community history: Develop a one page organizational history, briefly describing y our department's size and scope and how many sworn officers are on the force . Describe your geographic locat ion, basic population statistics, the industry make-up, as well as the natural and community resources. Locate any community needs assessments already completed by hospital systems, your county administrators, Unit ed Way or other community program to complete this profile. 2. Crime statistics Develop a database of crime statistics in an Excel spreadsheet. Collect part I and Part II crime data, such as robberies, murder, rape, attempte d murder, traffic violations. When asking for program funding or law enforcement equipment, data must be used to demonstrate the nee d for the funding. The crime statistics may be available through your own arrest rates, city or county commiss ioner's office, state department of justice, state police, department of probation and parole. Collect the following data: educational levels, truancy levels, gang activity, substance abuse levels , protection from abuse orders, domestic violence calls, homeless statistics, correction data, etc. This data will defend need for the funding. Update this data annually. 3. Community supports and social problems data This data will help you provide the funder with an understandin g of the types of programs already in existence. Collect data about programs such as job training, remedial educ ation, drug treatment facilities, drug prevention programs, youth-oriented program s, etc. With help of your commu nity partners begin to identify gaps in services and duplication of efforts. By doing this data assessm ent you will be able to provide the funder with a stronger justification for the funding request than just saying your want it! Many departments have retired o fficers assist with the grant wr iting process. They know t he business and want to continue to serve in a valuab le role. Many retired officers have attended my law enf orcement grant writing course as a representative of their former department and retur ned home to help locate and obtain valuable and needed resources. Preparing yourself and your organization for grant funding allows you to be better prepa red for a successful bid. Grant proposals must be clear, w ell focused and well written. I f you gather the right data, develop a strategic approach to the management of programs and equipment and presen t a strong case for funding, the money will be delivered to your door.

I look forward to hearing from you. 346 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Guide to NHTSA's grants To prepare for these funding opportunities, your department mus t assess your traffic safety needs now Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people of every age from 4 to 34 years old. David Strickland, administer of t he National Highway Safety Adm inistration (NHTSA) says traffic fatalities account for more than 90% of tr ansportation related fatalities and drain more that $230 billion from the economy each year. NHTSA recently published its proposed budget for funding the needs of it department. Proposed grant programs are included in the document. According to this document, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration remains dedicated to its mission to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce economic co sts due to road traffic crashes. In FY 2011, the agency is requesting $877.6 million, an increase of $4.8 millio n above the $872.8 million FY 2010 enacted funding level, to conduct vehicle research and rulemaking, as well as to develop and implement data-driven, workable, and self-sustaining local highway safety programs tha t reduce highway injuries and fatalities. To accomplish these objectives, NHTSA provides grants to states an d local communities, supports research, demonstrations and countermeasur e programs designed to prevent motor vehicle crashes and reduce their associated economic costs. NHDTA has requested $620,697, 000 (7 1% of the budget request) for highway safety grants. These grants are provided to law enforcement to enable the development of local highway safety programs. The budget's priority funding areas are research for advanced v ehicle technologies, distracted driving, children, teen driver safety, older driver, pedestrian safety, fuel econo my and environmental benefits. Page 146 of the document provides a detailed spread sheet of the Highway Safety Grants which are requested for 2011. NHTSA provides grants to states and local communities, supports research grants, demonstration grants and counter measure program grants designed to prevent motor vehicl e crashes and therefore reduce the associated economic costs. Examples of some of the proposed grant programs are as follows: State and Community Grant Program This program is to identify a nd refine consensus performance measures in state highway safety plans; continued focus on seat belt use, continued focus on correct child restra int use; combating impaired driving, promote use of ignition interlock technologies to address recidivism; colle ct and analyze crash data to identify priority safety problems. Occupant Protection Incentive Grants This program will fund occupant p rotection countermeasures and programs including improved seat belt and child safety laws, increased enfo rcement and correct child seat usage education programs. Distracted Driving Prevention Grant This grant is for the developmen t and placement of broadcast an d print media to support enforcement of distracted driving, also for an y safety activity including poli ce officers enforcement activity, collecting and analyzing relevant data and de veloping and conduction education programs. Child Safety and Booster Seat Safety Incentive Grants States will continue to purchase and distribute safety seats an d restraints to low-income families, work with law enforcement to enforce child r estraint laws, train child passen ger safety professionals, educators and parents concerned with child safety seats and child restraints. 347 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] State Traffic Safety Information Systems Improvement Grants States will use these grants to improve traffic safety information systems data that allow state and local government to correctly identify traffic safety problems, determine crash trends, and determine which traffic safety program activities are the most effective in reducing crash trends. To prepare for these funding opportunities, your department mus t begin NOW to assess your traffic safety needs, crash data, trends, scope of problem, hot spots, etc. Re search your data and map your numbers into a GIS to be able to visually see your t raffic safety needs. You must have at a minimum the following data and information to apply for a NHTSA federal or state grant Highway Traffic Safety: Three to five years' worth of current statistics National, regional and local or similar states statistics Make sure they're related to y our target audience: child, distr acted driver, impaired driver, older drivers etc. List data source and year The NHTSA also requires that every applicant for Highway Safety Grants comply with the \"Traffic Safety Performance Measures\" whether the funding comes from a federal grant or the state related grants. \"The National Highway Traffic Safe ty Administration (NHTSA) and the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) have agreed on a minimum set of performance measures to be used by States and federal agencies in the development and implementation of behavioral hi ghway safety plans and programs. An expert panel from NHTSA, State Highway Safety Offices, academic and re search organizations, and other key groups assisted in developing the measures. The initial minimum set contains 14 measures: ten core outcome measures, one core behavior measure, and three activity measures. The mea sures cover the major areas common to State highway safety plans and use existing data systems. States will set goals for and report progress on each of the 11 core outcomes and behavior m easures annually beginning with their 2010 Highway Safety Plans and Annual Reports. States will report the activity measures annually begi nning with their 2010 Highway Safety Plans and Annual Reports. States should de fine and use additional perform ance measures for their other high-priority highway safety areas as appropriate. NHTSA will use the core me asures as an integral part of its reporting to the Congress, the public, and others.\" This means that any grant application from a local or state pol ice department must be fully aware of these 14 measures, ten core measurements and their own state plan and th en must build these measures into any grant program they develop. This document defines the measures and in dicates where you would get the supporting data such as FARS. Another key document to review carefully before applying for a Highway Traffic Safety grant is the \"Partnering with State Highway Safety Offices/tips and tactics for success. \" This document defines the process for developing fundable traffic safety projects at both the state a nd federal levels. Most state traffic safety grants mirror the federal grant. By f ollowing the advice from the Traffic Safety Performance Measures for States a nd Federal Agencies and the Pa rtnering with State Highway Safety Offices\" you will be on the right path for developing a solid highway safety program as well as a sound grant application. Each state will have its own Hi ghway Traffic Safety Plan. Locate that plan and build your grant application in alignment with your state plan a nd your local data and needs. You may also go to your own state website and search for Highwa y Safety Grant program to locate your state grant funding.

Grants for Law Enforcement with Samantha Dorm Guide to NHTSA's grants Applications that are consistent with state and federal plans w ill move quickly to the top of the list when funding decisions are being made The Federal Accountability and Tr ansparency Act, although somew hat cumbersome for many departments to comply with, has resulted in an abundance of information being made available on the internet about previously funded programs and plans for future funding. The National High way Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) funding priorities for each state are generally located in thei r Highway Safety Plans and Annual Reports. The purpose of a Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) is to ide ntify the State's key safety needs and guide investment decisions to achieve significant reductions in highw ay fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads. The SHSP allows all highway safety programs in the State to work together in an effort to align and leverage its resources. It also positions the State and its saf ety partners to collectively address the State's safety challenges on all public roads. Below is a brief snapshot of the type of programs that are bein g funded through NHTSA grants. In Arkansas, traffic safety programs are developed and implemen ted through cooperative and concentrated efforts among state, federal, local and some private-sector par tners. These efforts are coordinated, implemented and supported by the Arkansas Highway Safety Office (AHSO, located within the Arkansas State Police). To date, funding has been provided for training of law enforcem ent officers as well as prosecutors. The Victim Impact Panels are coordinated by the Mothers Against Drunk Driv ing. Overtime reimbursement and traffic enforcement related equipment h as been provided to police depar tments that are conducti ng various traffic and safety details, while the impleme ntation of DWI Court benefited from a grant to cover salaries, fringe benefits, in-state and out-of state travel and training, maintenance and operations, printing and administration expenses associated with start-up costs. According to New York's 2010 Highway Safety Plan, grant funds m ay be utilized to support the development and implementation of innovative enforcement strategies by loca l agencies including high visibility enforcement programs, such as regional satura tion patrols, sobriety checkpoints, and organized sta tewide mobilizations, as well as participation in the na tional impaired driving mobilizations. Officer training programs such as the Standardized Field Sobrie ty Testing/Drug Recognition Expert (SFST/DRE) and Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement ( A.R.I.D.E) training for law enforcement officers, the Drug Impairment Training for Education Profession als (DITEP), and training for prosecutors of DWI cases will also continue to be provided. In Florida, all program areas funded with grant funds are requi red to have an evaluation method that will allow assessment of the funded program 's level of success in reducing fatalities and injuries. Grant application for Police Traffic Services should focus on these four major progra m related categories: 1. Resource Management: equipment for law enforcement agencies to implement traffic safety programs and enforce traffic safety laws. (Note: Grant funding is not in tended to replace an agency's existing equipment). 2. Training: for law enforcement officers and legal professionals to attend training that will increase knowledge and skills and motivate and enhance professionalism a nd effectiveness. 349 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 3. Traffic Law Enforcement: \"seed\" m oney for law enforcement agenc ies to increase traffic enforcement staff to address apparent traffic safety issues in their area that ca nnot be addressed with current staff levels.

Grants 101 by Sarah Wilson: 'Ti s the Season... Lessons Learned The team at PoliceGrantsHelp is pretty lucky. What I mean to say is we have the privilege of talking to offic ers every day about their department needs, what's going on in their communities, a nd ultimately their grant projects. Taking into account all the conversations we have had over the past year, the re are a number of trends we se e for departments who are successful when it comes to following through with a grant project. As we embark on a new grant year - here are some lessons learne d from the team at PGH for your department to plan for as you start navigating grants for 2011. Lesson Learned #1: A Top Priority for the Department? Have you asked permission? What I mean to say is before you sta rt looking into grants to fund a project, do the \"powers that be\" (Chief, Mayor, etc.) know you are looking into this project? Grants are a legal, binding contract between the grant maker and your department. Grants re quire a partnership on behalf of the department that includes some kind of match (cash or in kind services) and reporting requirements. Let's say you believe that drugs a re the biggest problem impact ing your community and you think your department needs thermal imaging equipment to counter this issu e. Coincidentally, your department also identified a drug problem through the most recent strategic planning session. Knowing this, they have elected/delegated/volunteered you to research and put together a grant proposal to apply for thermal-imaging cameras. This is of course an i deal scenario and I recognize it doesn't always happen this way. At least you 350 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] know that all of your efforts to look into and secure funding won't be wasted when you find out that there are about 5 other projects ahead of yours that the department has e lected to focus on. Some things to think about: When was the last time your department did any planning or strategic thinking? Is the identified problem and solution included as part of this pl an? Do you have permission to apply for grants on behalf of the department? Lesson Learned #2: Identify the Problem You know that your department has a need for equipment, trainin g, programs etc - but what grant makers (or any funding sources) want to know is what problem this grant re quest will solve in your community. The first question we ask every departmen t is: What will happen in your c ommunity if you do not get this equipment, training, etc.? What will be the impact if you receive this fun ding? What will happen if you do not? Cause and effect. For example - say your department needs a thermal imaging camer a. You have this need because there is a problem with drugs in your comm unity. You have done your homework and gathered data that proves there is an increase or \"hotspots\" for drugs in your community. Therefor e, the problem is drugs and its impact on the community. One solution is to patrol the rural areas with therm al imaging cameras where drugs are being distributed. Thermal imaging cameras will enable your officers to identify and apprehend drug suspects, thus decreasing the distribution of drugs in your community. The equipment you wish to purchase or the programs you seek to fund are considered the \"solution\" to a problem. To determine the appr opriate funding source, your department must first define the problem to justify the need. Lessons Learned #3: Data Support You know you have a problem; you see it every day in your commu nity. The thing is, the funding source for the grant most likely doesn't live or work or patrol in your commun ity. You need to demonstrate that there is in fact a problem not just by identifying it (reference Lessons Learned 1 and 2) but by supporting the claims. Using our example from Lessons Learned 1 and 2, let's say that drug arrests were the largest percentage of Part I Crimes, patrol/criminal arrests made in the past 3 years for your department. You would reference this data to support the claim that drugs are in fact a problem in your community. Another data source is to contact community partners such as the local hospital to see how many drug related emergencies have occurred over the same timeline. Is there a trend of increasing drug overdoses co rresponding with drug arrests? If yes, then you have 2 data resources justifying your claim. When you identify a problem to justify a need think to yourself : \"Where can I find data to support this claim?\" Make sure your data reinforces y our identified problem. We have created a data reference guide to direct you with some ideas: www.policegrantshelp.com/grant-data-collection/ Lesson Learned #4: Find the Right Grant Ok - so you've identified the problem, you've found the solutio n, you have data to support this claim, you have sign off from top brass, phew - now what? NOW you can look for funding. The reason we suggest going this route is to make sure you have e verything you will need to matc h your department with the right grant. Quite honestly reading the RFP (request for proposal) also know n as the Solicitation is the best way to determine what grant will work for your department. You will wa nt to focus on whether or not your department is eligible to apply, when the grant is due, how much you can a pply for, as well as the application requirements. If the grant is currently not open for applications, request a copy of the previous year RFP. Contact a person listed on the past RFP to inquire if that grant program will be re-issued. This will he lp you plan ahead as you start gathering information for when the grant does open. Building upon what we learned fro m Lessons 1-3 above, let's say we are in a community with an identified and data supported drug problem. Our solution to this problem is to supply thermal-imaging cameras to apprehend 351 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] suspects and counteract drug sales and distribution. A good gra nt for this is going to be something like the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program or a local Community Developm ent Grant that supports Crime Reduction. So where can you find these target ed grant opportunities? Some of the places you can find them are PoliceGrantsHelp, Grants.Gov, and Foundation Directory (access at your local library for free). Next Steps Let's be honest - grants are te dious and time consuming. The fl ip side is they are incredibly rewarding. The team here is ready to support you through your project and provide as many resources as possible in the coming year. We try to post as many grant opportunities as possible on Polic eGrantsHelp. You can also ask questions on our PGH Blog, our Facebook page or receive new grant alerts announc ements by signing up to be a member of PGH. If you are interested in ta lking to us in person or getting training - here is a lis t of where we will be in 2011. Sarah Wilson is respons ible for the day to day management of th e Grants program on PoliceGrantsHelp, FireGrantsHelp and EMSGrantsHelp. She has been wo rking with non-profits professionally and personally for over 8 years and has assisted over 2000 public safety agencies with grant research and grant assistance. She m ost recently completed her Gra nt Writing certification from the NCTC training facility. Gathering the right data to write a grant with Sarah Wilson According to Denise Schlegel, Supe rvisory Instructor at NCTC an d Grants Consultant with Allutiq, grants are defined as \"a negotiation through analysis, skill in problem so lving, professionalism through project design and lots of good, old fashioned effort.\" Most of the effort Denise refers to happens in the preparation for the grant. Defining your organization by taking basic data about your depa rtment, the community you serve and trends in call statistics can build the b asis for a successful grant appl ication. The first thing you will need to do before writing your proposal is gather the documentation or data to support your proposal request. If you are part of a small department wi th no staff, a knowledgeable chief, city leader or board member are the logical resource for this information. If you are in a larger agency, there should be administrative, operational and financial support staff that ca n help you. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of data you should collect prior to beginning your grant project. This information is useful for all organizations in the data collection process and can be the starting point for all future grant applications. Mission Statement/Vision Statement It is important that you have a good sense of how the grant project fits with the mission and vision of your agency. A mission statement shoul d clearly define your organiza tions purpose whereas a vision statement describes a realistic desired outcome of your organization. Col lecting background data on your organization and on the needs to be addressed will help document your arguments for funding. Funders want to know that a project they might fund reinforces the overall direction of you r public safety organization. Strategic Plan Individual public safety agencies may not have their own strate gic plan, but the community, county, or city you service should have one. Most chambers of commerce have a strat egic plan as do offices of emergency services. Make sure you get a copy of the plan to find out where your ser vice fits and more importantly if you are set up to respond accordingly. A lot of organizations you work with ha ve already done the strategic planning \u2014 so tap into that work. 352 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Demographics The demographics of your response area are going to be a substa ntial data resource within your grant application. You have more than likely drawn conclusions about why your area has seen an increase in call volume \u2014 demographic trends w ill help support these conclusions . To research and describe the demographics of the community you serve \u2014 population, economy, geography, and community issues \u2014 you can find from American Fact Finder. Decision Makers and Financing In order to get anywhere with grants you need to know who to kn ow in order to get support for your project. The decisions in your department coul d be made by your chief, a com mission, a board of directors or even city leaders. Try to find out who makes the decisions for programs a nd equipment and how that selection is made. These decisions should be based on the community needs, departm ent needs or ideally both. The final decision maker should be the person who si gns your grant \u2014 make sure you have access to them. Many of the private foundations will request copies of an organ izational chart, biographies and current job descriptions. At a minimum you should include the decision-make rs and their direct reports. Generally human resources or administrative personnel can assist you with obtai ning this information. All grant applications will ask for a project budget. You will need to show why you do not have budget for this grant project. Before you do that, do some due diligence on how your department is financially supported. How is your operating budget financed ? Is it through taxes, bonds, donations? Make sure you get a copy of your most recent annual budget from your chief, accounting department or city manager. Community Services and Grant History Your department is providing a number of services to your community. These could include K9, Narcotics, SROs, First response, Disaster Response, etc. Make a list of al l the services your organi zation currently provides or is expected to provide. Find out if any programs have been the result of grants funding and if any community organizations were included as part of this project. This will help you figure out your organizations grant history and if you have ever been funded before. You should have an idea at this point as to what other funders have given your organization money \u2014 private donations, corporate donations or other state or federal funds. Equipment Think about the equipment and new programs that are of interest to your organization. Prioritize them in a list. Now, what equipment in this list will you need to make your grant project successful? Equipment included as part of a grant application should directly assist in solving the problem in your community you are addressing. Sustainability Last and most importantly, think about how your organization will sustain/fund the new equipment or program after the grant. Talk to the per son who manages the department budget. You want to make sure your department considers the budget beyond the grant funding timeframe and bui ld in funding for things like replacements, insurance costs, training, upgrades or repairs. Conclusion While tedious and a bit time consuming, this data-gathering pro cess makes the actual grant writing much easier. Involving other vested interest parties in the process helps ke y people within your agenc y seriously consider the project's value to the organization.

The sunken national economy is causing public and private grant dol lars to dwindle. Administrators are finding that the competition for grants has b ecome even more intense because of cuts, especially in the federal grant money arena (a drop of about 17 percent). The grant application proc ess is demanding and exact, but the Internet is now a main source for grant information. Grantors set their pr iorities and their standards and you must meet those to be successful in receiving a grant. $ Internet Resources for your Grant Research $ The following Web sites may he lp your grants search. Because grantors sometimes (of often) change their preferences or strategies, keep current with the grantors that seem to match your project. www.grants.gov This is probably the best starti ng point for most Federal grant s and grant research.

The proportion of Nevada's popula tion classified as elderly (ages 65 and over) is expected to increase from 11.4 percent in 1995 to 21.1 percent in 2025. This would place Nevada as the 15th highest proportion of elderly in 2025. Nevada's dependency ratio, the number of youth (under age 20) a nd elderly (ages 65 and over) there would be for every 100 people of work ing ages (20-64 years of age), c ould rise from 66.1 to 79 in 2025. In Nevada, a person of Hispani c origin, who may be of any race, is projected to increase from 12.6% of the 1995 population to 25.2% of the 2025 population. This is an es timated gain of around 390,000 persons of Hispanic origin. The Hispanic population change ranks Nevada as the 12th largest gain among the 50 states and District of Columbia.

If he had all these, he might be a good polic eman!\" \u2014 August Vollmer Recruiting the next generation of police officers is probably o ne of the most important functions for human resources professionals and police leaders in any department. P rior to 2009, police agencies across the nation had experienced a dramatic decreas e in the number of qualified police applicants (Whetstone, Reed, & Turner, 2006). Chicago Police Department, like others, began lowering their standards for employment to allow younger, less educated officers into their recruitment pool whi le paying them higher starting salaries (Anonymous, 2001). Recently, however, the poor economy has led many unemployed wor kers to apply for more secure jobs in the public sector, including police departments. In October 2009, t he unemployment rate hit 10.2 percent, the highest since 1983 (U.S. Department of Labor, 11/6/2009). While this creates a better pool of diverse applicants for police recruiters, agencies should strive to find qualified applicants that are looking for a long-term career in policing with a commitment to the community (Whetstone et al., 2006). Once the private sector market rebounds from this recession, the e mployees who flocked to the public sector will again return to the private sector. The community has high expectati on of police officers. Recruite rs should focus on those who \"possess self- discipline, patience, attention to detail, knowledge of law, su perior communication skills, and understand of scientific principles grounded i n several disciplines\" (Whetstone et al., 2006, p. 53). These traits are not widely found in the general public (Wh etstone et al., 2006, p. 53). Understanding that the new r ecruits of today will be the leaders of tomorrow, recruiting has a direct impact on the future effectiveness of t he agency, including the community's crime rate and quality of life issues. To be effective in the 21st century, police recruiters must raise the standards on agency divers ity, officer education level, and understanding of the values of the next generation of police officer. In essence, police departments need to recruit police officers like other sectors of the labor market. To compete, agencies must raise the starting salary and provide opportunities for growth and development that are comparabl e to other private and public sec tor jobs. Professionalism and Recruitment Over the last thirty years, poli ce agencies have strived to become more professional organizations. Agencies have adopted an ethical codes of conduct, instituted mandatory yearly training requirements, and held its members to a higher standard of behavior to \"ensure trust\" (Kis singer, 2005, p. 34). The process of recruiting 373 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] qualified officers that will uphold and maintain these standard s of professionalism is the foundation of any police agency (White & Escobar, 2008). While many may argue whe ther policing has reached the point of a true profession, agencies have worked toward becoming more professional for decades. There is a true need to begin recruiting like a professional organization by reaching out to the top students at local high schools and universities as well as recruitment from other agencies. Many a gencies give hiring incentives to recruits for education, proficiency in foreign languages, military service, and prior experience. Most professional organizations r ecruit and pay candidates more that have prior experience in the field. The employee has their experience to offer the organization because they already have the prior work experience. In return, the organization pays the recruit the amount they are w orth to the organization. In this regard, professional organizations pay those with experience more than someone just out of school. To become a true profession, agencies should place more emphasis on the creation of lateral entry positions. Specifically, agencies should recruit patrol officers, crime prevention officers, scho ol resource officers, and even management from outside the agency. This compe tition for the best employees is not only good for the organization, it better serves the community as well. There are many communities that cannot afford to pay higher sal aries. Because salary and benefits are a product of a government budget, agencies will need to look at other benefits that can be offe red to recruits. These benefits may include take-home ve hicles, specialized training, or flexible schedules (Vest, 2001). The Generational Divide Each generation \u2014 from the baby boomers of the 40s to generation Y of the new millennium \u2014 has its own unique set of values, expectations , and goals in life. While ma ny aspects of law enforcement appeal to each generation, recruiting from this distinct generation of workers may require different strategies. The police recruiter must understand each generation. People included in the millennial generation were born between 1978 and the year 2000. This generation will be one of the largest ever, including more than 80 million people (Junginger, 2008). People born during in this generation are much more technol ogically savvy than previous ge nerations, growing up with computers, iPods, and video games. Their ability to use technology even eclipses most of their teachers in school and supervisors at work. What makes this genera tion different in the workforce, however, is the personal values and expectations about how they want be treated by their employers, supervisors, and peers. Employees from this generation are generally high achievers. Th ey are a group that values their independence, having grown up in families where both parents work. They also value their personal relationships and are very sociable. This generation is different from others in that they will question decisions, value immediate feedback, and believe that experience is n't everything (Wallis, 2009). Th ese characteristics will create conflict with the military style of command and c ontrol utilized within police departments. Police orga nizations will have to adapt their management style to this new age of recruit or face continued difficulties in recruitment and hiring. If Generation Y employees \"feel they are undervalued, they will be planning their exit strategy\" (Wallis, 2009, p. 62). Agencies cannot afford the c ost of constant turnover. Each police agency has its own m ission based on community expec tations \u2014 finding officers that \"fit\" into the agency's culture can be difficult. Recruiters must utilize strategies that will bring in a larger pool of diverse applicants to better fill these agency vacancies. These strateg ies include both methods of advertising departmental vacancies as well as the hiring process itself. One of the biggest issues for po lice recruiters has been creati ng a large pool of qualified applicants from which to choose. A larger pool of appli cants will allow departments t o be more selective in the hiring process. Even with the increase in applica nts because of recent econom ic issu es, police still face problems \"in trying to attract and retain quality candidates who fit within their organizational environment\" (Orrick, 2008, p. 26). Departments should to be in a position where they recruit the b est applicants, not merely eliminate those who 374 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] are least qualified (Whetstone et al., 2006). The recruiting st rategies must bring in applicants that have diverse cultures, backgrounds, and educational fields (Vest, 2001). Internet Presence According to White and Escobar (2008), the recruitment process should utilize multiple techniques. First and foremost, every agency should h ave a presence on the Internet a s a continued method of recruitment. The agency's website was identified as the most successful strategy for recruitment (Whetstone et al., 2006). From the website, departments can advertise and market their agency to prospective applicants . In turn, applicants can research the agency to find the agency's mission, hiring standa rds, community presen ce, and possible career tracks. Access to online applications makes it easier to recrui t officers from other regions of the country. A second source of recruiting using the Internet is through soc ial networking sites. Many agencies today are creating sites through networks like MySpace and Facebook. This is particularly important when recruiting the younger generation of applicants who place a higher value of th e social aspects of work . They utilize these types of online media to make contacts in both their professional and personal lives. Many agencies are creating a presence on these social networking sites to market their agency to prospective applicants. Agencies can update \"friends\" on opportunities within the agency, standards, and community news. Physical Presence Other successful strategies in recruitment include career fairs and visiting college and high school campuses (Whetstone et al., 2006). These events are good opportunities \u2014 indeed, have been good for a very long period of time \u2014 to market the police de partment to prospective applic ants. These recruiting events should not focus solely on those with criminal justice majors but all disciplines of study. The communities served by law enforcement are continually changing and becoming more diverse. Those with educational backgrounds in education, foreign language, computer programming, and communication may be plugged into the organization in needed areas. Agencies that c ontinue to recruit applicants with diverse backgrounds will do well in the long term. Although diminishing in number, some agencies are still offerin g sign-on bonuses to new employees. At one point, the Houston Police Department was offering a $7000.00 sign-on bonus to any sworn officer that already met the basic service requirements for employment (Gentile, 200 6). Law enforcement agencies should also consider pulling resources to provide scholarship funds to bring in new recruits. One specific program in North Carolina, the Police Co rps, recruited top performers right out of high school. The program, now a victim to budget cuts, created a ver y stringent selection process. Those that were selected for the program received a full scholarship to pay for college. In addition, the program provided law enforcement specific training du ring the summer months. Once th e recruit completed the program and graduated college, each participant already had a job waiting for them. A gencies that signed up in support of the program committed to hiring one of the recruits after they graduated. While this may be a costly program, it was an excellent opportunity to recruit qualified applicants that would show a long term commitment to the profession. This long term c ommitment becomes worth the expenditure when the costs of recruiting, outfitting, and training a new of ficer can cost well over $50,000. For accepting the scholarship, the recruit must work a specific number of years w ith the sponsoring agency, giving the organization a return on its investment. A Recruiting Culture Recruitment must be in the culture of the agency, from the top of the organizational structure to the bottom. Agency leaders, by the nature of their position in the organiza tion, are provided with numerous opportunities to recruit new applicants to their agency. Even the officers thems elves can be valuable tools in the recruitment process. All e mployees in the agency \u2014 no m a tter what rank or status in the organization \u2014 should be trained in the recruitment and selection process (Whetstone et al., 2006). Off icers should be given information on the agency 375 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] benefits, starting salary, and any testing requirements. Line o fficers and first line supervisors will have many opportunities in the community to sell the agency (Whetstone et al.). Human resources managers should even consider providing bonuses to those employees whose recruitment efforts lead to the hiring of a qualified officer. In this regard, officers would have financial incentive for identifying qualified applicants while in the community. In addition to recruitment from within the community, many of t he agency's seasoned officers are already members of outside criminal justice organizations and professio nal associations. The events held by these groups are also an excellent pl ace to recruit officers. Instruc tors who represent the ag ency teaching at local institutions have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility t o represent their agency with professionalism. The large numbers of recruits entering basic training while still searching for employment give instructors opportunities to market and sell th eir agency to prospective ap plicants. As the citizens in the community become more educated, policing as a profession must become more educated as well. The skills learned thr ough college education are requi red \"to be an effective police officer in the 21st century\" (White & Escobar, 2008 , p. 123). Police agencies must begin to recruit officers that have taken the initiative to better themselves through education. Education Standards The call for higher educational requirements for police officer s has been around for decades. In 1918, August Vollmer's movement toward poli ce professionalism called upon de partments to hire college educated police officers. He began hiring college students to fill part time po licing positions (Decker & Huckabee, 2002). The 1931 Wickersham Commission Report called upon American police d epartments to create formal education requirements as well. This comm ission believed that changes ove r the next fifteen years \"may see a great chain of instruction throughout the country which will make possible an education for every policeman. Only in this manner can the police ever hope successfully to cope with the c rime situation (Wickersham Commission, 1931, p. 85). The 1960's saw police in the middle of a social conflict that forced leaders to take a hard look at policing and the criminal justice system in general (Decker & Huckabee, 2002). The 1967 report by the Presidents Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice cal led upon police institutions to again create a higher standard of educational re quirements for law enforcement officers. In the report The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, the commission recommended that \"the ultimat e aim of all police departments should be that all personnel with general enforcement powers have baccalaureate degrees\" (President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administrati on of Justice, 1967, p. 109). There are many reasons cited for the need of college educated police officers. First and foremost, the development of critical thinking skills is linked to higher edu cation (White & Escobar, 2008). These skills are a necessity in today's police department as agencies move to comm unity policing and problems solving as a base line for success. Officers are frequently called upon to create solutions to problems that do not necessarily fall under the typical police crime problem. Neighborhood problems t hat affect the quality of life are dealt with far more frequently than typical cr iminal investigations. When resi dents have no place else to turn, they call the police to help. A Mighty Full Plate In addition to the 911-response- driven police activity, officer s today are required to not only attend community meetings to discuss problems but are responsible for facilitati ng those meetings as well. This requires well- developed communication skills \u2014 both written and verbal. Offic ers who have at least two years of college education are typically more prepared to handle this type of situation. In two separate studies of Florida Police officers, researchers found that t hose off icers who had a minim um of a two year degree performed better overall in police job functions and were more likely to act ethically in their law enforcement du ties (Tyre & Braunstein, 1992). Ethical performance by police officers is paramount to t he success of any agency in their respective communities. 376 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] If the public cannot trust the police department, communication and partnership begin to break down. Minority Recruitment One of the biggest arguments aga inst utilizing higher education as a prerequisite for employment in policing is the concern over losing poten tially good recruits, especially m inority and female appli cants. The number of minorities and women attending and receiving degrees, however, has risen substantially since the 1980's. In 2007, minority enrollment in institutions of higher learning in creased more than forty -seven percent (Cook & Cordova, 2007). After a study of this issue in 1991, the Police Executive Research Forum determined that \"there was an adequate pool of both minority and majority college educ ated men and women interested in police employment (White & Escobar, 2008, p. 123). If this is the case , however, why do police agencies continue to struggle with recruiting minorities and women? While opportunities for minorities in law enforcement have incr eased over the last 40 years, there continues to be discrimination in the workplace in terms of hiring, promotions, and assignments (Decker & Huckabee, 2002). Police agencies must be culturall y and racially diverse, mirroring the community in which they serve (White & Escobar, 2008). There has been supported research that lack of diversity in the organization may lead to poor relations with the community as well as misconduct by the offic ers (White & Escobar). Police departments should use targeted recruitment strategies t o bring in more minority applicants. Some suggested strategies include the use of minority recruiters, contacts with minority community leaders, and recruiting drives that specifica lly target minority applicants. In addition, it is recommended that recruiters maintain personal contact with minorities during the recruitmen t process (Decker & Huckabee, 2002). Agencies must, however, recruit minorities \"without regard to race or et hnic origin\" (National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, 1973, p. 331). In Conclusion While applicant pools have grown over the past year, police age ncies still need to be focused on finding qualified applicants that fit w ith the community and organizati onal culture. Many from this expanded pool of applicants are not interested in making law enforcement a career. Once the economy recovers, they will move back into the private sector whe re pay and benefits are more co mpetitive. In order to maintain the highest level of service to the community, po lice agencies must adapt to the new generation, increase standards in education, work toward a professional culture, and hire minority recruits. These strategies must be put in place in order to recruit the next generation police officer. References Anonymous (2001, January). Chicago police lower recruiting stan dards.

Police Officer Hiring Criteria Written by Randy Means, Kevin Lowry A good bit of federal anti-discrimination law must be considere d in choosing and sequencing police officer hiring criteria. For now, suffice to say that employers with 15 or more employees (including part time) must adhere to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disa bilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, for starters. Employers may also be subject to a variety of state-based civil rights laws that often apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees. Consu ltation with expert local counsel is advised. We proceed now with a discussion of certain police officer hiring criteria: written tests, medical screening and physical ability tests. The Written Test A tremendous amount of energy and money has been spent by indiv idual departments in the quest for the perfect entrance exam. If you have been diligent in your recruitment pr ocess, the significance of this phase of the hiring ordeal is radically reduced. The value of a written test as a p redictor of the future perfo rmance of a police officer has long been the subject of debate anyway. Traditionally, some large minorit y groups have performed relati vely poorly on many of these tests, and because of our emphasis on them, we have missed opportunities to hire s ome very good people. Today, the legally viable entrance test may be little more than an assessment of the take r's ability to read and write at required levels, and their ability to follow directi on. We may need to accept that a nd intensify other efforts in selection. Thousands of police agencies exist in this country, but we don' t need thousands of different entrance exams. Many departments have created or adopted bland, non-exotic writ ten tests which have already passed legal muster. Find one that has been acc epted in your state and use i t. Recruit the finest, let the test help put them in order, and then devote your best efforts to the rest of the selection process. Physical performance tests, psychological screening, b ackground investigation, medical screening and, very importantly, human relations skills assessment are far better tools for predicting success than the written test ever was\u2014as long as someone can read and write at required levels. Medical Screening The ADA precludes prospective em ployers from conducting medical exams or making medical inquiries of an applicant until after a conditional offer of employment has bee n made. The only pre-conditional offer inquiries that are acceptable, though they might pre-sage medical problem s, are straightforward questions concerning the applicant's ability to perform essential job functions. 378 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] For example, this job requires th at you be able to do \"this.\" Can you do \"this\"? These restrictions are intended to prevent subtle and not-so-subtle d iscrimination against individ uals with disabilities by attempting to assure that disabilities are not the focus of the selection process until a fter it has been determined that the applicant is otherwise a successful candidate. Then, the curtain is opened on possible disqualifying disabilities, and subsequent considerations are conducted under very bright light s of legal and sociopolitical scrutiny. If an applicant covered by the ADA is disqualified on the basis of a disability, the employer must be able to show that the candidate cannot perform all of the essential job functions, even with reasonable accommodations. Remember, we cannot require tha t all successful candidates be h ealthy. The ADA protects people from employment discrimination because of their disabilities\u2014even if their disability makes them remarkably unhealthy\u2014if they can perform all essential job functions. Other traditional thinking may need re-examination in light of current ADA principles\u2014like whether or not one really needs two eyes to perform the essential police job funct ions, and whether one really needs two biological legs when one plus a darn good pro sthesis seems to make that ca ndidate very able. Applicants who need hearing aids to hear satisfactorily should be allowed to use them, espe cially because we allow incu mbents to use them. Speaking of incumbents, the worst functioning heart in your inc umbent work force is apparently a good enough heart to do police work adequate ly\u2014at least so it seems from the fact that you are sending it into prospective combat each day. There will likely come a negative (legal) judg ment day regarding telling applicants that certain medical and physical standards represent essential job function s even though we have incumbents who are not held to those standards, and clearly would not meet them. Such illogic is probably not sustainable in the long term. Physical Ability Tests Physical ability tests bring down a great number of candidates. For that reason, the wise employer will run these tests before applying other hir ing criteria that are expensive and time consuming. A physical ability test in which an applicant must perform actual or simulated job tasks is not a medical examination or inquiry under the ADA. It may be run \"upfront.\" Again, we are not allowed to require that all new hires be healthy. The ADA protects some decidedly unhealthy people from discrimination on the basis of their disabilities, unless the candidate cannot perform the essential job functions. A candidate may be of questionable fitness and health yet be able to perform essential job functions. All that we can require, at least in the case of an applicant whose physical limitations are part of a covered disability, is that he or she be fit enough to do the j ob at minimum acceptable levels of safety and effectiveness. Physical ability standards that a re age- and gender-adjusted ar e, obviously and by definition, age- and gender- related rather than job-related\u2014unless we have a job called \"ol d man (or woman) police officer.\" The fact that someone falls into the 50th percentile (or any particular perce ntile) of a matrix of normative physical fitness data does nothing to assure that such p erson can do a particular job . So, for example, if someone is in pretty good shape for a 65-year-old woman, that does not tell us whether that person can or can't perform the essential functions of the job of entry level police officer. Also, requiring men to meet higher standards than women just because they are men may easily be viewed as gender discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Plus, Section 106 of the Civil Ri ghts Act of 1991 explicitly fo rbids gender \"norming\" on employment-related tests. Furthermore, to apply a physical standard to applicants that is never applied to incumbents may tend to invalidate that criterion. Physical performance standards should involve specific activities which are clearly job-related and may be required of any police officer at any time. These are t h e essen tial job functions. Examples might include a 379 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] dummy drag or the ability to handle normal police foot pursuit tasks like leaping small ditches and culverts, climbing over a small surmount obs tacle, climbing stairs and the like. The cutoff score on such a test w ould be the same for everyone, regardless of age or gender, because the tasks are the same for everyone. A surmount obstacle does not get sma ller, nor does the need to apprehend a criminal shrink, just because an officer is old or because of the office r's gender. Standards that are not age- and gender-adjusted are extremely l ikely to have adverse impacts on women and people over 40. Therefore, the employer must be able to validate such standards\u2014prove that they are so job- related as to constitute a busin ess necessity. Details of valid ation science are beyond the scope of this article but can be obtained via e-mail re quest at rbmeans@aol.com. It is also important to know that criteria like push-ups, sit-ups, a 1.5-mile run, etc., can be legally validated, although they do not \"look like\" the job. This may be accomplis hed through a two-step validation process that first identifies a valid passing score on a valid job task simulation test and then identifies what performance on a standard physical fitness test (push-ups, etc.) accurately (and with sufficient scientific certainty) predicts the ability to perform the job task simulation tests at the accepta ble level. The use of age a nd gender adjustments in passing scores completely invalid ates this approach, as mention ed above.

Police departments are squeezed by shifting demographics, changi ng expectations and a need to k eep up with traditional cr ime-investigation and -prevention duties while simulta neously expanding community ser vices and coordinating with hom eland security agencies. Departments large and small face these probl ems. Demographics The U.S. population is aging rapidly. Census Bureau projections show a marked rise in the over-65 population and a decrease among ages 18 to 35 -- the age range of recruitm ent for law enforcement, as well as for the careers that compete with law enforcement for talent. Diversity Police departments are making effo rts to better reflect the communities they serve. But lingering cultural biases, odd hours, and increased educational requirements create challe nges for departments hoping to recruit more women and other persons who are not heterosexual young white ma les. The RAND Center on Quality Policing 380 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] reports a creative range of depa rtmental attempts to address th is issue, including outreach to gay communities, efforts to demonstrate the rele vance of police work to young wo men, and efforts to recruit in Puerto Rico. Competition U.S. military involvement abroad and an increase in resources f or homeland security leave local law enforcement agencies in direct competition with the military an d federal agencies -- as well as with high-paying private security firms. Attempts to compete by emphasizing an e xciting, dramatic career in policing can backfire when thrill-seeking recruits encounter the gentler public-servi ce aspects of most daily police work. Changing Expectations Ellen Scrivner of the John Jay C ollege of Criminal Justice repo rts that public and departmental expectations of police officers have changed, from emphasizing linear response to and control of incidents, to a need for strategic thinking and problem-solving skills that better refle ct community needs. Employee expectations have also changed: Long, uncertain hours and modest salaries no long er meet the needs of many young families. Misconceptions Exciting cop shows on televisi on emphasize shootouts, car chase s and other high drama. This leaves potential recruits with the idea that such events are a daily part of policing, when in fact they occur rarely, if at all, in most departments. Recruiters themselves also can suffer from misconc eptions when they believe that only certain types of young men are appropriate for police work. Considerations Police department recruiters shoul d consider whether their curr ent strategies adequately address these problems, or whether new, creative approaches are required. Cutting-edge recruitment materials, such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police website www.discoverpolicing.com, show diverse images of officers. By expanding their recruitment efforts to include persons interest ed in public careers such as teaching or social services, rather than just targeting young men who might otherw ise opt for military service, police departments can attract whole new categories of qualified applicants. Solutions Solutions for tackling demographic and diversity issues include employing older civilians for non-patrol tasks that do not require a younger officer, or expanding acceptable age ranges for employment as long as physical fitness requirements are met. A more realistic portrayal of com munity police work in recruiting materials, and an understanding that women and men of diverse backgrounds stre ngthen a departments resources and resiliency, would also improve police recruiting quality. 381 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Police Recruitment and Retenti on - Improving Practices RAND Corporation Local law enforcement agencies typically cite recruitment and retention as among their most pressing issues. Yet, Alan Deal of the California Commission on Peace Officer St andards and Training told the RAND Summit on Police Recruitment and Retention, they typically do not make it a priority. Law enforcement agencies are hindered in recruitment by a lack of strategic planning for rec ruitment, a lack of unders tanding of the market, and advertising and marketing me thods that are out of touch and out of date for today's potential applicant. Nevertheless, Deal said, agencies that make recruitment and ret ention a priority can overcome these problems. In this section, we review what participants had to say about promising practices for la w enforcement agencies to address recruitment and retention problems, as well as pract ices that might be adapted from other sectors such as the military. Improving Recruiting Deal noted that while a large proportion of California local la w enforcement agencies agree that recruitment is a problem, few have devoted resour ces to it. Seventy-four percent spend less than $5,000 annually on recruitment, and nearly half have no recruitment budget. Similarly, a survey of local law enforcement agencies in Illinois showed that only 12 percent have a workforce development plan, and none have a written plan for retention. Traditional advertising and marketing is unlikely to help overc ome these problems, Deal said. Such efforts by local police agencies are typically out of date and out of touc h, demonstrating little knowledge of what candidates, particularly women and minorities, want in careers. Growing worker shortages stemming from decreasing birth rates will add to recruitment problems, and re tention problems further compound the challenges local law enforcement agencies face. A recent survey found that 22 percent of California officers have switched agencies in the course of their careers, with about 4 percent c hanging agencies each year. Other data show that more than 23,000 officers who had completed probation but were not eligible for retirement left California law enforcement agencies between 1979 and 2005 for careers elsewher e. Newer means of advertising and marketing can help police agenci es improve their recr uiting, Deal claimed. Internet sites are most effec tive, especially among self-direct ed candidates interested in police work. The 382 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Internet and other creative uses of technology can also help at tract more young applicants today and are typically used by private-sector firms to attract passive candi dates who are not otherwise looking to change jobs. A local law enforcement agency' s own employees, Deal said, are perhaps the second-most important resource it has for recruiting. The Sacrament o Sheriff's Department claims that nearly 90 percent of its best-performing officers learned about the department through a friend, relative, or other employee. Deal noted that a survey of 800 California academy graduates sh owed the primary motivations for joining a local law enforcement agency we re a desire to serve, the promis e of adventure or excitement at work, stable employment, and non-routine work. T he reputation of the agency also matters, not only for the candidate but also for \"influencers\" on the candidate such as family and frie nds. Some large departments develop means to market to particularly desirable candidates. The Charlotte-Meck lenburg Police Department distributes a video that depicts women in a variety of ranks and assignments speaki ng about what they did before joining the department to persuade women in other occupations to consider the potential opportunities available to them. Smaller agencies can also find unique ways to market themselves , Deal said. The Sheridan, Wyoming, Police Department distributes a video that emphasizes the benefits of working for a small agency in the Rocky Mountains. Deal noted that agencies can also personalize and streamline th eir selection process. Extended hiring processes put agencies at risk of losing good candidates, as do lack of c ontact with candidates throughout the process, failure to use online application technologies, and use of jarg on in application procedures. Several California departments have implemented t echnology such as online applicat ions to speed the hiring process. The federal government has funded initiatives to shorten the selection proc ess. California is spearheading legislation to allow peace officer background inv estigations to be conducted a fter a conditional offer of employment, thereby permitting background investigator s to ask job-related question s without risk of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibition of pre-offer medical inquire s. Recruiting Lessons from the Military Many of the recruitment and retention issues that local law enf orcement agencies face are similar to those faced by the military. Both law enforcement and the military, Bernard Rostker of the RAND Corporation told the summit, are market-driven, hierarchical rank systems in which recruits typically enter at the bottom and are promoted through the ranks. Both offer promotions on a competit ive basis, peg pay to time of and grade in service, and offer early retirement options. The police and the military also have similar life-cycle events in careers for their personnel. The first year of service, the accession period, requires both to consider how to attract qualified personnel, select appropriate jobs for them, and train and assign them. The second through the fif th years are a probationary and two-sided learning period, in which both p olice agencies and the military consider which personnel they want to retain and which they wish to separate (although in the police context, ex cept for performance issues, the act of separation is largely unilateral and initia ted by the individual, not the organization). The fifth through the fifteenth years are a promotion period, in which both police and the military must consider whom they want to promote to leadership positions and whom the y do not want to advance. Subsequent must consider how to keep and motivate those they want to retai n, what to do with senior officers, and how to maintain appropriate turnover in the force. Rostker noted that although local law enforcement agencies lack a centralized source for research and analysis on what may or may not work for police recruitment and retentio n, variation among them can help them analyze and identify the most effective recruitment and retention practices. Furthermore, previous research that helped the military address many of the pr oblems it shares with police agencies might be adapted to these agencies. This includes research on how to build a high-quality force and its effects, increasing pay to improve retention, and appealing to new age groups. 383 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Specific military recruiting experiences might also be applied to police work. The military has to make an enormous number of contacts to meet its accession requirements. In fact, Colonel Dan Choike and Lieutenant Colonel Mike Zeliff of the U.S. Marine Corps told the summit, M arine recruiters make approximately 10,000 contacts to ensure that 100 recruits are processed at the Milit ary Entrance Processing St ation and 55 eventually graduate from the School of Infantry. Part of this high ratio of contacts to recruits stems from the military's qualifications. Of the nearly 33 million youths in the United States between the ages of 17 and 24, only about 6 million are legal residents who have high school diplomas, woul d meet the requirements of Test Score Category A, and would not be disqualified for moral or physical fitness reasons. The propensity of youth to join the military has also decreased recently: In June 2005, 15 percent said they \"definitely\" or \"probably\" would \"be serving in the military in the next few years,\" but only 9 percent said so in December 2007. Nevertheless, Choike and Zeliff said, a great recruiter has confidence in his or her ability to convert the reluctant to joining. Military recruiting, Choike and Zeliff said, follows a model of consumer behavior in which awareness or understanding of military opportunities is, over time, converte d to a decision to enlist. Like local law enforcement agencies, the Marin e Corps seeks to attract individ uals with the \"dignit y\" goals of personal achievement and respect for self and others and who demonstrate \"fidelity\" in their duty to country and their self-discipline and teamwork. The Marine Corps, Choike and Zeliff said, has several measures of effectiveness for the $140 million in advertising it spends to attract recruits, including measures o f ad recall and action taken because of the ads. The military also measures lead generation variables such as qualif ied leads and their conversion rates and recruiter support. Recruiting Without Resources Although the military can offer ma ny lessons in recruitment and retention for local law enforcement agencies, it differs from many agencies in one important way: It has a large recruiting force and budget. By contrast, Nelson Lim of the RAND Corporation told the summit, only 30 percent of police departments have a recruiting force. Most elements of the military mode l by which candidates are con verted to recruits are a lso beyond the control of local law enforcement agencies. Nevertheless, Lim said, there a re five ways local law enforcement agencies can improve recruiting without add itional resources, that is, witho ut requiring an increase in taxes. First , Lim suggests, local law enfor cement agencies should put one l eader in charge of the entire recruiting process, from marketing to testi ng to background investigation through academy training. While most agencies do not consider the academy to be part of training, Lim said, t he academy dropout rate needs to be considered in assessing how well recruiting is f unctioning\u2014 specifically, whe ther recruiters are signing up the most promising candidates for the academy. To be effective, the recruiting \"czar\" should have direct support and a clear mandate from the police chief and civic leaders to make all elements of recruiting work seamlessl y in a lean and difficult environment. Second, Lim says, agencies should publicize that they are hiring. In some cases, Lim said, even test takers are not sure that hiring is taking place. Police agencies should en gage all their resources in the effort, putting recruiting information on business cards, asking officers to sp read the word, and using department vehicles as billboards. Agencies can make their web sites more effective by emphasizing the positive reasons for joining, demystifying the recruiting pro cess (perhaps providing a sample test online), and providing clear and updated instructions for applicants. Third , Lim recommends that agencies identify untapped local markets. Out-of-town recruiting trips, he said, are not effective, given that fe w persons will move far just to bec ome p olice officers. Rather, such recruiting trips ought to be limited to those loca tions where some intelligence indicates candidates are likely to be found, such as areas with economic difficulti es or where candidates are lik ely to have difficulties because of few openings. 384 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Within their own areas, local law enforcement agencies can make recruiting more effective by using a program such as CrimeStat to identify the top recruit-producing neighborhoods and communities and targeting their recruiting efforts on similar areas. Fourth , Lim said, not all applicants a re equally viable, so agencies should process them according to their viability. Highly viable applicants should be the top recruitin g priority, and less viable candidates should be a lower priority. Agencies should prioritize applicants by viability to unclog their recruiting systems. Fifth , not all recruiters and background investigators are equally p roductive. Local law enforcement agencies should develop performance measu res based on recent numbers and should encourage and reward top recruiting performance. Such recognition might be in the form of an award for the recruiter of the month, quarter, or year; lunch with the police chief; or dinner with the mayor. Improving Retention Retention, summit participants a greed, is the other side of rec ruiting, or what prevents departments from recruiting candidates only to lose them. Dwayne Orrick, Director of Public Safety for Cordele, Georgia, noted that retention costs can be ta llied as separation costs, recruitment costs, selection costs, new-employee costs, and other \"soft\" costs such as those that departments incur when they must \"stack\" calls and forgo proactive policing work because of staffing shortages. All told, Orrick claimed, f ailure to retain an officer can result in $100,000 in additional costs for a departmen t; therefore, the best way to r educe the demand on recruiting resources is for a department to keep the officers it already has. Officers, Orrick said, may leave a department for either \"exter nal\" or \"internal\" reasons. External reasons relate to the economy at the time; tha t is, officers may leave because they can, having better opportunities elsewhere. Internal reasons relate to what the department itself can offer . The single biggest influence on whether an officer leaves or stays, Orrick claimed, is the officer's immediate sup ervisor, because \"people don't quit jobs, they quit bosses.\" Other causes for turnove r may include uncompetitive salaries, lack of career growth, unmet job expectations, inadequate feedback, insufficient recognition, or lack of training that officers may seek for career growth. Orrick said that agencies should identify the core values they wish to instill and assess the organizational, cultural, and personal fit candida tes will have with the agency. Agencies can use realistic job previews to ensure proper organizational fit, behav ioral interviews to assess cultural fit, and background investigations to ensure personal fit. In addition to offering officers \"survival\" (that is, money) at their jobs, agencies should also help them reach recognition (success) a nd meaning (or transformation) at work. Local law enforcement agencies can, Orrick said, address many o f the reasons officers may choose to remain with the department or look elsewhere. Conducting \"stay\" interviews with the best officers can help identify what helps retain officers, to identify traits in officers who are likely to fit in or stay with the department, and to find what employees want that ag encies can provide. Such interv iews may also help a gencies begin their retention efforts with recruiting. Orrick also suggested that agencies make supervisors accountabl e for retention, something, he added, that is easier to do in large organizati ons with multiple stations or b ureaus than in smaller ones. Agencies can also make salaries competitive, offer flexible compensation, enhance recognition and career development, and offer career assessment and counseling. Offering varied work experien ces, such as cross-training or shadowing, can help officers discern which parts of police work they like most and wish to pursue. Addressing personal and family issues can also help agencies retain officers. Finally, agencies should create meaningful causes for their officers, enabling them to consider their careers as making a differe nce to a jurisdiction. Summary of Discuss ions Local law enforcement agencies are facing increasing challenges in recruitment and retention just as their work is becoming more complex. Higher standards, such as requiring a college education or a history of no or very 385 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] limited drug use, are reducing the number of eligible applicants, while agencies must take on increasingly complex tasks ranging from traditional crime fighting roles to community policing to homeland security. Police agencies generally have not applied common tenets of per sonnel management to their profession to address these challenges, but they can draw many lessons from t he application of personnel-management methods in other occupations and the experiences of their peers . Analyses of military recr uiting and retention can yield insights into how to appeal to young applicants and t o design career paths and progression that will retain and reward the most promis ing officers. Local law enforcement agencies themselves, ranging from departments with constant needs to those that need to grow to m eet specific needs to tho se that need to retain particular personnel, have lessons to share with each other. Th e results of this summit represent a call for a concerted effort to develop pers onnel-management principles and apply them to the law enforcement community. Evidence-based initiatives can yie ld results. Many departments already gather data to assess and fine-tune their efforts. In the extreme case of New Orleans, evidence-based initiatives, when presented by those outside the police department, quickly rallied city leaders to implement ma ny needed changes for the department. Internet dissemination can also help spread effective lessons more quickly and widely. Two recent innovations announced at the summit illustrate resources that can help poli ce agencies with their recruitment and retention needs. The RAND Center for Quality Policing, with the support of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, has launched a recrui tment and retention clearinghous e (http://www.rand.org/ise/centers/quality_policing/cops/). Jeremy Wilson, who serves as the clearinghouse's director, explained that it comp iles in a searchable database i nformation to help build, maintain, and enhance police workforces. All resources are annotated and sortable, al lowing agency personnel to identify the information that is most relev ant to their needs. Resources inc lude: Reports on promising practices, i ncluding evidence-based guides to improving recruitment and retention, especially for workforce diversity and community pol icing. Research and assessment reports on recruitment and retention. Briefings summarizing key pers onnel issues and strategies. Tools and methods for targeting recruiting efforts, assessing personnel needs, and gauging goal accomplishment. Data on personnel planning, poli ce agency employment and polici es, and community characteristics. Web site links to discussions of police staffing issues, fundin g agencies, professional associations, government offices, and data repositories. News and commentary by police personnel. Field experiences highlighting experiences and observations reg arding recruitment and retention. Announcements of current opportunities for police agencies and officers, including conferences, training sessions, funding opport unities, and other programs. In addition, Kim Kohlhepp of the International Association of C hiefs of Police brought attention to the association's new Discover Policing web site ( http://www.discoverpolicing.org ), which, by allowing candidates to obtain information on polici ng and to connect with agencies online, will help law enforcement agencies address their continuing recruiting challenges. Its career data base offers information such as: Why policing is a great career. Examples of the diversity of organizations and employment oppor tunities. Personal accounts of what it is like to be a police officer. An overview of hiring, selec tion, and training processes. Both the Recruitment and Retention Clearinghouse and the Discov er Policing web sites can help police agencies meet their personnel goals. The Clearinghouse web site helps to promote the dissemination of evidence-based lessons to assist agencies in maximizing the yield on their rec ruitment and retention efforts and resources. The 386 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Discover Policing web site increases awareness of, and interest in, the police profession, thereby improving police agencies' ability to attr act quality candidates. These a nd other means of communicating innovations, promising practices, analyses, and information are important for developing police-specific personnel management practices. Implications for Meeting Personnel Needs The summit also pointed to several steps police agencies can ta ke to improve their recruiting and retention. In particular, participants noted the following: In a highly competitive market, partnering with local criminal justice programs, administering frequent exams, and providing recruiting bonuses proved successful. In a rapidly growing community, a marketing campaign appealing to characteristics such as selflessness, patriotism, and community orienta tion, which the agency desired and candidates shared, helped attract candidates. Developing a cadre system letting recruits \"recycle \" through the academy as necessary also helped improve their processing. In a community that had to re build after a catastrophe, focused research on recruitment and retention, including an analysis of salary and benefits, helped a departme nt reverse its slide and stabilize its numbers. In a very large community, multiple initiatives, from selling the department's \"brand\" to recruitment web sites and hotlines to improving pay, are all necessary to m aintain the required force size. In a community seeking to rapid ly increase its police force for specific community needs, streamlined processes allowing candidates to be hired within three weeks of passing an exam helped improve recruitment, while changes in pay and other work practices helped maintain retention. In a department struggling to attain diversity that reflects th at of the community, the lack of a recruiting budget and restrictions such as r esidency requirements can limi t success. In a department seeking to improve recruitment and retention si multaneously, making the nature of policing more appealing to candida tes seeking \"white-collar\" st atus, instilling pride in the department, and demonstrating to veterans how new techniques (e.g., communi ty policing) serve traditional purposes (e.g., developing leads to capture criminals) all work . More generally, police agencies should focus on newer means of advertising and marketing, such as the Internet, for improving their recruiting, although their own em ployees will remain a very important recruiting resource. Police agencies can learn from military experience in different stages of the career cycle in market- driven, hierarchical rank systems. Agencies that find themselves w ith little or no resources for recruiting can still improve their recruiting efforts by centralizing leadership for those efforts, spreading the word when they are hiring, identifying untapped local markets, prioritizing applications, and rewardin g their most effective recruiters. Finally, because retention can eli minate much of the need for recruiting, agencies should focus on the \"internal\" reasons that may drive away effective employees and should work to augment the reasons officers choose to stay with a departmen t. 387 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Recruiting Character Written by Jay Burch When I started my career in law enforcement more than 20 years ago, we had 300 applicants showing up to test for three police officer openings. I tested with Denver PD in t he mid-1980s, and there were over 2,000 people testing for 50 jobs. As everyone in law enforcement knows now, those days are past. Where there used to be an applicant-to-hiring ratio of 100-to-1, there now is 10-to-1, or less in many cases. Larger departments recruit nati onwide just to get enough applic ants to try to fill academies. Smaller departments often struggle just to get enough applicants to fill openings. Not only is the quantity of applicants gone, sometimes the quality of applicants is just not there either. Police chiefs of smaller departments are faced with lingering openings or being tempte d to lower hiring standards. When I left a modern, highly equipped mid-size police departmen t in the Dallas metro area a few years back to take my first police chief job, it was at a small 15-officer de partment in a rural town. I knew it would be a challenge to hire officers of the same quality I was used to in a large metropolitan area, but I promised to never compromise my hiring standards and expectations. For my first opening, I had five appli cants, and three of those had criminal records! I chose a plan to hire only men and women of high character. It mattered not if the person was the smartest, toughest, best looking, worst looking, etc.\u2014the focus was on character. The downside was that some of my openings would linger, but I was willing to be patient to get the right people. As most chiefs of smaller depa rtments know, small police depart ments are usually training grounds for officers who eventually move on to larger , better paying departments. My goal was not only to increase pay and benefits for employees, which I knew woul d take time, but to build a dep artment with high-qualit y professionals where most would want to stay for man y years because of the quality of the department, good working conditions and being part of a successful team with the proper tools to do the job. Still, the main issue was to get people interested in our mission to hire and retain character. How to Hire Character Many tests for police applicants result in those who are smart or are good test-takers being hired or promoted, but they don't account for character. One might respond that th e character issues of applicants are checked during background investigations. B ut do we really check for tr ue character? There are outstanding background investigators across the count ry who \"look under every rock\" when investigating a recruit, so much of this may not be news. Mediu m or smaller department s sometimes have more time to spend delving into potential recruit's background than bigger departments because we don't have the dozens if not hundreds of applicants a month to work with. With this in mind, I offer the following for consideration when try ing to hire character. Rethink the recruiting process. Before entering law enforcement , I worked in the private industry and was always impressed with the recruiting efforts of many corporations. These businesses had recruiting and the application process down to a sci ence. They made the applicant feel as if he were the most important person to that company. When I became a po lice chief, I wondered why law enforcement does not go to the same lengths to attract quality people. We may not be able to go to the extr emes of corporate recruiting, but we can use the same principles. Plan the initial interview. Most all agencies will have an init ial interview with a potential recruit, but we take it a step further and have the appli cant meet with a couple of membe rs of the command staff and administration. The interview is not a board, per se, but a chance for the applicant to meet the staff and for the staff to get to know the applicant in a somewhat less formal setting. The appli cant often feels more at ease and will sometimes reveal issues or make comments that are indicative of something we need to investigate or reveal the ominous \"red flag.\" 388 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] If an applicant makes a positive impression during the initial interview, we sometimes take the person to lunch. Again, many agencies can't afford the time or money to take an applicant to lunch, but there are benefits to be realized. When applicants get into a less formal lunch setting, they tend to relax and open up about issues important in their lives versus trying to discuss matters they think we want to hear. Remember, once an applicant \"opens a door\" to a t opic, most times we can step through that door with follow-up questions if relevant to a potential police career. Background Investigation We try to take steps to uncover character issues. We may contact references, friends, former co-workers, or anyone we contact who knows the applicant. One of the most impo rtant questions to be asked is, \"When you think of a great police officer, does (applicant's name) come t o mind as the type of police officer you would want serving the public?\" I've actually had people burst out la ughing when asked this question. Their response is often a red flag. While home visits are a common practice with many agencies, man y do not conduct home visits for various reasons. A \"surprise\" home visit is often preferred over a sche duled one. Our investigators look for things in the residence indicative of character issues, such as photographs o r wall hangings, books or magazines on display that point to certain interests. Does the person take pride in how they live? Is their residence basically clean or is it littered with trash, dirty dishes, beer cans, etc.? If the a pplicant has a yard, how is it kept? Does the applicant show any emotions\u2014 positive or negative\u2014in how he talks with or handles other fami ly members present? Investigators can glean much from a home visit about an applicant's character and prior ities. How we live can sometimes relate to how we work. Contact instructors, the academy director and fellow students o f the applicant. We're looking for character issues such as leader ship, commitment, ethics, honesty and citi zenship. Peel the onion. Most applicants expect their references to give a positive response to a background inquiry about them. Like many police agencies , we try to go two or three laye rs deep into the background to find friends of friends or co-workers of co-wor kers who know the applicant. Nei ghbors are also sometimes a good source of information. Obviously, we have to be careful with how far or deep we go int o an applicant's private life, but it seems in my experience that more officers have lost their jobs or ruined th eir careers over off-duty issues than on-duty issues. Early on in a recruit's training, if problems arise, we must de termine if the problems are training issues or character issues. There is a major difference. Training problem s can be addressed through remedial training. Character issues usually take a completely different and complicated turn through the disciplinary process\u2014 thus, the importance of recruiting and hiring character. The Standards Bar As part of the recruiting character philosophy, I teach in poli ce academies. This allows me to get to know the recruits on a personal basis during the class; to see the natur al leaders; to see those truly committed; and to see those dedicated to service with honor and, yes, character. As part of my teaching, I introduce the \"standards bar.\" I tell the cadets that we a ll have an imaginary bar or le vel in our lives where everything above it is acceptable and everything below it is not acceptable, unless we compromise our standards. No two people have their persona l standards bar at the same lev el, but good people of quality character have their bar on average at a highe r level than others because we e xpect more of ourselves and refuse to compromise our standards for anyone or any reason. I want those people in my department serving our community. That person may or may not be the smartest when it comes to tak ing a test or board, but he usually becomes a high character officer in the department. Becoming part of an o rganization with others of the same high quality 389 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] and character makes being in tha t organization more enjoyable, and as a result, I have seen an increase in average years of service before moving on\u2014if they do decide to move at all. To achieve success, we are all walking up a downward-moving esc alator. Progress is slow but we are moving ahead. The moment we stop walki ng forward, we lose progress, an d our goal quickly becomes more distant, if not unreachable. It takes commitment and action to work toward our goals without ceasing. My recruiting targets are men and women with s uch a commitment to keep moving forward. Commitment Umbrella As another part of my instruction, I introduce the \"commitment umbrella.\" When I started my police career, most officers were dedicated and committed to most areas of the ir lives. But in recent years, I've seen that people who made very good officer s and who were highly dedicated to their profession have failings or lack of commitment in most other aspects of their lives. I talk about wanting people who are highly dedicated and commit ted to all aspects of their lives. I am aware that police administrators cannot delve too much into personal lives of our employees. But if they are truly committed to all aspects of their lives, being around cadets in a police academy class or talking extensively to references and others during b ackground investigations will reveal this. Under the commitment umbrella a re divisions of our lives: job, family, marriage, health, finances, spiritual life, goals, friends, etc. The recruits I search for are equally comm itted to all aspects of their lives but have different priorities for each aspect. There is probably no way to determine all the aspects of one's priorities in life, but finding a person who is equally committed has potential to make a better police officer. By the time I left my first police chief job four years later, there was usually a waiting list of decent applicants when we had an open position, which was becoming less frequent. It didn't matter to most applicants that there were larger, better paying departments in the region. Applicant s had heard about our department, knew the type of men and women who served there and wanted to be a part of su ch a quality organization. As a final segment of recruiting character, and something that normally only a smaller department can do, I have an interview with the applicant, usually with one or two of my command staff present. This is not a highly intense interview but a \"meet and greet\" visit just to get to k now the applicant and to learn the type of person he is to determine if he may be a f it for the department. Certainl y, there are some low-stress scenario-type questions we discuss, but only to observe and hear his thought process. M y opinion is that you tend to see the real person in a less intrusive situation th an a stressful interview board. It may not be feasible or possible for some chiefs to have the added benefit of teaching in an academy to get to know potential applicants, but you can keep in contact with academy directors and let them know the type people you want for your department. If nothing else, designate a person to spend time at the police academy to learn the recruits and determine who the leaders of the class a re and why they are looked upon as leaders. Recruiting character is not a perfect system, and certainly the re are those hired under the philosophy who do not make it after all. But the upsid e is for those who do make it i n the system. Those officers are usually far better officers than those under the more traditional recruitment meth ods. 390 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Refe rences American Fact Finder. www.factfinder.census.gov DiscoverPolicing.org Hill, Cindy.

Wear Your Belt It might sound simple to you, eve n unnecessary, but the truth i s too many agencies don't mandate belt wear. And even among those that do, many officers ignore policy becau se the culture doesn't value it. The truth: Seatbelts save lives. Article: Wear Your Belt. Watch Your Speed - By Travis Yates 2. Wear Your Vest We know vests save lives. We know that bullets can fly when we least expect it. Add to that the fact that body armor can improve your likelihood of surviving a car accident o r other traumatic event and you quickly see why you must wear it. Always. Period. Article: Wear Your Vest - By Jeff Chudwin 3. Watch Your Speed Why do cops drive fast? Because th ey can, right? Well, driving faster than what conditions warrant is a sure way to get in trouble. Of course ther e are times when getting on sc ene quickly is critical. But these times are rare. Too often, officers are speeding\u2014just because they can. In the process, they are putting themselves and the public at perilous risk for no good reason . Article: Wear Your Belt. Watch Your Speed - By Travis Yates 4. WIN\u2014What's Important Now? It's a simple question that can elicit profound results. It's a question that will lead to deliberate action, not reaction.

Article: WIN\u2014What's Important Now? - By Brian Willis 5. Remember: Complacency Kills! Chief Jeff Chudwin perhaps said it best: \"Complacency is among the most dangerous and insidious threats we face because it lays us open to all others.\" Complacency is wh y police officers think they can go without vest and seatbelts. It's why they think they can speed and allow the mselves to be distracted. To quote Chief Chudwin again: \"Complacency will kill you.\" Article: Complacency Kills - By Jeff Chudwin 396 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Prior Planning If you do not have the information ahead of time, you will be answering some uncomfortable questions and not have the answers.

Every year more than 120 Police Officers are killed in the line of duty. The National Law Enforcement Memorial wall in Washington DC has the name of more than 19,000 officers Thousands more are seriously injured in the line of duty..... Sadly, less than 25% of emergenc y response agencies are prepare d for any of these catastrophic events! 14 NV Officer deaths since 2006 2014 - Igor Soldo - LVMPD 2014 - Alyn Beck - LVMPD 2013 - David VanBuskirk - LVMPD 397 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 2012 - Tracy Hardin - NDOC 2012 - Lawrence, Denny - Elko S.O. 2010 - Deutch, Ian - Nye Cty S.O. 2010 - Cooper, Stanley - U.S. Marshall 2009 - Leach, Daniel - LVMPD 2009 - Nettleton, Trevor - LVMPD 2009 - Beitel, Milburn III - LVMPD 2009 - Manor, James - LVMPD One of the most dreaded traumatic events any law enforcement agency can experience: critical injuries or line- of-duty deaths They create chaos within any org anization and impact every swor n officer and civilian employee. During such emotionally challenging times, only the quick and e fficient implementation of a well-prepared plan of action can keep the \"organized\" chaos from degenerating into full-blown dysfunction. 398 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] How one responds to such an e vent will define you as a Chief, manager, or leader. It will forever change the way your department operates and will affect your department's ability to recover and continue to serve. Starting with management, ask these 4 key questions: Do we have a Line of Duty Death Pre-Plan in place? Do I as a leader know where my copy is? How long has it been since I looked at it and updated it? Do we have each staff member complete a confidential packet in case of a death? If you cannot fill in the answers to these three important questions, you then need to start on the process of having a hands on, Critical Injury/Line of Duty Death Pre-plan in place; regularly updated and regularly communicated to all department members. If your department does have a pre-plan in effect, ask yourself these questions: How familiar with the pre-plan am I right now? Do I know all of my available r esources and is the contact information for them readily available? Is the information in this pre-plan current? Agency's will find it better for a ll concerned if they formulat e answers to these questions when compassionate, clear thinking heads rule, rather than in a moment of emotional chaos when No one thinks clearly................... These events are difficult to m anage at best. However, with th e right amount of planning and with experienced resources at hand, you and your department ...WILL make it through these painful experiences and be able to continue on with work and life . Departments that have a critic al injury / line of duty death policy in place prior to the incident, experience fewer problems during this type of crisis. Such policies offer far-reaching advantages. Not only will your officers be better prepared to deal with thi s sudden violent trauma, but your department will also find fewer job-related disabilities arising from the after math of such an incident. 399 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] A definitive plan allows agenci es to function more effectively during one of the highest stress situations your officers may ever face. The loss will effect the family the departmentthe community both old and young...... On April 22, 2008, Trooper Chris Kelly was teaching a class, Re alities of Law Enforcement, at the Academy, to a new group of Cadets. It was their second day. At the end of the class, Trooper Kelly opened the floor to ques tions. One of the cadets asked the group of instructors: \"What do you do when you have to make that call t o the officers' family, how do you handle it. What do you do if you get that call on a fellow officer?\" The room got quiet. Trooper Chris Kelly addressed the cadet: I got that call. At 10:10 my sister, a Nevada Trooper, was involved in an accide nt. At 10:13 I got that call... You can ask my wife, a switch sna pped, I went into police mode because that is what we do......... I DROVE MYSELF It is not a matter of if...but when we get that call again. Nevada Department of Public Safety as implemented a KARA Team: The KARA Team has been organized to respond and act in the case of a serious and/or critical incident. Our primary goal is to persona lly and professionally meet your needs with regards to family notification in the event of the critical incident. The Voluntary questionnaire is your first step in the planning process and will be considered extremely Confidential. The two completed packets will be sealed and housed in locked file cabinets in dispatch and your respective duty stations. 400 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Should you choose not to complete this packet, or participate i n the KARA program, the Department will follow the policies and procedures already in place for no tification of family members.

Dispatch notifies Command/on duty KARA Team member/ PIO, Dispat ch Supervisor and Dispatch Center Manager. Family Notification: All attempts will be made to get the imme diate family to the hospital as soon as possible by the KARA Team or Command personnel, following polic y. KARA Team member responds to dispatch and assumes Facilitator role. Contacts KARA Team members and opens employee confidential pack et. Facilitator deploys team and dele gates assignments from packet. Facilitator is responsible for upda te notification of all personnel thru designates. Facilitator is Command contact person and Record Keeper which w ill act as the legend for the After Action Report. Facilitator acts as Media Contact until PIO assumes duties. Facilitator is call taker for all calls regarding incident. Team members have assignments and respond accordingly. KARA Team member assigned to family, will remain with family un less relieved by employee designate or Command personnel. Facilitator In Charge In order to prevent duplication of efforts and ensure the proce ss works for the benefit of the employee and his or her family, the FIC s hall coordinate all KARA Team f unctions regarding the incident. The Facilitator is not necessarily \"the\" decision maker nor nec essarily a position of rank. The FIC's primary role is to ens ure the needs of the employee a nd the family are met before the needs of the Department. Employee Actions All employees not involved in the incident will be notified and requested not to call the dispatch center. A Sergeant or Supervisor should meet with on duty personnel as soon as possible. Off duty employees will be notifie d by their district supervisor or designee, via telephone. Transportation The family contact officer will drive the immediate family memb ers to the hospital. If a family member absolutely ref uses to be driven, all attempt s will be made to have a Team member ride with them. 401 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Any trips to and from the hospita l, the family should be accompanied by the contact officer, a Team member or some designee requested by the employee, the family o r the department. Hospital Liaison Officer The first official, other than the Chief or his designate, to arrive at the Hospital shall act as the Hospital Liaison Officer Coordinating activities of hospita l personnel with the immediat e family members, the DPS/law enforcement family, the press and others. Secure a private waiting area for immediate family. Secure a waiting area for department personnel. Establish a Press staging area - Coordinate with the PIO. Remain at the hospital while the family is present. Do not be overly protective of the family. Family Liaison Officer The selection of the Family Liaison Officer is a critical assig nment An attempt should be made to assign someone who enjoyed a close relationship with the employee and their family. However, the liaison should not be so emotionally involved with the loss that they would become ineffective. This is not a decision-making position. This is a role of a \"f acilitator\" between the Family and the Department of Public Safety. Ensure that the wishes of the employee and the needs of the fam ily, come before the wishes of the Department Administrators must also anticipate the possible effects of the officers' death on department personnel. The victim's shift, their close friends in the department, the dispatchers, the evidence technician, and the administrative staff - these individuals should be considered s urvivors too. However, anyone in the department should be afforded the opport unity to assist the family in any way they feel capable of.

We believe this is the first manual of its type in the nation, and my office is proud to cooperate in its preparation and distribution. Death notification is acknowledged to be one of the most difficult tasks faced by law enforcement officers and other professionals, because learning of the death of aloved one often is the most traumatic event in a person's life. The moment of notification is one that most people remember very vividly for the rest of their life -- sometimes with pain and anger. Some survivors hear the news first through the media or a reporter calling, and then have flash-backs to that moment for years. Others tell how they were stunned to hear the person who was killed referred to as \"the body\" only minutes after the death. This booklet suggests ways to notify survivors effectively and sensitively -- including tips on what not to do or say. Notification is an exceedingly important duty. Besides being sensitive, notifiers have to be prepared in case a survivor goes into shock and requires emergency medical treatment. Notifiers also can provide very important information to survivors, including details about how death occurred. They can volunteer to notify others and provide otherinvaluable support. The principles described here are simple: Notification should be done in person, in time, in pairs whenever possible, in plain language, and with compassion. The recommended procedures were developed by people with much experience in death notification, and with help from survivors who have been through it. As one of the survivors put it, \"Please remember you are assisting innocent victims of circumstance.\" If you have any suggestions about how to improve these guidelines, please contact the Attorney General's Office. Thank you for your interest in this material, and good luck with your very important duty of death notification. -- Bonnie J. Campbell, Attorney General of Iowa 407 of 744Acknowledgements The people who took the lead in designing and drafting the guidelines were a committee of volunteers: Suzan Brooks from MADD/Polk County Chapter, Rich Joens of Polk County Victim Services, John and Kay Egan, who are the parents of a homicide victim, Rich Conner of the West Des Moines Police Department, and Kevin Seely of Hamilton's Funeral Services in Des Moines. Dr. Thomas L. Bennett, State Medical Examiner, also has been a strong supporter and contributor to this project. All these people have much first-hand experience in death notification and helping survivors. They exemplify the combination of professionalism and compassion that is so essential to the duty of death notification. I am exceedingly grateful to these people and their organizations for their generous public service. -- Attorney General Bonnie Campbell 408 of 744Basic Death Notification Procedures These are some of the cardinal principles of death notification. Some of the points overlap, and all will be refined by the notifier's experience and judgment. \"In Person\" Always make death notification in person -- not by telephone. It is very important to provide the survivor with a human presence or \"presence of compassion\" during an extremely stressful time. Notifiers who are present can help if the survivor has a dangerous shock reaction -- which is not at all uncommon -- and they can help the survivor move through this most difficult moment. Arrange notification in person even if the survivor lives far away. Contact a medical examiner or law enforcement department in the survivor's home area to deliver the notification in person. Never take death information over the police radio. Get the information over the telephone, or it might leak out to family through the media or private parties listening to police radio. If radio dispatchers start to give information over the radio, stop them and call in. \"In Time\" -- and with certainty Provide notification as soon as possible -- but be absolutely sure, first, that there is positive identification of the victim. Notify next of kin and others who live in the same household, including roommates and unmarried partners. Too many survivors are devastated by learning of the death of a loved one from the media. Mistaken death notifications also have caused enormous trauma. Before the notification, move quickly to gather information. Be sure of the victim's identity. Determine the deceased person's next of kin and gather critical information -- obtain as much detail as possible about the circumstances of the death, about health considerations concerning the survivors to be notified, and whether other people are likely to be present at the notification. -2- 409 of 744\"In Pairs\" Always try to have two people present to make the notification. Ideally, the persons would be a law enforcement officer, in uniform, and the medical examiner or other civilian such as a chaplain, victim service counselor, family doctor, clergy person, or close friend. A female/male team often is advantageous. lt is important to have two notifiers. Survivors may experience severe emotional or physical reactions. (Some even strike out at notifiers.) There may be severalsurvivors present. Notifiers can also support one another before and after the notification. Take separate vehicles if possible. The team never knows what they will encounter at the location. One might need to take a survivor in shock to a hospital while the other remains with others. (Shock is a medical emergency.) One notifier may be able to stay longer to help contact other family or friends for support. Having two vehicles gives notifiers maximum flexibility. Plan the notification procedure. Before they arrive, the notifier team should decide who will speak, what will be said, how much can be said. \"In Plain Language\" Notifiers should clearly identify themselves, present their credentials and ask to come in. Do not make the notification at the doorstep. Ask to move inside, and get the survivor seated in the privacy of the home. Be sure you are speaking to the right person. You may offer to tell children separately if that is desired by adult survivors. Relate the message directly and in plain language. Survivors usually are served best by telling them directly what happened. Thepresence of the team already has alerted them of a problem. Inform the survivor of the death, speaking slowly and carefully giving any details that are available. Then, calmly answer any questions the survivor may have. -3- 410 of 744Begin by saying, \"I have some very bad news to tell you,\" or a similar statement. This gives the survivor an important moment to prepare for the shock. Then, avoid vague expressions such as \"Sally was lost\" or \"passed away.\" Examples of plain language include: \"Your daughter was in a car crash and she was killed.\" \"Your husband was shot today and he died.\" \"Your father had a heart attack at his work place and he died.\" Call the victim by name -- rather than \"the body.\" Patiently answer any questions about the cause of death, the location of the deceased's body, how the deceased's body will be released and transported toa funeral home, and whether an autopsy will be performed. If you don't know the answer to a question, don't be afraid to say so. Offer to get back to the survivor when more information is available, and be sure to follow through. There are few consoling words that survivors find helpful -- but it is alwaysappropriate to say, \"I am sorry this happened.\" \"With Compassion\" Remember: Your presence and compassion are the most important resources you bring to death notification. Accept the survivor's emotions and your own. It is better to let a tear fall than to appear cold and unfeeling. Never try to \"talk survivors out of their grief\" or offer false hope. Be careful not to impose your own religious beliefs. Many survivors have reported later that statements like these were not helpful to them: \"It was God's will,\" \"She led a full life,\" and \"I understand what you are going through\" (unless the notifier indeed had a similar experience.) Plan to take time to provide information, support, and direction. Never simply notify and leave. Do not take a victim's personal items with you at the time of notification. Survivors often need time, even days, before accepting the victim's belongings. Eventually, survivors will want all items, however. (A victim's belongings should never be delivered in a trash bag.) Tell survivors how to recover items if they arein the custody of law enforcement officials. -4- 411 of 744Give survivors helpful guidance and direction Survivors bear the burden of inevitable responsibilities. You can help them begin to move through the mourning and grieving process by providing immediate direction in dealing with the death. Offer to call a friend or family member who will come to support the survivor -- and stay until the support person arrives. Offer to help contact others who must be notified (until a support person arrives to help with this duty.) Survivors may have a hard time remembering what is done and said, so write down for them the names of all who are contacted. Inform the survivor of any chance to view the deceased's body. Be available to transport the survivor or representative for identification of the victim, if necessary. Explain the condition of the deceased's body and any restrictions on contact that may apply if there are forensic concerns. If appropriate, explain that an autopsy will be done. Viewing the deceased's body should be the survivor's choice. Providing accurate information in advance will help a survivor make that decision. Some survivors will choose to see the body immediately, and this should be allowed if possible. (Denying access to see the body is not an act of kindness.) Provide other specific information. Take a copy of the \"Community Resource Information\" form, fill it out, and leave it with the survivor. [See copy of form at end of this booklet.] Fill out and keep the \"Survivor Intake Form.\" [See copy of form at end of this booklet.] This form records basic information about survivors and their wishes. Completethe form, sign it, and keep it with the report or investigation file. -5- 412 of 744Follow up. Always leave a name and phone number with survivors. Plan to make a follow-up contact with the survivor the next day. If the death occurred in another county or state, leave the name and phone number of a contact person at that location. Most survivors are confused and some might feel abandoned after the initial notification. Many will want clarifications or may need more direction on arrangements that are necessary. Following up can be the last step in completing a \"person-centered\" and sensitive death notification that is truly helpful to survivors. The notification team should be sure they are clear on any follow-up assignments theyneed to carry out. (See also the discussion of \"debriefing\" notifiers, on page 8.) Death Notification in the Work Place Survivors often must be notified at their work place. Here are several tips to help apply the basic principles described above to a work place notification. Ask to speak to the manager or supervisor, and ask if the person to be notified is available . It is not necessary to divulge any details regarding the purpose of your visit. Ask the manager or supervisor to arrange for a private room in which to make the notification. Follow the basic notification procedures described above: in person, in time, in pairs, in plain language, with compassion. Allow the survivor time to react and offer your support. Transport the survivor to his or her home, or to identify the body, if necessary. Let the survivor determine what he or she wishes to tell the manager or supervisor regarding the death. Offer to notify the supervisor, if that is what the survivor prefers. -6- 413 of 744Death Notification in a Hospital Setting Law enforcement officers and medical examiners may be called on to do death notification at a hospital after an accident or a shooting, for example. It is a very good idea for hospitals and other officials to determine general procedures and protocols in advance, so all parties are familiar with their duties and roles. The principles of death notification described above all apply in the hospital setting. Here are a few points to be sure to remember: Find a quiet room for the notification and be sure survivors are seated. (Do not notify in a crowded hall or waiting room.) Arrange for a doctor to be present or available shortly to answer medical questions. Doctors should be in clean uniform. Inform simply and directly. Provide assistance and guidance: Ask if survivors wish to spend time with the body of the deceased. Explain the procedure if identification of the deceased is necessary. Explain about autopsy or organ donation, if appropriate. Volunteer to help notify others. Make a list of any calls made. If there are media calls, refer them to the investigating officer or (if available) a victim service advocate. Do not leave survivors alone. Be sure someone is there to accompany them. Fill out the \"Survivor Intake Form\" for your records, and give survivors the \"Community Resource Information\" form. Be sure the survivor has your name and number. Contact the survivor the next day. -7- 414 of 744\"Debriefing\" for Death Notification Volunteers and Professionals Members of a notification team should meet as soon as possible to debrief the situation: Double-check who is responsible for any follow-up tasks to help ease the pain and suffering of survivors. Review the notification: what went wrong, what went right, how it could be done better in the future. Share personal feelings and emotions of the notification team. Death notifications are, without a doubt, stressful and difficult and sometimes very depressing. Be frank and honest. Share your concerns with one another. Discuss any feelings team members have about the death and notification. For example, the notification experience may have triggered emotions and stress related to a notifier's own loss of a loved one. Support one another. -8- 415 of 744General Information on How Survivors Respond to Death Notification Physical Shock: Persons learning of the death of a loved one may experience symptoms of shock such as tremors and a sudden decrease in blood pressure. Shock is a medical emergency -- help should be summoned. Some of the factors that affect stress reactions are: * the intensity of the event (for example, violent death vs. heart attack), * the survivor's ability to understand what's happening, * and the survivor's equilibrium. Whenever possible, notifiers should be aware of any available background information about the survivors, including medical or emotional history. Other general reactions to death notification: Even if there is no physical shock response, death notification must be considered a crisis for the survivors. They will have a need to express feelings; a need for calm and reassuring authority; a need for help in determining what happens next; and a need to begin restoring control by making some choices -- naming a support person to call, for example, or selecting a funeral home. These needs can be met through the humane, patient, and non-judgmental approach of notifiers. Allow survivors to express their grief freely. Take the time to give them adequate information about the death and about official procedures subsequent to the death. Many survivors, regardless of background, find themselves numb and unable to take the next step. This is where the support person helps the most. Survivors need support persons to help them through the initial crisis. Before you leave a survivor, make sure such ongoing support is available. The suggested Survivor Intake Form and Community Resources Form (\"What Do I Do Now?\") will help with this process. -9- 416 of 744Resource Materials for death notification The following pages contain four resource items for local departments: 1. Survivor Intake Form. (To be reproduced locally.) This form should be completed at the time of notification by the notifier and retained by the notifier. The form records essential information from survivors. It will help notifiers give survivors information and comply with their wishes. Gathering the listed information will help avoid needless follow-up calls or interviews with survivors. 2. Community Resource Form for survivors. (To be reproduced locally.) This form should be completed and left with survivors at the time of notification. It will help notifiers provide essential information that survivors will need after a family member has died suddenly. 3. \"A Guide to Survival For Family and Friends of Homicide Victims.\" (May be reproduced locally or obtained from the Attorney General's Office.) This brief Guide will help survivors of homicide victims cope with the tragedy. Your department can simply copy the Guide and give it to survivors. The \"Guide to Survival\" is available as a free pamphlet from the Crime Victim Assistance Division of the Attorney General's Office, Old Historical Building, Des Moines, Iowa 50319. Phone 1-800-373-5044 or 515-281-5044. 4. Wallet cards for notifiers. These cards should be carried like Miranda cards by notifiers. (Use these cards, or copy and laminate them to make more cards.) 417 of 744Survivor Intake Form Information about survivors and their wishes -- to be completed by notifier.

PO Box personal financial diary of Social Security Number This diary was last updated on We strongly suggest this diary be completed in pencil so it can be updated whenever necessary. We also suggest storing the book in a storage bag in your freezer so in case of fire in your residence, the diary will remain safe. 420 of 744 2 \"YOUR PERSONAL/ FINANCIAL DIARY\" This handbook was developed in November 1995 to be used as an educational tool for Concerns of Police Survivors' national training sessions. These training sessions were planned to help agencies address the emotional aftermath following a law enforcement officer's death. Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc., gives permission for this handbook to be copied by any person, agency, or organization. COPS would request, however, a credit line be given in the reproduced document. This Your Personal/Financial Diary is a project of Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. Printing and distribution of the document are funded through a grant from the U. S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance, grant #95- PS-CX-0001. Production of this handbook was made easy by modeling it after the \"Critical Incident Booklet\" published by the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary. Our thanks to them for taking on the task of producing such a booklet for law enforcement families. INTRODUCTION This personal financial diary was planned with the specific intention of giving law enforcement officers, who serve in a high-risk profession, the opportunity to organize their financ ial business so their families will have this information in an organized fashion should that officer be killed in the line of duty or die at an early age. However, this diary can be used by anyone to organize their personal/financial affairs. Every day law enforcement officers tend to tedious paperwork. Writing detailed reports can make the difference in court cases, civil cases, and truly affect the outcome of occurrences in peoples' lives. Paperwork is a major part of the law enforcement officer's job. Having worked with thousands of families that have lost officers in the line of duty, it has become apparent to Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc., that while law enforcement officers handle paperwork every day on the street, they are extremely lax at handling personal paperwork. You see, each year during National Police Week, a time when the law enforcement profession gathers to honor its fallen, we hear of 20 or more families whose officers forgot to up date their beneficiary forms. Imagine finding out after your law enforcement officer spouse has died that you're not listed as the beneficiary on insurance forms! Imagine finding out that although you've been married to this officer for seven years, the former spouse is still listed as beneficiary! This is a hurt no family should have to suffer. This handbook is designed to address this violation of law enforcement officers' dependents. The diary also encourages those who take the time to organize their affairs to leave a letter stating why the spouse was not their beneficiary if that was their intent. It will eliminate many family traumas and will help the surviving family understand why the deceased left benefits to various individuals other than the spouse. 421 of 744 3 Take time with your spouse to sit down and complete Your Personal/Financial Diary . It will save you or your survivors hundreds of hours searching for legal and financial documents at some time in the future. If you're a law enforcement officer, it's the least you can do for the family that loves you and supports you in your profession. For additional copies, contact: Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc.

For more information you can visit www.iii.org I also belong to the various social/fraternal organizations that carry insurance was planned to save as much heartache as possible immediately following the death of a loved one. All the planning and preparation in the world, however, won't save a family serious heartache if someone chooses to keep information about their life from family members. Often times after someone dies, family members are shocked to find out there are other children from outside the marriage and other significant others. To save your spouse or other family members this heartache and torment, it is suggested that you write a letter to be opened upon your death that will tell your family about the issues you felt you could not discuss with them during your lifetime. Additionally, we recommend that you discuss with your spouse the beneficiary listings you have chosen on various insurance policies. This will help alleviate the family upheavals that seriously affect the grief process when family members doubt that you meant to leave benefits to the people who received those benefits. Be proactive and address these issues before it's too late. 437 of 744 19 AGENCY SHEET If the person completing this booklet is a law enforcement officer, this page can be completed and filed with your enforcement agency in your personnel file.

Another 53 officers died in accidents while performing their duties, an d 54,774 officers were assaulted in the line of duty.

If approved a s a line-of-duty death according to Federal government criteria, a Federal death payment is made to eligibl e survivors. States also have benefits availa ble to the survivors of fallen public safety officers; however, state benefits are not uniform. Some states pay a one-time death benefit, while some do not. Some states offer tuition-free education for surviving children and some states include surviving spouse s in this benefit. A continuation of health care coverage, a pension payment, the officer's badge and/or uniform , a waiver of property taxes - these represent the variety of benefits that may be a vailable to the primary survivors of a law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty. C.O.P.S. has compiled information on benefits available to law enforcement survivors in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The initial research oc curred over a five-year period, utilizing hundreds of reference sources. Information is updated as it is received in the C.O.P.S. National Office. This information includes benefits sources and contact information. But specifi c benefits packages cited in the information are based on the State Police/Patrol benefits. Information on benefits is valuable to the survivors so they kn ow the benefits available to them and can verify that all benefits claims have been filed. This information is also valuable to law enforcement officers still on the job as well as the benefits assistance personnel within the age ncies who might be filing for benefits for a newly- bereaved family. When legislation is passed in your state that effects law enfor cement survivors' benefits, please send the information to the C.O.P.S. National Office. 443 of 744CONCERNS OF POLICE SURVIVORS Death Benefits Available to the Surviving Families of Law Enforcement Officers Killed in the Line of Duty To obtain certified copies of registered personal documents, contact the Bureau of Vital Statistics: Submit written request to 4150 Technology Way, Suite 104, Carson City, NV 89706.

Office: (775) 684-4694. www.dps.nv.gov EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS Sec. 396.540 Tuition charges for students at the University of Nevada are free to all students whose families are bona fide residents of the State of Nevada or to all students whose families reside outside the state, provided such students have themselves been bona fide residents of Nevada for at least six months prior to their matriculation at the university. Sec. 396.543 The board of regents may enter into an agreement with another state for the granting of full or partial waivers of the nonresident tuition to residents of the other state who are students at or are eligible for admission to any branch of the system if the agreement provides that, under substantially the same circumstances, the other state will grant reciprocal waivers to residents of Nevada who are students at or are eligible for admission to universities or colleges in the other state. Sec. 396.545 To the extent of legislative appropriation, the board of regents shall pay all registration fees, laboratory fees and expenses for required textbooks and course materials assessed against or incurred by a dependent child of a police officer, fireman, or officer of the Nevada Highway Patrol who was killed in the line of duty for classes taken towards satisfying the requirements of an undergraduate degree at a school within the University and Community College System of Nevada. No such payment may be made for any fee assessed after the child reaches the age of 23 years. When applying for admission, dependent children under the age of 23 should request the waiver of fees as provided for in Sec. 396.545 and provide proof of the line-of-duty death of the parent. 444 of 744CONCERNS OF POLICE SURVIVORS PO coverage is compulsory for employers in Nevada. The maximum considered wage for computing disability/death compensation for fiscal year 2013 has been certified by the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, Employment Security Division. MAXIMUM COMPENSATION Per month......................................................................................................... $3,481.75 Per day.............................................................................................................. $114.38 Per week.......................................................................................................... $800.66 14 day (usual payment)................................................................................. ...$1,601.32 Each year the benefit changes to 2/3 of 150% of the state average wage. If spouse remarries, he/she would be eligible for a two -year lump sum based on the maximum monthly award. Dependent children living in home of remarried spouse would receive 15% of officer's earned wage up to 66 2/3% of the maximum monthly award of the surviving spouse. If a dependent who is receiving a portion of the survivor benefits should marry, finish school, or drop out of school, then these benefits would revert back to the widow/widower providing they had not remarried. Also, once the 100 months benefit has passed on an applicable dependent, the benefit is then reverted back to the widow/widower. Should a dependent die while receiving benefits, there is a $5,000 reimbursable funeral benefit. In the state of Nevada, the State Industrial Insurance System would be notified of the death of an officer by the department that he or she worked for and at that time they would be instructed on how to begin the process of applying for the applicable benefits. Many times an investigator and a claim specialist will also assist the family in the application. There is a maximum burial allowance of $5,000 and transportation expenses are allowed for the deceased and an accompanying person to a mortuary within the continental limits of the United States. It is required that benefits for dependents outside the home and under the age of 18 have a court appointed guardian for the child's estate. This will hopefully ensure that the benefit is used for the future care and education of the dependent child. Once the widowed spouse remarries and the children receive the direct benefit, guardianship is also required.

Nevada Division of Industrial Relations, 1301 Henderson, www.dirweb.state.nv.us Nevada Revised Statute 287.021 and 287.0477 were passed which requires Nevada Police and Fire Agencies to offer continued insurance coverage for spouses and children after line-of-duty deaths. The agency is responsible for the entire cost of the premiums. This law also applies to the continued participation in the Nevada State Retirement System. Your Benefits Assistance Officer should be able to help you. RETIREMENT/PENSION Public Employees' Benefits Program (PEBP) provides benefits to the surviving families. Non- State Retiree Eligibility effective November 30, 2008, a non-state retiree is eligible to enroll in or continue PEBP coverage at retirement, only if they are retiring from a local government agency who participate in PEBP with its active employees. If a local government agency opts out of PEBP after November 30, 2008, their retirees will not be eligible to continue PEBP coverage unless the retiree was enrolled in PEBP continually since November 30, 2008. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2010, who retire less than 15 years of service are eligible for PEB P coverage at retirement, but will not qualify for the years of service subsidy, unless he or she retires under a long-term disability plan and has at least 5 years of service. The surviving spouse and any surviving child of a police officer or firefighter who was employed by a participating public agency and who was killed in the line of duty may join or continue coverage under PEBP if the police officer or firefighter was eligible to participate on the date of the death. Public Employees' Retirement System (NVPERS), You are eligible for a survivor benefit if the employee had two years of service in the two and one-half years immediately preceding death, you had more than 10 years of accredited service or your death was caused by an occupational disease or an accident arising out or in the course of your employment, regardless of service credit.

PREPARED BY: CONCERNS OF SURVIVORS P.O. BOX 3199 CAMDENTON, MO 65020 (573) 346-4911 Concerns of Police Survivors, through the courtesy of Professional Training Schools, Inc., Dallas, Texas, has received permission to condense information from \"Funeral Rites & Customs\". Updated with information regarding bagpipes 451 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] FUNERAL RITES American Muslim Funeral American Muslims traditionally have used the services of Jewish funeral homes because many customs are the same. Muslims say Jewish funeral directors understand their opposition to embalming and desire for a speedy burial. Preparation of the. Remains: Embalming is acceptable if the body can't be buried within 48 hours or is necessary for another reason, particularly communicable disease. Muslims have a deep respect for the body. Family members are ideally invol ved in preparing the body with Oils and fragrances. For the unmarried, widowed, or divorced, only women prepare women, and men prepare men. The eyes and mouth are closed, orifices packed, and hands and feet are bound. Then the body is shrouded and placed in a casket. The casket is usually closed. The face is left uncovered by the shroud. The Funeral: Funerals are usually held at a mosque. Committal Service: A cemetery is respected ground and graveside services are held . Prayers are said as the casket is being lowered; crying is acceptable, but wailing is n ot. Grief is viewed as a natural part of life, and a funeral is seen as being for the living. . Buddhist Funeral Preparation of the Remains: Embalming is permitted and often chosen by the family as the m eans of preparing the body. Many Buddhist funerals Will include public viewing with an open casket. Should the filthily choose some type of immediate disposition, the funeral director would prepare the body in the same manner as he or she would prepare the body of any other individual. Dressing and Casketing: The family will select suitable clothing to be used for the occasion. Families generally select traditional wooden or metal caskets available from the funeral home. Visitation: The Buddhist visitation period is usually briefer than is typi cal. Lasting perhaps only a few hours. The casket would normally be open. The Funeral: The funeral service is usually held at the funeral home and is often a continuation of the visitation period. The monk will choose a member of the family, normally t he eldest male, to assist him in conducting the rituals. The casket would remain open during the funeral ceremony which begins with the monk, normally dressed in a burnt orange robe, placing and lighting three candles on the casket. Using the melted wax to hold the candles in place, the candl es will continue to bum througho ut the ceremony. The monk and family will participate in a series of chants during the funeral service. A gong-like bell is used periodically during this chanting. One of the unique features of the Buddhist funeral is the preparation of a meal consisting of rice, peas and carrots. This is prepared in the funeral home chapel as par t of the service and taken to the cemetery. For the next ten days, a similar meal may be brought to the grave. Some priests use such fruits as, apples, oranges and bananas during the funeral servi ce. Incense is also burned duri ng the approximately forty-five minutes the funeral service will last at the funeral home. The pall bearers are normally family members. Friends are designated to \"stand in\" for a sp ecific family member. The pall bearers will wear white gloves which, are furnished by the Temple. The im portance of each family member i s also seen by the position which they hold in the funeral Cortege, The Committal Service: The committal service will normally last about thirty minutes with chants by the monk and the family. Incense is also burned. Flowers are normally placed on the casket at the cemetery. The colors of the flowers indicate the role of the - deceased in the family. 452 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Christian Science Funeral There are no ordained ministers in Christian Science Churches, instead, practitioners or readers, serve in somewhat the same capacity as a clergyman. To become a practitioner, one must demonstrate the ability to perform work of healing. Notification of Death: Because of their beliefs in the healing powers of the practiti oner and the reluctance to seek medical assistance, notifica tion that a death of a member of the Christian Science Church has occurred will bring about several unique situations. First, it is most likely that the death has occu rred in the deceased's home or someplace other than a usual medical facility. There will be no attending, physician responsible for completing and signing the Certificate of Death. It should, the refore; be called to the funeral director's attention to determine who will be certifying the cause of death and signing the death certificate, prior to making the removal from the place of death. Their preference is for the term \"passed on\" rather than such words as death and dead. The term passed on\" is used to emphasize the fact tha t \"death does not mark the termination of an individual's life, rather it is only one more phase of the beli ef that life is material\". Preparation of the Remains: If a traditional funeral service is chosen, with the body pres ent for viewing, the normal embalming and co smetizing would take place. If the famil y opts to have a memorial service with the body not present the funeral director may only be asked to prep are the body to the extent necessary for an immediate disposition. When it is possible the body of a female shall be prepared for burial by one of her own sex. Visitation : Whether there is a visitation or not is entirely a family decision, but it is no t a frequent practice for Christian Scientists. The Funeral: There are several key factors which the funeral director will have to be aware of when arranging the funeral. Most importantly, no funerals arc held in the Christian Science Church. T he funeral is probably most often held in the funeral home, at the gravesite, or other cemetery facility. If the casket is present during the service, it is closed. The officiant for the Christian Scie nce funeral is the practitioner or reader. The main theme of the funeral service centers around the comfort in know ing that death is merely a phase in which the individual leaves the mortal life while maintaining the immorta l spiritual life. The ser vice is often preceded by organ music. During the service there is usually an invitation for those present to join in the Lord's Prayer, and the service concludes with a benediction. The Committal. Service : There are no Church restrictions in regards to the method of disposition, with earth burial, entombment, and cremation all being permitted. Eastern Orthodox Funeral It is the \"nationalism\" or the tendency of the Orthodox Church to take on the characteristics of its people, which may cause the most serious probl em in trying to define the Orthodox Church and its practices. The most important factors in determining the type of funeral service he ld are the customs and tr aditions the family brings with them into the funeral arrangement conference. Notification of Death: The necessity of notifying a clergyman and whether there are a ny religious rites required or performed at the time of death is important to the funeral director. In the case of the Orthodox Church, there are no \"last rites\" such as those seen in the Roman Catholic Ch urch. Priests may prefer to be notified of an impending death in order that they may conduct a prayer service at that time Visitation: It is customary for the family's priest to be present with the m during their first viewing. Generally a prayer is offered during this time. In addition to this first p rayer, the Trisagion, a series of three prayers, are usually offered at the end of the evening. Similar to a Rosary or Christian Prayer Service in the Roman Catholic Church, the family and friends gather for this service, in whic h prayers for the deceas ed are offered. If the visitation and Trisagion are to be held in the funeral home, se veral pieces of equipment should be placed in the chapel or state room. The Holy Icon, a picture of Christ, is a symbol which can be seen throughout the Orthodox 453 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Church. In the funeral home, the Icon is normally placed at one end of the casket, allowing those approaching the casket to first kiss the Icon. Other items used in conjunct ion with the Orthodox funeral include candles as well as a crucifix. The Funeral : The funeral service may be held on any day except Sunday. On the day of the funeral service, the family, pallbearers and perhaps close friends will gather at the funeral home for a Trisagion. Following this short, prayer service of five to six minutes, the casket is closed and those in attendance will move in procession. The funeral service, is called the Parastas (a. standing servic e), or Great Panaehicia, which means \"all night service\". The funeral service will follow a very liturgical pat tern. Organ music and/or vocal selection may be allowed although it is not normal in the Orthodox Church. Follo wing the. service, the casket may be turned so that it is parallel to the Ico nstasion, solid screen, covered w ith Icons, which separat es the sanctuary of the Church from the remainder of the building. The casket is opened at this point, if at all possible, and left open for the remainder of the service, The priest will make the sign of the cross first with olive oil and then with ashes or sand on the chest of the deceased. If the family and friends are going to view the deceased they can file past the casket once again kissing the Ic on, which is placed either at t he head or foot end of the casket before filing out of the Church. The Committal Service . The graveside service will consist of a. reading and short pr ayer. In some ethnic groups, the oil and ashes are placed on the top of the closed c asket during the graveside service. Incense may be used by some priests at the funeral home, church and graveside. Cremation is forbidden by Orthodox Christians because of the destruction which would take place to the body. The body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit and the church, mindful of this fact, refuses to deliberately destr oy the body. A church funeral is denied by anyone who will be cremated Episcopal Funeral Notification of Death: In the past it was considered essential that a Priest be noti fied when the death, of an Episcopalian had occurred or was expected to occur. Although th is may vary today from parish to parish, the funeral director should determine the preferences of the indivi dual Priests he or she serves to ensure that the proper procedure is followed. Visitation: In most cases, visitation will b e held at the funeral home. The casket is present and open or closed depending on the wishes of the family. There are no items of re ligious equipment used during the visitation. The Funeral : All funerals for Episcopalia ns should be conducted in the, Episcopal Church. The funeral service is very similar to that of the Catholic Funeral Mass. Music may be sung by the church choir and/or, the congregation from the Episcopal Hymnal. The use of flowers is prohibited in the Episcopal Church; although local customs and the preferences of individual priests may var y. The Committal Service : The Episcopal Church has no restrictions as to the means of d isposition for one of its members. As part of the committa l service the priest will read a passage commending the body to the earth, often while sprinkling sand in the shape of the cross on top of the casket. The Lord's Prayer is recited by all in attendance followed by a final prayer said by the priest. Hindu Funeral Hinduism is a way of life rather than a denomination. Hindus wo rship many gods. These gods are believed to be different forms of a universal spirit called Brahman. Hinduism centers around kharma, which is the belief that every action of an individual will result in either good or bad results. The total of all of these actions is known as dharma, and it is this overall pos itive or negative way of livi ng during one's present life which the soul will inherit when re-incarnation takes it into the next life. The funeral ceremony is one of celebration and is considered the second most impor tant (and expensive) ritual to take place in a person's life. The preparation of the body, which is done in the hmee, was traditionally handled by the family with the assistance of \"mortuary specialists\". After the body was bathed, it was wrapped in line n and decorated with sacred ashes and sands) 454 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] paste. Normally the body of a M arried women would be wrapped in colored cloths and decorated with flowers and jewelry showing her married s tatus. The body is viewed by a ll who wish to enter the home for that purpose. Prior to removing the body from the house for disposition, it is anointed with oils,- soa ps and powders. Again the immediate family is responsible for this anointing process. When rituals are completed, the body is carried without the use of a coffin to the cemetery or cremation site. Cremation is the preferre d means of disposition. Cremation is a sacrament in the H indu religion. Hindus believe that the soul never dies, but passes through a series of lives in different bodies. The soul is trapped in the skull and has to be released from the body with the help of fire. Cremation is a religious .act and sacred texts ar e chanted while the-body is binned. The oldest male relative walks three, five or seven times around the pyre holdi ng a burning piece of wood and then lights the pyre. When the heat of the fire b reaks the skull, the relatives leave the prye to be tended by professional burners. On the third day, the ashes are collected and taken to a river- to be dispersed. This frees the soul allowing it to be reborn in another life. Preparation of the Remains : Unlike the practice in eastern countries, the family will not be responsible for the preparation of the body in the U nited States. Here the funeral home will handle the preparation to whatever extent the family wishes. Dressing and Casketing : The clothing will usually be pr ovided by the family. Many of these individuals still prefer to wear their native clothing. However, the clothing may be more of a reflection on the nationality of the deceased, rather than on the fact that he or she was Hindu. Generally, the casket chosen is an inexpensive one, whether it be made of metal or wood. One reason, cremation is o ften practiced and no casket is used. Hindus believe that death is only a tr ansition from one life to anothe r. Visitation: In a community where there are few Hindu, the visitation and fu neralization may take on a very western flavor and be similar to any other such service. If on the other hand there are many Hindu in the area, it might be expected that the visitation and funeralization will t ake on a more eastern flavor. The visitation period, still held in the funeral home, w ould most likely be of a short er duration. The Funeral : In most instances, a Hindu funeral held in the United States will take place in the funeral home. The priest will lead the service which will include prayers and chants. The use of candles and incense may also be observed. While they mourn for this individual, they do not approach death as the final experience to a physical life. The Committal Service : Since cremation is very much a part of the Hindu custom, it i s often the choice for disposition: However, earth burial is also acceptable and used extensively in some areas. The family takes an active role. When the' cemetery or crematory is near the locati on of the funeral service, the family will even lead the procession. The family membe rs will not only carry the body to the retort chamber, but will also place the body inside the chamber and initiate the cremation process. Jehovah's Witness Funeral Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to accept blood transfusions, thei r refusal to salute the flag of any country, and their claim ftor exemption from participating in the armed services, are decisions which are based on their literal translation of the Bible and its applicability in today's world . Preparation of the Remains: Embalming is often the method cho sen by the family for preparat ion of the remains. Dressing and Casketing : Decisions as to the clothing to be worn by the deceased and the type of casket to be used are also left up to the family. Visitation: Visitation and viewing of the body are accepted as part of the normal funeral procedure. The visitation will, normally be held in the funeral home and will be similar to most visita tion periods held in that community. 455 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The Funeral: The funeral service may be held either in the funeral home or in the Kingdom Hall. The casket would be placed in the usual manner at the front of the funeral home chapel or Kingdom Hall and parallel with the seating. There is no formal processional as the casket is generally closed and positioned prior to the serv ice beginning. The use of flowers i n the Kingdom Hall is permitted. The use of a recessional will depend on the customs of the area and the preferences of the officiant. The s ervice is simple, with no religious items such as palls, crosses, candles, etc. bei ng used. There are no others participants, such as altar attendants used to assist the designated officiant of the service. A Jehovah's Witness funeral will normally take no more than thirty minutes and is centered around the reading and discussion of scripture. The music used will normally be organ music with no actual singing, and will come from the Jehovah's Witnes ses' own hymnal. The Committal Service: Earth burial and cremation are the two m ost common means of disposition practiced by members of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The committal service will last only a few minutes with a short scripture reading and a few words spoken by the officiant concluding the service. Jewish Funeral History: The Orthodox, Conservative and Re form (sometimes referred to as the Liberal) Jews each bring with them a number of customs and tr aditions both in their everyday lifestyle, as well as in the way they honor their dead. The basic differences am ong these three groups lie in the amount of tradition they continue to practice in their lives today. Orthodox Jews maintain most of the same traditions that have ma rked .the Jewish religion for the past 3,000 years. The Reform Jews have kept only the moral laws and those which they feel adapt to modem civilization. The Conservative Jews fall somewh ere in between, following the dietary Jaws and the traditional celebrations, Because of some very different practices in regard to the funer al service among these three groups, it may be necessary to devote more time in explaining use differences than has been necessary with many of the other religious bodies. The Jewish Sabbath (Shabbath) is observed on Saturday. For the Orthodox Jew this day is strictly observed. No business dealings are to be conducte d on this day. No work is a llowed, no writing, and even travel is forbidden. While the Reformed and Conservative Jews also observe, their Sa bbath on Saturday, the same restrictions as to work, travel, etc. may not be as strictly observed. Notification of Death: The Rabbi should be notified if the deceased was an Orthodox J ew. However, if the deceased belonged to the Reformed or the Conservative Jewish sy nagogues, you might find that the Rabbi prefers to be notified after the removal has taken place. Making the Removal: There are no restrictions when making a removal of a deceased Reformed or Conservative Jew. However, if the deceased was an Orthodox Jew and the death occurs on the Sabbath (from sundown Friday until sundown Satu rday), the removal should not be made until the sun has set on Saturday, marking the end of the Sabbath . Obviously, there are situations in which this Jewish law cannot be honored. In these types of situations, the civil laws would supersede the J ewish Jaws and the remova l would be made. If the death does not occur during th e time observed as the Sabbath, then there are no restrictions in place for any of these three groups. Preparation of the Remains: For the Reform or Conservative Jews, there are usually no reli gious restrictions concerning the preparation of the deceased, including embalming . However, since some Reformed and Conservative Jews will follow : the Orthodox traditions, it is important that the funeral home staff maintain close communications with the family and the Rabbi to prevent unneces sary problems from occurring. If the deceased is an Orthodox Jew, embal ming is usually not allowed. The reason for not embalming the body is a religious one. The Orthodox Jews believe that nothing should be done which would delay the return of the body back to the original elements it came from. Exceptions, such as the necessity to transport over a long distance or by common carrier, a lengthy delay between the time of death and the funeral servi ce, or when death takes place 456 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] on the Sabbath, may make refrigera tion of the body or embalming necessary. However, whenever possible, the Jewish law should be followed. If the deceased is an Orthodox Jew , the role of the funeral dir ector in preparing. The deceased is almost non- existent. Once the removal has been made to the preparation ro om, the funeral director will notify the Rabbi. The Rabbi will then notify the Chevrah Kadisha who will come to the funeral home to prepare the remains. The Chevra, commonly referred to as the \"Washers\" by laymen, are a group of men or women, depending upon the sex of the deceased, who have been t rained in the Taharah, the ritual of washing and preparing the body for burial. This ritual includes a physical washing , dressing the deceased in Tachrichim, a white burial shroud, and placing the deceased in the casket. During this ritual, prayers are also said and a bag of Israel earth is placed under the deceased's head. Dressing and Casketing the Remains: An Orthodox Jew is dressed in a Tachrichim, a white linen shro ud for burial. This shroud covers virtually the entire body with only the face visible. It is, however, customary that even the family not view the d eceased after the body has been placed in the casket If the deceased died as the result of trauma, any cloth ing with the deceased might have been wearing and which as a result had blood on them, should be kept and placed in the casket with the deceased . If the deceased were embalmed, the blood should be collected in containers, sealed a nd placed in the casket with the deceased. This is due to the belief that the blood contains the individual's soul. The Orthodox casket is known as an Aron. This casket is made completely out of wood, e ven to the extent of having pegs instead of nails. Oak and pine seem to be very comm on. The Star of David or Mogen David, the symbol of new hope for the Jewish people, is usually attached t o the lid of the casket. Reform or Conservative Jews will be dressed in their own clothing. The family is not restricted as to the type of casket they can choose from. The Sta r of David may or may not b e attached to the casket in this case. Visitation : If the deceased is Orthodox, it is possible that no visitatio n would be held, or that the time would be only a matter of hours. This is due to the tradition of having the burial within 24 hours from the time of death. The fact that the casket would be closed also decreases the pos sibility of the traditional visitation as members of other religious bodies think of it. A pall with the Star of David may drape the casket and a Menorah (candelabrum) may be placed at the head of the casket. In some areas, one or two vigil candles may be substituted for the candelabrum. N o flowers or music would norm ally be present. Having a shomrim to watch over the body is still observed. This is an age-old custom of not leaving the body alone prior to the burial. If the body was to be held until the f ollowing day, the shomrim would sit with or near the casketed remains all night, reading and reciting prayers. If the deceased belonged to a Reform or Conservative congregati on, it is possible that a visitation period would be held. In these cases, the deceased would be embalmed, dresse d and casketed. The visitation, with an open casket, flowers and music, similar to that of other religions m ay be held. The Funeral Service: At one time funerals for the O rthodox were held only in the fu neral home or at the gravesite. Today, some funerals a re being held in the synagogue . No services are held on the Sabbath (Saturday). Prior to the funeral service, the family will participate in a ceremony known as K'ria. This custom of rendering or tearing of one's clothes symbolizes ones grief. Today, many families wear a black ribbon, which they will tear instead of an article of clothing. This K'ria is worn, for 30 days following the funeral, during a. period of mourning known as Shloshim. The Rabbi, assisted by the Cant or, leads the funeral service, w hich is generally very brief and is made up of the reading or chanting of psalms, a m emorial prayer called the El Mole Rachammim, and a hesped, the eulogy honoring the deceased. No music or flowers are present and no f raternal ceremonies take place. Men attending an Orthodox funeral are expected to wear a yarmulke and many wi ll wear a prayer shawl called the tallith. 457 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The Conservative or Reform Jewish funeral may also be held at t he synagogue, funeral home or gravesite. The Conservative or Reform funeral service cannot be held on Saturday. Unlike the Orthodox funeral, flowers and music may be a part of these services, although often they are not if the casket had been open for visitation, it is closed prior to the service beginning. The Rabbi and Cantor lea d the service. Men attending the service will generally wear the yarmulke. The Funeral Procession: In the Orthodox tradition, if the funeral service was held in the synagogue, the funeral procession (levaya) will proceed directly to the cemetery. Howe ver, if the service was held in the funeral home, the procession may stop at the synagogue. If this occurs, the funeral coach will pull up to the doors of the synagogue. While the family, friends and pallbearers remain in their cars, the doors of the synagogue and the funeral coach will be opened. T he Rabbi and Cantor will have a brief prayer prior to the doors being closed and the procession moving on to the cemetery. This provides the dec eased with their last contact with the synagogue. Ordinarily, the procession, for Reform or Conservati ve funeral services does not stop at the synagogue. The Committal. Service: The Rabbi, followed by the pallbearers, may stop several times while on their way to the gravesite. Some orthodox still follow the practice of lowering the casket into the grave using the hand straps rather than any type of mechanical lowering device. While earth burial or entombment are the primary modes of disposition, in some cases crema tion may be allowed by the Cons ervative or Reformed Jewish religions. The Orthodox Jews use only earth burial. Periods of Mourning: A unique characteristic of the Jewish religion as it relates to death is their observance of several periods of mourning. Both of these time periods require the family of the deceased to refrain from certain activities: Shiva: The Shiva marks a seven day period of intense mourning beginning on the day of the burial, During this period of time, the family membe rs are encouraged to stay away from work or school, to remain at home, and to contemplate the meaning of life and the manner in which adjustm ent will be made to the death of the beloved. The mourners are discouraged from any act which will call atten tion to themselves, even to the extent of covering all of the mirrors in the home. The family will often sit on Shiva stools, which are low to the ground, in order to humble themselves while they contemplate life followin g the death of a loved one. Services are to be conducted in the morning, afternoon and, evening during this ti me and a Shiva (7 day) candle bums' throughout this period. Shloshim: The Shloshim mouthing period is a thirty day period i n which the mourners begin a return to their normal routine, with the excepti on of attending any type of entertainment or social functions. The family continues to wear the K'riah, but the services held in the home during Shiva are now replaced with the daily recitation of the kaddish, a Jewish prayer recited at the daily service and by mourners after the death of a relation, at the synagogue. Shanna: Those who are mourning the loss of an immediate family member continue their mourning period for eleven months after the Shloshi m. During the Shanna the attenda nce at daily services to recite the kaddish continue as well as the abstaining from celebrations during tha t year. Yahrtzeit: The Yahrtzeit commemorates the anniversary of the de ath. Each year on that date, the kaddish is recited. The Jewish community places great emphasis on their du ty to assist the family not only in the burial, but also in the recovery from thei r loss through the various mourni ng periods. Lutheran Funeral Dressing and Casketing : The decisions as to the clothing to be worn and the type of c asket to be used are left up to the family. 458 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Visitation: In most cases, the visitation w ill be conducted at the funeral home. The open casket is the focal point with the flowers, music and friends completing the memory pictu re. There are generally no services held during the visitation period. The Funeral: Traditionally, the Lutheran funeral service was held in the ch urch. Today, there seems to be a shift away from the church funera l in favor of the funeral held at the funeral home. The use of the cross, candles, and altar are still very much a part of the Lutheran service. I n most cases when a funeral service is held in a Lutheran Church, the casket will be closed for the funeral serv ice. To view the deceased, it is a common practice to have the casket open before the service in the narthex. The Committal Service: As part of the Committal Servi ce, the Pastor will sprinkle san d, earth or flower petals in the shape of a cross on the top of the casket as he notes the return of the physical body back to the elements from which it came. The Lutheran Funeral Service is a simpler v ersion of the Catholic Funeral Service. ' Methodist Funeral Dressing and Casketing: The choice of clothing the d eceased is to wear as well as the type and style of casket will generally be selected either prior to or at the time of de ath by the family. Visitation : In most instances, visitation will take place in the funeral home. Flowers are acc epted and enhance the visitation environment The Funeral: The location of the funeral will in most cases have very littl e effect on the actual funeral service. The use of candles, crucifix, and similar religious equipment w ould not be used. The funeral service is normally short, lasting no more than thirty minutes in most cases. The celebration of Holy Communion is normally not a part of the service. Prayer, scripture reading, music and the e ulogy make up the traditional service. The Committal Service: Earth, sand or flower petals may be used as part of the commit tal service, as the minister commends the body to the earth and back to the element s from which it came. Mormon Funeral The largest body of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the \"Mormons\", are headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and number over four million member$ in the United States. (The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, not a part of the Mormon Chu rch, headquartered in. Independence, Missouri, claims over two hundred thousand members.) The Mormons do not r ecognize professional clergy among their ranks. Those who take up this ca lling serve for `unspecified pe riods of time and without compensation. One of the unique characteristics of the Mormons is the involvement of the young men and some young, women in Church missionary service for a period of up to two years each. Dressing and Casketing: Decisions as to the clothing to be worn by the deceased and th e type of casket to be used are left up to the family . A deceased Mormon who has prev iously participated i n Temple Ordinances; which is an instructional pro cess within the Church, would usua lly be dressed primarily in special Temple clothing. Otherwise, their clothing will be chosen by the famil y. Visitation: Visitation could be held in a C hurch ward chapel, the family r esidence, or the funeral home. No special services are held during this time. The Funeral: The funeral service for a deceased Mormon will generally be he ld in a Church ward chapel, the funeral home, or- at the cemetery as the family prefers. The Church attempts to follow the wishes of the family as to the type of service they w ould like, but the funeral service follows the same format as the other Church meetings. A viewing may be held immediately before the service in an adjoining room; however, the casket should be closed before being pl aced in the Main chapel and rem ains closed for the funeral service and is not opened afterwards. 459 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The Committal Service: The Mormon Church prefers earth burial as the method of disposition for its members in the United. States, although entombment in a mausoleum is permissible. (The primary difference in the area of funeralization of a member of the Reorganized Church is the all owing of cremation as a method of disposition.) Muslim Funeral The Muslim religion means \"submission to God\" and those who hav e accepted the teachings of Mohammed have embraced that saying. Black Muslims are not recognized by the Muslims as true followers of Mohammed. Notification of Death: The funeral director is not expected to notify the Islamic rel igious leader at the time a death occurs. Members of this community spend time reading to t he dying person. Making the Removal: The removal is no different than the removal of any other dec eased. The civil laws and regulations governing the facility in which the person died mak e up the basis for determining the removal. While there are instructions to the family in the Koran as to t he positioning of the deceased after death, the funeral director may or may not, find that these instructions have been followed. Preparation of the Remains : Generally, after the deceased is removed from the place of death, the body is taken to the funeral home where the funeral home staff will, wi th the permission of the family, embalm the body. After the body is embalmed, and just prior to the visitation period and funeral service, members of the family will come to the funeral home where they will wash the body. This ritual of bathing the deceased is known as Ghusl. According the Koran, the steps in the bathing of the dead include: 1. Washing the private parts of the dead three times, using a new piece of cloth each time; 2. Washing the mouth of the dead w ith a piece of unused wet cloth; 3. Cleansing the nostrils with a piece of unused wet cloth; 4. Washing the face of the dead; 5. Washing the right hand then the left hand 6. The ma-sah is performed; 7. Washing the right foot then the left foot; 8. Washing the entire body from head to foot. Dressing and Casketing: Once the deceased has been washed , the family (or funeral home staff) will dress the individual by wrapping them in muslin material. Several pieces of this white cotton material are used to encompass the body so that only the face and hands of the deceased are visible when completed. The casket is usually the simplest wooden casket available, including the clo th-covered woods. The use of a casket in a Muslim funeral is unique to the United States. In other countri es, the dead are buried in the white muslin material they are wrapped in without a casket Visitation: The visitation period is usually restricted to one hour. All of the family are in attendance during this time and the casket is open. This would normally be held at the funeral home. The Funeral: Most Muslim funerals are conducted at the cemetery. Funera ls may be held on any day exce pt Holy Days. The casket is carried by the male members of the fam ily only and is placed as much as fifty feet from the actual place of interment. The casket is placed north and south with the head toward the south and facing east. The casket is opened for the funeral service, whic h will take approximately twenty minutes. The funeral prayer is called the Janaazah Namaaz. All prayers to Al lah are done in public by the men only. The Committal Service: At the conclusion of the funeral service, the casket is lowere d into the grave. If the cemetery is a perpetual care cemetery, a concrete grave liner i s most likely used. If the cemetery is not a perpetual care cemetery, a series of wooden timbers may be placed around the casket. Once the casket is lowered into the conc rete grave liner, the cap of the casket is removed and the lid of the grave liner is put in place. The cap of the casket is then placed on top of the concr ete grave liner. If final disposition is to be cremation, the male members of the family will place the deceas ed in the retort chamber. Women are instructed 460 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] to mourn for four months and ten days. During that time they are to dress plainly and are forbidden to participate in any type of entertainment. Men are instructed to mourn for o nly three days. Presbyterian Funeral Dressing and Casketing: The physical preparation of the body would conclude with the d ressing of the deceased, generally in their own clothing or in clothing purcha sed by the family. The casket would be a decision of the family without influence or restrictions from the Church.. Visitation: A visitation period is normally h eld prior to the funeral service with the various decisions such as location, hours and any services to be held in conjunction with the visitation to be determined by the family. Auxiliary services inch as a Masonic Service may be held during a portion of the visitation. The Funeral: There are no restrictions as to the day on which a funeral ser vice may be held. It is suggested that the casket be closed during the service and that the casket be covered with a pall. With strong emphasis placed on the Resurrection in Presbyter ian Church, a plain cross inste ad of a crucifix is used. The funeral service would begin with the reading of scripture, followed by the singing of hymns, additional scripture, a sermon, the reciting of the Affirmation of Faith, and the closing of the se rvice with the saying of prayers. The Committal Service: The actual time of the committal service is very brief the ser vice will usually consist of a scripture reading, words committing the body to the earth as well as to the care of God and a closing prayer. Quaker Funeral The Friends General Conference is the group whose practices are most often identified as Quakers. Quakers worship in an environment of s ilence. The congregation is divid ed with men and boys on one side of the \"Meeting House\" and women and girls on the other side, with no minister, but an \"overseer\" to lead the worship. The Friends United Meeting have m inisters who lead the worship service and congregational singing. An observer would probably believe that they were in a typical Pro testant Church. The primary difference between this group of Quakers and most Protestant churches is in the ob servance of sacraments. The Quakers believe in the baptism of their members but do not use water. They also re frain from using the traditional elements of bread and wine in observing Holy Communion, opting instead for an individual and \"spiritual communion\" with' God. Preparation of the Remains: A simple funeral service with the body present is appropriate. In most cases the body would be prepared through the normal embalming procedures. There are no Church restrictions or requirements as to the pre paration of the remains. Dressing and Casketing : The, choice as to the type of c lothing the deceased is to wea r and the type of casket to be used are left entirely up to the family. Visitation: The visitation is usually scheduled at the funeral home. There are no special services held during the visitation period. The use of mus ic and flowers are generally a cceptable. The decision as to whether the casket is to be opened or closed during the visitation period is left up to the family. The Funeral: The funeral service is very simi lar to many of the Protestant churches' funeral services. There are no religious symbols, such as cros ses, crucifix, or candles. Nor are altar attendants used in a Quaker service. Flowers -would be acceptable and are generally present The casket may be opened or closed depending on the wishes of the family and the practice of the church, The Amend would consist of prayer, music, scripture readings, a eulogy, and the minister's message or sermon. The f uneral service would normally last no more than half an hour. The Committal Service: There are no guidelines or church preferences as to the method of disposition. The committal service consists of scripture reading and prayer. No symbolic rituals such as making the sign of the cross with flower petals or sand takes place. 461 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Roman Catholic Funeral Notification of Death: The \"Last Rites\" are given to individuals of the Roman Catholi c Church who may be facing imminent death or who have in some instances already died. The need for a priest to administer this ritual of preparing the soul for eternity necessitates the informing of the priest prior to the tim e of death or at the time of death. Usually this is taken care of by the family or, in so me cases, the staff of the hospital, nursing home or other health care institution the individual may be receiving c are in at the lime of their death. Visitation : On each end of the casket, candles should be placed. A crucifix is placed behind the casket and a kneeling bench is placed in front of the casket. A Rosary or Ch ristian Prayer Service is usually held at the funeral home the night before burial. The Funeral Mass: The Mass of Christian Burial for adults and Mass of Angels for a child are generally held in the Church. There are certain \"Holy Days\" on which a funeral ma ss may not be conducted. You will also find that a funeral will not be held do Sundays. Secular symbols suc h as national flags or insignias of other associations should be removed prio r to entering the Church and replaced when leaving the Church. Religious symbols such as a crucifix, rosary beads, or a Bible may be placed on the Pall du ring the Mass. The Committal Service: Not only will the priest who cel ebrates the funeral mass go to the cemetery, but the altar attendants may also be included. The committal service at the cemetery will begin with a processional from the automobiles to the grave s pace. The committal service will include prayers, scripture and liturgical readings and the blessing of the casket for a final time. Ethic/Nationality Rites and Rituals African American Funeral Their community gathers in anticipation of the death to support the dying-person as well as to muster collective support (emotional ? financial) for the survivors. Vigils, wakes, funerals and post -funeral events are important traditions. The more important, honored, and esteemed the decea sed, the larger the gathering of mourners. The hardiness of survivors underscores the importance of social sup port systems as a critical resource in the adjustment and survival of grief, trauma and loss. Dressing and Casketing: According to transcendence view, it is the responsibility of t he living to carefully and respectfully care for the dead. Close kin are given the honor o f assisting with burial preparation (preparing the body, making the casket, digging the grave). Because a natural appearance and likeness of the loved one create less trauma for survivors, the reputation of the funeral home b ecame dependent upon the funeral director's skill in restoring the likeness of the loved one, pricing, services a nd care of the remains. Afri can-Americans prefer to use African- American funeral directors. The Funeral: African-American funerals are often delayed for several days after the death until family and friends gather. Funerals in the African-American subculture hav e come to represent a posthumous attempt to achieve dignity and esteem denied and limited in a culture wher e people often are treated with minimal respect Funerals attempt to affirm one's self and achieve some measure of positive self-identify, if only posthumously. The funeralization process and rituals, as well as final dispos ition, are important in honoring the soul of the deceased. The belief in transcendence to the spiritual word is commonly held. Since they mirror death as an integral part of life, they reflect attitudes that are more \"de ath accepting\" than Western culture. They practice a \"homegoing service\", i.e. passing babies over the casket and na ming a baby after a departed love one. These ceremonies may go on for hours . Most traditional African-- American funerals are officiated, by African- American clergy in churches. A frican- American funerals tend to be spontaneous and lengthy. Emotionalism of African- American funerals supports evidence that cathartic rel ease and externalization of feelings is more healthy and beneficial to grief recovery than suppressing feeli ngs. African- Americans believe in the value of the responsible care of the dead and rega0 funerals and \"primar y rituals\" worthy of considerable personal, and monetary investments. 462 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The Committal Service: Most African-Americans prefer ground burial. Native American Funeral The Native American Funeral can v ary greatly between tribes, vi llages, and clans. Many Native Americans have given up their funeral rituals to simply follow other religious beliefs addressed in this document. The following is an example of funeral concerns for a clan within the Hopi tribe. Preparation of the Remains : Embalming is not often necessary; however, a medicine man or woman is notified to do cleansing of the body. It is custom to have the body buried as quickly as possible, always before the third day following the death. Dressing and Casketing: Decisions ions as to the clothing to be worn b y the deceased a nd type of casket to be used are left up to the family. Visitation: Visitation varies from village to village, as some clans do no t believe in holding a wake. The Funeral: Traditionally, no funeral service is held. The Committal Service : Ceremonial hair washing is done by the deceased's aunts at th e gravesite. This is done by stroking the hair of the decea sed with the mother corn or wh ite corn. Preparation of the gravesite is done by male relatives and the body is placed in the chamber by four or five male relatives. On the fourth day following the death, a male of the tribe places food and prayer feathers on the grave. The food symbolizes energy needed for the deceased's journey to the after-life and the prayer fea thers assure the deceased a safe journey. Far Eastern Funeral While most groups of immigrants settle in cities, The Hmongs, a group of people displaced by the conflicts in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, are a notable exception. Their agr icultural background has led them to some unusual immigrant destinations: Wausau in central Wisconsin, for example. Preparation of the Remains : Hmongs would prefer the body not be embalmed. Visitation : Two nights of visitation is preferred. Dressing and Casketing: Family members dress the body. S ix to twenty survivors will co me to the funeral home for dressing the body and ceremonial wailing. They may bring a 50-gallon oil drum with a shower curtain stretched taut across the top on which they beat from morning u ntil night. The tone of the drum may suddenly change and then liquor is offered to select people. A glass of liquor may even be placed in the casket should the deceased get thirsty on the way to see his or her ancestors. A survivor dances under a tripod while playing a large reed horn. Artifacts be placed around the casket. The Funeral: Service may be held at any time, preceded only by an announcement that the family is ready to proceed. Slaughtering of animals is part of the tradition. The Committal Service: Closing of the grave is sacred to Hmongs. After burial, they re turn to their homes. Filipino Funeral The Funeral: Funeral services are typically Roman Catholic combined with et hnic traditions. Ceremonies typically last several days. Filipinos do not enter the chapel unless a funeral director accompanies them. The Committal Service: Lowering of the casket is always witnessed. To signify the pas sing of generations, the youngest child in the family is sometimes handed across the gra ve. Many photographs and/or videotaping of the funeral services and burial are taken to prove to those unable to attend that a loved one was given a proper service. 463 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Haitian Funeral The Funeral: Haitians may have to have the body 'lied\" for many days while f amily, friends, and money are gathered for the funeral. This may also be a necessity to obtai n visas for family members that are out of the country. Haitians also remember the dead and have a strong sens e of their ancestors. They believe the dead speak to them in dreams and that they, therefore, must have a p roper funeral. Haitians never expect death, even suspecting foul play when an old person dies of natural causes. Even though death is unexpected, death is a part of daily living for Haitians and their extended families. Upper OM Haitians mourn just like Anglos, and poor Haitians from rural areas are very emotional. They cry loudly, are demonstrative, pass out, and even throw themselves at the coffin. The Committal Service: Haitians wait at the cemetery until the last shovel full of di rt is thrown. They always fear the funeral director may steal the casket so they may jump on it to dent it up at the last minute. The emotionalism is also part of thei r grief resolution. Santeria o r voodoo customs are c ommon among Haitians. Mexican and Central American Funeral Among Mexicans, death is culturally viewed as punishment; religiously it is viewed as rebirth. Culturally, Mexicans believe that in the afte rlife they have the ability to observe what is occurring in this world; religiously, they view death as a union with God. Ceremonies are usually Rom an Catholic. Dressing and Casketing: The body of the deceased LS the focal point of the funeral. The casket is open, there is little cremation, and organ don ation is rare. Viewing is a m ust, and the body is dressed in the best, new clothing. Mexicans are very aware and comment on the quality of the casket. Visitation : The visitation and funeral is a three-day affair. Anything le ss would be a breach of social convention. The Funeral: The funeral is usually at a c hurch. The immediate family is cl osest to the grave with the extended family nearby. A week-long recitation of rosaries is common as well as anniversary observances. The family can consist of many, many people . Paperwork may be needed to ge t three-day visas to come to the United States for the funeral. The key to a rrangements is to contact the cons ulate of that country for instructions. Mexican immigrants traditionally resist prepayment plans since they fee l death will be brought closer. There is increased emotionalism, more emphasis on fa mily, and more direct help fro m friends. The Committal Service: Friends may actually dig the gra ve, do housework or prepare foo d for the bereaved. Santeria, the practice of a type of voodoo, may follow a traditional service in a funeral home. This is marked by special salsa music 'performed by musicians wearing tuxedos with long coats, gloves, and sunglasses. Polynesian Funeral Polynesian beliefs are a mixture of Protestant Christianity ble nded with Polynesian nature-oriented practices. All aspects of their' lives are influenced by the tribal structure of their society. Dressing and Casketing : Following a series of family Meetings, the first Samoan servi ce will feature the dressing of the body by women of the tribe. Customs include draping the casket or surrounding it with fine mats of hand-woven grass or leaves, and placing prized family possessions in the casket The body is covered with a veil, a tradition followed by the need to keep off insects in S amoa The Funeral : There is typically a week to te n day wait between the time of death and the burial so that all members of the family and tribe can attend. There will be an informal family service. Music is very important to the Samoans. More structured ceremonies called laeos follow wit h ministers and representative of other tribes participating. 464 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The Committal Service : Before the casket is closed, t he spouse or oldest child puts perfume over the body. Samoans feel they must, witness the actual burial. They throw f lowers while singing. A funeral, is not always a mournful occasion for them. West Indies Funeral Making the Removal: An unusual Cuban custom is called an all-night, repose, tradi tionally arranged to assure that the person is actually deceased. This custom has been modi fied in the United States, and now some reposes only last until midnight The Funeral : Cubans want traditional funerals with metal caskets and lots of flowers. Everyone goes to the cemetery. Cubans insist on staying at the cemetery until the va ult is sealed and the grave is filled in. Puerto Ricans are also more apt to tak e children of all ages to funera ls than are Cubans. Jamai can funerals are barely distinguishable from those of native-born Americans. The Committal Service : There has been a gradual incr ease in the acceptability of cremation. Military/Fraternal Rites American Legion Funeral The American Legion involvement in a funeral service is general ly limited to those events following the dressing and casketing of the remains. Dressing and Casketing : The only consideration which might affect the dressing of the deceased would be the wearing of American Legion clothing. Visitation: A flag will usually be present , either on the casket or folded and displayed nearby. If the deceased is not dressed in an American Legion uniform, the hat or other sig ns of membership may be displayed. The Funeral: In most cases the Anglican Legion service is conducted at the graveside. A total of twenty-one individuals are used in the American Legion funeral. Following the service, the playing of taps and the twenty- one gun salute would take place. The funeral home staff should be prepared to participate in the folding of the flag. Masonic Funeral Dressing and Casketing : Normally a white lambskin apr on, symbolizing membership as a Mason, is placed on the deceased. A sprig of evergreen is also usually fastened to the lapel of the deceased's coat. Visitation: The funeral director will need t o schedule the Masonic Funeral Service during some portion of the visitation period. The religious officiant will want to separate the Masonic Service from the religious portion of the funeral service. The Funeral: It is important that the funeral director be aware of these pre ferences and establishes a good rapport with not only the clergy but also the leaders of the fraternal organizations to ensure a smooth and meaningful funeral service for the family. If the funeral service is to be held at the fune ral home, the religious funeral service will be held first with the Masonic service fol lowing thereafter. If the funeral service is to be held in the church, you will most likely find the Masonic service he ld at the cemetery. The Committal Service : Members will wear white gloves, their white lambskin aprons a nd a sprig of evergreen on their lapels. The white lambskin apron worn by the deceased may be left in place or may be placed on the casket during the service. A minister representing the deceased 's religious denomination will normally have a scripture reading and prayer before turning the remainder of the service over to the Masons. 465 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Military Funeral Eligibility and availability of the appropriate military funeral detail and status (retired or active) of the deceased play major roles in the funeral. Some may not be entitled to a military funeral, but w ill be eligible for such benefits as a United States fla g, a government headstone, or burial in a National Cemetery. Eligibility : A Complete or graveside military funeral service is available for any active member of the armed forces. If the deceased was no longer an active member, the fam ily would need to contact the branch of service the deceased had belonged to and request that a full or partial military service take place. The funeral director will be responsible for working with the military funeral detai l to coordinate the funeral service. Preparation of the Remains : The military would play no role either in determining the ext ent or the method to be used in preparing the deceased. lf, on the other hand, the f uneral director is preparing a deceased on behalf of the armed forces, especially by means of a military contract, t he stipulated embalming requirements should be closely followed. Dressing and Casketing : It is possible that the dressing and casketing of the decease d could come under the auspices of the mortuary affairs unit of the armed forces. If t he deceased was still on active duty, the deceased would be dressed in his or her military uniform and placed in a casket provided by the government. If the deceased was a veteran, the task of dressing and casketing the remains would generally fall to the funeral director. The funeral director w ould be responsible for dressin g the deceased in the clothing provided for or chosen by the family and placing the deceased in the casket. Visitation : One noticeable difference for an active member of the armed f orces would be the representatives from that branch who would serve as an honor guard during the v isitation period. The presence of a United States flag would also serve to remind all who attend the visit ation of the deceased's service to his or her country. The flag would be used to drape the casket when it is closed. For the open casket , the flag covers the bottom portion of the casket or it can be folded into a triangl e and displayed in the head panel or on a nearby pedestal. The Funeral : The full military funeral could be held at the funeral home, the deceased's place of worship, a cemetery chapel or even a public facility such as an auditorium or similar type of building. A full military funeral service will combine the religious and fraternal with, the military service. Police Rituals and Customs BAGPIPE MUSIC : One of the time-honored views the public identifies the falle n police officer with are the bagpipes. Although the bagpipes are more known as an export fro m Scotland, the Irish transformed the bagpipes into an Irish-American tradition and a public safety tradition. In the middle ages, the bagpipes were a revere musical instrume nt played in both Scotland and Ireland and they were used to rally the troops in to battle, usually against the British. The fighting facti ons in Celtic lands used the bagpipes to assemble the troops just as the United States Calva ry used the bugle. The English outlawed the bagpipes in Ireland (1366) and declared them an \"instrument of war\". Anyone caught playing the bagpipes or harp was put to death. The-bagpipes were also u sed during the funeral ceremonie s when burying their fallen countrymen. In the early days in America when a police officer or firefighter was killed in the line of Duty, the Irish forefathers within these departme nts ensured that their fallen brothers were buried with full honors. In keeping with Celtic tradition, the Irish in America would play \"the pipes\" to bury their fallen. Today, that tradition transcends ethnic, racial and religious lines and the bagpipes are played at most police and fire funerals. With more than 25% of the names on th e National Law Enforcement Offi cers Memorial being of Irish decent, the Irish have made the playing of th e bagpipes a part of the fabri c of America and bagpipes are institutions in many police and fire departments across the United States. 466 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] BLACK BANDS OVER BADGES : Black armbands were worn as a symbol of mourning for hundreds of years and we believe law enforcement simply adopted that ritual as well. The black band over the shiny gold badge was a very noticeable symbol of mourning when a police officer died. The usual length for wearing this mourning symbol is 30 days. (It is suggested this be a \"thin, e lastic band\" so the shield number can still be seen by the general public.) BLACK SHROUDS OVER DOORWAYS OF POLICE BULDINGS : People used to shroud their home doorways when a family member died. This custom, too, we believ e was simply adopted by law enforcement. Again, this mourning symbol can be displayed for a 30 day perio d. FLAG-DRAPED COFFIN : While this rite is supposedly reserved only for persons who h ave served in the military, many police departments drape officers' coffins with the American flag since we know law enforcement protects our citizens on our home lands. It is trul y a heartfelt show of concern for the surviving family if two American flags can drape the coffin. and one is p resented to the surviving .spouse, with the other being given to the surviving parent(s). While it is customary that only one flag be presented at the burial, there is nothing keeping an agency from presenting a second flag at a nother time to other family members Additionally, flags that have f lown over the United States Capi tol in Washington, DC, are available through your Congressional representatives. You May request a flag to be flown over a specific day and a certificate will accompany that flag stating it was flown over the Capitol for the purpose you requested; i.e., \"This flag was flown over the Capitol of the U nited States in memory of Office r James Smith who was killed in the line of duty on October 12, 2012.\" FLY OVERS WITH HELICOPTERS OR AIRPLANES : Flyovers are again a military funeral salute to their men. Normally used at funerals where the officer was a helicopter/airplane pilot or a m ember of a SWAT team that used their air vehicles, t his ritual was again adopted from the military. HONOR. WATCH : Out of a show of respect for the fallen, law enforcement agen cies have stood 24-hour watch over their dead just as military have. With large majorities of military-trained personnel leaving the service and becoming polite officers, this is another adopted c ustom from the military. LOWERING OF FLAG : The American flag is usually lowered for a 30-day period when a government official dies. Again, law enforcement has adapted this ritual s ince the profession believes it serves as the last defense between chaos and order. Federal legislation allows the American flags on all government buildings to be lowered on May 15 th of each year, National Peace Officers' Memorial Day. Some states have also passed this same bill to allow State flags to be flown at half-staff on May 15th. 21-GUN SALUTE: Again, a ritual of the military, we believe law enforcement t ook on this ritual believing there is a \"war\" against crime. RIDERLESS HORSE/MOTORCYCLE : Again, another borrowed military ritual that probably goes ba ck to Civil War times. TAPS: Again, another borrowed military ritual. PRESENTING OFFICER' S GUN TO SURVIVING FAMILY : Knowing that many times the only immediate backups an officer has are his ability to talk himsel f out of trouble or his weapon, it has become custom with some police departme nts to present the officer's se rvice revolver to the surviving family. It is suggested that the weapon be alte red so it is unable to fire but so that it is also repairable. Several police organizations have rituals that include pr ayers during the wake and at the cemetery. Check with the surviving family to see if they a re interested in a police organizati on ceremony prior to scheduling the ceremony with the police organization . 467 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Understanding the Need for Ritua ls and Family/Agency Participat ion in the Funeral.

People tend to resist change 3. Nothing significant can be changed overnight 4. Purposeful planning and effective leadership enable change Lewin's Change Management Model Understanding the Three Stages of Change Unfreeze-Change-Refreeze. Change is a common thread that runs through all businesses rega rdless of size, industry and age. Our world is changing fast and, as such, organ izations must change quickly t oo. Organizations that ha ndle change well thrive, whilst those that do not may struggle to survive. The concept of \"change management\" is a familiar one in most bu sinesses today. But, how businesses manage change (and how successful they are at it) varies enormously de pending on the nature of the business, the change and the people involved. And a key part of this depends on how far people within it understand the change process. One of the cornerstone models for understanding organizational change was developed by Kurt Lewin back in the 1940s, and still holds true t oday. His model is known as Unfreeze - Change - Refreeze, refers to the three- stage process of change he describ es. Lewin, a physicist as wel l as social scientist, e xplained organizational change using the analogy of cha nging the shape of a block of ic e. Understanding Lewin's Model If you have a large cube of ice, but realize that what you want is a cone of ice, what do you do? First you must melt the ice to make it amenable to change (unfreeze). Then you must mold the iced water into the shape you want (change). Finally, you must solidify the new shape (refree ze). By looking at change as process with distinct stages, you can p repare yourself for what is coming and make a plan to manage the transition - looking before you leap, so to speak. All too often, people go into change blindly, causing much unneces sary turmoil and chaos. To begin any successful change p rocess, you must first start by understanding why the change must take place. As Lewin put it, \"Motivation for change must be generated befor e change can occur. One must be helped to re- examine many cherished assumptions about oneself and one's relations to others.\" This is the unfreezing stage from which change begins. Unfreeze This first stage of change invol ves preparing the organization to accept that change is n ecessary, which involves break down the existing status quo before you can build up a ne w way of operating. 474 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Key to this is developing a compelling message showing why the existing way of doing things cannot continue. This is easiest to frame when you can point to declining sales figures, poor financial results, worrying customer satisfaction surveys, or suchlik e: These show that things have to change in a way that everyone can understand. To prepare the organization su ccessfully, you need to start at its core - you need to challenge the beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors that cu rrently define it. Using the an alogy of a building, you must examine and be prepared to change the existing foundations as they might not s upport add-on stories; unless this is done, the whole building may risk collapse. This first part of the change process is usually the most difficult and stressful. When you start cutting down the \"way things are done\", you put everyone and everything off bala nce. You may evoke strong reactions in people, and that's exactly what needs to done. By forcing the organization to re-examine its core, you effecti vely create a (controlled) crisis, which in turn can build a strong motivation to seek out a new equilibrium. Withou t this motivation, you won't get the buy-in and participation necessary to effect any meaningful change. Change After the uncertainty created in the unfreeze stage, the change stage is where people begin to resolve their uncertainty and look for new ways to do things. People start to believe and act in ways that support the new direction. The transition from unfreeze to ch ange does not happen overnight: People take time to embrace the new direction and participate proac tively in the change. A related change model, the Change Curve, focuses on the specific issue of personal transitions in a changing environmen t and is useful for understanding this specific aspect in more detail. In order to accept the change a nd contribute to making the chan ge successful, people need to understand how the changes will benefit them. N ot everyone will fall in line j ust because the change is necessary and will benefit the company. This is a common assumption and pitfall that shoul d be avoided. Tip: Unfortunately, some people will ge nuinely be harmed by change, particularly those who benefit strongly from the status quo. Others may take a long time to recognize the benefits that change brings . You need to foresee and manage these situations. Time and communication are the two keys to success for the chan ges to occur. People need time to understand the changes and they also need to feel highly connected to the organization throughout the transition period. When you are managing change, t his can require a great deal of time and effort and hands-on management is usually the best approach. Refreeze When the changes are taking shape and people have embraced the new ways of working, the organization is ready to refreeze. The outward signs of the refreeze are a stable organization chart, c onsistent job descriptions, and so on. The refreeze stage al so needs to help people and the organization internalize or institutionalize the changes. This means making sure that the changes are used all t he time; and that they are incorporated into everyday business. With a new sense of stability, employees feel confident and comfortable with the new ways of working. The rationale for creating a new sense of stability in our ever y changing world is often questioned. Even though change is a constant in many organizations, this refreezing sta ge is still important. Without it, employees get caught in a transition trap where they aren't sure how things s hould be done, so nothing ever gets done to full capacity. In the absence of a new frozen state, it is very difficult to tackle the next change initiative effectively. 475 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] How do you go about convincing people that something needs chan ging if you haven't a llowed the most recent changes to sink in? Change will be perceived as change for chan ge's sake, and the motivation required to implement new changes simply won't be there. As part of the Refreezing process, make sure that you celebrate the success of the change - this helps people to find closure, thanks them for enduring a painful time, and help s them believe that future change will be successful. Practical Steps for Using the Framework: Unfreeze 1. Determine what needs to change. Survey the organization to understand the current state. Understand why change has to take place. 2. Ensure there is strong support from upper management. Use Stakeholder Analysis and Stak eholder Management to identify and win the support of key people within the organization. Frame the issue as one of organization-wide importance. 3. Create the need for change. Create a compelling message as to why change has to occur. Use your vision and strategy as supporting evidence. Communicate the vision in terms of the change required. Emphasize the \"why\". 4. Manage and understand the doubts and concerns. Remain open to employee concerns and address in terms of the ne ed to change. Change 1. Communicate often. Do so throughout the planning and implementation of the changes. Describe the benefits. Explain exactly the how the changes will affect everyone. 2. Prepare everyone for what is coming. Dispel rumors. Answer questions openly and honestly. Deal with problems immediately. Relate the need for change b ack to operational necessities. 3. Empower action. Provide lots of opportunity for employee involvement. Have line managers provide day-to-day direction. 4. Involve people in the process. Generate short-term wins to reinforce the change. Negotiate with external stakeholders as necessary (such as empl oyee organizations). Refreeze 1. Anchor the changes into the culture. Identity what supports the change. Identify barriers to sustaining change. 2. Develop ways to sustain the change. Ensure leadership support. Create a reward system. Establish feedback systems. 476 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Adapt the organizational structure as necessary. 3. Provide support and training. Keep everyone informed and supported. 4. Celebrate success! Key Points Lewin's change model is a simpl e and easy-to-understand framewo rk for managing change. By recognizing these three dis tinct stages of change, you can p lan to implement the change required. You start by creating the motivation to change (unfreeze). You move throu gh the change process by promoting effective communications and empowering people to embrace new ways of wor king (change). And the process ends when you return the organization to a sense of stability (refre eze), which is so necessary for creating the confidence from which to embark on the next, inevitable change. Coping with Workplace Change Change evokes fear in most people because of the uncertainty it presents. Understanding the Change When you have a routine, you know what to expect, and even if i t's difficult or boring, it's consistent and reliable. You have learned how to do your work and deal with fe llow workers. But when something changes, suddenly your routine is broken and you no longer know what to expect. Even if the change is for the better, the transition can be difficult. Practice the following four A's of coping with change: Awareness - Since uncertainty about the f uture creates the most fear and stress during a change, try to find as much information as you can about your situation. Whom can you ask? What can you lear n? What research can you do? The more you learn, the less uncertain you will experie nce. Behaviors, thoughts and actions that can be learned and developed will help you cope with change. Acceptance - You may not like the change , but if you accept that things h ave changed, instead of fighting it or complaining about it, you'll experience less frustration. It's important to accept the transition process with grace and a sense of looking forward to a new experience. Attitude - Are you being fearful or are you thinking about the possibil ities for improvement and new skills that the change might bring? To focus on the positive aspects of yo ur change, write a list of all the possible positive outcomes. Even though minor changes can cau se stress and frustration, the good news is that change can be an opportunity for something positive to happen. When you learn how to cope effectively with minor changes at work, you'll develop the skills and positive outlook to help you deal with c hanges throughout your life. Action - This is where you do have som e control over the situation. It is how you prepare and respond to change. The following positive actions can help you cope with change. Develop a network. Always keep in contact with your managers an d fellow workers. Having positive people to talk to about changes occurring in the workplace can be very helpful. Learn new skills. Learn a new computer program. Take a class in communication skills. Learn to make presentations. Ongoing training will add skills to your professional tool kit. Change your surroundings. Do what you can to make your work are a pleasant and comfortable. 477 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Ask questions. It is important to ask questions if you don't un derstand why something is being done a certain way. Being able to contact the correct person to ask a specific question is always good. Whom can you talk to? What ideas can y ou present to help with the c hange? The key to coping with change i s resilience. Resilience means knowing how to survive and making the best of change in spite of setbacks, barriers or limited resources. For change to be effective you m ust have a high degree of organ izational support and time for the commitment to happen. 478 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] To guide organizational change four factors must be present: 1. People : Team building, management deve lopment, and leadership development. (Who can tell me why these four elements are so important?) 2. Structure : Organizational reengineering , work team development, and strategic thinking. WHY? 3. Processes: Business Process reengineeri ng, continuous improvement/total quality, performance enhancement system. (If the processes are not in place, change will not be successful) 4. Tools : Structured coaching methodology, train-the-trainer systems, and organization diagnostic systems. 10 Critical Questions for Change Leaders Change managers need to ask the mselves some difficult questions before they set out to \"shake things up.\" And they need to listen to the answers. If you are a sensitive change manag er, here are some of the que stions you must consider before you set out to make things better. 1. What is the employees' perspective? To mobilize a work force to trans form itself, leaders must know what people in the organization are thinking, encourage them to articulate their points of view and their concerns and be ready to respond to them sincerely. Do not rely on second-hand information or make assumptions about what you think employees think. Ask them\u2014and k eep asking them until the answer becomes clear. Only then can you begin to design a strategy that builds on synergies and fills i n perception gaps. 479 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 2. Did you \"set the stage\" for change? One of the most vital roles of l eadership is to anticipate the agency's future and its place in the community arena, and then to formulate stra tegies for surmounting challenges that have not yet manifested. To proactively respond to these challenges, agencies must continua lly reinvent themselves. Leaders must encourage employees to join a constant questioning of the preva iling assumptions\u2014and to be ready to act upon new opportunities early in the game to maintain an advantage. 3. Are you tracking employee perceptions throughout the change? As important as it is to find out what employees are thinking b efore the change, it is just as crucial to have a system for monitoring employee perception throughout the proces s. George Bernard Shaw once said that the problem with communication is \"the illusion that it has been ac complished.\" When it comes to communicating change, leadership must be especially careful not to suffer that illusion. Strategies that include employee interaction and feedback systems help organiza tions track the level of work force comprehension. You will find the greatest advantages come when organizational feedback is gathered immediately after the delivery of every important message. Use this short questionnaire to query audiences before they leave the meeting room: What in your view are the most important points we just covered ? What didn't you understand? With what do you disagree? With what do you agree? What else do you need to know? 4. Are you giving honest answers to tough questions? In the light of economic realities that offer little in the way of job security, employees must be able to rely on their employers to give them honest information that will allow them to make informed choices about their own jobs, careers and futures. When you can't answer ever y question, it is best to tell people that you understand their concern but don't know the answer. Or, say tha t you don't have the information yet, but will get back to them as soon as deci sions are made. It is even bett er to tell people that you have the information but can't release it than to withhold or twist the truth. 5. Can you explain \"what's in it for them\"? The most commonly asked or unasked question regarding change is \u2014\"What's in it for me?\" 6. Is your communication \"behavior-based\"? Organizations send two concurrent sets of messages about change . One set of messages goes through formal channels of communication\u2014speeches, newsletters, videos, values statements and so forth. The other set of messages is delivered informally through a combination of \"off the record\" remarks and daily activities. Senior management teams should begin two questions: \"What do yo u currently do that already supports the change?\" and \"What do you have t o do differently to align with the change?\" For today's skeptical employee audience, rhetoric without action quickly disintegrates into em pty slogans and propaganda. In the words of Sue Swenson, president of Leap W ireless, \"What you do in the ha llway is more powerful than anything you say in the meeting room.\" 7. Can you paint the big/little picture? Vision is the big picture (we'll look at this next), and it is crucial to the success of the enterprise. But along with the big picture, people also need the little picture: Big Picture\u2014Presenting the concept of transformation. Little Picture\u2014How are w e going to do that? Big Picture\u2014Setting long-term corporate goals. Little Picture\u2014Where do we begin? Big Picture\u2014Developing the overa ll objectives of the transforma tion. Little Picture\u2014 What are the priorities? Big Picture\u2014Creating the mission of the organization. Little Picture\u2014Where does my contribution fit in? 480 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Big Picture\u2014Communicating organizational values. Little Picture\u2014What does this mean in my daily life? 8. Is it your vision or our vision? Leaders understand the power of vision to imbue people with a s ense of purpose, direction and energy. A compelling vision of the future pulls people out of the seducti ve hold of the past and inspires them to set and reach ambitious goals. Of even gr eater importance is the sense of meaning that people derive from their jobs when they can tie their contri butions to the fulfillment of a c lear, compelling vision. Leaders must therefore be able to paint the big picture. But if the vision belongs onl y to top management, it will never be an effective force for transformation. The power of a vision comes truly into play only when the employees themselves have had some part in its creation. So the crucial q uestion becomes, \"Whose vision is it?\" Leaders must create a master na rrative that coherently articula tes the agency's identity and ideals and is embraced by every member of the organization. If you want emplo yees to feel the same kind of connection to their work that the executives feel, then you have to get th em involved. 9. Are you emotionally literate? To be a consummate manager of change, it is not enough to engag e people's logic; you also have to appeal to their emotions. As leaders gain the insight that people skills (the \"soft stuff\") hold the key to organizational change, human emotions take on new significance. Large-scale organiza tional change almost invariably triggers the same se quence of reactions\u2014denial, nega tivity, a choice point, tentative acceptance and commitment. Leadership can f acilitate this emotional process or, ignored, it can erode the transformation effort. 10. Do you know what shouldn't change? The greatest challenge for leaders is to know the difference be tween what has to be preserved and what needs to be changed. The \"genius\" of leadership is being able t o preserve an organizati on's core values, and yet change and adapt as times re quire. The product of that kind of leadership is an org anization that goes on for a very long time. 7 Essentials Skills for Managing Change Change has always been the only constant. In recent years, the pace of change has accelerated greatly, and we all need to find ways to deal creatively with this fact of m odern life. Leaders need to face and manage change in a constructive way. Leaders are adaptable and creative, responding to change in three key ways: People who respond well to change will have a high 'ambiguity threshold.' Change is inherently ambiguous, and those who deal creatively w ith change will have a high tole rance for uncertainty and 'shades of gray.' Skillful managers of change will have a constructive 'internal monologue.' They will see themselves as inherently powerful and having the ability to control elements of the situation in which they find themselves. Some circumstances cannot be changed, but the way we respond to them is always a choice, and we always have a sphere of influence, howev er small. By focusing on this sphere of influence, and not expending energy bemoaning the area outside it, the circle will start to expand and give us progressively mor e control. Solutions to problems always exist, and the 'internal monologue' should refl ect the desire to find them and the certainty that they can be successfu lly implemented. 481 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Those who deal well with change will have a good reservoir of emotional, physical and mental energy from which to draw when things get tough. The above ways of dealing with c hange tend to be innate, with s ome people having a greater capacity for one or more of them than others. However, they can be learned, a nd the following are seven tips for improving your skills in managing change . 1. Spend time reflecting on your own core values and your mission in life. A sense of purpose is essential to success and effectiveness, and those without a clear idea of what they are doing and why they are doing it will not have the foundation to k eep going in the face of chang e. 2. Be persistent. Success is usually more to do w ith tenacity that genius. Persi stence is only possible when you have clarified your values and when you are able to build on th e bedrock of purpose. Successful people keep going in the face of change, finding new and creative ways to achieve a positive outcome. 3. Be flexible and creative. Persistence does not mean pushing through by force. If you are unable to achieve success one way, try another, and then another. Keep looking fo r more creative solutions and innovative responses to problems. 4. Think outside the box. Read widely, and don't confine yourself to your own area of 'e xpertise.' Try to see links between apparently separate and diverse elements in your life and experience. 5. Accept uncertainty and be optimistic. Life is inherently uncertain, so don't waste your energy tryin g to predict the future. Of all the possible outcomes, focus on the most positive one. This is not to be a 'Pollyanna,' but to accept that i f you respond well and work to the best of your ability, a good outcome is as likely as any other. Don't waste your energy being negative. 6. Keep fit and healthy. Eat well, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly. Meditation can help, too. This will keep up your energy levels and allow you to keep going in tough times. Not taking care of yourself physically, mentally and spiritually is foolish and short sight ed. 7. See the big picture. Change is inevitable, but if you take a bird's-eye-view of the landscape, the change won't be so disorientating and you will keep perspective at all times. The Biggest Mistakes in Managing Change Mistake #1: Not understanding the importance of people. 60-75 percent of all restructuring failed\u2014not because of stra tegy, but because of the \"human dimension.\" Lesson Learned: Organizations do not change. People do - or they don't. If staff do not trust leadership, do not share the organization's vision, do not buy into the reason for change, and are not incl uded in the planning - there will be no successful change - regardless of how brillian t the strategy. Mistake #2: Not appreciating that people throughout the or ganization have different reactions to change. Lesson Learned: Some people are naturally more \"change-adept.\" We need to spot and encourage the early adaptors -- and we need to develop change-adept employee profil es to better understand how to develop these qualities throughout the organiza tion. Change-adept people are naturally happier in their work because they have come to terms with a world that never stays the same. They move with today's chaotic workplace, rather than fighting it. They are energized by, and actually thrive on , change. The change-adept are not necessarily more competent than their co-wor kers, but they have distinct advantages in the attitudes they hold and the strategies they adopt. Change-adept professionals build greater resilience and not only survive, but flourish in changing times. There are five factors that determine which ind ividuals deal successfully with change. 1. Confidence. Confident people are self-motivated, have high self-esteem, a nd are willing to take risks. Quite simply, they know how good they are. 2. Challenge . With any change, the danger of possible reversals coexists wi th incredible opportunities for personal and professional success. Leaders need employees to be excited by the opportunities in change. 482 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] When change-adept people are asked for verbal images they assoc iate with change, they acknowledge the stress, uncertainty, pressure , and disruption, but they als o emphasize the benefits -- the opportunity, growth, adventure, exc itement and challenge. 3. Coping . Some people are naturally more flexible and better at coping with, and adapting to, a complex, fast-paced reality than others . These individuals take charge o f change by accepting responsibility and assuming control. To be successful in chaotic times, the trick is not to brace yourself for change, but to loosen up and learn how to roll with it. In your organization, strategies will be planned, announced, implemented, and then-- right in the middle of execution -- the y will all too often ha ve to be altered or aborted because of external changes. What leaders need from emp loyees is the ability to commit to a course of action and, at the sa me time, to stay flexible enough to quickly alter behavior and attitude. 4. Counterbalance. Those who are most resilient not only have a job -- they have a life. Change-adept individuals compensate for the demands and pressures of busines s by developing counterbalancing activities in other areas of their lives. They engage in exerci se programs and healthful eating habits, they cultivate interests outside of business -- sports, hobbies, art , music, etc. -- which are personally fulfilling, and they have sour ces of emotional support. Because employees with counterbalance have a life that includes both work and recreation, they handle stress better and are more effective on the job. 5. Creativity . Buckminster Fuller once said, \"Everyone is born a genius. Soc iety de-geniuses them.\" Change-adept professionals have su rvived the de-geniusing of society to remain curious, creative, and innovative. You can easily spot creative people in organization s. They are the employees who are constantly seeking ways to improve products, services, or thems elves. Typically, they question rules and regulations, and contribute ideas beyond the limits of their job descriptions -- to other functions, to other departments, and to the organization as a whole. These creative employees solicit diverse opinions that generate new thoughts, and they value any business experience t hat exposes them to new knowledge and skills. Mistake #3: Treating transformation as an event, rather th an a mental, physical and emotional process. Lacking \"emotional literacy\" we disregarded the wrenching emoti onal process of large-scale change -- and when we began to address the emotional component, we underestimated its depth. Lesson Learned: Large-scale organizational change usually trigg ers emotional reactions -- denial, negativity, choice, tentative acceptance, com mitment. Leadership can either facilitate this emotional process or ignore it -- at the peril of the transformation effort. Mistake #4: Being less than candid. Under the rationale of \"protec ting\" people, we presented change with a too positive \"spin.\" And the more we \"sugar-coated\" the truth, the wide r the trust gap grew between management and the work force. Lesson Learned: Communicate openly and honestly. Today's employ ees are demanding it. Not everyone will thank you for your candor, but they will never forgive you for anything less. Open and honest communication goes beyond simply telling the trut h when it's advantageous. Yo u need a proactive, eve n aggressive, sharing of everything -- the opportunities, t he risks, the mistakes, the p otentials, the failures -- and then inviting people in to work on these challenges together. Mistake #5: Not appropriately \"setting the stage\" for change. All too often, change was announced in an environmental vacuum, with little reason or rationale for what the organization was trying to accomp lish and how this change fits into the corporate vision. Lesson Learned: To prepare employees for success, we must give them pertinent information about demographic, global, economi c, technological, competitive, and industry trends. People need to know the vision, goals, and strategy of the company. They need to understand the financial reality of the business and how their actions impact that reality. 483 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Mistake #6: Trying to manage transformation with the sa me strategies used for incremental change. Lesson Learned: Incremental cha nge -- continuous improvement, e tc. - is linear, predictable, logical, and based on a progressive acceleration of p ast performance. Transformation is none of these things. Transformation is a redefinition of who we are and what we do. It's often unpredictable (responding to unforeseen circumstance, challenges and opportunities), illogical (demanding people and organizations change when they are the most successful), and most importantly, in a transformative change, our past success is not a valid indicator of future success. In fact, our past success may be our greatest obstacle . Mistake #7: Forgetting to negotiate the new \"com pact\" between employers and employees. The result was that people knew what they were losing, but didn't have a clear picture of what to expect in its place. Lesson Learned: A new kind of relationship, grounded in mutual trust and respect, is emerging between employers and employees. This new compact is developed out of realistic expectations on bot h sides. It attempts to align the interests of the organization with those of its em ployees, to share both the risks and rewards of doing business. As leaner companies rely on fewer employees to should er more of the work, the developing relationship between company and worker is changing from patern alism to partnership. Companies owe it to their work force to aggressively pursue new ideas, products, services, markets, and customers. Employees expect to be treated and compensated fairly, to develop profess ionally, and to have meaningful, challenging work. In return, employees owe the organization their willingne ss to participate in personal growth, idea development, customer service, a nd organizational transformatio n. Balancing the employee-employer compact is not a matter of adding more items to one side of the balance sheet or eliminating some from the other side. Increasingly, it is a matter of f inding items that are of value to both the employer and the employee. Mistake #8: Believing that change-communication was what employees heard or read from corporate headquarters. So we focused our attention on speeches, newsletters, videos, a nd email -- only to find out that, from an employee's perspective, the ki nd of communication that impacts behavior is 10 percent \"traditional\" vehicles, 45 percent organizational structure (whatever punishes or rewards ) and 45 percent management behavior. Lesson Learned: A communication strategy that is not congruent with organizational systems and the actions of leadership is useless. Corporate leaders are beginning to learn the importance of behavior-based communication as a requirement for leading discontinuous change. Organizations send two concurrent sets of messages about change. One set of messages goes through formal channels of communications -- speeches, newsletters, corporate videos, values statements, and so forth. The other se t of messages is \"delivered\" informally through a combination of \"off the record\" remarks and daily activities. For today's skeptical employee audience, rhetoric without action quickly disintegrates into empty slogans and company propaganda. In the words of Sue Swenson, CEO of Cricket Communications, \"What you do in the hallway is more powerful than anything you say in the meeting room.\" Mistake #9: Underestimating human potential. And when we underestimated poten tial, we wasted it. This was o ur worst mistake. Lesson Learned: Trust in the innate intelligence, capability, a nd creativity of your em ployees -- and people will astound you. In the Industrial Age, companies squandered immens e amounts of human potential on mindless, repetitive tasks and meaningless paper work. It never occurred to leaders in those days t hat their assembly-line workers had the know-how to go home and rebuild entire car engi nes, that their \"lowly cashiers\" easily negotiated complicated bank loan s for their families, or that t heir \"pretty little stenogra phers\" were perfectly capable of chairing PTA meetings, managing household budgets, o rganizing charity drives, sitting on hospital committees or running complex vol unteer organizations in their spare time. Today, in the post-industrial Information Age no company can a fford to waste human capital so rashly. Every talent, every idea, every skill is 484 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] needed urgently if companies are to survive. The potential of t he work force really is the company's greatest asset. Leading and Managing Change Managing change has become the \"silver bullet\" in seeking the f inal component of successfully managing strategy, process, people and culture. Few people will argue w ith this statement, but fewer still will say their organization does a good job at managing those changes. Managi ng change well is a c ontinuous and ongoing combination of art and science that assures alignment of an org anization's strategies, structures, and processes. A growing number of agencies are undertaking the kinds of organ izational changes needed to survive and prosper in today's environment. They are streamlining themselv es and thereby becoming more nimble and responsive. They are involving employees in key decisions. Th ey are taking initiative in innovating and managing change, rather than simply reacting to what has alread y happened. Consider the following six practical aspects of any change proc ess: 1. Do No Harm - Too often, and with the best o f intentions, managers change on facet of the organization without regard for the whole system. All parts of an organization are connected directly or indirectly and tinkering with one component exe rts tension on other parts. 2. All Change Involves Personal Choice - Change is more oftened resist ed than supported because peopl e rarely are given the chance to u nderstand the reason for the ch ange. No one bothers to e xplain to the \"why.\" Few organizations spend time thi nking about \"What's in it for t he employees?\" That is, individuals must believe that it is in their own best interest to do things diff erently. 3. The Relationship Between Change and Performance is Not Instanta neous - As far as human beings are concerned, there is no such thing as instantaneous transformation. As a result, asking an organization to change (or telling the people in the organization to change) without giving them resources to do so is a fool's errand? \"Turning the or ganization on a dime\" or \"pullin g the organization through a knothole\" are metaphors that do no justice to the process of change. Worse, such wrenching procedures can create cynical attitudes among employees. Change often involves time and opportunity to learn. 4. Connect Change to Business Strategy - Change for change sake is a r ecipe for failure. The notion of \"If it is not 'broke,' break it and improve anyway\" is a waste of scar ce and valuable resources. Change should only be pursued in the context of a clear goal. 5. Involvement Breeds Commitment - Few principles in the manag ement of change are as well docum ented or understood as the idea that involvement breeds commitment, y et organizations continue to ignore this principle. Managers who do not involve their workers in decisions that affect them run the risk of stalled change efforts. \"But it takes too long,\" is the most common co mplaint and source of resistance to the involvement imperative. But what is the cost of failed impleme ntation because you went too fast? 6. Any Good Change Effort Results in Increased Capacity to Face Ch ange in the Future . It is one thing to \"install\" a change, but it is a quite different notion to imple ment change in such a way that the organization is more capable of managing change in the future. Address and reduce the fear of change. Recognize that people w ill complain about change. It is just human nature. It is your job to identify whether people are complaining for the sake of complaining or whether t hey have valid concerns. 485 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] There are three levels at whic h people are involved in change: 1. Aware of; 2. Accepting of 3. Committed to For change to be successful you need a lot of pigs (committed p eople) Have clear expectations - As yo u manage change in the workplace it is important to: Get people to think and act like owners of the change Involve employees (study groups, think tanks, etc.) Create a clear tomorrow Empower your people by rewarding the 'right' behavior Staying on Top of the Change Process Engaging workplace change can be an unpredictable experience because processes and people evolve in diverse ways as they undergo change. No two individuals will respond i n exactly the same way to workplace changes. In the same way, identical chang es implemented in multiple area s can produce distinctly different outcomes. These tips from Dale Carnegie show you how to stay on top of th e change engagement process by thoroughly preparing for it, while allowing for various outcomes. These tips allow you to take a structured approach to organizational change and s till maintain flexibility. 1. Motivation for Change - Change begins at the point where the organization finds a motivation for change. Sometimes external issues drive the change and other times, int ernal forces drive the change. 2. Analyze the Situation - As the organization becomes progressively more motivated to change, leadership undertakes a thorough analysis of the risks and opportunities a ssociated with proposed change. What are the potential gains in undertaking the change? What are the costs? What are the risks of making the change? What are the risks of not making the change? 3. Plan the Direction - Once an organization determines that opportunities outweigh the risks of making the change, it develops a plan for ch ange implementation. Many organizational change initiatives fail because of lack of careful, thorough planning. In this step, the stage is set for the ultimate success or failure of the change. Key elements of the plan must include: Planning for the impact of the change on individuals who will b e most affected Planning for the impact of the ch ange on the systems within the organization that will be most affected A step-by-step plan for integrating the change into the organiz ation A review plan to measure the success of the proposed change 4. Implement the Change - Depending on the type and scope of the change, implementation within the organization may be gradual or abrupt. The team's most critica l role in this step of the change process is to maintain open, honest lines of communication with each other. Define individual responsibilities Announce and launch the change Adhere to timetables Promote the anticipated benefits of the change. 486 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 5. Review the Direction - Once the change has been implemented in the organization, yo u should monitor the outcomes of the change. As team m embers in a changing work env ironment, you cannot assume that the change will evolve exactly as pl anned or that every individual affected by the change will react as anticipated. Your role is to observe review checkpoints that w ill reveal whether the change is working as anticipated and is producing the desired results. Establish ways of measuring results Communicate criteria for successful change outcomes Coordinate the gathering and measuring o change effects Inform key team members consiste ntly during the review process 6. Adopt - When you have reviewed the ch ange implementation and found i t to be succeeding as planned, the organization adopts the change and it becomes part of the new o rganizational norm. The review process if not terminated, but it transitions to the ongoing monitoring of the changed within the organization. How well is the change meeting planned outcomes? How well have you adjusted to the new status quo? What aspects of the change have not met expectations? What is your role in making those aspects more successful? 7. Adjust - If the review process concluded that the change is not worki ng as planned, you should adjust the change implementation. Assuming that the organization executed the change analysis and plan accurately, you should be able to adjust the implementation of the organiza tional change to achieve your desired results. Determine where the outcomes ar e falling short of your plan. Engage key individuals in determining adjustments that need to be made Keep the lines of communicati on open with everyone involved Make adjustments to the review p rocess and to the change implementation 17 Ways To Survive Your Company's Reorganization, Takeover, Dow nsizing, or Other Major Change. By Morton C. Orman, M.D. Many companies today are under intense economic pressure. Reorg anizations, takeovers, mergers, downsizings, joint ventures, and other major changes are extremely common, as companies try to g row and survive. These changes present new challe nges and demands for everyone, from the C.E.O to the telephone receptionist. All members of the organization must therefore learn to cope with change or suffer consequences. When change is not handled well, additional loss of jobs can oc cur. In addition, demoralization of the work force; increased worker turnover; decreased cooperation and tea mwork; and increased levels of stress, anxiety, absenteeism, illness, and mistakes can follow. The purpose of this Special Report is to highlight eighteen principles that are useful for coping with organizational change. While all eighteen of these principles m ay not apply to your situation, please read through the entire list to find those that do appeal to you. 1. BE PREPARED FOR CHANGE Change is--and always has been--a n inevitable part of life. In today's climate, however, the pace of change has definitely increased. Since most people normally hate to go through change, you can e asily understand how today's pace of change can be stressful for many employees. 487 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Most of us prefer established routines. We like to feel secure, stable, and familiar with our responsibilities. The one thing we hate most is uncerta inty--uncertainty about our jo bs, our future, our status in the organization, the role we are expected to play, and what other changes might be c oming down the pike. Thus, instead of fearing change, resisting it, or hoping it won 't ever happen to you, it's much better to prepare yourself mentally for the inevitable changes that are likely to occur. Start today by imagining how you could cope with sudden, massive change. Think about likely scenarios and then brainstorm, on your own or with others, about how you migh t best respond. Assume that the \"rug could get pulled from beneath you\" at any time. Then, if this happe ns, you won't be caught off guard. You'll already be psychologically and emotionally re ady. If the changes never come, you'll still be better off. Having p repared yourself in advance will enable you to feel much more confident and secure in your normal day- to-day activ ities. 2. EXPRESS SADNESS, LOSS, ANXIETY ABOUT THE FUTURE When change does occur, don't pr etend it isn't painful. Yes, ch ange can bring new opportunities for personal growth, accomplishment, and organizational success. But it also causes feelings of sadness, loss, and anxiety about the future. These are normal human responses. When people get laid off or fired, everybody hurts. We feel for our friends and coworkers. We empathize with their pain, anger, and sadness. In fact, we may have our own si milar feelings to deal with, as new demands and responsibilities suddenly come our way. When people get promoted, when organizational relationships cha nge, or when our own job responsibilities become altered, there is a normal reaction of sadness, anxiety, and loss. One of the worst things you can do when this happens is to pret end everything is \"just f ine.\" Even if you agree intellectually that the changes are necessary, emotionally you still may have some painful, negative reactions to deal with. Unfortunately, today's business culture has little regard for h onest human emotions. Expressing or even acknowledging negative feelings is considered \"inappropriate.\" Workers are expected to be upbeat, positive, and \"team players\" all the time. While this is a laudable goal, the re should also be room for people to express heart- felt negativity as well. Truly enlightened business leaders know this. During times of significant change, they actively solicit negative feelings from their workers. They know that denying these feeli ngs or trying to suppress their expression will only make things worse. 3. WATCH OUT FOR UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS Unrealistic expectations can be a tremendous source of stress a nd unnecessary suffering. Unfortunately, when organizations undergo downsizings , restructurings, or other major changes, a whole host of unhealthy, unreasonable expectations frequently arise. Upper management may expect, for example, that increased produc tivity will quickly occur, even though the work force has been seriously reduced. Or, management may expec t they can impose any changes they want, without considering how employees feel about them. Employees, on the other hand, mi ght expect that management shou ld always act in a caring and compassionate manner. They might expect better communication from company leaders; more sensitivity to their feelings and needs; or more respect for their health, well-being, and family responsibilities. 488 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] While all of these things may be important for good employer-em ployee relationships, to expect them to be forthcoming from management (w ithout encouragement from the rank-and-file) is to invite disappointment, resentment, and low morale. 4. DON'T LET YOURSELF OR OTHERS BE ABUSED During times of change, it is common to let yourself and others be easily abused. When workers have been fired or laid off, there is a natural tendency to wonder if you might be next. This climate of fear might prevent you from speaking up forcefully when excessive or unreasonable dema nds are placed upon you. Anxiety quickly spreads throughout the entire workforce, making it even more di fficult to obtain support for questioning unreasonable company policies. But sometimes, questioning polic ies is healthy and appropriate. If you feel that you or fellow workers are being unfairly abused, try to tactfull y broach this subject with your immediate superiors. Try to do this in a way that isn't offensive or that doesn't make you appear to be lazy, unc ooperative, or unwilling to do your share. Yes, there is always a risk when you make such a move. You could easily get fired or be branded as a troublemaker. But if you truly have your compa ny's interests at heart, you ma y be able to negotiate a more fair and humane work environment for all concerned. After all, if the remaining work force is angry and demoralized, how could this possibly be good? 5. ACKNOWLEDGE ANY INCREASED PRESSURES, DEMANDS, OR WORKLOADS One of the biggest mistakes most companies make when they downs ize or restructure is they fail to acknowledge the increased pressur es, demands, and workloads that temporarily fall upon remaining employees. Sometimes, retained workers are asked to do the work of two or three individuals with little appreciation or acknowledgement. Their salaries are not increased commensurately or perhaps even at all. The resources made available to them are often very lean or nonexistent. While at the very same time, the demands on their productivity might be significantly increased! All of this could occur without even a word of thanks or gratit ude from the company leaders who ultimately benefit from such an arrangement. Whether your company realizes how short-sighted this failure of recognition is, you don't have to compound this mistake. Be sure to regularly acknowledge to yourself and to yo ur coworkers if your responsibilities have been substantially increased. While it may take time for you to succ essfully readjust, always strive to acknowledge whatever is true for you at the moment. Discuss your feelings with your family, friends, and loved ones. Consider discussing them with your superiors, if you think this would be appr opriate. Just don't make the mis take of suppressing your feelings, denying them, or pretending they aren't really there. 6. PROTECT YOUR LEISURE TIME When companies undergo change, the re is usually plenty of extra work to be done. Suddenly, people begin working through their lunch times. They can't find time to play golf, take a vacation, or ev en travel to their local fitness club. They begin to come home later and later in the ev ening, and they often fi nd themselves back in the office on weekends and holidays. This is a very dangerous patte rn to fall into. It can easily gr ow into a generally accepted mentality. Remember, just because everybody else in your organization starts acting insane, you don't h ave to go along. Fight against this common trend by protecting your leisure time , as best you can. Realize that during times of change and increased stress, it's actually more important to get away from your job and have some time each day for yourself. That way, you' ll be refreshed, energetic, and much more productive than all those people who spend all their time on the job. 489 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 7. DON'T IGNORE YOUR FAMILY In addition to maintaining time for yourself, it's also importa nt not to forget your family. Spouses, children, and other family members can be excellent sources of emotional supp ort when times are tough at work. But they won't be in a very loving or supportive mood, if all you do is neglect them in favor of your job. Sure work often takes priority , but you family should be elevat ed to an equal priority as well. If you put too much emphasis on just one of these areas, and neglect the other , you're eventually going to find yourself in trouble. 8. DON'T TURN TO ALCOHOL, DRUGS, FOOD OR OTHER CHEMICAL COPING STR ATEGIES During times of increased stress, people often look for rapid and easy means of symptom relief. Headaches, muscle aches, nervousness, irritability, and sleep disturbances can all be very disturbing. Please avoid the temptation to use alcohol, drugs, or other che mical coping methods to obtain relief from these common symptoms. Also watch out for tendencies to overeat, skip meals, or drastically alter your diet in response to increased pressures or an expanded work load. While most of these coping strate gies can make you feel better in the short run, the y each have serious (sometimes even fatal) long-term consequences. It's always better to use natural, non-chemical coping methods. Try to exercise more, communicate more, and set time aside each day to relax . Don't deprive your body of sl eep or proper nutrition. You'll need both of these to cope with the many new demands that you might face. If your symptoms don't respond to these natural measures, or if you feel yourself turning toward alcohol, drugs, or other harmful behaviors, DON'T GIVE IN. Pick up the phone an d make an appointment with your doctor or other trusted health professi onal. Be totally honest about your problems and listen carefully to what they recommend. If you don't have a fam ily doctor, get one. Whatever you do, don't succumb to taking the easy way out. 9. REMAIN UPBEAT AND POSITIVE Even though you may be feeling stressed, angry, or scared about your future, you still need to remain upbeat and positive in most things you do. W hen organizations change, the climate should remain positive, even though individual members of the organization may be having all sorts of negative or uncertain feelings. I know this sounds contradictory, but it's not. Acknowledging any negative feelings you might be harboring actually improves your ability to remain upbeat and optimistic! When you're willing to look at all sides of your company's reorganization or cha nge, your ability to notice the positives, as well as the negatives, improves. Then you can choose to focus on the positives, rather than dwell on the negatives. Please be clear about this very i mportant point. I am not sayin g you should \"pretend\" you are upbeat when you are really feeling down. What I am saying is that if you force yourself to tell the whole truth, you'll see both the positive and negative aspects of any major change. This expande d perspective alone will almost always help you feel more positive and upbeat, without having to deny your feel ings to the contrary. You can then use your powers as a creative human being to focus on just the positives (and help others in your organization to do the same) because you know from past experie nces that this is a wise thing to do. If a few key people in each organ ization or department take on this role as a positive emotional leader, it will quickly spread to other employees as well. If nobody steps forward to remind people of the truth, it's easy for company employees to remain stuck in a chronic state of negativ ity. 490 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 10. GET CREATIVE One of the best ways to cope with organizational change is to \" rev up\" your natural powers for creative intervention. Most problems are amenable to creative, innovative solutions. T he only thing that usual ly keeps these solutions from arising is our own internal barriers and self- imposed res trictions. Creative problem solving always involves risks. Proposing a new idea invites criticism from others. What if the idea fails? What if business losses occur? What if things end up worse than before? You've got to be willing to accep t such risks if you're going t o be free to think creatively. Trust yourself and others around you to recognize any really horrible idea before it gets implemented. Then give yourself permission to swing out and think creatively--allowing any and all ideas to come to mind. Many companies have regular \"brainstorming\" sessions for just this purpose. During times of reorganization and change, these creative sessions are very important. Time should be set aside to make t hem a common occurrence. 11. EXPAND YOUR VALUE When times get tough and people are being laid off, remaining w orkers become very fearful. Instead of worrying or losing sleep over the possibility you might be let go, why don't you go into action and stack the deck in your favor. How? Very simple. Just make yourself incredibly valuable to you r company. Offer to take charge of some problem or project that isn't working. Contribute creative ideas to appropriate people in the chain of command. Become very interested in the problems your boss and company ow ners are facing, and see how you can help them out. Stop worrying about yourself and your future and get busy helping your company grow and prosper. What's the worst that can happe n? You might still might lose yo ur job, but look at the bright side. You can take all that energy, drive, commitm ent, and creativity to your next place of employment. Who wouldn't be delighted to find an employee like that? It's a win-win situation for you, no matter what happens. NOTE: Give serious thought to using th is strategy even if times aren't tough and your company isn't downsizing. Then, when the first wave of employee cut backs occ urs, hopefully you won't be among those let go. 12. CELEBRATE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS In the world today, most people tend to focus primarily on prob lems, mistakes, and obstacles to future agency goals. We rarely take time to celebrate our accomplishments. Do we take time to celebrate the tremendous effort everyone is putting in? You'd be surprised how much of a difference this can make. You don't have to spend a lot of money or hold a gala event. You can have small, spontaneous celebrations any time you choose. If you are creative, you can find all sorts of ways to acknowle dge and uplift your co-workers. You could even throw a \"party\" every once in a while to celebrate and acknowle dge your boss! 13. IMPROVE LINES OF COMMUNICATION In general, the more \"crazy\" and chaotic your work situation be comes, the more you need good lines of communication. In fact, much of this \"craziness\" is directly ca used by ineffective communication. Everyone must communicate more actively when organizations unde rgo change. This includes the boss, the CEO, and even the Board of Directors. It also includes middle m anagers, clerical staff, and other agents and employees. 491 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] More meetings, not fewer, will pr obably be needed. When employe es and managers are nervous, worried, and pressured, they have increased information needs. They deserve to know what's really going on and what is being planned for the future. If you don't supply these answers to them, they will make up ones on their own. Often, they will imagine the worst, when in fact, there may be very good reasons for hope and optimism. Evaluate your organization's communications needs and game plan . Talk to employees to see what communication they needs have. Find out what forms of communica tion they would find most helpful. Above all, realize how important and necessary good communication is in coping with the stress of major organizational change. But make sure communications are honest, sincere, respectful, and open- ended. 14. BECOME MORE EFFICIENT In addition to increasing your val ue to the company, you'll nee d to find ways to become more efficient. As organizations change a nd evolve over time, improvements in effi ciency almost always coincide. After all, if you're going to take a leadership role, if you're going to handle bigger responsibilities, and if, at the same time, you're going to look for added ways to increase your value to your company, you are going to have to get more efficient or suffer a nervous breakdown. Fortunately, efficiency can be l earned. There's an almost endle ss capacity for human beings to improve upon the way they do things. Whoever said \"necessity is the mother of in vention\" spoke the tru th. When you have so much work to do that you can't handle it anymore by using your present strategies and routines, you will quickly become an innovator. 15. LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS Two very common mistakes people make when undergoing organizati onal change are: 1) they try to cope on their own; and 2) they fail to benefit from the experiences of others. With the rapid pace of organiza tional change today, thousands o f people have faced circumstances similar to yours. Some of your friends, relatives, and other acquaintances have probably struggled with similar difficulties. Talk to these experienced people . Pick their brains. Find out w hat other people in similar companies are doing to deal with downsizings or expans ions. Read books and articles. L isten to audiotapes on coping with organizational change. Attend lectures and workshops given by prominent people locally or around the country. Get involved. Get creative. Learn from others' mistakes and suc cessful solutions. Don't just sit there and suffer quietly. Reach out for support a nd you will eventually find it. 16. RISE TO THE CHALLENGE Instead of viewing your particular situation as a problem, see if you can view it as an exciting challenge instead. Remember, change is inevitable, but being stressed by change is not. It all depends on how you look at change and how you choose to respond to it. In every organization undergoing change, some people rise to th e challenge, while others don't and get left behind. Which group do you want to be in? Think about it seriou sly. You've got the power and ability to end up in either one. 17. NEVER BECOME COMPLACENT Once you've survived and successf ully adjusted to a major organ izational change, avoid the trap of becoming complacent. Future changes will probably occur, and you should be prepared for them--emotionally, physically, and also financially. Keep developing your skills and enhancing your value to the com pany. Learn to do as many jobs as you can. Take on a leadership role in hav ing your agency be successful. Take pride in helping others below you. And alway s let your superiors know you are ready and willing to hel p out whenever the need might arise. 492 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Changes, Challenges, and Choices There is not doubt that these are challenging times for our sta te and city governments and for those who work in it. Did you ever notice how some folks eagerly take on new cha nges, challenges, and choices while others seem to back out, hide out, and burn out during the same times? Res earch shows that the difference between those who thrive and those who \"dive\" o ften depends on three characte ristics: commitment, control, and challenge . Those with a sense of commitment are first knowledgeable and aware of who they are, what they b elieve in, and what goals they have. They are able to articulate these an d willing to change them based on new insights. Second, they live their life in congruence with their goals and beliefs. In short, they do what they believe and believe in what they do. The characteristic of control is defined by the ability to realize that there are some thing s we have control over and some things we do not. Those who thrive are able to focus their energy on those things they do have control over rather than futilely trying to change things they have no control over. \"Circle of Influence vs. Circle of Concern\" The third characteristic, challenge , is exemplified by those who possess a certain level of vigor, a willingness to learn and try new things, an ab ility to work through problems, a knack of finding alternative solutions, and an understanding that \"If I fail in what I do, I have not failed i n who I am.\" For a sense of challenge we need to cultivate professional \"spe cial friends.\" We all have one or two special friends in our personal lives w ith whom we can be perfectly honest and from whom we can get honest feedback. They help us learn about ourselves and become more self-aware. We need to do the same in our professional lives - if not with one special friend, then with a professiona l support group. Each day, each week, each month we need to take a brief timeout - a sort of \"stretch break\" - with the purpose of evaluating how our current activities jive with our current goa ls. Doing so gives a change to redirect our activities and be better able to fell that what we are doing is congruence with what we b elieve or what we have set for goals. If we want to have a better sense of control, then we also need to have a better sense of humor. Humor helps us physiologically, psychologically , and emotionally. We can main tain our sense of humor by seeking out others who have a sense of humor. We can force ourselves to do those things which, at the mo ment we may not feel like doing, but nonetheless, we know we will enjoy. The respon sibility to keep the humor batteries charged is ours. We can maintain a better perception of control by maintaining a better sense of perspective. It is tempting to try and convince ourselves and others that the trying times or issu es we are facing are the most catastrophic. Yet, by doing so, we cause ourselves to feel powerless to deal with them. We need to ask ourselves how awful the current situation is compared to how awful it could be. We hav e much more control than we realize we do. The key is to use it. We can feel as controlled by our own habits, rituals, routines, etc. as we can by any outside force, yet we have complete control over these. Either use the control or lose the control. To maintain a sense of challenge we need to maintain our creati vity, for creative people cope with trying times and change more successfully. We can give ourselves permission to be creative and seek out those who are creative in order to produce a sy nergistic effect as we build o ff each other's creativity. By constantly looking for alternatives verses a single \"mag ic\" answer we can learn to thi nk of myriad of things we could do instead of merely the one thing we \"should\" do. Maintaining a sense of challenge includes a willingness to take risks. We need to practice the skill of risk taking li ke we do any other skill. Doing so teaches us that the world will not end should we not be completely successful, and when we do succ eed that the perceived \"danger\" is often much greater than the actual danger. 493 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Finally, we can help maintain our sense of challenge by continuing to learn. Learning is a naturally invigorating experience. It allows us to experience people, places, events, etc. that we have never experienced before. It is said that mental health is not the absence of problems, b ut rather the ability to deal with problems. The same holds during these times in state/county/city government. Being able to continue coping as individuals and as a government means being able to: 1. Maintain a sense of commitment to who we are and what we are doing; 2. Maintain a perception of control verses the misperception that we are being controlled; and 3.

Harvard's Executive Sessions are a convening of individuals of independent standing who take joint responsibility for rethinking and improving society's responses to an issue. Members are selected based on their experiences, their repu - tation for thoughtfulness and their potential for helping to disseminate the work of the Session. In the early 1980s, an Executive Session on Policing helped resolve many law enforcement issues of the day. It produced a number of papers and concepts that revolutionized policing. Thirty years later, law enforcement has changed and NIJ and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government are again collaborating to help resolve law enforce - ment issues of the day. Learn more about the Executive Session on Policing and Public Y 2 0 1 2 Introduction Effective police leaders become adept at respond - ing to challenge. Like other organizations, police agencies must balance constancy and predict - ability with adaptation and change. Even as they strive to standardize operations, most police leaders recognize the fluid context in which their agencies operate. They also understand that there are forces to which police organizations must adapt and evolve in order to remain effective in a changing world. It is those forces that drive organizational change and create new models for conducting the business of policing. Several of the papers written in conjunction with the Executive Session on Policing confront these forces for change. Bayley and Nixon (2010) describe \"the changing environment\" for polic - ing, including the rise of terrorism, new patterns of immigration, and increased accountability for police. Gasc\u00f3n and Foglesong (2010) describe the new budget realities that shape police agencies and challenge the premise of public policing.

New Perspectives in Policing Bulletin. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice, 2012. NCJ 238338. 2 | New Perspectives in Policing of a \"new\" police professionalism to respond to changes in the context for policing today (Stone and Travis, 2011; Sklansky, 2011). This paper builds on the discussion of forces for change in police organizations. Our central the - sis is that policing, like other industries, faces an urgent need for a new way of managing and lead - ing police agencies that is being driven by two interdependent shifts in the world of work: the rise of a \"new generation\" of police officers; and significant opportunities \u2014 and challenges \u2014 in the availability of new technology. These two factors are linked to other changes within the broader context of policing, such as globaliza - tion, heightened budget concerns, the changing nature of crime, and the other forces that bear on the work of policing. By focusing our attention on these two key related changes in the work and management of policing, we hope to shed light on the broader challenges that confront police leaders and police organizations. Beginning with a brief review of the rise of the traditional organizational model, we examine the new generation of \"contemporary employ - ees\" and the related use of emerging technology that is integral to the lives of this new generation. We examine their impacts on multigenerational police organizations and conclude with lessons from other management fields as well as sugges - tions for preparing police leaders to confront the challenges of a changing world within the police environment. The Growing Irrelevance of Traditional Organizational Models The way in which many police leaders manage is linked to the way police agencies are orga - nized. Like most modern work structures, police agencies trace their roots to the first industrial revolution and the industrial organizations that were the foundation of manufacturing indus - tries. Platoons of officers, organized under shift sergeants with a command staff above them, bear a striking resemblance to industrial man - ufacturing plants and the organization of work on the shop floor. Even the rise of police unions parallels the rise of industrial trade unions, shop stewards and organized labor in other industries. Like the auto assembly plants of Henry Ford, tra - ditional police agencies are characterized by a hierarchical authority structure that clearly distinguishes decision-makers from line staff, emphasizes adherence to principles of structure over flexibility, and prizes uniform operations and interchangeability across staff positions. Police organizations are further constrained by their reliance on a paramilitary model (Geller and Swanger, 1995) that does not adapt well to exter - nal demands for change or accountability. Police unions add to this mix of outdated priorities through work rules and contractual requirements that can be unyielding. Thus, despite substantial gains by police in crime fighting, there is still a widespread tendency to adhere to outdated and ineffective management practices. For example, 498 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 3 even the way a department's overall effectiveness is traditionally measured and tracked \u2014 typically some aspect of response time or fulfillment of calls for service \u2014 lacks relevance to current expecta- tions of and for police. As police agencies continued to incorporate the management models of the industrial age, the world of work began to shift away from these models. Starting in the late 20th century, driven in part by the need to compete in a global economy, manufac - turing organizations have increasingly abandoned the traditional industrial work model and have sought new work structures that maximize effi - ciency (and profitability) and provide a more flexible structure that is less shackled to antiquated notions of work and management. Capitalizing on a 21st century workforce with skills and expecta - tions that are as novel as the manufactured goods they produce, these new management models pay less tribute to the bureaucratic hierarchy of the old industrial plant and more attention to the inclu - sion of workers in a broader range of operations and policies. Senge and colleagues (2008) frame this transition as realistically questioning the wis - dom of protecting the ways of the past in contrast to creating a different future. As business and industry have moved away from older industrial systems built on hierarchies, tra - ditions, and formal rules and procedures better suited to another era, police agencies in the 21st century are in need of a similar revolution in their organization, leadership and management models. Two sweeping changes serve as primary drivers for this revolution in policing: the new generation of police officers and an expanded use of technology innovations. New Generation Officers and Technology Innovations: Drivers of Change in Policing New Generation Police Officers \u2014 Contemporary Employees Popular literature describes generational cohorts in different ways. Although there tends to be gen - eral agreement on the Baby Boomer cohort, labels applied to younger cohorts vary from Generation X and Generation Y to Millennials, Gamers or the Net Generation. Given that all of these cohorts may exist simultaneously within a police department, in this paper, we elected to use the term \"contemporary employee\" as a way to capture distinctions between this latest generation of officers and all those in the organization who preceded them. Those who hire, train, supervise, manage and lead them comprise the established organization of the police agency made of a mix of earlier generations. Together, these earlier generations have blended fairly successfully within the traditional industrial style of police orga - nizations. Not so the generation of contemporary employees. Beck and Wade (2004) and Hicks and Hicks (1999) describe contemporary employees as conscientious, unselfish and independent in their thinking while also more tolerant of differences than those of other generations. In contrast to descriptions suggesting that contemporary employees are self-centered with a sense of entitlement, Alsop (2008) describes them as altruistic, wanting to make the world a better place, and interested in making a positive impact in their world. He also characterizes them 499 of 7444 | New Perspectives in Policing as highly collaborative, team-oriented, and as having a \"hands on\" attitude, wanting to be involved and wanting to \"give back.\" Some of their strongest skill sets include the abilities to multitask, articulate career values, understand the capacities of technology and appreciate diver - sity as strength. We also examined studies from the Pew Research Center (2007) whose findings demonstrate that groups born in the 1980s and early 1990s are more accepting than their elders of issues such as affirmative action, immigration and the appropriate scope of government, as well as far more supportive of an ethnically diverse workforce and responsive to concerns of diverse communities. We see these characteristics as extremely desirable for police officers but the challenge is whether current police organizations can capitalize on these attributes. Despite desirable attributes, both research and practice describe contemporary employees as often lacking certain essential work attributes. For instance, they may need help with focusing on single issues and seeing projects through to the end. As such, they are strong candidates for mentoring, coaching and training to help them see and reinforce how their place in the organi - zation can help meet their personal goals and objectives. In this regard, meeting their early work development needs will require approaches that are quite different from those of their mul - tigenerational supervisors. Yet, the supervisory group will be key to retaining this younger cohort in the organization by creating a work environ - ment that allows their attributes to flourish. Their retention will be important to the stability of the organization and to future organizational leadership. Beyond differences in personal characteristics, the contemporary employee also brings life - style changes to the workplace that may conflict with traditional law enforcement practices and present challenges to the commitment to 24-7 public safety coverage. These changes include: placing a greater value on balancing work and family, experiencing comfort with questioning authority and challenging the traditional chain of command, demanding ongoing performance feedback, expecting transparency and timely out - come measures that show what is working, and relying on instant feedback from electronic com - munication and social networking. All these set contemporary employees apart from those who have long subscribed to, or accepted, the para - military organizational model and a lifestyle that prioritized work over other elements of their lives. One way this dynamic can be observed is in the context of collective bargaining. Both unions and managers face a new prioritization of issues and demands based upon the desires of today's younger workforce. Rather than emphasizing the traditional \"meat and potatoes\" bargaining issue of wages, public safety collective bargain - ing agreements now often hinge on issues that relate to scheduling, hours of work and overtime. For example, the most recent labor agreements between the city of Chicago and its police unions hinged on the adoption of new scheduling lan - guage that incorporated both 10-hour workday 500 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 5 as questioning the status quo and reshaping the bureaucracy. They seek to make a difference and to help the government do better, citing response to disasters as but one example. The full impact of contemporary employees cur - rently remains uncertain and is a topic ripe for research. However, it is clear that they present challenges to police leadership that raise ques - tions as to their influence. Will the new generation, like those before it, need to change in order to fit into the prevailing police culture, or will the traditional structure and the culture of polic - ing need to change? Within that context, does the new generation of contemporary employees present a crisis for policing or an opportunity for fundamental change? Driver of Change \u2014 Technology Innovations We identify the second primary driver of change in policing as the rise of technology and its influ - ences on organizational behavior, crime trends, individual work behavior and personal life styles. Beyond trends in the economy and shifts in industrial management, changes in American policing are further embedded in social transi - tions that have been facilitated by innovations in technology. Some examples are seen in the closures of certain types of businesses such as bookstores, record stores, and camera shops; failures of major newspaper companies; and the significant downsizing of U.S. Postal Service operations \u2014 all reflecting changes in commu - nication brought about by technology. Other changes have become familiar symbols of mod - ern life such as social media, instant messaging and 8.5-hour workday provisions (Rozas, 2008).1 Similarly, one of the most contentious issues in public safety bargaining across the country has recently become whether, and to what extent, police officers will be compensated for overtime work with time off in lieu of cash. Within the limited context of this issue, a strong difference can be observed between more senior employ - ees' preference for pay versus younger employees' desire to be compensated with time off instead of cash. Further, in response to younger officers' demands for some, if not greater, control over their work schedules some departments have adopted \"flexible time\" scheduling. Such a con - cept was unheard of in American policing even 10 years ago. As would be expected, this new generation dif - fers considerably from those in the ranks at the time of previous Executive Sessions. Whereas we accept that other generations brought new challenges to their organizations, the challenges today seem to be reverberating throughout the private and public sectors, and even the federal government is feeling the impact. Rein (2010) writes that almost one in three new federal work - ers being hired is 29 years of age or younger and is part of the texting generation. Government personnel specialists see these younger workers 1 See Chicago Police Directive E02-01, Work Day Duty Schedules, effective Jan. 6, 2011, which provides for three primary workday duty shifts for sworn officers, an 8.5-hour shift, a 9-hour shift, and a 10.5-hour shift. All shifts include 30 minutes for lunch. Available online: http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives.

Conversely, the latter impact systems and present complications for police, as seen in the already strained broadband demands brought about by the marriage of cell phones, televisions, computers, and an inventory of hand-held, portable Web-connected devices that respond to desires for flexibility, speed, min - iaturization and electronic efficiencies \u2014 trends that are becoming familiar constructs of modern society and embedding technological change into our way of life. But, we also see their influ - ences in other trends such as the recent Occupy Movement activities in cities across the country. Policing needs to be thinking about how to use these shifts to further its operational and organi - zational strategies and how to take advantage of the new skill sets brought to the workplace by the cohort of contemporary employees who are com - fortable in the \"tech\" world that is revolutionizing the way people live and communicate. Already we are seeing some organizational changes, such as some police departments now conducting virtual rollcalls where officers obtain pre-shift briefing information via email or mobile data computers. This mode of information transfer, when offered as an alternative to an in-person rollcall, is often the choice of younger officers who are accustomed to, and in some cases more comfortable with, the tech-based mode of communication. But the \"electronic\" influence goes much further. For instance, three years ago the Los Angeles Police Protective League (LAPPL), the union for the Los Angeles Police Department's rank and file officers, pioneered a Web-based communication system that enabled the union to hold \"virtual\" membership meetings. The LAPPL created its electronic communication system to engage its younger officers. Several other police organizations that are experiencing the challenge of engaging contemporary employ - ees have followed suit. Other departments have assigned their contemporary employee officers to help manage social media for the department, a phenomenon which becomes even more criti - cal at a time of large demonstrations and major events. Inevitably, departments are seeing the need to develop social media policies that govern the appropriate use of social media by the officers themselves. Creating the right balance of preserv - ing evidence and information while protecting the rights of free speech is becoming a new chal - lenge in many departments. In the area of crime control, we again see change driven by technology. Internet crime, identity theft, and cyber influences on crimes such as fraud, stalking, bullying and child pornography represent one way that technology is influencing crime trends. Websites that offer ways to access police scanners through live audio feeds to cell phones, and social media used to agitate groups such as flash mobs represent others. Technology is also impacting changes in traditional street tactics and investigations, along with alterations in traditional crime control and prevention activ - ities. For example, although street robberies may decline when people carry less cash, bank online, use debit cards, or buy and sell on websites such as Amazon and eBay, the increasing use of cell phones and other hand-held communications 502 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 7 and technological devices presents new targets for street robberies. On the upside, police depart - ments are using their own media outlets to get information to the public about developing crime trends or to seek the public's assistance in solving a problem. Other major developments relate to property crime, which is reported to be decreas- ing because of these trends. The changes in the investigation of property crimes are particularly apparent in the use of cellular and GPS technol - ogy to track and recover stolen cars. In addition, the now familiar presence of surveillance cam - eras enhances the potential for identifying suspects in many types of crimes as well as their locations, which makes it more difficult for perpe - trators of organized criminal activity to operate when they run a greater risk of detection. The con - verse is the evidence suggesting that future crime trends will demonstrate less localized crime and far greater incidence of crimes perpetrated by international organizations based in foreign countries such as Russia and China (Clarke and Knake, 2010). As crime goes global, technology will be a pri - mary driver in responding to issues that are far more complex than anything we see today. Accordingly, the generation of the contempo - rary employee may be central to understanding the changes needed to respond to the shifts we have outlined, shifts that will impact organiza - tions, the nature of crime and work behavior. The most recent developments in technology have been an integral part of the lives of the genera - tion of workers now entering policing. They bring with them a sophisticated understanding of how technology could enhance policing, communi - cations and crime control. Their familiarity with technology may hold the promise of new, more effective strategies to combat an array of both old- and new-style crimes and to promote citizen engagement with the police. However, they could also create new demands on multigenerational police organizations and on police leaders. As drivers of change, the cohort of contemporary employees and the seemingly never ending ways to use technology will result in new ways to think about how police organizations function in a changing world. Managing Drivers of Change in a Multigenerational Workforce Many police executives and union leaders devel - oped their careers in earlier times and were influenced by norms established by traditional - ist and Baby Boomer cultures. Although these cohorts have initiated enormous change over the past 40 years and are not resistant to tacti - cal and strategic change, tampering with age-old organizational structures, benchmarks for per - formance, or benefit and reward systems may be hard pills to swallow. Further, in contrast to the private sector, there is no financial incentive to drive changes to traditions. Because they have been trained and educated to survive in a society shaped by industrial markets, some police lead - ers may question the relevance, as well as the wisdom, of supporting change to fundamental organizational structures based on command and control or initiating practices that prioritize the needs of contemporary employees. Common themes noted when discussing contemporary 503 of 7448 | New Perspectives in Policing employees with multigenerational police manag - ers include seeing the new generation as \"whiners\" who lack understanding of the business and have unrealistic expectations. Leaders often see more negatives than positives and ask whether they are simply babysitting kids who just need to grow up. We acknowledge that similar comments have been made about previous generations of police officers. However, Harrison (2007) describes the gap between those in charge and those who fol - low as wider than it has ever been. As a police consultant, he calls on astute police executives to seek ways to bridge that gap and to learn flexibil - ity. His thinking is consistent with what Sullivan (2004) refers to as \"clash points\" that result from applying traditional work standards to employees who have divergent viewpoints about autonomy and supervision. The focus of these discussions generally applies to new recruits, who are defi - nitely different from those of yesteryear, but whose differences are further compounded by personal lifestyle changes as well as changes in the world around us. All present challenges that need to be considered in order to effect a success - ful transition to this new era. Law enforcement has completed one successful transition through their response to the shrink - ing of quality applicant pools, and those efforts provide an apt illustration of the adage that cri - sis presents opportunity for change. Applicant shortages documented by Koper, Maguire and Moore (2001) spawned dramatic changes in police recruitment strategies including: use of cutting-edge advertising, marketing and brand - ing new images of law enforcement as seen on the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) website, providing signing bonuses and financial assistance for relocation expenses, and the proliferation of a variety of Web-based recruiting inducements. Because recruiting a diverse, talented, appropriate future workforce has required new methods, some agencies are loosening rigid acceptance criteria and adopting the framework of a \"whole person\" approach to evaluating candidates (Scrivner, 2005). The next challenge will be to retain those hired in the sys - tem and to prevent their being driven away by rigid traditions and fixed structures. Beliefs that current hiring challenges will dimin - ish because of economic conditions and threats of job loss are becoming less common. Thus, law enforcement will need to maintain a focus not only on recruitment but also on how to retain a new generation of officers within a multigen - erational environment. Profiles of contemporary employees sharply contrast with those of the generational cohorts who supervise and manage police departments and, based upon the authors' collective observation and experience, attempts to embed them in a culture that is out of step with their values and needs only tends to alien- ate them. There is a need to examine further how the police culture can adapt and become more agile while still responding to the ongoing chal - lenges that accompany the expanding complexity of the local law enforcement portfolio. How can it meet demands for calls for service while still engaging the new generation to contribute their knowledge and accept different levels of respon - sibility? These are not easy tasks because of the 504 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 9 multigenerational differences in work ethic and the values endemic to the various generational cohorts that fill police ranks. Profiling the Multigenerational Workforce Distinctions of a multigenerational workforce are described in the following profiles of the American worker (1920-1990) (table 1). The pro - files show a distinct contrast between earlier generations and contemporary employees. The profiles suggest how respective values may play out in day-to-day functioning on the job. Although those represented in the traditional profile have long since retired, their ideas and pervasive influence remain embedded in many of the structural and operational parameters of Table 1.

Sources: Rogler, 2002; Sullivan, 2004; Tulgan, 2000. 2 This point deserves a good deal of consideration within the context of retention, as contemporary employees tend to place greater emphasis on their individual families, friends and hobbies over work and give far more weight to their own profes - sional development and career advancement than they place on organization or employer loyalty.paramilitary public safety agencies. This influ- ence is quite prevalent within police unions, which sometimes struggle to define their value to younger workers who enter the workforce with lit - tle, if any, historical perspective regarding wages, rights and working conditions. In fact, one of the greatest challenges facing police labor organiza - tions today is recognizing the assumptions new members have (i.e., that they will receive fair pay, good working conditions and protective rights). In comparing the generation of contemporary employees with those of the traditional and Baby Boomer groups in policing, it is clear that current generational issues involve more than absorbing new employees with different value systems and learning how to motivate them.2 Rather, they affect the entire organization and 505 of 74410 | New Perspectives in Policing challenge those at all levels of supervision and management. Many of the new generation start their careers with higher levels of education than their superior officers, either by holding college degrees or meeting the requirement for two years of college now in place in many agencies. Certainly, top police executives are also better educated and have greater savvy in managing organizations and providing leadership than at any other time in our history. However, in many organizations first-line supervisors and mid-level managers, probably the most multigenerational group in the organization, have not kept educa - tional pace with their superiors or subordinates. These middle managers often remain married to the paramilitary and command-and-control approaches with employees and can present sig - nificant barriers to change. Consequently, as hiring processes and training academies begin to change to meet the needs of the new generation, supervision practices, move - ment within the organization, and leadership also will need to change. Those changes may be more challenging because they require not only change in practices but also a level of organizational flexibility that has not been part of the command- and-control model embedded in the American policing culture. Although significant progress has been made in police strategies and tactics, American policing still struggles with a 20th cen - tury assembly-line mentality that is dominated by command and control and a rules and procedure approach to performance. As such, organiza - tional flexibility is often not considered an asset and may in fact be interpreted as disarray \u2014an easily understood anathema to most police com - manders and their political bosses. It may be easier for multigenerational manag - ers to criticize characteristics and differences in work habits than to come up with constructive ideas on how to respond to the new generation of contemporary employees and the challenges they present. Criticisms that focus only on what is \"wrong\" may be short on facts and miss the point that contemporary employees bring a lot of what is \"right\" to the workforce. As such, their strengths need to be acknowledged, rather than trying to force them to adapt to a culture that worked for their predecessors but does not fit for them. In fact, that culture may no longer fit 21st century law enforcement practice or com - munity and citizen expectations. Acknowledging strengths, however, may require first confronting existing perceptions. A few examples of how perceptions can be altered come from participants of the Executive Session and other forums where the new generation was discussed. The following significant questions were framed as follows: Are they a generation that expects to be empowered and makes too many demands for information and feedback? Or, is it equally likely that they are seeking clarification of roles and responsibilities but in ways that are perceived as challenges that make supervisors uncomfortable? Do they want an easy, lucrative ride? Or, are they seeking meaningful work and the opportunity to advance? 506 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 11 Are they risk averse and hesitant to go \"hands on\"? Or, are they using sensible risk management? Do they expect ongoing accolades for work? Or, are they seeking honesty and authenticity from superiors? Does their questioning of rules mean actual resistance? Or, do they want to understand the rules and learn the history as to why the rule exists? Are we experiencing a knowledge drain due to Baby Boomer retirements? Or, does the new generation bring an infusion of new and diversified knowledge that needs to be exploited? Focusing on negative laundry lists of what may actually be misperceptions is not productive in any analysis. Instead, police leadership must position itself in a way that affords every oppor - tunity to tap into valuable new knowledge that contemporary employees bring to the workplace. Failure to recognize these opportunities is likely to lead to situations that will impact their reten - tion and could risk losing the best of the next generation of leadership. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the area of how technology is changing policing. Rethinking Police Organizations and Accommodating Drivers of Change We have established how new police officers are different from their predecessors and how they have a level of comfort with, and reliance on, technology that can advance the work of the police. How all this merges within the context of an organizational mindset is another matter and presents an important opportunity to begin to rethink police organizations for the future in order to accommodate drivers of change. Within that context, valuable lessons can be drawn from private industry. Private Industry \"Lessons Learned\" The need for support to change organizational mindsets and supervisory practices to accom - modate the contemporary employee can be gleaned from recent \"lessons learned\" in the private sector. In a Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) survey of those in leadership positions, 74 percent of the leaders believed that the generation of employ - ees currently entering the workforce will place unique demands on their organization. Survey findings strongly suggest that contemporary employees will require businesses to go beyond current organizational norms and to develop \"innovational\" cultures and changes to business practices that are compatible with changing com - munication patterns and skills developed in the technology sector (Criswell and Martin, 2007). Erickson (2010) discusses the need for a new generation of leaders in the private sector and contends that they will face unpredictable chal - lenges in an environment of constant change. She identifies \"context creating\" leadership activi- ties that reflect core values of the contemporary employee and which future leaders will need to adopt. \"Context creating\" includes increasing 507 of 74412 | New Perspectives in Policing collaborative capacity and working through networks, asking compelling questions to bet - ter frame the challenges, embracing complexity and welcoming disruptive information, shaping organizational identity, and appreciating diver - sity. Although her work addresses leadership needs in the private sector, it is not unrealistic to consider how, as these values begin to shape leadership throughout private industry, they will also influence policing, and how unique conflicts may occur when the core values of contemporary employees begin to intersect with those of others in the multigenerational workforce. Other private sector lessons relative to organiza - tional change and driven by the contemporary employees include: New skills brought to the job have the potential to change organizations. For example, an automotive survey (KRC Research, 2009) of \"millennials\" examined how they get and use information in their day-to-day lives (social networking, instant messaging, websites, blogs, instant mobile alerts). Survey findings suggested that consumers' desire to be technologically connected has a significant impact on how automobiles need to be marketed to this group in contrast to the types of approaches that were used with their parents. Multigenerational supervisory personnel will need to learn how to communicate with contemporary employees, especially about performance-based issues, if they are to be successful in changing behavior. Many private companies are implementing supervisor training directed at developing listening and critiquing skills, as well as how to provide more frequent performance feedback and not always at the one-to-one level. IBM is urging supervisors not to wait for an annual performance review to give employee performance information. Rather, they encourage supervisors to create ongoing dialogue with employees and to listen to them while using open-ended questions and letting them know what you are learning from them. Both IBM and Accenture Ltd. have developed training programs focused on interactive dialogue as part of critiquing skills. Ernst & Young has created online \"Feedback Zones\" where employees can request feedback at any time. They also assign mentors to new employees (Hite, 2008). Google is providing online \"office hours\" where any employee can pitch new ideas. They have also created an \"idea listserv\" where any employee can suggest or comment on an idea. This, they believe, is moving their organization towards virtual leadership (Criswell and Martin, 2007). Another CCL online survey of 1,131 global lead - ers addressed the changing nature of leadership and primary challenges faced by management consumers. Among other findings, 65 percent of the respondents believed that there will be a talent crisis in the next five years and identified 508 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 13 talent acquisition and talent development as primary needs. Also cited were needs for greater emphasis on collaboration for developing a capacity to deal with change and for building effective teams (Martin et al., 2007). The above are only a few of the examples that show how private sector industries are changing prac - tices to respond to changing needs. Obviously, they do not function within the confines of civil service agencies so some of their more subjec - tive undertakings may not be feasible within the public sector. However, policing can benefit by adopting some of these progressive ideas, par - ticularly those relating to supervisory training and communication skills. Within that context, IACP is starting to include courses on managing this new generation in their training offerings. Clearly, the best and the brightest of the new gen - eration of contemporary employees need to be retained and groomed for leadership. The case can be made that American policing faces chal - lenges similar to those of the private sector, and that police leadership needs to confront these issues to avoid a critical shortage of effective leaders in the not too distant future. In fact, some police executives have started to do just that and are introducing change in their organizations. Promising Practices From Police Executives Despite a dearth of research that specifically addresses this type of organizational change in policing, American policing is not taking a back - seat in this new era. In fact, some police leaders have started to make changes that address both the needs and the talents of the new generation, such as involving them in community engage - ment and problem solving and encouraging use of social media to get realtime information to the public. For example, online electronic com - munication tools such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are being integrated into many gov - ernment agencies and police organizations and provide new avenues for interacting with the public (Hermann, 2009). At the administrative and operational levels, sub - stantive changes were described in a Roundtable Discussion on New Generation officers that took place in Seattle in October 2008, sponsored by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, U.S. Department of Justice. Of the 25 police exec - utives who participated, many expressed growing awareness of the need to change their systems not only to accommodate employees but also to cre - ate more effective organizations. Many are trying new approaches that would have been unheard of just a short time ago. Police executives participating in that discussion agreed on the following practices:3 Creating new processes for recruit orientation that devote significant time to the \"front end\" of the system similar to college and professional \"first-year experience\" programs designed to prevent attrition. 3 This information has now been summarized in a document funded by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Practitioner Perspectives: Community Policing in a Democracy (Scrivner, 2010). 509 of 74414 | New Perspectives in Policing A statewide law enforcement training program is currently testing a two-week residential pre-academy orientation that involves team- building exercises, leadership, ethics, fiscal integrity and physical fitness. Although this represents a sizable investment in upfront staffing, the program reports that those who are unsuited for the career generally self-select out before they begin the expensive process of training and completing the probationary year only to walk away from the job. Finding ways to allow creative officers to do their best work and encouraging them to use problem-solving approaches and to experiment with technological tools to create more efficient and effective law enforcement responses. Examples of initiating internal changes so that the department is more responsive to line officers are reflected in the following: n Developing targeted training programs to expose officers to specialized training early in their careers. n Creating what one department called \"renaissance\" officers by equipping them with knowledge, and eventually experiences, in a range of different specialties. n Enhancing new officer awareness as to how law enforcement is evolving and the challenges it will present, as well as the opportunity to make a difference.n Creating new and different types of jobs within the profession such as predictive analytics or cybercrime units. n Providing early and in-depth career exposure to the skills that officers will need to develop to function in those new jobs as well as others. Changing discipline systems so that a goal of behavior change is achieved in contrast to the traditional \"days off\" model and with a stronger emphasis on strategic discipline \u2014 which emphasizes strategies to change and correct behavior rather than simply imposing a penalty. Making employees part of the choice to change their behavior and grooming them to accept greater responsibility. Teaching value-based decision-making at the academy rather than focusing only on rule- bound curricula. Incorporating value-based review boards that examine violations through the lens of department values in contrast to violations of specific rules or policies. Creating a different mindset at the executive level and requiring leadership development that stresses the need for different command- level thinking in order to facilitate progress. Pushing leadership down throughout the organization as opposed to being controlled solely by senior staff. 510 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 15 Drivers of Change: Challenge or Opportunity for Police Leadership? Modern police leadership continues to evolve and is introducing new business models that address some of the issues important to a work - force impacted by the contemporary employee cohort and their emphasis on using technology in unprecedented ways. Many police leaders recognize that balancing complex demands is but one role of the modern leader and that mul - tilayered bureaucratic police departments will have to learn to keep pace with information and data that move at the speed of light and with the new technologies that are changing how they do business. Just as private sector entities are being transformed to adjust to their environment, American policing will need to do the same in order to operate in ways that are consistent with the needs of the contemporary employee. This is particularly noted in the instance of union offi - cials, who previously relied on monolithic models of power in negotiation, starting to adopt interest- based negotiation models that allow for win-win bargaining. The result of this shift in bargaining process has given employees (union members) more ownership in the terms and conditions of employment. In these situations, where healthy labor relations exist, a shared process in organi - zational planning is becoming the cornerstone of progress quite in contrast to past union business models. Many police leaders also have developed an appreciation for how organizations can be informed by research that supports different types of law enforcement approaches. Departures from the past include current references to intelligence-led, evidence-based or predictive policing that attempt to introduce greater efficien - cies and enhance effectiveness. These also may incorporate new skills brought to the workplace by contemporary employees or could integrate civilian personnel to reduce the cost impact of sworn officers. Further, the wave of the future for the modern police organization may be reflected in the development of new skill sets such as stron - ger analytic capacity, information technology specialists, forensic computer experts, strategic planners and change management specialists, many of which are consistent with the interests and skills of the contemporary employee. Other adaptations will be reflected in changes in police discipline systems, signifying a shift from harsh punishment that research tells us does not stop dysfunctional behavior to systems based on val - ues, logic and behavior modification. Finally, the mentality of \"do as I say,\" which once worked in factories and paramilitary settings, no longer hits the target, particularly as recruits with high potential whom leaders seek to mentor and retain come into the workforce. We reiterate that a successful response to the changes and challenges we have discussed also will need to start with a change in the middle management (or first-line supervisory) dynamic and build from there. Increasingly, police leadership has veered away from hiring blind, paramilitary followers of decades past and now seeks to attract employees with a strong inter - est in problem solving, often but not always autonomously. These employees have different 511 of 74416 | New Perspectives in Policing expectations and anticipate that they will be mentored and given the dignity, authority and discretion to solve problems. But in many police departments, little or no investment is made in training first-line supervisors in the art and method of mentorship or coaching. Successful organizational leadership in an agency focused on community-oriented or problem-solving policing must incorporate a break from compla - cent first-line supervision and officer evaluation processes that measure job performance based on activity statistics or ticket quotas. Instead, a real investment must be made in training for supervisors that emphasizes guidance through mentoring. Leadership through instruction, edu - cation, logic, and persuasion are the \"power tools\" of contemporary police leadership ... not \"do as I say\" ... and they are consistent with the needs of the new generation of contemporary employees. Preparing Police Leadership for the Future \u2014 Requisite Skills Given our emphasis on police leadership chal - lenges being driven by the growing cohort of contemporary employees and the expansion of technology in the world around us, the ques - tion follows: What type of leadership skills will be needed for law enforcement agencies of the future? The following provides a brief profile of how we see a modern police leader and the requisite skills that will be needed to advance the organization and meet challenges. Some of the information is derived from organizational theorists; some comes from discussions with Executive Session participants and other police leaders. All of these skills and characteristics have strong implications for the future of police management training. Global perspective. In an era where tech- nology, financial institutions and terrorist threats are constructed on global landscapes, a greater awareness and knowledge of global history, and connectivity to global issues and their impact on crime, will all be necessary in that crime of the future will also be global and supported by a strong technological base (Clarke and Knake, 2010). Creativity. Leadership authority Ronald Heifetz (1994) contends that problems that are outside the norm necessitate a thought process that demands creativity and the total re-engineering of new concepts. Future police executives will need to adapt that type of thinking and be creative to an extent not needed in the past. They will need to be \"big picture\" executives. Change management and adaptivity. Because the next two decades will be driven by dynamic changes to the traditional concepts of policing, future police executives will need to be aware of global shifts and technology trends and have the ability to adapt and move organizations to end points, more so than those of the past. As with other organizations, globalization, new technology and greater transparency have combined to \"upend the business environment\" (Reeves and Deimler, 2011). Hence, management training will need to focus on the skills needed for big picture thinking and change management in order to 512 of 744Police Leadership Challenges in a Changing World | 17 prepare leaders to function in the changing environment. Comfort in the midst of independence. Effective future leaders will need to be at ease in an organization where workers demand autonomy and opportunities to be creative, signature requirements of the new generation of contemporary employees. Hence, police organizations will need to flatten to allow for creating the balance between creative autonomy and the formality of traditional culture. Strong oral and written communication. Because change will be so rapid, the contemporary executive will need to develop strong oral communication skills in order to explain complex theories in simple forms. Persuasion methods should be encouraged for purposes of allowing input and developing logical dialogue. This fine art of communication will be required in a culture where attribution questions are focused on those in authority. Mastering technological trends. The future police executive will need to anticipate how current changes in technologies will intersect with constitutional law and must prepare the agency to respond appropriately (i.e., the ability to see through walls and the concurrent impact on illegal searches and seizures; managing access to multiple databases to solve crimes while protecting sensitive information). Given these trends, it is likely that the very nature and fundamental concepts of what law enforcement does will continue to be vigorously questioned and debated. Police leadership will need to be prepared to respond appropriately to concerns raised by these practices. Architect of change. The contemporary leader will need to be a trendsetter and innovator. Taking lessons learned from other industries will be important to creating and using societal and organizational shifts in law enforcement in ways not previously contemplated. An understanding of research methods. Successful contemporary leaders must become comfortable with research analysis and interpretation. Basic criminological theory and understanding should be supplemented by exposure to other fields of study, which may include holding progressive and advanced degrees. Moreover, stronger partnerships with colleges and universities will be required to facilitate ongoing, in-depth empirical research on operational methods and decision-making. Striking a balance: Integrating strategy, culture and political influences. The nexus of strategy, culture (both internal and external) and political influences was identified as critical to contemporary leadership by a group of prominent police executives. They framed this nexus as key to the executive mindset that is needed for solving problems, circumventing obstacles to performance, and moving organizations forward in a changing world. Considering new police strategies, reviewing use of best practices, managing community-police crises, and retaining new 513 of 74418 | New Perspectives in Policing talent brought by the contemporary employee to the organization all can be considered within this intersecting, dynamic framework. It provides something of a roadmap that incorporates strategy, culture and political influences into an executive model to help clarify where the organization needs to go to accomplish its mission; or, in other instances, what an organization needs to do to recover from crisis (Scrivner, 2008). Conclusions The profession of policing and public safety continues to confront new challenges that also present a wealth of opportunities for initiating substantive change. As evidenced by the work of the Executive Sessions, police leadership today may be better positioned to address them in ways that benefit the field and that maintain American police leaders' position at the forefront of the profession. Today's police leaders were trained to operate in an ingrained bureaucratic structure. This train - ing, the resulting organizational culture and fixed attitudes present conditions similar to those in the auto industry a few short years ago. Many police leaders, however, have seen the need to alter these traditions in favor of becoming more flexible and adaptive to the world we currently live in and to the people with whom we work. Their efforts will be the key to preventing systemic failure in policing similar to what has occurred in some segments of the private sector. Today's lead - ers and tomorrow's visionaries will continue to need a strong foundation anchored in the values of credibility, truth, high ethical standards and sound morals. Further, leaders will always be selected for their abilities to make sound, cogent and well-thought-out decisions. Answering the wakeup call to continuously adapt and improve the profession will be one of those decisions. References Alsop, Ron. 2008. The Trophy Kids Grow Up. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

Kranda (Retired), Fairfax County Police Department, Fairfax, Virginia Mentoring is a mutually beneficial relationship in which a know ledgeable and skilled veteran officer (a mentor) provides insight, guidance, and developmental opportunities to a lesser-skilled and experienced colleague (a prot\u00e9g\u00e9). Mentoring is not a new concept or practice. History abounds with examples of professional mentoring. Mentor was the name of the man charged with providing wisdom, advice, and guidance to King Odysseus's son in the ancient Greek epic The Odyssey. During the Middle Ages, boys se rved as apprentices to masters in a craft or trade while gaining skills to eventually qualify as a journeyma n and, finally, as a master. During this time, the mentoring relationship ensured th e continuity and quality of th e craft handed down to the next generation. The modern concept of mentori ng, which has recently been used t o recruit and retain new employees effectively in business and academic instituti ons, provides the law enforce ment community with an opportunity to engage and anchor new employees at a time when industry competition fo r these employees is at an all-time high. There are three primary goals of a mentoring relationship: to p romote professional growth, to inspire personal motivation, and to enhance effectiveness of police service. 526 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Mentoring Benefits for Mentors Mentors can enjoy the following benefits: A personal sense of reward for spotlighting and developing tale nt Enhanced knowledge of department policies and procedures as well as contemporary policing practices Paving the way for others, thereby leaving a positive legacy in the agency A reputation as a valuable member of the organization and the r espect of colleagues Varying perspectives from prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, which foster creativity \"Getting by giving\" Frequently, people become mentors because they were previously prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who experienced the rewards of a mentoring relationship. Others b ecome mentors because they wish a mentor had been available to them during their career. Whatever the reason, mentors derive great satisfa ction from seeing a colleague succeed with their help. Mentoring Benefits for Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Of course, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s also benefit from the mentoring process in several ways: An increased likelihood for succes s; mentors help prot\u00e9g\u00e9s gain competency and avoid failure Assistance in setting goals and charting career paths Encouragement and opportunities for new experiences and profess ional growth Help in avoiding pitfalls and learning through real-life exampl es An enhanced feeling of worth to the mentor and the organization A boost in self-confidence resulting from positive feedback on their achievements Many successful people attribute their achievements to a mentor ing relationship. Many \"repay\" their debt to the mentor and the organization by going on to serve as mentors themselves. When mentoring begins with new employees, it is the first step toward institutionalizing mentoring in the department. Formal versus Informal Mentoring Some police organizations have im plemented new-hire mentoring p rograms as a method of reducing employee turnover, whereas others have chosen the more common method of informal mentoring. Examples of informal mentoring have occurred throughout the history of policing. Typ ically, veteran officers encourage friends or acquaintances to apply for positi ons in their departments. As a result, there is a natural tendency for these veteran officers to encourage , support, and give information to their friends during the hiring and training period. This informal mentoring relationship provides an advant age to new employees by helping them feel connected to their new departments. However, there are some distinct benefits of formal mentoring. The best reason for crea ting a formal process is that it affords every employee the opportunity and benefit of m entoring and promotes loyalty and inclusiveness within the organization. In add ition, a formal mentoring proces s identifies goals, creates structure and procedures, and defines mentor /prot\u00e9g\u00e9 roles and responsibiliti es. Although the program requires time to plan and initiate and requires some ove rsight, it often results in e nhanced employee self-esteem and a perception that the agency is a great place to wor k. Whether launching a formal men toring program or creating a mentoring environment in an organization, mentoring can improve and promo te any leadership initiative. Institutionalizing Mentoring: A Step-by-Step Plan For law enforcement agencies in terested in improving effective recruitment, retention, and personnel leadership development by initiating a ment oring program, a suggested step-by-step mentoring plan follows. 1. Teach mentoring skills to all employees (sworn and civilian) 527 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 2. Chief must demonstrate and support total agency mentoring 3. Establish formal new hire mentoring process A. Appoint mentor coordinator B. Identify employee work group C. Draft mentoring policies and procedures D. Define mentor/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 roles and responsibilities E. Select and train mentors F. Pair mentors and new hires G. Evaluate and fine-tune process 4. Create career development mentoring system A. Identify command coordinator B. Identify supervisory work group C. Draft career planning/goal-setting policies and procedures D. Define mentor/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 roles and responsibilities E. Select and train mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s F. Pair mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s G. Evaluate and fine-tune process 5. Succession planning A. Chief mentors commanders B. Commanders mentor supervisors C. Supervisors mentor line employees D. Officers/civilian employees mentor colleagues and new hires 6. Chief grooms and prepares successor What Mentors and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Do Before defining the roles and responsibilities of mentors, the goals of the mentoring process should be understood by mentors and prot\u00e9g \u00e9s. For example, consider a new-hire mentoring process. Is the goal to provide a welcoming atmosphere that will anchor the new employee to the organization, to provide a career development mentoring process to help employees identify and map out career targets, to begin a mentoring program that ensures the continuity and quality of the next gen eration of police leaders, or all three of these? Once mentoring program goals are identified, the roles and resp onsibilities of mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s must be established in order to avoid c onfusion and potential conflict as well as to maximize program success. Mentors have the following responsibilities: Encouraging and modeling value-focused behavior Sharing critical knowledge and experience Listening to personal and professional challenges Setting expectations for success Offering wise counsel Helping to build self-confidence Offering friendship and enc ouragement Providing inf ormation and resources Offering guidance, giving feedback, and cheering accomplishments Discussing and facilitating opportunities for new experiences a nd skill building Assisting in mapping a career plan The mentoring relationship requires commitment and shared responsibility for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s as well. The partners should discuss mutual roles and responsibilities at the beginning of the relationship and review them periodically as necessary. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' responsibilities are as follows: 528 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Clearly defining personal employment goals Taking directions given and following through on them Accepting and appreciating mentoring assistance Listening to what others have to say Expressing appreciation Being assertive and asking good questions Asking for help when needed Sharing credit for a job well done with other team members Respecting mentors' time and agency responsibilities The Chief As Mentor: The Knoxville, Iowa, Model Successful leaders are often successful mentors. In most large agencies, line employees seldom have direct interaction with their chief, but in smaller agencies, employees interact with their chief on a daily basis. As a result, chiefs of smaller agenci es can enhance their leadership effectiveness by being personally committed to mentoring and by encouraging a total agency mentoring environme nt. As the lead agency mentor, chiefs can model employee value to their a gency by supporting employee career planning, by providing opportunities for training, and by encouraging l earning and skill building. The K noxville, Iowa, Police Department, an agency of 18 sworn officers, serves as a m odel in this article for agenci es embracing formal mentoring. Goal-setting and career-planning sessions with the chief at the Knoxville Police Department are usually conducted once a year with each sworn and civilian employee. Th ese sessions are intended to promote employee growth and skill development. The chief has seen reduced emplo yee turnover and increased empl oyee loyalty since instituting this practice. These sessions may occur with great er frequency for some employ ees when goals are achieved quickly, or with less frequency for employees who have not met short-term object ives. Because employee goals and interests continually evolve, the periodi c review and monitoring of employee progress is vitally important to maintaining this program. These goal-setting and career development meetings with departm ent employees are flexible in structure because the sessions must be tailo red to meet the age, personal ity, and work/life experiences of each employee. By making the individual sessions informal and relaxed, the pro cess can be an insightful and rewarding experience for both the employee and the chief. The skill of active listening is an essential component of the success of the mentoring process. The Knoxville Police Department employee goal-setting and caree r-planning process requires two meetings. The first meeting is preparatory: the chief explains the initia l phase of the process, during which employees identify and clarify their current and future career goals. Employees are encouraged to consider the present and future in terms of short-term, i ntermediate, and long-term goal s. Their goals must be achievable but challenging. If the goals are achieved with little effort, they are seldom l ong lasting or fulfilling. Next, employees are asked to conduct a self-assessment in which they identify personal strengths and weaknesses. This assessment provides both employees and the chi ef with additional insight into the employees' disposition and temperament. Employees are required to document their goals succinctly on one typewritten page. During this stage, the chief offe rs to include the spouse or si gnificant other of each employee in the goal-setting and personal examination process if the employee would like tha t person included. This is an example of the \"family-centered\" policy embraced by the Knoxville Police Depar tment. A week later, the chief conducts a second m eeting during which the employee's one-page goal statement is reviewed and discussed. After reviewing the goal statement, the chief prepares questions and feedback for 529 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] clarification, then offers his recommendations for achieving th e goals. The chief and employee mutually decide upon a timeline for the review a nd accomplishment of the goals. The department retains a copy of the typewritten goal statement for reference when planning and scheduling training opportunities or specialized assignments for employees . As agency leader, the chief believes he is responsible not only for influencing and directing but also for establishing an environment for positive growth by providing resources, job-rela ted opportunities, and experiences that will improve employees' personal and professional skills. As their mentor, the chief strives to meet employee training and assignment \"wants\"; however, greater emphasis is placed on meeting individual training and assignment needs. The chief and his employees determine the training and assignment needs based upo n the personal assessments completed with the chief, employee work experi ence, previous assignment evalua tions, education completed, and the employee goal plans. The chief provides private-sector customer service and communic ation skills training as ways to augment agency educational opportunities beyond the traditional police training topics. Local ba nks and other businesses provide contemporary service-based training for the agency's sw orn and civilian employees. Private-sector customer service and communications training provides police em ployees with the opportunity to interact with citizens and members of the bus iness community. This cross-trai ning builds agency and community cooperation and supports broad-based perspectives of work, service, and com munity, an environment the chief feels is essential for law enforcement professionals. The model of employee goal setting and career planning in Knoxv ille may not work successfully for everyone. This model requires time and comm itment to agency growth and im provement by both chiefs and employees. The program has worked to the advantage of the Knoxville Police Department and community. The commitment of time and attention to his employees pays off for the chief through successf ul labor negotiations, sustained employee loyalty, and low turnover rates. This model is particularly benef icial to recruiting and retaini ng new employees who are focused on work and family relationships as well as the development of job skills. Although the smaller-agenc y chief may have the advantage of knowing and working closely with employees, elemen ts of this program and the chief/mentor model can be successfully implemented in agencies of any size. Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between a m entor and a field training of ficer for new employees? The roles of the mentor and field training officer (FTO) are distinct yet complementary. FTOs train and develop effective police officers. As required during field training, FTOs evaluate recr uit performance on a daily basis. In contrast, the role of mentors is supportive and relational. Mentoring is not performance evaluation. Mentors are responsible for contacting ne w employees before the agency appointment date and assisting with an effective transition into the police organization by answering questions and serving as a resource for information. Mentors maintain contact with recruits during acad emy training to provide support, guidance, and encouragement. Unlike FTOs, mentors do not evaluate recruit per formance. How do agencies prevent conf lict between FTOs and mentors? The first step in avoiding conflict between FTOs and mentors is for chiefs to demonstrate support of the me ntoring process. Second, the input of some FTOs should be included in the development of the mentor program. The last critical step is to train mentors and FTOs such that they understand the differences in their roles. Periodic review and oversight by a mentor coordinator will help diminish the potential for conflict. Is the mentoring process lengthy and a drain on staffing requir ements? The time devoted to the mentoring relationship is based on the need s of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. For exa mple, new em ployees who are area natives will have fewer needs than employees hired from outside the area. New hir es need time to adjust to the police department and the community. It is important for agencies to be flexible and support mentors in providing this valuable 530 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] assistance to new employees. The benefits in terms of employee retention, enhanced morale, and agency loyalty far outweigh the marginal commitm ent of staff time. The mentori ng function can be accomplished while mentors are on duty in conjunction with fulfilling primary duti es.

Your highest response will indicate which motivational personality type you are (according to McClelland's needs model). TOTAL: _____ Achievement _____ Affiliation _____ Power McClelland's Theory of Needs In his acquired-needs theory, D avid McClelland proposed that an individual's specific needs are acquired over time and are shaped by one's life experiences. Most of these n eeds can be classed as either achievement, affiliation, or power. A person's motivation and effectiveness in certain job junctions are influenced by these three needs. McClelland's theory sometimes is referred to as t he three need theory or as the learned needs theory. Achievement People with a high need for ach ievement seek to excel and thus tent to avoid both low-risk and high-risk situations. Achievers avoid lo w-risk situations because the easily attained success is not a genuine achievement. In high-risk projects, achieve rs see the outcome as one of chan ce rather than one's own effort. High achievement individuals prefer w ork that has a moderate probabi lity of success, ideally a 50% chance. Achievers need regular feedback in order to monitor the progres s of their achievements. They prefer either to work alone or with other high achievers. Affiliation Those with a high need for affiliation need harmonious relationships with other people and need to feel accepted by other people. They tend to conform to the norms of their wo rk group. High affiliations individuals prefer work that provides significant personal interaction. They perf orm well in customer service and client interaction situations. Power A person's need for power can be one of two types - personal and institutional. Those who need personal power want to direct others, and this need often is perceived as undesirable. Persons who need institutional power (also known as social power) want to organize the efforts of others to further the goals of the organization. Managers with a high need for institutional powe r tend to be more effective than those with a high need for personal power. 537 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Implications for Management People with different needs are motivated differently. High need for achievement - High achievers should be given challenging projects with reachable goals. They should be provided freque nt feedback. While money is not an important motivator, it is an effective form of feedback. High need for affiliation - Employees with a high affiliation n eed perform best in a cooperative environment. High need for power - Management should provide power seekers t he opportunity to manage others. Motivation Why do we need motivated employees? The answer is survival Motivated employees help organizations survive Motivated employees are more productive Motivated employees reduce absenteeism Motivated employees reduce turnover Motivated employee are happier Why should managers and supervisor motivate staff? Your employees are the key to your success Motivation affects employee performance, which affects organiza tional objectives Motivated employees make your job easier Motivation falls into five categories 1. Understanding the concept of motivations 2. Assessing your approach to employee motivation 3. Identifying the supervisor/managers role in the motivation proc ess 4. Applying motivational techniques (creating the environment) 5. Measuring success Understanding Today's Staff Motivation is directly related to morale Effective supervisors motivate their staff using a variety of incentives and rewards Researchers often divide these into two categories Maintainers Motivators Maintainers Factors that must be kept at a satisfactory level in order for staff to maintain performance Working conditions Organizational policies Job security Pay and benefits Relationships with co-workers Supervision Status 538 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Motivators True motivators are the factors that create an inner desire to work by satisfying certain needs which are important to the individual. Achievement Recognition Satisfying work Responsibility Advancement Growth and training opportunities Motivating Different Age Groups Motivating your staff is complicated further by generational di fferences Veteran/Silent (1927-1945): formality, in-person, respect Baby boomers (1946-1964): primary motivators have been money, p ersonal growth and involvement Gen X (1965-1980): Interested in re warding challenges, personal and leisure time Nexters (1981-2000): achievement and diversity How to Motivate Different Generations Veterans: Personal touch, hand written note rather than e-mail. Honor their work with records of achievement. Live phone call rather than voicemail Boomers: Public recognition, chan ce to prove themselves, ask for input. GenXers: Lots of projects, constant constructive feedback, ask for opinions Nexters: make all opportunities truly equal, open avenues for e ducation, training, skill-building, use mentor programs, use electronic communication (text/email). Create a Supportive Work Environment Expect the best from your staff Expectations of staff + The way you treat them = Staff success or failure Develop a flexible superv ision/management style. Ask yourself: Do you use the same approach in every situation Do you treat everyone the same? Supervisors/managers should treat everyone fairly but not necessarily the same Eliminate barriers to individual achievement Many people who are labeled \"failures\" or \"incompetents\" are si mply being hindered by minor obstacles that supervisors have not recognized. 539 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Ask yourself: Does the person have the knowledge and skills to do the job? Does the person have the necessary tools? If not, it is your responsibility to provide him/her with the n ecessary training, tools, encouragement, etc. Staff need the training, information, tools, and equipment to d o the job and it is your responsibility to make sure they have them. Rewards, Recognition, Reinforcement The most successful reward systems make allowances for individual differences. Reward, recognition, and reinforc ement go hand-in-hand with mot ivation. Encouragement and reinforcement need to be followed with recogn ition and rewards Rather than dangling a carrot or welding a club use more succes sful methods. Power of Recognition: Resentment, low morale, slo w downs, errors, endless gossip, a bsenteeism, and unexplained illness are all signs t hat you or management have b een taking your employees for granted. Ways to recognize employee: Earned praise Recognition for performance Respect Equal treatment Rewards for work well done Tangible evidence of recognition (commendation letters, certifi cates, trophies, plaques, pens, key rings, cups, etc.) Training and development Awards (certificates, employee of the month, etc.) Types of Rewards Informal rewards Saying thank you Post a note Rewards for specific achievements Newsletter recognition Letter signed by the Director, Sheriff, UnderSheriff, etc. Formal awards Match the reward to the person Match the award to the achievement Be timely and specific Let employees reward each other Ideas Written Words Written thank you notes Letter of appreciation in the employee file Handwritten cards to mark occasions Recognition posted on the employee bulletin board Contribution noted in the company newsletter Positive Attention from Supervisory Staff Stop by individual's workstation or office to talk informally Provide frequent positive performan ce feedback-at least weekly 540 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Provide public praise Take employees to lunch Include your employees in decisions you make Encourage Employee Development Send people to conferences and seminars Give employees the opportunity to learn as many skills as they are able to Ask people to present a summary of what they learned Work out a written employee development plan Make career development commitment and a schedule Celebrate successes The Work Itself Provide cross training opportunities Provide more of the kinds of work the employee likes and less o f the work they do not like. Opportunities for empowerment and self-management Ask the employee to represent the department at an important meeting Opportunities to determine goals and direction Participation in idea-generating and decision-making Gifts Company/Agency logo merchandise (shirts, hats, mugs, pens, jack ets) Gift certificates to local stores Placed in a drawing to win a prize Motivational posters Gift baskets Symbols and Honors Framed or unframed certificates Engraved plaques Larger work areas More or better equipment Provide status symbols What Can You Do?

There is a wide range of varying freedom that you can confer on the other person. The more experienced and reliable the other person is, then the more freedom you can give. The more critical the task then the more cautious you need to be about extending a lot of freedom, especially if your job or reputation depends on getting a good result. Take care to choose the most appropriate style for each situation. For each example the stat ements are simplified for clarity; in reality you would choose a less abrupt style of language, depending on the person and the relationshi p. At the very least, a \"Please\" and \"Thank-you\" would be i ncluded in the requests. It's important also to ask the other person what level of authority they feel comfortable being given. Why guess when you can get the other person's view? You don't necessarily need to agree, but you should certainly take account of the other person's opinion. Some people are confident; others less so. It's up to you to agree with the m what level is most appropriate, so that the job is done effectively and with minim al unnecessary involvement from you. Involving the other person in agreeing the level of delegated freedom for any particular responsibilit y is an essential part of the 'contract' that you make with them. 1. \"Wait to be told.\" or \"Do exactly what I say.\" or \"Follow these instructions precisely.\" No delegated freedom at all. 2. \"Look into this and tell me what you come up with. I'll decide. \" This is asking for investigation and analysis but no recommenda tion. 3. \"Give me your recommendation, and the other options with the pr os and cons of each. I'll let you know whether you can go ahead.\" Asks for analysis and recommenda tion, but you will check the thinking before deciding. 4. \"Decide and let me know your decision, but wait for my go ahead .\" The other person needs approval but is trusted to judge the rel ative options 5. \"Decide and let me know your decision, then go ahead unless I say not to.\" Now the other person begins to control the action. The subtle i ncrease in responsibility saves time. 546 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 6. \"Decide and take action, but let me know what you did.\" Saves more time. Allows a quick er reaction to wrong decisions, not present in subsequent levels 7. \"Decide and take action. You need not check back with me.\" The most freedom that you can give to another person when you s till need to retain responsibility for the activity. A high level of confidence is necessary, and you would normally assess the quality of the activity after the event according to overall results, potentially weeks or months later. 8. \"Decide where action needs to be taken and manage the situation accordingly. It's your area of responsibility now.\" The most freedom that you can give to the other person, and not generally used without formal change of a person's job role. I t's the delegation of a strateg ic responsibility. This gives the other person responsibility for defining what projects and tasks are necessary for the management of a particular area of responsibility, as well as the task or proje ct, and how it is to be done and measured, etc. This amounts to delegating part of your job - no t just a task or project. You'd use this utmost level of delegation (for example) when developing a successor, or as part of an intentional and agreed plan to devolve some of your job account ability in a formal sense. The Steps of Successful Delegation 1. Define the task Confirm in your own mind that the task is suitable to be delega ted. Does it meet the criteria for delegating? 2. Select the individual What are your reasons for delegating to this person? What are t hey going to get out of it? What are you going to get out of it? 3. Assess ability and training needs Is the other person capable of doing the task? Do they understa nd what needs to be done. If not, you can't delegate. 4. Explain the reasons You must explain why the job or responsibility is being delegat ed. And why to that person? What is its importance and relevance? Where does it fit in the overall scheme of things? 5. State required results What must be achieved? Clarify understanding by getting feedback from the other person. How will the task be measured? Make sure they know how you intend to decide that the job is being successfully done. 6. Consider resources required Discuss and agree what is required to get the job done. Conside r people, location, premises, equipment, money, materials, other related activities and services. 7. Agree deadlines When must the job be finished? O r if an ongoing duty, when are the review dates? When are the reports due? And if the task is complex and has parts or stages, what are th e priorities? At this point you may need to confirm understanding with the other pers on of the previous points, get ting ideas and interpreta tion. As well as showing you that the job can be done, this helps to reinforce commitmen t. Methods of checking and controlling must be agreed with the other person. Failing to agree this in advance will cause this monitoring to seem like interference or lack of trust. 8. Support and communicate Think about who else needs to know what's going on, and inform them. Involve the other person in considering this so they can see beyond the i ssue at hand. Do not leave the person to inform your own peers of their new 547 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] responsibility. Warn the person a bout any awkward matters of po litics or protocol. Inform your own boss if the task is important, and of sufficient profile. 9. Feedback on results It is essential to let the person know how they are doing, and whether they have achieved their aims. If not, you must review with them why things did not go to plan, and deal with the problems. You must absorb the consequences of failure, and pass on the credit for success. 10 Factors Creating Job Satisfaction: What Motivates Now? by Dr. David Spicer Interesting jobs, security and be ing appreciated are top of employees' lists for crating job satisfaction in today's workplace.

ARTICLE | SUN, 07/24/2011 - 23:00 By Lorri Freifeld If money is the root of all evil, is it also the root of all mo tivation? When talking about workplace performance and training, the experts' consensus is a resounding \"No.\" First, a look at some research: A McKinsey global survey on cash as a motivator found that while performance-based cash bonuses were used frequently (68 percent of respondents), employees sti ll viewed \"praise and commendation from their immediate manager\" as being more effective than cash (67 percent for praise versus 60 percent for cash). (\"Motivating people: Getting beyond money,\" Martin Dewhurst, Matthew Guthridge, and Elizabeth Mohr, McKinsey Quarterly, November 2009). In a LinkedIn survey of 665 respondents, 285 said the motivation of personal satisfaction has the most positive impact on their job performance, followed by potential for career growth (160) and increased compensation. Pay did not make the list of HR Solutions' Top 10 Engagement Dr ivers. Recognition checked in at No. 1, followed by career development , direct supervisor/manager le adership abilities, strategy and mission, and job content. \"The primary value exchange betw een most employers and employee s today is time for money,\" note Tony Schwartz, Jean Gomes, and Cather ine McCarthy in their book, \"Th e Way We're Working Isn't Working: The Four Forgotten Needs That Energize Great Performance\" (Free Pre ss, 2010). \"It's a thin, one-dimensional transaction. Each side tries to g et as much of the other's reso urces as possible, but neither gets what it really wants. No amount of money employers pay for our time will ever be sufficient to meet all of our multidimensional needs. It's only when employers encourage and support us in meeting these needs that we can cultivate the energy, engagement, focus, creativity, and passio n that fuel great performance.\" Tim Houlihan, vice president of Re ward Systems at BI Worldwide, which designs and executes business improvement programs, agrees. \" As an incentive for above-and-be yond effort, cash is hopelessly ineffective. The reason is that cash turns the incentive into a deal\u2014it puts us in a calculative mindset, forcing us to compare anticipated effort with anticipat ed returns in dollars and cent s. If we start thinking about our effort in terms of the cash we could earn and we give any consideration to what we'll spend that cash on, we immediately begin to feel guilty about spending on anything other than the most util itarian items. That leads us to ask ourselves, 'Why should I spend an extra six hours at work this week to pay my V isa bill?'\" In very short order, Houlihan says, we rationalize why it's not a good idea to put in the extra eff ort. \"We'll end up doing w hat we've always done because we'll rationalize (using th e analytical left side of ou r brains) why it's not worth what's being offered to do what's being asked.\" Or think about it this way, Houlihan says: \"Almost every single sales job has a pay-fo r-performance component: The more the rep sells, the more he or she makes. Why aren't 10 0 percent of the reps maximizing their plan if money is such a good motivator?\" That's the crux of the issue: We're not saying money doesn't mo tivate. But it often may not be the top motivator. That means there are other, often more powerful sour ces of motivation that many organizations aren't tapping. 551 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] \"Money is more like unconditional love from our employer\u2014it's n ot a motivating force to get us to go above and beyond the call of duty, to go the extra mile, to really push our limits,\" Houlihan explains. \"Money gets us in the door at the office every morning. But the stimulants tha t get us into high achievement are these: our ability to set challenging goals, our ability to get emotionall y engaged in our work, and our ability to focus. These common tools are available to all, but only the top performers practice them on a regular basis. We can learn them from books and mentors and online learning systems, but until we internalize them, we won't exhibit top performance. In the short term, we can use extrinsic motivators, such as incentives, to help facilitate goal setting, engagement, and focus. Thi s way, the extrinsic motivat ion helps us perform at a higher level, and once we recognize what it takes, we can replicate it more easily.\" Elaine Varelas, a managing partne r at Camden Consulting Group, notes that cash as a mo tivator often depends on how much someone makes: the ratio of the cash incentive vs. their full compensation. For example, she says, if they're earning $50,000 a year, then $100 might not be a big motivator. But $2,500 might be. \"And after a certain threshold of earnings, there are more things to motivate people\u2014fun things such as trips, dinners at expensive restaurants, experiences (i.e., a trip to Disney Worl d with the family and VIP tickets). The VIP treatment may mean more than the actual cash value,\" she explains. \"Coveted items such as tickets to a sporting event or a luxury spa may be mor e welcome and motivational. Peo ple like to say they got these things from their company.\" Learning for Dollars? When it comes to training, the m ost important part of motivating is letting people know what the value of the training is to them personally\u2014will they be more knowledgeable about the stock market; will they learn how to deal with conflict in the offi ce, etc., Varelas says. \"You have to communicate the value of the training\u2014that's where the motivation comes in. T rainers can make things more fu n by giving out $10 coffee shop gift cards or giving out points redeemable for incentives for answering quest ions or coming back the second day, but the big sell is why this training is valuable to them personally.\" Varelas says it really comes down to marketing or selling the t raining program to learners. \"One key part of the marketing is including a participant quote (especially from a s enior person or someone known for not liking training) explaining how valuable the training was to them and what they got out of it,\" she recommends. Learning is an individual matte r and draws upon personal commit ment, interest, abilities, and attitudes to learn and cannot generate identical outcomes in different people just by rewarding them, agrees Roy Saunderson, author of \"GIVING the Real Recognition Way\" and president of th e Recognition Management Institute, a consulting and training firm specializing in helping companies \"get recognition right.\" He says research shows organizational and managerial commitment to learning will enhan ce individual motivation to learn. \"Managers and supervisors actually have the greatest influence on transfe r of learning when they meet with the learner before they start training,\" he notes \"They can clearly convey the benefits from attending and participating in the training. Managers can establish learning goals with the learner and follow up after the course. Practical application of the instruction can occur with specific goals to be carried out following course completion. Social reinforcement and rewards then can be given as warranted.\" When it comes to online training, Chad Hoke, VP of Sales and Marketing at BlueVolt, a provider of online learning management systems (LMSs) for manufacturing, construct ion, and service industries, says he thinks the biggest motivating factor is the inherent desire that most peop le have to master their job or task. \"We consistently find that the top 15 to 20 percent of employees usually will find and complete training on their own, simply because they want to improve, regardless of extra help o r incentives.\" However, he adds, \"the much larger 'middle group' of employees is more likely to get distracted from their goals. This group is very responsive to incentives and rewards that help them get on track with training. Even in these cases, though, the incentives don't have to be rich to be effective.\" 552 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] that rewards learners as they succ essfully complete training through their company's LMS or online university powered by BlueVolt. The $Bl ueBucks program has proven to increase online course enrollments up to 10 times. The partnership gives learners the option to redeem $BlueBucks immediately for a virtual eGift card from retailers such as Foot Locker, Nike, and Amazon.com delivered via e- mail or to a smart phone, and viewed through a secure Web brows er. Learners also can use their $BlueBucks to pay for additional courses offere d in the BlueVolt system, incl uding continuing education courses to keep professional licenses current. Peder Jacobsen, vice president of Learning & Organizational Eff ectiveness at BI Worldwide, recommends first ensuring the training is geared toward the actual skills and behaviors that will change results. \"Just distributing facts in a PowerPoint is not tra ining,\" he says. \"It's like tak ing a new basketball team and training them by giving them a PPT about the rules, then turning them loose in a competitive league. They'll get slaughtered. So first is to change or update the training to align with the ski lls and behaviors that will really get the results you want.\" This is different than aligning training directly to business objectives, he cautions. \"It can be a long leap from an individual course to a division's business objectives. The reco mmended approach takes into account the actual human behaviors that need to change in order to get the perform ance that will achieve the business objectives. It also makes it easier to draw a direct line from the training to the overall business objectives by taking it in steps\u2014rather than one giant leap.\" Second, he says, create the incen tive rules to reward both the learning of the new behaviors (completing the training course) and then applying them on the job. \"One idea to keep costs down is to give a minor incentive here, but use success as a gate o r multiplier for actual busine ss results,\" he suggests. Third, Jacobsen stresses, include the first-line managers. \"No lasting change happens without them. They provide the oversight and accountability. Include them in the i ncentive for successfully completing the training themselves, but also consider giving them an override for each of their employees to successfully complete the training and/or start demonstrating results. This ensures that they make their employees comply. As a variation, you also could use the percentage of their employees to complete training and/or demonstrate the behaviors as a gate to accelerate their normal business results.\" In all these situations, Jacobsen believes, an accumulation sys tem has more flexibility and power than cash or gift cards. As an example, he cites a large telecommunications client that created a voluntary incentive program for training within its customer service/sales employee base. I t piggybacked on its points accumulation system that was in place to motivate sales. If learners completed cour seware and were certified , they received points in their sales reward incentive system. In the spring program, approximately 25 percent of the population voluntarily participated in the training. Certified employees' sales increased 12 percent more in one month than those of non-certified employees. The same program was used again in the fall. This time, it included an incentive for first-line managers, as well as employees. Managers received an incentive\u2014and an override\u2014for e ach employee who reported to them who was certified. Voluntary partic ipation increased to about 50 pe rcent, and month-over-month results were even more dramatic. \"One month after certification,\" Jacobson says, \"certified employees sold 43 percent over baseline, while uncertified reps sold 19 percent less, yielding a whopping difference of 62 percent between certified vs. non-certified.\" Jacobsen does note that while the re is a control group, \"it's a self-selecting system and it can be argued that the best people chose to try to impr ove themselves. However, the im provements listed here w ere measured against their own individual baselines and then averaged.\" Nor does tha t criticism accommodate for such large deviations in performance, he adds. 553 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Linking Recognition and Rewards Research has proven that recogn ition can be a powerful motivato r. That brings up the question: Does tying recognition to cash and other rewards have a bigger impact on m otivation? Rewards, such as cash and tangible reward items, are extrinsic and transactional in nature, Saunderson explains. \"In other words, if you do 'x' t hen you get 'y.' A person knows they will get the reward if they deliver the desired results. Very much like getting paid a wage or salary f or one's job. Recognition , on the other hand, is intrinsic and relational\u2014and is more meaningful in nature. It also is unexpected and influences our emotions, thus impacting us psychologically and emotionally.\" Effective and meaningful recogn ition\u2014appreciation, praise, and social reinforcement\u2014will directly impact the self-esteem and intern al motivation of an individual, Saunderso n says. \"Coupled with fair and justifiable rewards, you have a winning combination.\" BI's Houlihan believes recogniti on is a very sensitive thing an d tying awards to recognition must be done without cash or cash equivalents . \"Imagine yourself getting up from Thanksgiving dinner and wanting to recognize your grandmother for making an amazing meal. You say, 'Grandma, this was fabulous! How does $30 per plate sound to you?' I can guarantee you'd never be ask ed back to Grandma's.\" Or, he says, consider the diffe rence between monetary recogniti on and non-monetary recognition, both costing the same: Scene 1: You want to express your gratitude to your team member, Susan, for completing a task with exceptional quality. You say, \"Susan, you did a great job on th at project. Here's a $5 gift card to Starbucks. Go grab yourself an amazing cup of coffee on the company.\" Or, Scene 2: You say, \"Susan, you did a great job on that project. Let's go down to Starbucks and grab a cup of coffee so we can talk about it.\" \"If you want Susan to remain a n employee, to stay engaged, and to increase her already promising contributions to the company, choose Scene 2,\" Houlihan says. \"If you don't w ant any of those things, choose Scene 1.\" Stumped on Motivation: Just Ask Many managers and organizations find it difficult to determine what the best form of motivation is for their particular employees, especially if members of the workforce ar e at different age and ec onomical stages of their lives. Of course, one of the easi est ways to find out what moti vates people is to ask them, says Saunderson. \"Motivation is an inside job. Only an employee can tell you wha t really motivates them, and each response will be unique per individual. Ask employees what motivates them personally in their life and what would influence them to perform at a higher level for the company. Let them kno w the total rewards options available to you as a manager to draw upon for rewarding desired results.\" These questions can be asked durin g performance reviews and emp loyee engagement surveys. But be careful to avoid asking too many questions and being overwhelmed with data overload, Varelas cautions. \"Figure out what do you need to know now? Where's the pain? Prioritize your ques tions. It also helps to ask open-ended questions as that way people will tell you what they are thinking about.\" Also, she suggests that Sales work with managers to identify pe rks or incentives that might be shared throughout the organization. \"Perhaps they get a luxury box at a sporting event that they invite customers to; if there's an extra seat, that could be given to an employee. Or give people the opportunity to attend an executive dinner. Recognize that networking opport unities some executives might not want to attend might be thrilling experiences for others in the co mpany. For example, CEO luncheo ns usually have 20 empty seats\u2014there might be 'high potentials' at the compa ny who would see this as a net working opportunity and be flattered to be invited.\" 554 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] A Little Appreciation Goes a Long Way By Joe Schumacher For decades, managers viewed money as a powerful productivity m otivator. To get more out of the workforce, you simply paid them more. But this is only part of the story. All of us are motivated by money, but money is only a short-term motivator. Looking over the last few decades, you can see more and more attention shifting up the list on Maslow's hierarchy of needs: We want not only food and health and shelter, but also less tangible rewards such as appreciation and a sense of purpose. Millennial s report less interest in the traditional elements of workplace prestige such as status and \"perks.\" Today, most w orkers seek more intrinsic rewards, such as on- the-job opportunities to do mean ingful, creative, and independe nt work while enjoying a balanced lifestyle and quality of life benefits. If money isn't the main motivator, then what is? What do workers want most from their job and manager? The answer is surprisingly simple. Workers want someone they can wo rk alongside, who is compassionate, and who serves and protects. Someone who understands the complicated al chemy of making people matter. Employees want a manager who leads by example, with integrity a nd a defined purpose. Such a leader brings meaning and direction to the team's work and helps every team m ember continuously improve. Employees want a leader who provides tools, training, trust, technology, and t echniques, as well as opportunities to take initiative, and who galvanizes their team to achieve great resu lts. Workers want to be respected as \"talented,\" to be intellectually challenged, to be given elbowroom to work tow ard their defined purpose with ownership and accountability for the final product. Workers want to be apprec iated and to have their accomplishments acknowledged, to receive accurate and timely performance feedba ck, to work a variety of duties, and to be on a career path with a desirable futu re. Workers don't want to feel like just subordinates, headcounts, or direct reports; they want to be team members and colleagues and rising talents. The most exciting part of this: Almost all these best practices of leadership cost nothing. Small gestures of kindness, gratitude, and appreciation bring the most meaning to workers, at the least cost. So go for it! Commit deliberate acts of thoughtfulness and dish out premeditated acc olades, because it's these best practices\u2014which previous generations' money-or iented managers may have found tr ifling, unattractive, or troublesome\u2014that can lead to leadership success. Quick Tips BI Worldwide Vice President of R eward Systems Tim Houlihan says that while a \"Top 10 list of motivation stimulants will not speak to th e complexities of any given situ ation, including the all-important corporate culture, there are some things to keep in mind,\" including: 1. Help your people set goals. Think short-term goals (30, 60 , or 90 days at a time) rather t han annual goals. The CEO of NetApp, Tom Georgans, said in a radio interview that he sets no more than three goals to achieve every quarter. More than that is too many to f ocus on and longer than that is too difficult to foresee and control. 2. Help your people get engaged. The workplace has a social exchange, as well as a financial ex change. Leverage the social exchange w ith opportunities to develop heal thy relationships with coworkers, and recognize their efforts with non-monetary awards such as smiley faces, thank-you notes, or gifts that do not have explicit dollar values. E dison was already a wealthy m an when he spent several years and exhausted 10,000 prototypes to develop a functioning lightbulb. He was committed beyond the dollar. 3. Help your people focus. Communicate clearly what one or two things you want them to do \u2014help them focus on the most important issues only. Stephen Covey recommen ded we move the boulders first\u2014the sand will fill in the gaps without any effort. Every person's d ay starts with a long list of things to do, and every day ends with a portio n of tha t list unfinished. Help people finish their lists by providing clear direction on what it is they should focus on. That will improve productivity and morale. 555 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 4. Use non-monetary rewards. Our natural inclination to feel guilty about spending hard-ear ned income on luxuries turns any monetary reward into a utilitarian tool, or worse, just plain old compensation. On top of that, monetary awards cr eate a calculative mindset, and we immediately ask ourselves: Is this a good deal? Non-monetary rewards\u2014such as a trip or a toaster or the boss taking us to the coffee shop\u2014 allow our imaginations and emoti ons to get involved without any guilt.

Performance Objectives: By the end of this training, you will be able to pass a writte n exam at or above 80% on the following: Define needs assessment List the different types of techniques to conduct a needs asses sment List the pros and cons of each technique 559 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Needs Assessment After you complete this traini ng, you will have a foundation in the following concepts: How to develop assessment instrum ents such as surveys and questionnaires Understanding where needs assessme nts fit in the project development process Basic steps in conducting needs assessments Needs assessments are used whenever there is a need or a want t hat could be fulfilled by some sort of organizational effort. Let us take a look at where needs assessments fall into the picture from two perspectives: organizational development and instructional design. The organization's mission is elaborated as a strategic plan with regional, state, or local focus. The strategic plan contains appropriate programs and project plans with a local or site-specific focus. Each project plan and the planning process itself focuses on specific local issue(s) and audience(s). To then determine if and where there are issues for which training or other tools and techniques can help, a needs assessment is conducted. Definitions of Needs Assessments A needs assessment is a systemati c investigation of an audience (s) to identify aspects of individual knowledge, skill, interest, attitude and/or abilities relevant to a particular issue, organizational goal, or objective. All effective training begins with needs assessment. The training needs survey mea sures what skills employees have, what they need, a nd how to deliver the right tr aining at the right time. - American Society of Training and Development A Needs Assessment is a systematic exploration of the way thing s are and the way they should be. These \"things\" are usually associated with organizational and/or indi vidual performance. - D. Stout, Performance Analysis for Training, 1995. Needs analysis is an examination of the existing need for train ing within an organization. It is a gathering of data that enables you to make an informed estimate of the chang es desired or demanded by those organizations. - Stuart Dalziel , Planning and Managing Training and Development Needs assessment is performed to determine what training will s uccessfully address any skill deficits. - Cornell, Technology Training Services 560 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Needs Assessment is a process us ed anytime someone carefully as ks the question \"How can I find out what is really happening (or needed; at the root of the problem; mis sing; etc.)?\" - Cornell, Needs Assessment Tips and Techniques Data gathering methods by them selves are not a needs assessment . The needs assessme nt process has to result in decision-making for the process to be complete. - University of Virginia Needs assessments and needs anal ysis are interchangeable and ha ve the same purpose and meaning: to assess and analyze. The purpose is to ensure that there is a n eed for training and to identify the nature of the content of the training program. - AMX, Training Needs Assessme nt Now that we have seen a few definitions, let us look at what th e goal of a needs assessment is. Simply put, the goal of a needs assessment i s to design an effective program, product, or service that addresses the group's needs and \"wants.\" Too often people consider only one solution (a want) and discus s it as a need, when in truth what they really need will not be addressed. Effec tive questioning can reveal th e need behind the want. However, it is important to remember that the \"want\" is often the best solution. Two things to remember: Needs are gaps - the space between what currently exists and what should exis t. Wants are solutions - a proposed means to filling the gap. Examples of Wants I want to hire more staff. I want new equipment. I want more training. Examples of Needs I need more staff to meet the department's mission. I need to reduce injuries and n eed to equipment to facilitate t his need. I need better knowledge, skills, a nd abilities to reduce depart ment liability in high critical areas. Write down three wants. __________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ Now, write down the needs or gap s that are creating these wants . __________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ This seems like a simple exercise but it will help you in visua lizing the difference between the two. The goal of a needs assessment is the gathering of information for designing and creating an effective product or service that addresses a group's needs and \"wants.\" The objectives of a needs assessmen t define what the needs assessment will achieve and provide a more complete understanding of the pr oblem to be addressed. Examples of some appropriate objectives are listed below: Identify existing degree of knowledge, skills, and the attitudi nal characteristics surrounding a particular issue or topical area. In order to develop a relevant program, it is critical to determine current understanding of an issue from the participant's perspective, not from what the participant is thought to believe, or to be able to do. Identify individuals or groups of individuals who most need add itional skills training or access to information and technologies. T hrough interviews, for example, an individual may indicate interest in a refresher seminar or workshop to enhance skills and knowledge r elated to a particular issue. A 561 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] geographic information systems (GIS) analyst may see the need for a specific tool to help create better data layers. Identify motivations and conditions that contribute to an indiv idual's degree of interest in an issue and ability to access or purchase the final product or training cou rse. Solicit opinions about content, functionality, etc. in order to draw participants into the design process, and build interest and active participation in the product, ser vice, or training. Needs assessments are used whenever there is a need or a want t hat could be fulfilled by some sort of organizational effort. Let's take a look at where needs assessments fall into the picture from two perspectives: organizational development and instructional design.

Questions Is this a new issue or audience for the organization? Is there widespread agreement up the organizational chain that this issue or audience needs to be addressed? Risks Unknown stakeholders; political blunders; content blunders Lack of support for the results of needs assessment Notes: Always address your goals and objectives in synthesis. An exe cutive summary is often helpful. Step 2: Establish the Planning Team Summary In this step, you will establish the planning team while also determining the resources available for the needs assessment, including: Time Money Number of individuals required for statistical purposes Research or prior studies Expertise of researchers Questions Are the stakeholders and partners new or well known? How geographically or organizationally dispersed is the team? Is there expertise within the team? Risks Not instilling ownership in the final product. Communication difficulties. Can spend a lot of time without getting much accomplished. Notes: All steps should be conducted as part of a group effort and i n the form of a planning team. The planning team ideally will consist of mem bers from different stakeholder groups, as well as individuals with expertise in 567 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] the area of research. Good communication between planning team members is essential. The team must establish protocols and job duties. Step 3: Establish the Goals and Objectives In this step, based on the available resources confirmed in ste p two, you will establish goals and objectives. Summary This step has three phases: Identify the optimum (desired) and actual levels of knowledge or skill. Identify the cause(s) for the lack of knowledge or skill. Devise a solution or series of solutions. Questions Are the goals widely shared by the audience? Are your objectives measurable? Will the project be considered a success if the objectives are met? Risks Different priorities from different team members or supporting organizations; people will disengage from the process. You will not know if you have achieved them and to what degree. Long-term support for doing needs assessments Notes: Ensure goals and objectives drive the outputs (statistical analysis and reporting). This will prioritize the rest of your steps and determine the amount of effort you spend on the needs assessment Step 4. Characterize Your Audience In this step you will determine the following audience characte ristics: Summary Number of individuals present (i.e. sample size) Skill and knowledge level Educational level Organizational niche Cultural characteristics and possible biases Attitudes and biases Ability to access or attend Questions How long have you worked with the audience? How much variation is there within the audience? Risks Assumptions can backfire Stereotypes don't always work Notes: The needs assessment can also validate or demonstrate weaknesses in perceptions. This should be used to check critical characteristics. Step 5. Conduct Information and Literature Search Summary In this step you will review information and literature regarding the issue by looking at studies from management plans, public records, strategic plans, reports, and articles. Questions Has this audience or issue been surveyed in the past? What other kinds of reports would shed light on the audience or issue? Risks Results may be outdated Wasting time and effort to do something that has been done before Not knowing about information that would make the job easier or better Note: Surveys are often used to clarify or answer questions that have surfaced through reviewing reports 568 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Step 6. Select Your Data Collection Methods Summary In this step you will decide how you will collect data, from choices ranging from personal interviews to written tests. Questions Have all of the methods been considered? Do the audience's characteristics provide insight into what methods they would be receptive to? How much expertise is there in- house? Risks The two most popular are also the two most intrusive Upsetting your audience Less experience means more time designing and analyzing and less concrete results Notes: Your decision here will affect much of the time and resources you have for your project. Step 7. Determine Your Sampling Scheme Summary Sample more than you think you need. The biggest threat to a survey is that the results are inaccurate because of the sample size not being representative Questions What's statistically recommended? What is the population size of your audience? Risks Results may be invalid for \"academics\" Too many or too few in your sample Step 8. Design and Pilot the Collection Instrument Summary Always pilot your questionnaire! Better data requires more time, money and resources. Questions How will you pilot your instrument? What kind of expertise is on your planning team? How important is statistical precision? How will data collection be standardized? Risks Instrument will not be clear or gather necessary data The audience will not be receptive to the survey instrument Asking too many questions may irritate the respondents Step 9. Gather and Record Data Summary Always pilot your questionnaire! Better data requires more time, money and resources. Questions How will you pilot your instrument? What kind of expertise is on your planning team? How important is statistical precision? How will data collection be standardized? Risks Instrument will not be clear or gather necessary data The audience will not be receptive to the survey instrument Asking too many questions may irritate the respondents 569 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Step 10. Analyze Data Summary Keep findings and interpretation of findings separate in reporting. Questions How much statistical analysis do you do? Is the gap or issue best addressed through training? Is the data analyst the same as the data gatherer? What statistical tests will be run? How will non-responses to individual survey items be dealt with? Risks Under- or overwhelming your audience with your report Missing trends or patterns Not accounting for other possible critical barriers Letting bias slip into the process Step 11. Manage Data Summary This step involves determining how data will be organized and archived. The importance of this step is often not recognized until it is too late. Questions Will you ever need to refer to these data again? Will the raw data be retained? How will it be stored? If contracted, who owns the data? Risks There may be unforeseen reasons that would necessitate the data being used again Inadequate metadata Step 12. Synthesize Data and Create Report Summary Always address your goals and objectives in synthesis. Report must include problems or errors with the design and the implementation of the survey. An executive summary is often helpful. Questions Who is your audience for the report? Did you address your objectives? Risks People who are making the decisions not understanding process or results Not reaching your goal A key to any successful needs ass essment project is the gatheri ng of complete and accurate data and information regarding your target audience . There are seven basic assessmen t methods that can be used to gather data and information. Each has its own set of benefits and limitations. Depending on time and other logistic issues you may not be able to utilize what might be your first choice of m ethod. Often you will need to use more than one method to obtain the information you need. 570 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Assessment Methods Observation - Watching and observing Interviews - Interviews can be conducted via telephone, video conference, or even on-line via the web Focus Groups - You might be familiar with foc us groups by some other term such as roundtable discussion Oral Surveys - Read a list of questions from a survey form and fill in the answers the participants give you Questionnaires - are a survey instrument through which individuals respond to printed questions (mail/email) Existing Data - looking at information already gathered by the organization. Tests - Testing your target audience will give you a good idea of th e knowledge gaps that exist Methodology Mail Surveys Telephone Surveys InPerson Surveys Focus Groups Online Surveys 571 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Characterizing your Audience Characterizing your audience means figuring out the essential traits, abilities, and knowledge of the members of that audience. Conducting a target audience assessment will hel p you decide who needs what. The information below details the types of ques tions and information you will a sk in characterizing your audience: Knowledge What degree of knowledge does the target population have relating to the issue? Do they have an understanding of c urrent events related to the issue? Are they familiar with any special terms or acronyms? Training What type of prior training or skills does the population have related to the issue? Tools and Techniques What tools and techniques does the population currently use or have access to? Benefits What are the personal benefits to the population in learning about this or changing tools/techniques? Attitudes and Biases What attitudes and biases does the audience have towards the issue? How does the population feel about training opportunities or any changes required in tools/techniques? What training technologies will work best with this audience? Ability to Attend or Access Are there any factors that w ill affect the ability to access, attend or utilize any training or other tools/techniques? Cultural Characteristics Are t here any cultural issues? Sample Size Sample size refers to the numbe r of questionnaires, interviews, surveys, etc. you will distribute or conduct during the needs assessment process. Having a large enough sample to prevent one sample from skewing the results is important. But, the size of your sample is not nearl y as important as the proper design or the survey instruments. However, if there is bias in the data, it is unlik ely to go away as you collect more data. It is more important to obtain a representative sample than a large sample. Identify the groups you need and put more effort into getting a high r esponse rate (e.g. by phoning, or sending reminders) rather than sending out huge numbers of questionnaires a nd letting a few undefined volu nteers return them. If you have the time, contacts a nd/or resources to be more rigo rous about a sampling scheme, you might identify someone familiar with determining things like margin of error, degree of accuracy, standard deviation, mean degree of accuracy, etc. With pilot data in hand, a resource pe rson with some experience could help you work out the total sample size you need for the kind of accuracy you choose. The size of sample you need depends upon two things: 1. How accurate you want the summary data to be. If you want no sa mpling error at all for example, you would need to measure each entire population. 2. How variable the data are. If you started measuring something a nd found that every measure was the same, you obviously wouldn't go on very l ong repeating the measuremen ts to increase your accuracy. On the other 572 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] hand, the more the data vary, the more data you need to collect to get a reasonably accurate measure of the mean. A third consideration is accepta bility to partic ipants and audi ences. For example, in collecting the views of staff, it might not be acceptable to sample, even though a sample woul d appear to be statistically adequate. Every staff member might need to be heard so that no one feels left out and there is no suspicion of bias. Sample sizes over 30 have certa in advantages, statistically. Correlations are very unstable on samples smaller than 50 - 100 . Often you will simply use the largest sample on which you can c ollect high quality data within the constraints of time and money available. One of the most consistent problems with surveys is a low respo nse rate. The method of surveying you select has a lot to do with the response rate. The effects of nonrespo nse on surveys depend on the percentage not responding and the extent to which those not responding are biased (different from the whole population). There is no minimum set or standard response rate that would be seen as acceptable in every circumstance. The federal government generally ask s for a response rate in excess of 75 percent. The desired rate of any survey is 100 percent. But getting higher response rates usually involves more effort. The greatest response rate happens when you have a \"captive audience\" where everyone taking the su rvey is in the same room. Phone interviews and mailed questionnaires are the two most pop ular methods, For mailed questionnaires, keep in mind the following: Questionnaires tend to be biased t oward people who have a strong interest in the subject matter and are more likely to return the questionnaire Better educated people usually return mail questionnaires more quickly Accurate mailing addresses are critical! Anything that makes the survey more professional-looking, perso nalized, or more attractive has a small positive effect on the response rate Ideas to increase response rates in clude printing on colored pa per, using an impressive letterhead and leader endorsements, paying people, or providing other gifts Follow-up postcards or phone calls can be effective. If not don e carefully, follow-up contacts can reduce the perceived confidentiality of the survey Keep in mind the following when conducting phone interviews: Unavailability is an important source of non-response Less-educated people and those over 65 years old tend to be mor e willing to be interviewed in a random phone survey Interviewers with flexible schedules are helpful so that they a re able to call at a convenient time for the respondent Participation in an interview is always voluntary; the intervie wer needs to be persistent without being annoying No matter how careful you are, e rrors made by respondents, and respondents not answering specific questions will always happen. Non responses and errors can be a result of any of the followin g: Poor form design Inadequate attention to survey administration procedures Carelessness or lack o f motivation on the part of the respondent Faulty assumptions on the part o f the survey respondent or administrator Since invalid responses will happen on any survey, you must have some protocols in place for determining how to cope with them prior to tabul ating data. It is important to deal with invalid responses consistently. 573 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Invalid responses may include the following: Multiple items marked (when respondent was asked to mark only o ne) Changes to survey items (responde nt edits an item to reflect what he or she wants to address) Middle marks (deliberately puts a mark between two answers) Mismarked responses (marks a response other than what is intend ed) Misaligned responses (marks intended response but for the wrong item) Skipped question (does not mark any response at all) Note: One way to eliminate nonresponses is to use a \"Not Applic able\" option to give respondents a method of indicating that the question is not personally relevant. \"Not A pplicable\" responses are characteristically treated in the same way as missing data. Remember that any data cleaning and data editing you perform should be documented and handled systematically. When dealing with errors and non-responses you should calculate the percentage of error or nonresponse to the number of valid responses. This will help yo u compensate for nonresponses and errors. If the number of non-responses to certain questions, or the error rate is high, the validity of the data can be significantly impacted. Questions Developing questions is difficult. We all have our biases, plus we wish questions to prompt the information we are looking for. When you are given the opportuni ty to ask questions in person, face to face, be sure to ask directly about any issues or problems. Interviewing someone in person permits you to adjust wording, clarifying meanings, and ask additional questions to elicit mo re detail \u2014 things that just a re not possible using written instruments or web surveys. Some examples are shown below: What training do you need? This question directly solicits solu tions from the interviewee. What issues do you deal with? This questions directly addresses their problems. Person to Person Interviewing Active listening means to focus both on the words being spoken and to the person himself in order to better understand what he or she is say ing. As you listen you should a lso communicate your understanding and show nonjudgmental acceptance of what is being stated. The following are some other tips for active listening: Ask non-leading questions: \"can you tell me more about that?\" Rephrase what the speaker said in your own words Reflect underlying feelings: \"whe n that happens to me, I feel r eally bad\" Avoid analyzing what was described Use personal disclosure: \"I'm not sure I fully understand what you are saying\" Avoid using probing questions Face the speaker Watch the speaker and listen Keep your mind on what the speaker is saying Written questions Written questions present unique challenges but at the same tim e can be advantageous. You can test multiple iterations of questions to ensure there is no bias and can hone the grammar and sentence structure as well. The main thing to ask yourself about any question as you write it is whether it will measure what you are trying to measure. 574 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Negativity Can be very difficult to understand Repetition Can make respondents angry Irritates people when they think you are playing games with them At a minimum, change the wording (most folks will catch on) Structuring questions can means not only how the question itsel f is written, but also how the responder is guided to answer. The way a question is worded can reveal or suggest bias on the part of the interviewer. Especially in the case of multiple choice type response options, the question can also unintentionally guide the interviewee toward a certain answer, or not a llow him or her to answer the way they would like. There are two different types of questions you can use that will elicit very different responses. These two types are called open-ended and closed questions. Open-ended questions are used whe n longer and more thoughtful a nswers are required. Typically these questions: Ask the interviewee to think and reflect Will provide the questioner with opinions and feelings Open Ended Question Example Describe two examples of interpreting results of your research coastal management applications. Closed questions are typically t hose that can be answered with one word. For example, \"Yes/No\" questions are closed questions. These questions are useful for testing compre hension and when long essay answers are not required. Typically these questions: Provide facts Are easy to answer Can be answered quickly. Closed Question Example What methods have you utilized in the past year to interpret the results for your research for coastal managers? ___ Workshops ___ Field Demonstrations ___ Interpretive materials (signs, etc.) ___ Posters at professional conference ___ Presentations at meetings When structuring questions, agree/disagree type responses can r eflect bias on the part of the questioner, or be interpreted as bias. An altern ative scheme that uses a ranking structure of some sort is much better as it does not reveal any biases. In the example on this page, the Better allows the interviewee to rate the health of the bay on a continuum as opposed to focusing on one particular aspect of ba y health. 575 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Example of Bad Structure Statement: The bay is polluted. Do you ... ___ Strongly agree ___ Agree ___ Disagree ___ Strongly disagree Example of Better Structure Question: How would you rate the health of the bay? ___ Excellent ___ Very good ___ Good ___ Fair ___ Poor Sensitivity in structuring questi ons refers to creating questio ns that will not somehow embarrass or cause the interviewee to divulge personal information he or she does not want to have on record. For example, when asking about a person's salary, providing a range of values to choose from can seem less invasive. Example of Bad Structure What is your salary? ___________________ Example of Better Structure Please select the salary range associated with your position. ___ 15-25K ___ 26-35K ___ 26-45K ___ 46-55K ___ 56K + The way you word your questions can have implications on the ty pe of response you will received. Poorly worded questions will get vague, unintended, or false answers. Incomplete wording , such as trying to abbreviate the details of a question, can c ause respondents to not understand the question properly. Example of Incomplete Wording Question: Experience? ___ 0-2 ___ 3-5 ___ 5-10 ___ 10 + Example of Better Worded Question Question: Number of years in current position? ___ 0-2 years ___ 3-5 years ___ 5-10 years ___ 10 + years Specialized wording , such as using acronyms or terminology not universally underst ood, can also create confusion. In the example below , the term \"outreach\" means different things to different organization. To some it means marketing and communica tions. To others it means commu nity involved projects but not necessarily publications and communications. 576 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Specialized Wording - Bad Example Question: Do you have outrea ch staff? ___ Yes ___ No Specialized Wording - Better Ex ample Question: Do you have sta ff dedicated (1 Full Time Equivalency) to the promotion and marketing of your office's programs? ___ Yes ___ No Sometimes in the effort to get precise answers we can structure questions with too many variables. In other words, we can force the responder to make a distinction that he or she does not necessary want to make, nor have the ability to make. The exa mples below provide some insight. Example of Too Many Variables Question: Do you feel that using water quality monitoring kits helps students to understand chemistry in order to meet state curriculum standards? ___ N/A ___ Not enhanced ___Somewhat enhanced ___Enhanced ___Significantly enhanced Better Use of Variables Question: In your experience, has the use of water quality monitoring kits enhanced stude nts understanding of water chemistry? ___ Unsure ___ Yes ___ No Important questions when planning needs assessments 1. Who is the assessment attempting to inform, influence, or persu ade? 2. What purpose is the needs assessment intended to accomplish? 3. Whose needs are to be assessed? 4. What questions need to be asked ? Do you already know the answe rs? Can you do anything to change the situation? 5. How will the information be used? 6. What resources are available to do the needs assessment? Selecting your assessment strategy What resources do you need (time, money, materials) Who will take part What type of needs are addressed How confidential How comfortable is the method Validation Well grounded, sound Produces the desired results Measure what it is supposed to measure 577 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Percentage of return indicates the need What are the advantages of using a needs assessment? New ideas Alternative for dealing with the needs Allows employee to voice their concerns in a safe environment Empowers employees Makes employees feel that their opinion matters Planning and designing a needs assessment 1. Be creative, efficient and effective 2. Determine the purpose for conduc ting a needs assessment (awaren ess, aid in decision making, promote action, find out cause and effect) 3. Define goals and objectives. Who will be your target audience? Make it a broad survey in order to receive input from everyone involved. Be specific. 4. Select the approach you will take in collecting the data. 5. Design the instrumentation and procedures. \"Keep it simple\" Lo ng and complicated discourages response. 6.

According to the U.S. Census, the majority of households have personal computers and Internet access. In 1984, 8 percent of households had a computer and in 2003 this number was up to 62 percent (Cheeseman Day, Janus and Davis 2005). It is becoming increasingly popular for individuals to be reached as research subjects via the Internet. Advantage #1: Online Surveys are Cheaper Many researchers choose online surveys because they a r e typically less expensive than non- electronic surveys. They do not require interviewers, printing or transcribing. It is much cheaper to send the survey itself via email and also cheaper to send participation reminders. When researchers choose to have the postal service send these, they will probably incur the cost of letterhead, envelopes, postage and the time it would take a person to generate these items. Advantage #2: Online Surveys are Flexible \u2014 for the R esearcher and Participant Online surveys can be relatively easy for researchers to create, and are typically very \"user -friendly\" for respondents. When researchers are creating these surveys, errors can be corrected easily without having to reprint or redistribute. These errors can be fixed in real time, and the survey results can also be presented in real time. Since online surveys are self-administered, often respondents have the ability to begin the survey and pause at their convenience. This also allows them the time to think about what feedback they want to share. Giving them this chance to think about their answer will generate more detailed and accurate responses. Respondents won't feel as rushed since they are participating at their convenience. Since they have more time to respond, they can give more elaborate answers. Also, the answers will not be summarized by interviewers, which answers collected by phone often are. Similar to mail surveys, online surveys can be perceived as unobtrusive as compared to other methods, since respondents can complete them from the comfort of their home or any other desired location. Advantage #3: Online Surveys are Fast and Accurate Large amounts of data can be collected in a short amo u nt of time through the use of online surveys. Hundreds or thousands of respondents can answer the questions simultaneously which can also offer a quick turnaround on reporting. As data is input by the respondent, web-based questionnaires can automatically validate their responses. If the user enters data incorrectly, the system can be set to alert them of this error so they can resubmit. This will catch missing or out-of-range responses without the researcher having to watch for these. 581 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

This saves time and resources associated with the data entry process. It lowers the probability of data errors because it eliminates the need for manual entry. It also eliminates interviewer error. In some cases such as a telephone interview, the interviewer could influence the respondent through their attitude, tone of voice, or their perceptions. Also, respondents may be more willing to answer questions based on what they think about the interviewer. This improves accuracy and reduces response time. In some cases, research companies can provide statistics automatically upon the respondent's completion of the survey. Online surveys also allow researches an easy way to track quota fulfillment. Advantage #4: Online Surveys are Versatile There are a few functionality and aesthetic benefits o f choosing the Internet as a means of conducting a survey. The overall structure of the questionnaire can be very complex. The online aspect gives the researcher control over the order of the questions presented, and how they are presented. It makes offering open-ended questions much more feasible because the respondents are literally completing the data entry process themselves. Online surveys can offer the capability of pull-down lists. Researchers can use branching techniques, randomization, skip patterns, and piping with simple point and click programming. There are other techniques and statistical methods that are most easily administered online, such as MaxDiff. Another benefit, from a functionality standpoint, is that online survey questions can be set to mandatory, optional, or a mixture of both. This allows the researcher the opportunity to force a response out of participants. In some cases, it is advisable to keep mandatory questions at a minimum, but if some type of incentive is being offered to respondents for completing the survey, researchers may gain valuable information from these forced responses. Either way, having this control is a great benefit of the online avenue. Online surveys can be very aesthetically pleasing because they can easily incorporate graphics and sound. Brands hoping to leave a lasting impression can customize brand colors and graphics onto the online survey. They can also include a function that other methods cannot. They can allow respondents the ability to visually compare different graphics. For example, visual comparisons are easily presented on screen when testing new product packaging or considerations for new car models. While it may be feasible for a focus group to accommodate new packaging options, an online approach would usually be better for comparing objects more challenging to present, such as cars. In some cases, the survey can also provide automatic completion statistics with charts and graphs that allow the respondent or the company seeking the research a visual representation of results. Advantage #5: Respondent Control Online surveys can include a unique identifier, which prevents a person from submitting a survey more than once. Each participant can have an exclusive number assigned to them that can be entered at the beginning of the survey. This can be easily tracked by the 582 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

The unique identifier will strengthen the survey because the information will be more representative (i.e. not skewed by the same people completing multiple times). Advantage #6: Larger Sample Sizes are a Possibility Larger sampling possibilities are a big benefit of on l ine surveys. Not only does this allow the researcher to collect responses from all over the world (making the study more representative), but it also gives access to rare populations. These hard-to-reach populations could include people participating in deviant practices, people with specific diseases taking certain medications, or other specific criteria that are not concentrated in one area. If the researcher has very targeted intentions, online research may be the best methodological choice. Disadvantages of Online Research Online data collection has many features that may be appealing to researchers, but it also has its drawbacks. If the following points would be detrimental for the information you plan to attain, it may be best to stick with a more traditional collection method. Potential Problem #1: Sampling Bias Online surveys typically do not reflect the general p o pulation, so there will likely be sampling bias. The U.S. Census Bureau's Population Survey conducted in 2003 found that Internet users are more likely to be non-black, non-Hispanic, and under the age of 65. Respondents that had completed \"some college\" or had obtained a \"bachelor's degree or higher\" were more likely to be Internet users than those with a \"less than high school\" education. In addition, the 2003 study found that households earning an annual income of $50,000 or more were more likely to be Internet users compared to those earning less than $25,000 annually (2003). Therefore, online surveys are best when the desired target population consists of Internet users. If the researcher is conducting employee satisfaction research, they may know that each of their employees has Internet access and time allotted to complete the survey. In some instances, they may not be certain that this is the case. Statistically, we know there are certain populations whose Internet usage is not as high as other demographics. Younger people are more likely to use the Internet than older people (Pew Internet studies). If a retirement home wants to capture information from its residents on opinions toward cafeteria food, an online survey may not be the best choice. The basic concept here is online research is only a good method when your audience is online and can read and enter data. Another drawback is that it is difficult to know whether the person who says they are taking the survey is actually the one who took it because it is almost impossible to check a respondent's identity. Another thing to keep in mind is that not everyone has an email address. Of those that do, many do not want to offer their personal information or even their opinions online. While online surveys are considered less obtrusive than other methods to some people, others 583 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved. Co ntact: Polaris Marketing Research, Inc., 1455 Lincoln Parkway, Suite GA 30346 404-816-0353, email: research@polarismr.com, web site: www.polarismr.com 4 Si x Key Advantages of Online Surveys Potential Problem #2: Compliancy Laws There are certainly privacy concerns with information transferred through online portals, and these privacy laws make data collection more difficult. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) states that personal information collected online from children under the age of 13 must have consent from their parent or guardian and this consent must be verifiable. This becomes tricky because data collection agencies cannot guarantee that the personal information they collect actually had parental consent. The Privacy Act of 1974 was also created, which requires agencies to follow \"fair information practices\" and states that records cannot be disclosed to an agency without the consent of the individual sharing their information. As Internet data collection becomes increasingly popular, opt-in privacy policies are becoming more common. It is crucial for researchers to familiarize themselves with the voluntary guidelines and codes of conduct associated with online data collection. Many organizations reference a code of ethics and practices established by the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). Potential Problem #3: Operating System and Web Browser Consistency Other things to consider are how the survey will suppo rt multiple platforms and browsers. Oftentimes web surveys will look different depending on browser and computer monitor characteristics. Some people keep their web browsers at full screen, and others keep their window smaller, which means the survey will look different to different respondents. When designing a survey, it is usually the researcher's intent to keep each screen of the survey as short as possible, and avoid forcing the respondent scroll. These scroll bars give the impression that the survey is long, and attrition rates will be higher. This makes online surveys tricky because unlike paper surveys, it is difficult to know exactly how the survey will appear on different screens. The best way to test this is for the survey designer to set their monitor resolution to a very low setting (the lowest common denominator). This will give the designer the best idea of what the majority of respondents will see. Survey Methodology Comparisons As a follow-up to this account of the online approach, the following table offers a short summary of the characteristics of mail, telephone and in-person surveys, as well as focus groups. The following information can aid your decision should you still be unsure about using the online route after reviewing these pros and cons. For example, since mail surveys are self-administered, interviewer bias is avoided. Respondents have time to construct their answers, much more time as compared to some other methods. However, mail surveys yield a relatively low response rate and a long turnaround time. This method does not allow for the ability for interviewers to further probe respondents, which is an advantage of other methods such as in-person surveys and focus groups. Telephone surveys are a reliable way to acquire information quickly and typically have a good response rate, but certain populations will be difficult to reach. Face-to-face surveys also have a good response rate, but similar to focus groups, can be expensive. If the researcher wishes to include product visuals or demos, focus groups can be a good starting point before beginning quantitative research. However, these focus 584 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

Conclusion Whether the advantages of choosing the online route versus another means of data collection outweigh the disadvantages will really depend on what the researcher seeks to accomplish. The subject matter, the demographics of the population being studied and the timeframe the researcher has to work with should all be considered. As technology continually improves, the number of online techniques for obtaining this type of information will also grow. Give adequate time to consider which methodology will be most successful for your study. This paper should serve as a starting point to educate and aid readers about this type of decision-making.

For questions that require anonymity, Mail surveys provide the best advantage. Telephone surveys provide quick collection of data with trained interviewers to probe for underlying reasons. Online method is a powerful way for using dif- ferent media types (pictures, sound, video, etc.) and also for collecting data quickly. With In-Person methodology, the interviewer can acquire more qualitative data from hard-to- reach populations. Hybrid methods or using a mixed-mode strategy can help increase re- sponse rate and faster data collection. With all methodologies, there are disadvantages using one mode over another, such as interviewer bias in telephone or in-person interviews, time in collecting data for mail surveys, or legitimated studies tagged as SPAM-mail for online surveys. Time frame and budget are major factors for choosing a methodology, but each method depends in terms of your sample size, desired accuracy of the data, and/or the complexity of your questionnaire. 587 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc.

This paper will explore the pros and cons of four basic types of quantitative survey methodologies: mail, telephone, online, and in-person to guide you in choosing the best methodology for your study. As telemarketers disguised as marketing researchers are proliferating and as getting respondents for legitimate research is becoming more difficult, we will also mention some hybrid techniques used today to help increase your survey response rate. Method #1: Mail According to author Thomas Magione in Mail Surveys: Improving Quality , it is a good idea to co nsider mail surveys \"when your sample (or respondents) is spread out geographically and your budget is modest.\" In survey design, Magione mentions that there are two broad classes of questions - open-ended questions and close-ended questions. With close-ended questions, the respondent is given a series of alternatives to pick the answers. However, in an open-ended question, no specific categories of responses are given and the respondent must answer the question in their own words. When designing a mail survey questionnaire, the questions should be designed with close-ended answers. Also, since mail surveys are convenient for respondents to complete in their own place and time, its anonymity and privacy makes mail surveys the most appropriate methodology for sensitive information. Method #2: Telephone When discussing telephone survey methodology, we cannot overlook the sampling methods associated with it. Unlike mail surveys, where self-selective bias is high, telephone surveys provide a more accurate result to the study due to the random dialing feature. In telephone methodology, sampling methods consist of list-assisted, random digit dialing Pros Because they use paper and pencil instruments, mail surveys are the least ex- pe nsive way to collect data from large number of people. Also, because of the convenience of completing the survey at their own pace, a longer question- naire design is plausible. Cons Since mail surveys are self-selected and self-administered by the respondent, th ere's no follow-up from the researcher. They also have the least amount of control over all other survey methodologies in terms of questionnaire design and clarification of questions. The time getting back the survey by mail, the time entering the data, and time analyzing the data are extensive. Comple- tion rate is very low. Mail Surveys 589 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved. Co ntact: Polaris Marketing Research, Inc., 1455 Lincoln Parkway, Suite GA 30346 404-816-0353, web site: www.polarismr.com 2 Fo A Comparison of Pros & Cons (RDD) or multiple-frame sampling methods. In early telephone sample design or list- assisted design, researchers used telephone directories because they were readily available and considered to be a general representation of the U.S. household population. However, with increased levels of unlisted numbers, (Los Angeles being on the extreme side of 56% unlisted numbers, Survey Sampling Inc., 1989) concerns about the accuracy of the sample became prevalent. Defined by James M. Lepkowski in Telephone Survey Methodology, RDD can reach both listed and unlisted numbers by generating telephone numbers at random. Multi-frame sampling method, introduced by Lepkowski in 1993, combines both list-assisted design and RDD to generate telephone numbers in a select sample frame. An important point to note for RDD is that the sampling frame used for RDD can have a significant impact on cost and scope of the study if a substantial portion of households from random generated telephone numbers are ineligible to take the survey. With a good telephone sample, either from a customer database or multi-frame sampling, surveys are conducted by trained interviewers with computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) software. CATI can display the questionnaire to the interviewer with skip patterns and rotation of the questions. As investigated by Groves and Mathiowetz in 1984, collecting quantitative data using CATI results in \"higher quality\" data when a complex set of questions is surveyed on both types of paper and pencil and CATI methodologies. Other capabilities of CATI system include sending emails on the fly during an interview or redirecting a respondent to an IVR system. An IVR, Interactive Voice Response, telephone survey is administered by the respondent answering pre-recorded questions using touch-tone key pad to record their answers and there is no live interviewer. For those still using dial-tone telephones, the system can also capture and digitally store their voice responses. For open-ended questions, responses are recorded and then transcribed and included in the research report. IVR is most commonly used to measure customer's reactions to service they just received, also known as a transactional survey. For example, you may be asked if you'd like to take a short survey at the end of the call with an agent. When the service is complete, the agent disconnects the caller, and the caller is transferred to a survey. Common IVR applications, other than for marketing research, include bank balance inquiry, call center routing, stock lookup and quotes, order entry and tracking, and Movie schedules. IVR is one example of a hybrid methodology. For example, a restaurant or retail store will give receipts with a toll-free number encouraging customers to take a survey for a discount or coupon incentive. Although IVR surveys have a high fixed cost, there is very little variable cost. Western Wats, Polaris' telephone partner for telephone data collection, can have 2,000 lines available 24/7, which can be used to collect large volume data quickly and on a budget since a pre-recorded voice surveys the respondent. IVR's speed of data collection is its most striking advantage. Within 5 minutes after a service interaction is finished, a company can get feedback from the customer about his experiences. Also, although there is no interviewer bias, the question design is very limited to simple scale questions. 590 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

It's difficult to ask sensitive and personal questions. Hurdles such as FTC's Do Not Call List for telemarketers and inexpensive gadgets like TeleZappers make reaching re- spondents more difficult. Cost per telephone interview can be expensive if the completion rate and response rate is low. There's also possibility of inter- viewer bias when probing for answers. Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) Pros High quality control with trained interviewers and CATI technology to assist in co mplex questionnaire. Clarification of unfamiliar words and questions are carried out by interviewers. Data collection is quick and less prone to errors. It's easier to reach \"low incidence\" respondents, as in a segment of population that is small in size. It is also less prone to \"non-response\" bias and more likely to represent the true opinions of the population than any other method- ology. Pros No interviewer results in low cost and no interviewer bias. Convenient for re- sp ondent to dial in anytime at his convenience. Used in transactional surveys, IVR provides fastest feedback after interaction with an agent/company. Cons Survey needs to be very short, 5 minutes or less. It tends to have low initial co operation rates and high break-off rates. No clarification of questions and probing for reasons by interviewer. Interactive Voice Response Surveys (IVR) Me thod #3: Online Surveys With more companies trying to reach international markets, online surveys fill the need for sampling an array of languages and populations. Web questionnaire design can vary from complex skip logic to placing images, videos, and sound-clips for new brand concepts and designs. Unlike telephone interviews, there is no interviewer bias or even interviewer dia- lects/accents that can lead to misunderstanding the questionnaire. Data collection is quick and easy, and tracking where respondents break-off in the survey is possible due to data pip- ing-in to a database in real-time. With both CATI and IVR systems, respondents who have unresolved issues and/or request immediate attention, can request for contact or Action Report at the end of the survey. Action Reports provide an excellent opportunity to mend dissatisfaction and turn these contacts into successful long-term relationships. 591 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc.

Because email invites for survey are sent through software in large email batches at a time, it can trigger a respondent's mail box to label it as \"junk\" or SPAM mail. To overcome this hurdle and increase response rate, sending an initial email about the survey from a trusted address domain is important. Mail invites, rather than email invites, with incentive offers are also used to initiate respondents to log on to online surveys. The obvious downside of online surveys that most expect is the problem of skewed da ta. Only the participants with Internet access are expected to respond with these respondents being in the Gen Y or Gen X generation. However, in a recent article by Pew Research Center \"Generations Online in 2009,\" \"the biggest increase in Internet use since 2005 can be seen in the 70-75 year-old age group. While just over one- fourth (26%) of 70-75 year olds were online in 2005, 45% of that age group is currently online.\" The following chart is a representation of Americans online by age. Probing in online surveys is also a concern with this methodology. However, new soft- ware integrated with online surveys, such as iModerate and SurveyGuardian, are able to use interactive chat features, like a pop-up window during the survey, by a trained e-interviewer to probe for more clarity and accuracy of answers from the respondents in real-time. 592 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc.

Respondents are recruited, screened, and instructed by a phone interviewer to go onto to a web page for the actual survey. Bill MacElroy in the article \"Measuring response rates in online surveys,\" however, mentions a downside to using hybrid methods for telephone-recruit to web. He states that \"telephone pre-recruitment can cost up to 70 percent of the cost of doing the entire interview over the phone, so there has to be a very compelling reason to use the Internet if you must call ahead of time.\" Pros Although there is a high software and hosting start-up cost involved with la unching your own online survey (unless professional marketing research firm like Polaris is used), the cost of online is less expensive than a CATI survey overall. Time collecting data is greatly reduced since data is automatically entered in a database and can be exported to other programs. Online surveys are as powerful as CATI, cover international population, and can display many different media types. Cons Coverage that is representative of the population is still inferior to telephone sam- pl ing. Email invites can end-up in junk mail boxes and people are paying less attention to emails as they used to. There's still self-selection bias unless pop-up surveys are used. Online Surveys However, advances in online surveys are not limited to clicking a survey link from an email in vite or typing in a web address from a mail invite. \"People are just not paying attention to their email like they used to,\" said Mark Houston, PeanutLab's Vice President for Market- ing. Companies like Peanut Lab are targeting respondents of specific web communities or social networks, such as facebook.com, where incentives to taking surveys on your face- book page is fake online money for games and applications. The method used by Peanut Lab also can be used for recruiting an online panel, since social networks include demo- graphic profiles used to segment respondents. There's also an option to online surveys where you do not need an actual sample. For ex- ample, a \"pop-up survey\" window can be programmed to appear every n:th time the web site is visited. This online survey method can be used in order to avoid self-selection bias and to gain a little more control over the sample visiting the website. This method allows a good number of completes in a short period of time if the site has a lot of traffic. However, this type of methodology has been reported somewhat annoying to web users. 593 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

Face-to-face surveys have almost become extinct due to cost compared to telephone or online methods. It has the highest degree of inter- viewer bias, in verbal and also in this case, non-verbal. Also, respondents may feel reluctant to share truthful answers to sensitive topics and give a more so- cially acceptable response to the interviewer Method #4: In-Person/Household Surveys Un til the 1970s, face-to-face survey was the dominant methodology for data collection. However, with technology to cut down cost of interviewer's travel expenses, time, and training, why would you need to conduct face-to-face surveys? In the article \"Intensive One -on-One Surveys\" by Granite Bay, in-person or household surveys are most commonly used when interviewer and respondents are discussing personal situations with extensive probing and exploration. Respondents are able to reveal themselves and tell a story that is more genuine and pointed. The interviewer can record the responses into a computer or tape the interview while determining whether the respondent is giving false answers to the ques- tions from his facial expressions and body language, etc. In-Person Surveys Pros The completion rate is high. Respondent is unlikely to \"drop off\" before com- pl etion. The interviewer can acquire more qualitative data, and explore an- swers with respondent. It's optimal for difficult to reach populations. Now that you have the knowledge of four basic survey methodologies, we have to ask ge neral, but insightful questions to determine which approach is most appropriate for your situation: 1) Depending on what you want to know, who should be in your sample and who should respond to the survey? Do you have the phone numbers, addresses, or email to reach your respondents? 2) Do you need the results right away? Time frame is an important factor to method- ology consideration. Do you need to consider hybrid techniques and increase your cost to collect the data you need and as soon as possible? 3) How complex are your questions? Do they require probing from the interviewer? Does your survey need to show graphics and/or audio? 594 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

For example, at a 95 percent confidence level, the margin of error of n=200 responses is \u00b17 percent. This means that if 60 percent of your respondent answered to having a preference to Coke over Pepsi, you can be 95 percent sure that 53 - 67 percent of your entire sample population actually does prefer Coke over Pepsi. Depending on your ideal confidence level, you can increase or decrease your sample (n) to increase or decrease the margin of error. All these factors taken into consideration not only affect the accuracy of your study, but also your budget. However, budget should never overweigh selecting the best option to achieving your research objectives.

It takes a good bit of experience to develop questionnaires that clearly and comprehensively address the goals of the project while considering both the nature of the target re- spondent and the particular survey methodology chosen. However, following a few basic principles of good questionnaire design can get you started in designing basic surveys. It also will help you with insight for evaluating the effectiveness of questionnaires designed by third parties. 596 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

It is highly recommended that you and your team go through the entire questionnaire design process to make sure that any survey instrument you create will be an effective tool for gathering the information you need. Key steps in the design process include: Determine the information needed Determine which survey methodology is most appropriate for your needs Specify individual questions to be asked Decide what question structure, rating scale, and wording is appropriate Properly order the questions within the questionnaire Proof and pretest survey with small sample to check performance Make changes based on pretest and execute survey You should consider the nature of the target respondent group when wording questionnaires. The methodology (for example, phone vs. online), also dictates what types of questions can be included and how they can be asked. A few general rules that should be followed include: /checkbld Make sure your response categories cover most plausible responses and include an \"other\" category. /checkbld Be very specific and keep it to one concept per questions. If necessary, break a complex question into several simpler ones. /checkbld Create a logical order to the questionnaire with similar topics together and in context. /checkbld When creating a list of response categories for multiple choice questions, make sure that each response is clearly different from the others with no confusing overlap. Build questions that are clearly understood. /checkbld Write clearly and avoid unfamiliar words, jargon, technical terms and jargon that may be unfamiliar or confusing to your respondents. 598 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc.

Co ntact: Polaris Marketing Research, Inc., 1455 Lincoln Parkway, Suite GA 30346 404-816-0353, web 101: Getting Started /checkbld Don't use leading words and biased questions. /checkbld Respect your respondents' privacy and allow them an out to skip answering personal questions (religion, education, income level, politics) if they so choose. Forcing a response can lead to hang ups and terminates. Most important of all, remember that respondents are doing you a favor by participating and you should always respect their time, sensitivity, privacy and opinions. A respondent who was treated courteously and respectfully is likely to participate in other marketing research surveys. When creating a survey questionnaire, there are basic types of scale questions to have in your tool box. They are: Nominal \u2014 when numbers are used to identify objects, such as social security number, license numbers or daily customers. In this case, the number acts mostly as a data tag, typically for identification. Ordinal \u2014 when numbers are used to indicate the relative position, but not indicate the magnitude of the difference between those positions. An example of this would be rankings in which items are listed by priority, say first through fifth, or competitive events where the quantifiable difference in perception between #1 and #2 is unknown. Interval \u2014 when a rating scale is used and the zero point is arbitrary. An example of this is satisfaction scores (satisfaction of 3 on a scale of 1 to 5) as well as most other attitude and opinion questions, regardless of the scale used (3, 5, or 10 point). Unlike ordinal, the difference between each data point is fixed. Ratio \u2014 the most useful of all of the scales in creating a questionnaire, ratio scales allow the researcher to incorporate each of the above listed scales into one (nominal, ordinal and interval). The key difference with ratio is that unlike the interval scale, it is anchored with an absolute zero point. Examples of ratio questions are market share, income group, age group, etc. 599 of 744\u00a9 2009-2010, Polaris Marketing Research, Inc. All rights Reserved.

The questions in this tool are designed to help you examine you r business processes, and to help identify possible improvements. The tool uses what, why, when, how, whe re, and who. This problem solving technique is part of the comprehensive Sev en Step Problem Solving process. Starting with the flow-diagram (below), it will help guide you from an a ssessment of the current situation, to challenging why things are done in a partic ular way, to option generation, and finally to the selection of appropriate solutions. Next apply the systematic, structured, questioning technique, d etailed below. Think about the task yourself, and then involve team members. Enc ourage creativity but ensure eac h step is taken in a thorough and disciplined manner. The Critical Examination Technique Read the questions in this problem solving technique then follo w these 4 steps: 1. Answer the questions in the first column. These summarize the present process method, asking: what; how; when; where; and who. 2. Challenge each of your answers by asking \"why?\" 3. Use column three to help you generate a range of improvement op tions. 4. Use column four to help you decide on the best option. (Adapted from Michael Tucker's Successful Process Management in a Week) 606 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Tips to Implement the Critical Examination Technique To make improvements to a process, work with the team responsib le for that process. Use step 1 to: identify the purpose of the process; explore what citizens and stakeholders expect the process to de liver Use step 2 to: analyze how the process works, a nd its resource requirements; explore ways of measuring its efficiency and effectiveness. Use step 3 to: examine ways to improve the process; assess the implications and consequences of these improvements Use step 4 to: decide on the best option , given available resources A final tip: Look for the small changes to the process which could have a big impact as a whole. Basic Guidelines to Problem Solving and Decision Making Much of what managers and superv isors do is solve problems and make decisions. New managers and supervisors, in particular, often make solve problems and decisions by reacting to them. They are \"under the gun\", stressed and very short for time. Consequently, when they encounter a new problem or decision they must make, they react with a decision that seemed to work before. It 's easy with this approach to get stuck in a circle of solving the same problem over and over again. Therefore, as a new manager or supervisor, get used to an organized approach to problem solving and decision making. Not all problems can be so lved and decisions made by th e following, rather rational approach. However, the following basic gui delines will get you started. D on't be intimidated by the length of the list of guidelines. After you've practiced them a few times, they'll be come second nature to you - enough that you can deepen and enrich them to su it your own needs and nature. 1. Define the problem/opportunity This is often where people struggle. They react to what they th ink the problem is. Instead, seek to understand more about why you think there's a problem. Defining the problem: (with input from yourself and others) Ask yourself and others, the following questions: a. What can you see that causes you to think there's a problem? b. Where is it happening? c. How is it happening? d. When is it happening? e. With whom is it happening? (HINT: Don't jump to \"Who is causing the problem?\" When we're stressed, blaming is often one of our first reactions. To be a n effective manager, you need to address issues more than people.) f. Why is it happening? 607 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] g. Write down a five-sentence description of the problem in terms of \"The following should be happening, but isn't ...\" or \"The following is happening and should be: ...\" As much as possible, be specific in your description, including what is happening, where, how, with whom and why. Defining complex problems: a. If the problem still seems overwhelming, break it down by repea ting steps a-f until you have descriptions of several related problems. Verifying your understanding of the problems: a. It helps a great deal to verify your problem analysis for confe rring with a peer or someone else. Prioritize the problems: a. If you discover that you are looking at several related problems, then prioritize which ones you should address first. b. Note the difference between \"important\" and \"urgent\" problems. Often, what we consider to be important problems to consider a re really just urgent problems. Important problems deserve more attention. For example, if you'r e continually answering \"urgent \" phone calls, then you've probably got a more \"important\" problem and that's to design a system that screens and prioritizes your phone calls. Understand your role in the problem: a. Your role in the problem can greatly influence how you perceive the role of others. For example, if you're very stressed out, it'll pr obably look like others are, too, or, you may resort too quickly to blaming and reprimanding others . Or, you are feeling very guil ty about your role in the problem; you may ignore the accountabilities of others. 2. Look at potential causes for the problem a. It's amazing how much you don't know about what you don't know. Therefore, in this phase, it's critical to get input from other people who notice the problem and who are affected by it. b. It's often useful to collect input from other individuals one a t a time (at least at first). Otherwise, people tend to be inhibited about offering their impressions of the r eal causes of problems. c. Write down what your opinions and what you've heard from others . d. Regarding what you think might be performance problems associated with an employee; it's often useful to seek advice from a peer or your supervisor in order to verify your impression of the problem. e. Write down a description of the cause of the problem and in ter ms of what is happening, where, when, how, with whom and why. 3. Identify alternatives for approaches to resolve the problem a. At this point, it's useful to keep others involved (unless you' re facing a personal and/or employee performance problem). Brainstorm for solutions to the problem. Very simply put, brainstorming is collecting as many ideas as possi ble, and then screening them to find the best idea. It's critical when collecting the ideas to not pass any judgment on the ideas - just write them down as you hear them. 4. Select an approach to resolve the problem When selecti ng the b est approach, consider: a. Which approach is the mo st likely to so lve the problem for the long term? b. Which approach is the most realistic to accomplish for now? Do you have the resources? Are they affordable? Do you have enough time to implement the approach? c. What is the extent of risk a ssociated with each alternative? (The nature of this step, in particular, in the problem solving process is why problem solving and decision making are highly integrated.) 5. Plan the implementation of the best alternative (this is your action plan) a. Carefully consider \"What will th e situation look like when the problem is solved?\" 608 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] b. What steps should be taken to implement the best alternative to solving the problem? What systems or processes should be changed in your organization, for example, a new policy or procedure? Don't resort to solutions where someone i s \"just going to try harder\". c. How will you know if the steps are being followed or not? (thes e are your indicators of the success of your plan) d. What resources will you need in terms of people, money and faci lities? e. How much time will you need to im plement the solution? Write a schedule that includes the start and stop times, and when you expect to see certain indicators of su ccess. f. Who will primarily be responsible for ensuring implementation o f the plan? g. Write down the answers to the a bove questions and consider this as your action plan. h. Communicate the plan to those who will be involved in implement ing it and, at least, to your immediate supervisor. (An important aspect of this step in the problem-so lving process is continually observation and feedback.) 6. Monitor implementation of the plan Monitor the indicators of success: a. Are you seeing what you would ex pect from the indicators? b. Will the plan be done according to schedule? c. If the plan is not being followe d as expected, then consider: W as the plan realistic? Are there sufficient resources to accomplish the plan on schedule? Should more priority be placed on various aspects of the plan? Should the plan be changed? 7. Verify if the problem has been resolved or not One of the best ways to verify if a problem has been solved or not is to resume normal operations in the organization. Still, you should consider: a. What changes should be made to avoid this type of problem in th e future? Consider changes to policies and procedures, training, etc. b. Lastly, consider \"What did you learn from this problem solving? \" Consider new knowledge, understanding and/or skills. c. Consider writing a brief memo that highlights the success of th e problem solving effort, and what you learned as a result. Share it w ith your supervisor, peers and s ubordinates. 7-Step Problem Solving 1. Find the Right Problems to Solve. Too often our approach to probl em solving is reactive, we wait for the problems to arise. Firstly in our 7 problem solving steps, we advocate taking a proactive approach, go and find problems to solve; important and valuable problems. The real starting point then for any pro blem solving process is to find the right problem to solve. 2. Define the Problem It is very tempting to gloss over this step and move to analysi s and solutions. However, like the first step, it is one of the secrets of effective problem solving. Combining p roblems that are valuable to solve, with defining exactly what you are tr ying to solve, can dramatically improve the effectiveness of the problem solving process. The secret to defining the problem, is really about attitude. Try to see every problem as an opportunity. 3. Analyze the Problem Analysis is a process of discovery of the facts, finding out wh at you know about the situation. In doing so you are breaking down complexity, stripping away the superficia l and getting to the causes/issues. 4. Develop Opportunities There are always more than one way to solve a problem, so take time to develop plenty of creative possibilities to solve the problem. 5. Select the Best Solution 609 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Selecting is about making choices, about deciding. To do this y ou need to weigh up the competing value and risk of the different options y ou generated in the previous ste p. 6. Implement Good solutions are often only as good as the way they are imple mented. Implementation requires project management and a determination to deliver the outcomes essentia l to solving the problem you originally defined. 7. Evaluate and Learn You will have done some things r eally well through this seven s tep problem solving process. It would be all too easy to forget them in rushing to solve the next problem, o r to implement the solution. You should evaluate at least two areas: How you carried out the seven step problem solving process The effectiveness of the solution you implemented. Did it deliver the outcomes you expected? 610 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] 611 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Six Thinking Hats Looking at a decision from all points of view Take different perspectives. 'Six Thinking Hats' is an impor tant and powerful technique. It is used to look at decisions from a number of important perspectives. This forces you to move outside your ha bitual thinking style, and helps you to get a more rounded view of a situation. This tool was created by Edward de Bono in his book ' 6 Thinking Hats '. Many successful people think from a very rational, positive vie wpoint. This is part of the reason that they are successful. Often, though, they may fail to look at a problem f rom an emotional, intuitive, creative or negative viewpoint. This can mean that they underestimate resistance to plans, fail to make creative leaps and do not make essential contingency plans. Similarly, pessimists may be excessively defensive, and more em otional people may fail to look at decisions calmly and rationally. If you look at a problem with the 'Six Thinking Hats' technique , then you will solve it using all approaches. Your decisions and plans will mi x ambition, skill in execution, public sensitivity, creativity and good contingency planning. How to Use the Tool: You can use Six Thinking Hats in meetings or on your own. In me etings it has the benefit of blocking the confrontations that happen when people with different thinking styles discuss the same problem. Each 'Thinking Hat' is a differe nt style of thinking. These are explained below: White Hat: With this thinking hat, you focus on the data available . Look at the information you have, and see what you can learn from it. Look for gaps in your knowledge, and eit her try to fill them or take account of them. This is where you analyze past trends, and try to extrapolate f rom historical data. 612 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Red Hat: 'Wearing' the red hat, you look at problems using intuition, gut reaction, and emotion. Also try to think how other people will react emotionally. Try to understand the responses of people who do not fully know your reasoning. Black Hat: Using black hat thinking, look at all the bad points of the decision. Look at it cautiously and defensively. Try to see why it might not work. This is importan t because it highlights the weak points in a plan. It allows you to eliminate them, alter them, or prepare contingency plans to counter them. Black Hat thinking helps to make your plans 'tougher' and more resilient. It can also help you to spot fatal flaws and risks before you embark on a course of action. Black Hat thinking is one of the real benefits of this technique, as many successful people get so us ed to thinking positively that often they cannot see problems in advance. This leaves them under-prepared for difficulties. Yellow Hat: The yellow hat helps you to think positively . It is the optimistic viewpoint that helps you to see all the benefits of the decision and the value in it. Yellow Hat thinki ng helps you to keep going when everything looks gloomy and difficult. Green Hat: The Green Hat stands for creativity . This is where you can develop c reative solutions to a problem . It is a freewheeling way of thinking, in which there is little criticism of ideas. A whole range of creativity tools can help you here. Blue Hat: The Blue Hat stands for process control . This is the hat worn by people chairing meetings. When running into difficulties because ideas are running dry, they m ay direct activity into Green Hat thinking. When contingency plans are need ed, they will ask for Black Hat thinking, etc. 613 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] A variant of this technique is to look at problems from the poi nt of view of different professionals (e.g. police officer, public, administrators, etc.) or stakeholders. Example: The directors of a property company are looking at whether they should construct a new office building. The economy is doing well, and the amount of vacant office space is reducing sharply. As part of their decision they decide to use the 6 Thinking Hats technique during a planning m eeting. Looking at the problem with the White Hat, they analyze the data they have . They examine the trend in va cant office space, which shows a sharp reduction. They anticipate th at by the time the office block would be completed, that there will be a severe shortage of office space . Current government projections show steady economic growth for at least the construction period. With Red Hat thinking, some of the directors think the proposed building looks quite ugly. While it would be highly cost-effective, they worry that people would not like to work in it. When they think with the Black Hat , they worry that government projections may be wrong. The econ omy may be about to enter a 'cyclical dow nturn', in which case the offi ce building may be empty for a long time. If the building is not attractive, then companies will choose to work in another better-looking building at the same rent. With the Yellow Hat, however, if the economy holds up and their projections are co rrect, the company stands to make a great deal of money. If they are lucky, maybe they could sell the building before the next downturn, or rent to tenants on long-term leases that will last through any recession. With Green Hat thinking they consider whether they should change the design to make the building more pleasant. Perhaps they could build prestige offices that people would want to rent in any economic climate. Alternatively, maybe they shoul d invest the money in the short term to buy up property at a low cost when a recession comes. The Blue Hat has been used by the meeting's Chair to move between the different thinking styles. He or she may have needed to keep other mem bers of the team from switching styles, or from criticizing other peoples' points. It is well worth reading Edward de Bono's book 6 Thinking Hats for more information on this technique. Key Points: Six Thinking Hats is a good technique for looking at the effects of a decision from a number of different points of view. It allows necessary emotion and skepticism to be brought into w hat would otherwise be purely rational decisions. It opens up the opportunity for creativity within Decision Making. The technique also helps, for example, persistently pessimistic people to be positive and cre ative. Plans developed using the '6 Thinking Hats' technique will be s ounder and more resilient than would otherwise be the case. It may also help yo u to avoid public relations mis takes, and spot good reasons not to follow a course of action before you have committed to it. 614 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] \"Houston, We Have a Problem\": Leadership in Times of Crisis By: Winston Scott Perhaps you've never been called upon to lead in a situation as fraught with potential peril as the manual capture of a $10 million, 3,000-pound, out of control satellite in oute r space (the mission faced by the crew of the space shuttle Columbia in 1999), but business leaders face major cris es all the time: a scandal involving senior management, fall-out from an ec onomic downturn, product malfunc tion and recall or the loss of a key employee. Leadership under extreme conditions, like those encountered abo ard the Columbia, requires adherence to key principles that guide you, your team and your mission to success. The Columbia mission did ultimately succeed, and using the same principles of leadership that worked on this space mission, business leaders too can learn to turn obstacles into opportunities. Space Mission Lesson #1: Prepare for the Unknown A leader needs to anticipate any potential problems. The original Columbia mission was to launch a research satellite called Spartan, but the satellite malfunctioned almost immediately. The effort to retrieve it for repair went awry when the shuttle's r obotic arm inadvertently tipped t he satellite, setting this object\u2014roughly the size and weight of an automobile\u2014spi nning unpredictably in space. Because NASA and the Columbia crew had already prepared for potential problems, they immediately knew what to do next. Two spacewalking astronauts\u2014one on his first space flight\u2014had to perform a dange rous manual capture of the satellite. When an unanticipated problem o ccurs in business, leaders, like the astronauts, should be so thoroughly prepared that they already know what options and resources are available to help solve it. Otherwise, valuable time is wasted, during which the crisis may become even more di re. So in your business, determine what possible factors could caus e your company to suffer, and then devise action plans for dealing with each scenario. Should that problem ever occur, you will be able to react quickly and lead your team to victory. Space Mission Lesson #2: Conquer Communication Barriers Get to know the members of your t eam well. Ascertain their communication strengths and weaknesses, particularly in times of crisis. Don't assume that even the people closest to you will unde rstand your plans. It's never more important for everyone to be on the same page than w hen you're confronting a problem. To ensure that your message is communicated correctly, solicit feedback, asking \"Do you understand what I mean?\" to encourage clarifying questions and honest responses from your t eam. English was the second language of one of the spacewalkers, so the lead spacewalker spent a lot of time with him to ensure they were speaking the same language, literally, before they attempted to capture the satellite. What's more, in space, all direction is relative to something e lse, so to facilitate the ma nual capture of a satellite while cruising at 18,000 miles an hour, everyone on the team ne eds to know what \"up\" and \"down\" mean in that context. In the world of international space flight, there may be litera l language barriers to overcome, and in an organization, even if everyone s peaks the same language, the fi lters of culture sometimes put up major communication obstacles. Men and women may communicate differently, for example, and business leaders must ensure that communications' meaning and intent are clearly understood by everyone, especially when trying to solve a problem. Space Mission Lesson #3: Be Alert to Non-verbal Communication A good leader will pick up on cues to potential problems and mi sunderstandings before they arise. For example, while both the robot arm operator and one spacewalker on the Co lumbia mission were highly qualified individuals, both were on their first space flights. The lead s pacewalker observed that the other spacewalker 615 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] talked very little and kept to himself, away from the group. In response, he shared his own experiences on his first spacewalk, reassuring the othe r man that he empathized wi th his nervousness but was confident he would do well. As a business leader, you must know how key team members act on a normal basis so that you can recognize behavioral changes. When a cris is occurs, does your usually soc ial VP of Marketing lock himself in his office? Does your usually mild-mannered CF O begin barking orders like a drill sergeant? These are telltale, non-verbal cues that you must step in and take the lead. Space Mission Lesson #4: Ask for Help A leader must demonstrate an i mmediate understanding of the pro blem. You can't appear wishy-washy, even if, at the moment, you don't have a clue what's going wrong. You ne ed to demonstrate self-assurance to show that you're in control. People follow confidence. Keep in mind, however, that confident doesn't mean omniscient. You must solicit input and feedback from the experts both on your team and outside the team. NASA rehearsed the satellite's capture on the ground and sent images up to the shuttle. The sp acewalkers constructed a Spartan simulator for practice, and the team leader rehearsed the terminology to use in the capture and to direct t he commander where to fly the shuttle to get it close enough to the satellite so they could reach out with glov ed hands and manually direct the satellite back into the shuttle. You don't need to know every single nut and bolt involved in ev ery single person's job, but there are people on your staff who are more expert in certain areas than you are. A cknowledge that and benefit from it when planning and problem-solving. Space Mission Lesson #5: Earn Real Experience Business leaders, like astronauts, obviously need technical tra ining in their fields, but equally important are maturity and experience at making difficult real-time decisions . There's a reason you never see 22-year-old astronauts! You must have complete confidence in your ability t o make critical judgments and to take action in tough situations\u2014and the only way to acquire that confidence is through real-world experience. While mounted in foot restraints on the edge of the shuttle, th e Columbia spacewalkers spent 3\u00bd hours safely manipulating the satellite into the single orientation that wou ld fit it into the payload bay. The leader had never before attempted this particular mission, but he did have a vas t array of experience\u2014even some mistakes\u2014that gave him the focus a nd determination that were essential to keep 3,000 pounds of mass from getting out of control, where it might injure the spacewalkers or damage the s pace shuttle. As you came up through the business ranks, decisions you made may have cost your department money, set back a safety record, or otherw ise affected some critical aspec t of the business, but all of that is part of your essential on-the-job education. Leaders Reach for the Stars As NASA knows, one of the main c onsiderations for hiring or pro moting senior management must be their level of experience, training, and education in problem solving, espe cially in a crisis situation. Have they turned critical circumstances around? Do they thrive or shrink in the face of disaster? Whether walking in space or walking into a boardroom, good lead ers must not only be prepared for everything that might go wrong, they must c ome alive when faced with a thorny situation, large or small. Great leaders have confidence, can communicate what's necessary to handle a p roblem, and know how to best utilize the skills of each member of their team to solve it.

Updating Ethics Training\u2014Policing Privacy Series: Managing Risk by Reducing Internal Litigation By Thomas J. Martinelli, Adjunct Professor, Wayne St ate University, Detroit, Michigan; and Lawrence E. Shaw, Inspector, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, In vestigations and Forensic Scie nce Program, Tallahassee, Florida For years, ethics trainers hav e taught that all illegal behavio r committed by a sworn member is unethical, but that not all unethical behavior is illegal. Still, policy nonco mpliance involving department investigations into members' private lives remains a dicey business. Invariably, de partment policies and procedures dictate that sworn members, and sometimes th e non-sworn, must conduct themse lves both on duty and off duty in accord with their organizations' exp ectations, citizen expectations, a nd ethical expectations, and not according to their own subjective privacy expectations. These are training issues that must be addressed at an academy level as well as during annual in-service training sessions. Time and time again, officers accu sed of policy noncompliance f or unethical behavior claim that they did not know that legal, but questionably moral, behavior would subject them to department discipline. The law enforcement profession demands the highest standards of duty an d credibility in its members in order to accomplish its mission to protect and serve. This demand implie s that the mission strictly adheres to the tenets of the profession and is carried out constitutionally, ethicall y, and legally. This philosophical template of professionalism is the cornerstone of productive community-policing relations. In the end, citizens are the stakeholders of policing services , and reducing department internal litigation, specifically unethical misconduct and privacy issues, is a mandatory organization-wide challenge. 625 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Minimizing Litigation Is Managing Risk Renowned lawman, lawyer, and a nnual IACP conference presenter G ordon Graham travels the country speaking about what managing risk entails in law enforcement circles.1 He uses a succinct definitio n for risk management, describing it as \"any activity that involves the evaluation or comparison of risks and the development, selection, and implementation of control measures that change, reduce, or eliminate the probability or the consequences of a harmful action.\" 2 He has several risk management catch phrases applicable to law enforcement, such as \"every identifiable risk is a manageable risk\"; \"the errors that he will make can be predic ted from the errors he has made\"; \"things that go wrong in life are predictable, a nd predictable is preventable\"; and \"discipline is a form of training.\" Graham understands policing and is adamant about supervisory pr oactive prevention as he lectures on the costly mistakes made by supervisors fa iling to adequately supervise. M ore times than not, department liability is the result of \"a supervisor not behaving like a supervisor.\"3 Graham repeatedly emphasizes that running a police department is a systemic team effort, and when tragedies occur, management drops the supe rvisory ball and fails in its supervisory duties. Examples of dropping the supervisory ball include failures to a dequately educate swor n personnel regarding department expectations of bot h on-duty and off-duty conduct re garding unethical behavior. In police training circles, there is a distinct disconnect between training blocks regarding \"coffee shop ethics\" and gratuities and training blocks regarding officer privacy expectations. Specifi cally, there is a lack of attention and policy implementation to both off-duty activities and department-relat ed information technology oversight. Graham's wisdom regarding managing risk can be applied to the a stronomical costs associated with internal litigation. These are the lawsuits employees engage in regarding labor law issues and discipline. To reduce liability, attorneys' fees, and ho urs spent in defense of lawsu its, law enforcement executives must repeatedly provide notice through training of department expectations for officer behavior. An agency can markedly reduce its liability from internal lawsuits (police officers supplemen ting their incomes by suing their departments) if designated blocks of training address organizational expectations pertaining to officer privacy issues. Training curriculums must explain what \"keeping one's private life unsullied as an example to all\" means in today's policing values. Minimizing inte rnal lawsuits through notice re duces or eliminates costly litigation. In these times of having to do more with l ess, this is a cost-saving man agerial tool that can provide only positive dividends for the future. Others have mirrored Graham's definition regarding the organiza tional duties associated with departmental liability, which states that \"ri sk management is a process that also includes basic managerial functions: planning, organizing, and leading, as well as controlling agency losses a t a reasonable cost. It uses accepted managerial techniques in order to preserve the assets of an organization o r entity.\" 4 This systemic accountability demands department-wide training in the a gency's expectations of office r behavior both on duty and off duty; policy implementation; vigilante superv ision; and strict, swift, and c ertain discipline for policy noncompliance. Middle management buy-in for identifying potential risk, coupled with the use of early warning systems, is critical for success. Otherwise, organizationa l dysfunction results and can prove costly in civil court, win or lose. When a member of a police depart ment sues the department, the ultimate losers are the st akeholder citizens. This is an inexcusable cost that must be avoided. Failing to fo llow a risk management template for success, which must commence with a block of training comprehensively di scussing systemic notice in training, can result in protracted internal litigation. What is worse is the problematic reality of having to reinstate a poor employee, with back pay, because a policy was void for vaguenes s or was inadequately addressed in training curriculums. Maintaining written records of training curricula and attendees is a strong defense against an officer's \"I didn't know\" defense. Lastly, prioritizing potential risks is the key to successful r isk management. 5 There are plaintiff attorneys who make their livings suing departments regarding fatalities resulting from police shootings and pursuits. These are 626 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] priorities that agencies historically have had to address due t o their relative frequency and are generally forgiven by civil juries in wrongful death actions. Time and time again, the dangerousness of the j ob, the tragic situations officers confront on a daily basis, and the split-second decisi on-making processes officers have to engage in cause juries to side with police departments. These lawsuits, t hough a part of the public service professions, must be minimized at all costs. Civil trials for internal litigation involving unethical office r behavior and privacy issues may find that taxpayers are not as forgiving of the police in their jury verdicts as th e disciplined officers would like them to be. Taxpayers are the clientele of t he police department, and knowl edge of their officers' off-duty promiscuity, on- duty derelictions, and sexual trysts may not result in their bl ind-faith forgiveness. Agencies have a duty in assessing their risk management pr iorities to minimize or allev iate the potential for all types of costly internal litigation. Privacy Expectations and Off-Duty Sexual Trysts Labor law literature is rife with examples of officers involved in off-duty sexual trysts. For years, police ethics trainers have referred to a wrongf ul discharge lawsuit wherein an officer involved his wife, his 18-year-old sister-in-law, his scout car p artner, and tangentially, his ent ire department in a sex scandal that resulted in his termination.6 Rumors were rampant throughout the department that the 18-year- old was engaged in nefarious relations with numerous officers. The woman's par ents complained to the chief, the mayor, and eventually to the media. Once the internal investigation was finalized, it was discovered the officer in question solely orchestrated sexual trysts with his scout car partner and hi s wife in order to seduce his 18-year-old sister-in-law. The key to this case was the court's conclusion that the termin ated officer knew, or should have known, that his legal but unethical off-duty behavior could cost him his job. H is actions constituted unbecoming conduct, brought discredit to the entire department, and gave the citize nry, through extended media coverage, the perception that their police officers spent more time pursuing sex than protecting the streets. In upholding the officer's termination, the court rejected the defense that the officer did not know his off-duty unethical behavior would deprive him of his job and police pens ion. In fact, the court used the IACP Code of Ethics as the template of notice, stating that the officer knew he was to 'keep his private life unsullied as an example to all' if he wished to be a part of this noble profess ion. In a paramilitary struc tured organization, such unethical behavior is dysfunctional and tarnishes the good imag e of the agency in the public's eye. Further, thousands of taxpayer dollars were used by the departm ent to defend the lawsu it. In this case, one can conclude that the agency's termination process took many hours to investigate; litigate (in department labor hearings); and eventually defe nd in civil court. These internal law enforcement lawsuits are counterproductive, inefficient, and require significant time and money. In the end , the citizens the agency is tasked to serve are the losing faction. Internal litigation is a management risk that is predictable, p reventable, and can usually be avoided, or minimized, with adequate training , policy implementation, and m iddle management buy-i n. There must be an organizational understanding, betw een rank and file, as to priv acy expectations of the department and written policies supporting that understanding. Organizational training mandates limiting employee privacy expectations, coupled with department policy compliance measure s, are the keys to successfully diminishing internal lawsuits. Information Technology, Privacy Expectations, and Internal Litigation In this age of information technology (IT), there will always b e the organizational cha llenges of expediting law enforcement services through technological means and employee p rivacy expectations associated with these IT tools. One could argue it is a dereliction of duty for a law en forcement agency to not embrace this modern age of technology in order to better serve its constituents. But as the tools of the trade become more sophisticated, the rules of law associated with the use or abuse of those tools be comes more challenging. 627 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Police administrators must employ a comprehensive IT privacy po licy that instructs all sworn personnel using agency-supplied technological equipment that this equipment is to be used solely for police matters; that all communiqu\u00e9s will be randomly audited for work-related purposes; and that there exists no employee expectation of privacy for the use of such technological equipm ent. In this way, misc onduct allegations are reduced, internal investigations are minimized, discipline in this regard is practically nonexistent, and plaintiff lawyers will have less causes of action to sue departments. Organized policy implementation reduces departmental risk, but poorly drafted or vague policies have forever provided internal litigation headaches in policing. The wording in the policies themselves, coupled with assumptions, implications, and a blind faith that employees wil l always do what is morally right, have cost agencies time, money, and sometimes a drop in morale with incre ased employee cynicism. The \"supervisory logic of good faith\" 7 presumes that subordinates will comply with policies and proce dures and can police themselves in regard to policy compliance issues. As Graham sai d at IACP 2009 in Denver, \"Show me a tragedy in law enforcement\u2014and almost without exception (and there are some exceptions) I will show you the fingerprints of a supervisor not behaving like a supervisor.\"8 The U.S. Supreme Court recently had to adjudicate a poorly worded and poorly implemented department IT policy in deciding Fourth Amendment privacy issues. In the case City of Ontario, Ca lifornia, et al. v. Quon, the Ontario, California, police department provided its special weapons and tactics (SWAT) team members with alphanumer ic pagers, as the court put it, \"in order to help the SWAT team mobilize and respond to emergency situations.\"9 The agency purchased 25,000 text characters (letters and spaces) a month for each member's pager , and the text messages from the pagers were subject to the agency's computer policy. That policy stated that the city reserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or wit hout notice, and that \"users should have no expectation of privacy or conf identiality when using these reso urces.\"10 Subsequent training at a staff meeting for the SWAT team and a memo fro m the chief further stressed that the texts sent on the SWAT pagers were considered departmental e-mail and were subject to random audit s. The plaintiff, a sergeant on the SWAT team, fully acknowledged the computer policy, the relevance of the pa ger's use with that policy, and the 25,000 character limit per month. Despite this departmental policy of notice and officer acknowledgement, the sergeant filed a Fourth Amendment privacy rights violation suit against his employer after he was disciplined for his improper use of the SWAT pager. The sergeant's discipline resulte d from an internal affairs inv estigation regarding his on-duty use of the pager for personal matters. The chief a udited the team's text message s to see if the department needed to purchase more monthly characters. The internal affairs investigation con cluded that the plaintiff, in the month of August alone, sent or received 400 personal messages while on duty, which had nothing to do with the duties associated with the SWAT team. His record f or one day at work was 80 text messages, and his daily average for sent or received personal messages was 25 texts. The investigation also discovered that some of the on-duty personal messages were sexually explicit in nature. After the sergeant w as disciplined, he filed his privacy violations lawsuit. Despite the presence of a written computer policy; further trai ning on that policy; and a memo from the chief stating that all departmental networking, including the text me ssages from the SWAT pagers, were subject to random audits, the plaintiff argue d his privacy expectations to the on-duty texts were violated. He argued that a subsequent verbal agreement betw een the team and its lieutenant nullified the computer policy, at least in regard to the SWAT pagers. The lieutenant assured the team members no one from the agency would audit the team's text messages as long as they personally reimbursed the city for all monthly overages exceeding the allotted 25,000 texts per month, per pager. The court ruled in favor of the department. Though the U.S. Supreme Court's analysis is long and arduous, r eading between the lines facilitates a swifter conclusion. The court concluded that the plaintiff had a limited expectation of privacy, if any at all, and that the search was reasonable under the cir cumstances and under any Fou rth Amendment application. 628 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The majority relied heavily on the facts of the case. The plain tiff was a supervisor. He knew the policies and the agency's purpose behind those policies. He was on a special tac tical team, held to higher standards than street- level supervisors due to the da ngerous nature and duties of a S WAT team. The purpose behind the acquisition of the pagers was to facilitate wor k-related communications betwee n the team members. The court concluded that the plaintiff was a veteran officer an d knew, or should have known, that department- issued communication technologies are many times subject to (1) review for performance evaluations; (2) reasonable Freedom of Information Act requests by citizens or the media; and (3) the lenient discovery rules used in civil lawsuits, especia lly lawsuits in which SWAT team members most likely would be involved. For these operational realities, coupl ed with knowledge and notice of the computer policy, the court rejected the plaintiff's expectation of privacy argument. In this discussion of managing risk by reducing internal litiga tion, how did such a case, as costly as it was to the taxpayers of that community, asce nd to the U.S. Supreme Court? On its face, the sergeant did not seem to have much of a legal leg to stand on from the outset. This is where poor policy drafting and poor policy implementation can cost an age ncy the multitude of hours and at torney fees associated with such internal litigation. First, as previously mentioned, the plaintiff hung his privacy expectations argument on the lieutenant's subsequent verbal assertions tha t the department would not audi t the SWAT team's text messages as long as the team members paid for their own overages. The lieutenant lacked the authority and the policy-making powers to circumvent a written department al policy, and the court recogni zed that. This is an issue that must be addressed in supervisory training circles . Verbal, additional, or implied changes to written departmental policies cloud misconduct issues and disciplinary procedures and may fail in l abor law hearings. Secondly, the computer policy and subsequent text message train ing for the SWAT team never specifically addressed personal usage of the p agers, whether used on duty or off duty, and the discipline to be meted out for any policy noncompliance. It seems that as long as the team mem bers did not exceed the 25,000 characters allotted, personal use, both on and off duty, was permissible. But had the plaintiff never exceeded his monthly characters, would the chief have been justified in ordering an audit of the text messages? The answer is yes; all random audits in policing have a special needs purpose in the p rofessional administration of a department, and employee privacy should never be an issue. Why, then, was a costly jury tria l held to determine the chief' s intent in ordering and auditing the team's text messages? The departmental tec hnology policies themselves never mentioned that the chief, the internal affairs department, or anyone with the authority to audit those message s had to rely on a Fourth Amendment exception to read those employee messages. Random audits in the workplace are just that: random, with no need for reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or allegations of miscond uct. A random audit policy gives administrators carte blanche authority to audit all technological communication associated with department-issued equipment. Random audits of in-car videos , in-car lien communications, and Internet audit trails are specifically intended to deter employee abuses. The philosophy behind random audit polic ies is to deter any employee temptations to abuse their access to the specifi c technology available. This s hould have been explicitly written in the computer policy in order to deter the very behavior the plaintiff engage d in: his personal texting on duty. A time-consuming, costly jury trial was held to decide the chie f's intent in auditing the team's text messages. Written random audit policies a lleviate any causes of action fo r bad faith, illegal search es, or maliciousness on the part of a chief of police or the internal affairs unit. Though the j u ry ruled in favor of the chief, concluding that hi s audit had a legitimate, work-related purpose, thousands of taxpayer dollars were spent on this trial, as well as the monies spent for the appellate case and eventual U.S. Supreme Court pro ceedings. Focused policy verbiage regarding the agency's intent to conduct random audits, coupled with freque nt random audits and appropri ate disciplinary measures, most likely would have deterred the sergeant's abuse of the pager and eliminated any internal litigation paid for by taxpayer 629 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] dollars. Notice, through training curricula, of how policies wi ll be implemented and supervised is the key to limiting costly litigation. Taxpayers are the stakeholders in the police business. The majority of justices, in this case, questioned what society accepts as proper behavior in regard to technological p rivacy expectations in the workplace. The answer is most likely that private citizens have little expectation of privacy at the workplace regarding their employer- issued desktops, laptops, and networking tools. In order to dec rease extraneous Internet surfing, following sporting events, and excessive pe rsonal e-mailing during work h ours, private employers issue directives informing their employees that a udit trails are randomly conduc ted to prevent such wasteful uses of their work time and their computers. In his concurrence with the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia re iterated his position from a previous employment privacy case wherein he wrote \"that government searches to retr ieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules\u2014searches of the sort that are reg arded as reasonable and normal in the private employer context\u2014do not violate the . . . Amendment.\"11 The laws of privacy continue to evolve in criminal courts and i n labor law courts. As technological advances continue to enhance police services, agencies must revisit thei r own policies and procedures related to informational technology and employee privacy expectations. Onl y through training programs can department notice be established regarding policy implementation. Addition ally, comprehensive ethics training curriculums must emphasize the sanctity of p rivacy issues in policing, both as applied to target citizen investigations and to internal affairs issues. Internal lawsuits are counterproductiv e and costly in relation to the overall agency mission to protect and serve. Thomas J.

Risk Management (at its simplest) is a \"process for managing th e risks that you can identify -- and insuring those you can't manage.\" It uses accepted managerial techniques in order to preserve the assets of the organization or entit y. The Risk Management process is comprise d of two separate, but equally important components, risk control and risk financing. Risk control involves identifying the organization s risk expos ures, examining the various alternatives available to either eliminate those risks that can be eliminated or mitig ate the effects of those that cannot be eliminated, selecting the best alternative or combination of alternatives to deal with each risk exposure, implementing the chosen techniques, and monitoring the process for the purpose of altering or improving the program based on the observed results. Risk fina ncing is the method or methods b y which an organization chooses to pay for those losses that result from the vari ous risk exposures the organiza tion faces. Because the decision as to how to finance losses is generally l eft to the elected officials within each particular municipality, you (and your department s administrators) will h ave little control or influence on this aspect of the risk management function. The area where your efforts will best impact, where your influence and control will be felt, and noticed, is in the risk control arena. For th is reason, the remainder of this article will focus on the risk control aspects of your municipality's overall risk ma nagement program. Definitions Terms to Know Before proceeding further, it is important that we all know and understand the terms and their meanings, as used frequently within the risk management profession. EXPOSURE: An exposure is any circumstan ce, item or situation that has th e potential to cause a loss. LOSS: An actual expenditure as a resu lt of an incident. An expenditu re does not necessarily require a monetary outlay. The lost service of an employee is a loss. RISK: The degree of likelihood that a loss will occur. HAZARD: A condition or situation that has a high probability of causin g a loss. INCIDENT: An occurrence with a poten tial for a resulting loss. CLAIM: A formal notification that an incident has occurred. LIABILITY LOSS: A loss arising when an individua l or organization files suit a lleging wrongdoing. A loss is incurred whenever funds are expended as a result of the lawsuit to investigate or defend the suit, and to pay a settlement, judgment or award whether the suit has merit or not. A loss results irrespective of any judgment or award. Dispelling the Myth All too often, people mistakenly believe that risk management i s something created by, and for the benefit of, insurance companies. Nothing is further from the truth. Control ling risk is a management function, created by management to reduce its need for, or reliance on, traditional commercial insurance co mpanies as the sole means of paying for losses. In fact, most professional risk managers judge the success of t heir efforts based on the amount of insurance they are forced to purchase after implementing their program. The le ss insurance they need, the more successful their efforts. The theory is that a lthough risk cannot be entirely el iminated, the frequency and severity of those losses that do occur can be minimized. T his, in turn, allows t he organ ization to finance losses by alternative methods such as retaining them rather than by paying the seemingly exor bitant premiums charged by traditional 631 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] commercial insurers. The entity can invest the monies saved or use them to grow and expand the organization. This philosophy is completely compatible with the needs of muni cipal government. With more tax dollars available, the municipality can more effectively, with increase d cost efficiency, provide the services the community has come to expect. The increased savings can be used to purchase patrol cars, increase manpower, pay for sidewalk reconstruction, or finance any other priority item. Due to this increased awareness of the need to manage risk, man y public entities are joining together to form risk management pools, which are very unlike traditional commer cial insurers. Most pools are tax exempt, non- profit, quasi-governmental organizations that provide insurance type coverages and services by way of a joint arrangement. Participating muni cipalities \"pool\" their funds to cover each other's lo sses by group purchase of insurance coverage, thereby avoi ding the prohibitive premium pr ices charged to individual municipalities by commercial insurers. It's very m uch like buying wholesale. For this reason, it is to everyone's benefit to contain and control losses. For risk cont rol practices to provide maxim um benefit to all pool members, all members must aggressively participate in the risk control process. As a police trainer or administrator, you are a risk manager. Y ou train for and manage the hundreds, or thousands, of interactions betw een your department s officers a nd the public, and you do this on a daily basis. These interactions all carry the potential for litigation, but more importantly they create the possibility of injury to your department s officers or citizens. It is your responsib ility to train for and manage the daily activities of your department s personnel in such a manner as to maintain the lowest possible chance of loss. That's the bad news. The good news is that, if y our municipality is a member o f a risk management pool, you're not in this alone. Until recently, police trainers and executives in pool member municipalities had nowhere to turn for advice, input, or direction on ways to manage their department's unique exposures. However, man y pools are committed to providing the best possible coverage at the lowest possible price and believe that the risk control function will assist in achieving these goals. In some pooling organizations, this has led to the creation and funding of specific law enforcement risk control e fforts. Now, through the developm ent of a strong, long term relationship with your law enforcement risk control specialists, many law enforcement trainers and administrators have a resource available through which information and recommendations can be obtained. Through this relationship many benefits and advantages can be achieved. Primary among these be nefits is the opportunity to provide input that will affect the decisions made concerning the type and nature of services provided, specially tailored to your department's needs. Through a c ooperative effort, by everyone w orking toward the same objective, you will greatly impact the amount of losses your department, and thus your pooling organization, incurs. Where to Start? Before you can take positive steps to reduce your risk exposure s, you have to know what risks you face. You must analyze and identify the ar eas within your department s da y to day operations that hold the potential for causing losses. This can be done in a variety of ways, many of which your law enforcement risk control specialists are ready and able to assist you with. Exposures ca n be identified by examining past loss experience and histories, on-site surveys , questionnaires, and by consulting with experts both from inside and outside your department. The identification process is the most important step in any concerted risk control program. Of the various identification techniques available, on-site ris k assessment surveys conducted by your pool s law enforcement risk control staff members, and a review of loss \"r uns\" or histories provide the greatest amount of insight in to those exposures uniqu e to the delivery of police s ervices, and identify trends or patterns within your department that may be cause for concern. Loss histories, which can be provided by most pooling organizations, document not only the severity (cost) of past losses, but the f requency with which they occur. If your agency or department does not have a signi ficant history of losses, much valuable information can be gleaned from examining loss histories of comparable agencies or municipaliti es. 632 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Frequency vs. Severity By looking at past occurrences, we frequently can predict futur e events. By examining how frequently a loss causing situation has occurred in the past, we can predict with a certain degree of accu racy how often it will occur in the future. By reviewi ng the cost, or severity, of prior losses we can make an informed decision as to which conditions deserve priority attention and how best to fin ance the larger losses. When reviewing loss histories yo u will quickly discover that, f ortunately, there is usually an inverse relationship between frequency and severity. T hose events that occur most fr equently tend to be less severe in nature. Conversely, the most severe inci dents occur much less frequentl y. With enough experience, or history, an analysis will further show that based on the frequency with whi ch events occur a reasonably accurate forecast as to the severity of future lo sses can be made. That's the good n ews. The bad news is this creates another problem that police trainers and executives must deal with. Statistically we know that frequenc y predicts severity. The iss ue, then, becomes one of foreseeability. If an event is predictable, is its fut ure occurrence foreseeable, in a legal sense? And, if it's foreseeable, do we have a duty to act? AND, if we fail to act, are we behaving in a negli gent manner? The answer to all of these questions is most probably Yes! The courts often refer to this as being on \"notice\". Stated sim ply, you knew, or should have known, that a particular event or occurrence would take place. Courts have fu rther ruled that if the need to take action is obvious, failure to act demonstrates a \"deliberate indifference\" towards the civil rights effected citizens. In other words, if something is foreseeable, if it is predictable, if it is likely to occur, it cannot be ignored as a potential problem. Beyond the potential for litigation when a critical situation i s left unresolved, is the likelihood of officer injury as a direct result of a department s failure to deal with such a situation (lack of or improper training is a good example). Not only do sound risk control practices insure a higher level of officer safety and result in cost savings to the municipality, but they are, in some instances, r equired by contemporary court decisions. Risk Control Techniques Once your risk exposures are identified, the next step is to choose the technique, or combination of techniques, best suited to effectively eliminate or control the exposure. T here are five basic risk control techniques. Some can produce the desired results in and of themselves, others wo rk best when used in combination, dependent on the particular exposure being d ealt with. These five basic tech niques are defined here: RISK AVOIDANCE: Voluntarily choosing to no longer participate in the activity that creates or causes the loss. If you no longer provide the service or perform the funct ion that created the loss exposure in the first place, you are no longer faced with the exposure. Examples of risk avoidance would include disbanding a SWAT team or canine unit, refusing to allow civilian ride-alongs in patro l cars, prohibiting misdemeanor pursuits, or a prohibition on the carrying of blackjacks or sap gloves. For law enforcement, risk avoida nce is not always an option. Th ere are some things we just have to do, but it is nonetheless a desirable technique w here its implementation does not significantly interfere with the delivery of vital and necessary police services. PREVENTION OF LOSSES: Prevention involves measures or activities undertaken before a loss occurs, in an attempt to prevent the loss causing event from happening, or to render its impact less significant. Examples of preventive measures are the creation and implementation of soun d policies that provide appropriate guidance to line level officers, continuous and on-going in-service trainin g, patrol cars equipped with prisoner screens, and the issuance of latex gloves for the prevention of infection. T he primary objective of loss prevention is to reduce the frequency with which the loss causing event occurs. 633 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] REDUCTION OF LOSSES: Reduction techniques can be implemented either before or after a particular loss occurs, in an attempt to reduce the amount of the loss or damag es that may result. Sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, soft body armor, and vehicle safety belts are ex amples of reduction measures. These activities are intended to minimize the potentia l severity of loss. They do no t prevent the loss causing event from occurring. SEGREGATION OF RESOURCES: This technique actually consists of two separate elements dupl ication and separation, both having subs tantially the same goal: to seg regate the agency's res ources so that no one event can significantly impair the overall operation of the organizat ion. Basically, segregation involves not placing all your eggs in one basket. Duplication involves the use or creation of spares or backups, to be used only in the event the primary or original item is damaged or destroyed. Examples of duplication are tape backups of computerized data, spare patrol cars left in reserve, or an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) housed in another location that is only utilized if a power failure or natural disaster renders the pri mary communications facility inoperable. These items for the most part sit, unused, until after a loss occurs. Duplication efforts are intended to reduce the severity of potential losses becau se the department can still f unction, although possibly with less efficiency. Separation is similar to duplica tion in that facilities, operations or items are duplicated in other locations. The difference is that these facilities or items are used on a daily basis. Examples of separa tion would be the creation of precincts or mini-stations that provide full service on a da ily basis, and can serve to take up the slack in the event the primary loca tion becomes disabled or inoperable. Separation also targets potential severity, but because of its daily u sage, can actually increase the frequency of losses. TRANSFER OF RISK: Transfer techniques are used to transfer, or move, the risk from one party to another. The most common examples of transfer strategies are the use of waiver forms, hold harmless agreements, insurance policies, and contracting with others for services su ch as prisoner transports or lodging. Ideally, to receive maximum benefit from transfer arrangements, the organiz ation strives to transfer both legal and financial responsibilities for an incurred loss, although this is not always possible. Implementing an Effective Risk Control Program With an understanding of risk c ontrol fundamentals it is now po ssible for you, the police trainer or executive, to begin to design and implement a risk control program tailored t o the needs of your individual department or agency. When planning how best to implement your program, it's important that you never lose sight of the fact that effective risk control prac tices involve more than just li tigation avoidance. Of primary importance is officer safety and survival. A program that is founded on this premise will not only encourage officers to work safer and smarter, but will also, because of an obvious overlap in th e issues that create both injury and liability, significantly impact liability concerns. While researching the losses incurred by your department you wi ll probably find that officers are getting hurt in the process of creating liability. The same things that cause o fficers to get hurt cause many of the civil suits we are forced to defend. Police offi cers are routinely involved in inherently dangerous situations, they carry a variety of weapons that can injure or kill, they drive cars at high speeds, and they have to take violent or resistive subjects into custody. All of these activities can re sult in officer injury or litigation. It is entirely that a concentrated effort to reduce th e potential for officer injury will positively influence your liability exposures. The law enforcement profession has, however, routinely placed a greater emphasis on avoiding liability. Not only has this failed to work, but it has also resulted in the l oss of t he valuable service of some of our best and brightest officers. We must, therefore, shift our emphasis, and implement a risk control program based on a top- down initiative. All levels within the agency, beginning with t he chief executive, must be sold on the need and value of such a program, and encouraged to implement and practice sound risk control measures in all of their daily encounters with the public. 634 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Police executives, supervisors, and line officers must feel a s ense of ownership in the program. They must all feel they have participated in, or been allowed the opportunity to provide input into, the decision making process that led to the development and implementation of the program. At the executive level, manager s must willingly take responsibi lity for oversight and control of the program by developing sound procedural doc uments and by providing crucial in-service training in critical skills areas, and supervisory training to the agency's middle level managers. At the supervisory level, employees must accept responsibility for oversight of line officers' daily activities to ensure that they conform to department policy, and are performed in a manner consiste nt with the agency's approved training. Supervisors must also communicate with police executives concerning th e effectiveness, or continued feasibility, of the c hosen techniques, policies, trai ning, or programs. Finally, if risk control techniques are to be effective, line l evel officers need to believe in the principles on which they are founded, so that t he basic concepts are appropri ately translated to the streets. They must understand the need for and comply with requirements to report all relevant and important data, so that activities can be monitored and measured aga inst the intended goals of the risk control program. Without the line officer's feedback, it is impossible to monitor the risk control program and make necessary and appropriate adjustments to enhance and improve it. 635 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] References Ashley, S.

To prepare and plan for the fut ure, a few business concepts should be introduced to our profession. If used correctly (or at times, at all) , these can help your organizati on succeed and certainly weather this storm of uncertain budgets. As law enforcement leaders move toward data-driven decisions, t hese processes will help prepare you for the fight (discussion) with your boss about eliminating or keeping a program, or introducing something new. Organizational Assessments First and foremost, you must understand where your organization is, what it needs to grow (assets, physical plant, deployment, training), and other areas of concern. This means that you need to take the time and conduct an internal organizational assessment. With law enforcement departments fighting for tax dollars and b udget against the roads, parks and recreation, fire department, general city office, and any other project that is planned for the upcoming year, the best way is to be prepared to argue how the money will be used. Your prover bial ducks should be in a row. \"Organizational Assessments are powerful tools for identifying an organization's strengths and weaknesses. They are a critical starting point for initiating any type of o rganizational change\" (Stark 2009). The organizational assessment pr ocess should be an honest criti que of your organization. This type of assessment is not a \"bitch session\" but a critical review of yo ur shortcomings, and things you are doing well. For those working in larger or ganizations, this assessment can be done by units, divisions, or shifts. There are a variety of ways you can conduct an organization assessment; the most simple thing that can be done is to review data from dispatch and records and compare year over year stati stics, and look for any dramatic increases and/or extreme reduction and attemp t to provide an answer. But another option is to examine everything: training, deployme nt, crime areas, investigations, patrol, and office operations. Compare miles driven by shift, training issues, contacts, calls for service, and any data point that you would like to know about. Comprehensive Planning Comprehensive planning is key to achieving success in any long range plan, complex idea, or project. The process itself predates the United States of America. Comprehen sive planning was used in drafting of important documents like the Articles of Confederation and the Constituti on. The process is used by businesses, schools, and all levels of government. The plan is something that is real and prepares the organization[s] for the future (Becker & Kelly, 2000). Planning is a rational way of pre paring for the future. It typically involves the gathering and analysis of data, the examination of possible future trends, the consideration of alt ernative scenarios, some score of analysis of costs, and benefits...choosing a preferre d scenario and plan for implementation. (Becker & Kelly, p.17) 647 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Organizational change is pervasi ve today, as organizations stru ggle to adapt or face decline in the volatile environments of a global economic and political world. The many potent forces in these environments \u2014 competition, technological innovations, professionalism, and de mographics, to name a few \u2014 shape the process of organizational adaptation. As a result, organizations may shift focus, modify goals, restr ucture roles and respons ibilities, and develop new forms. Adaptive efforts such as these may be said to fall under the general rubric of redesign. (National Research Council Staff, 1997, p. 11) Strategic Planning The strategic plan provides for: 1.) Better informed, more timely decisions through continuous strat egic thinking 2.) Clear direction to the organization on what the company will do , and perhaps more importantly, what it will not do 3.) Greater empowerment with clearly understood boundaries communicated to the entire organization Departmental Implications With a solid comprehensive plan, law enforcement agencies should be able to sustain c urrent funding trends and quite possible weather the storm when lean times come. For example with data driven inf ormation, departments can demon strate how they improve safety within their community. Specific information re garding traffic enforcement, arrests, investigations, and services can be used to demonstrate how effective th e law enforcement agency. Once the department has started the planning process it prepare s for community changes to include; demographic shifts, transit populations, tax decreases, and other problems that have recently confronted communities. In Conclusion... In these recent years, law enfor cement funding has been difficu lt to forecast. Budgets are shrinking, grant opportunities are few and far between. Preparing for the future through comprehensive planning, and st rategic planning is key to long-lasting survival. Projecting when you will need to replace things and how to use money effectively is of vital importance. Try to forecast for the future you will be surprised with what improvements and changes you will be able to prepare and plan for. References Becker, B., & Kelly, E. (2000).

As we look forward to the years ahead, we are instantly faced with a number of challenges to overcome: shrinking budgets, rising crime rates and prisoner realignment to name a few. We recognize the compelling need to move forward as an organization despite the obstacles in our way, hence the creation of this Strategic Plan. If we fail to act on the future, we know the future will act on us. Building on the successes of our last Strategic Plan 2006-2010, we learned from the experience gained in the planning process and can now appreciate the benefits of long range planning. The Strategic Plan provides our department with a framework from which we can make sound decisions and prepare our budget accordingly. The plan will act as a blueprint enabling us to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow; it is dynamic and will require regular evaluation to ensure its effectiveness. As technology continues to advance, the role of law enforcement becomes more complicated and exciting at the same time. We will strive to provide our employees with the very latest in equipment and resources to increase both efficiency and effectiveness. In an effort to maximize our resources, we will look to alternate funding sources, such as grants and asset forfeiture, to finance these projects. Tustin has a population of over 75,000 residents and continues to grow. With the projected development of the Tustin Legacy, we stand prepared to respond to the needs of a vibrant and diverse community. Understanding and respecting individuals and 652 of 744 families of various ethnic and cultural backgrounds is one of the cornerstones of our department values. This plan is centered on three main goals for our department: Serving our Community, Serving our People, and Ensuring Resources and Technology. These goals were developed out of a comprehensive analysis of our strengths, limitations, opportunities and threats. Within each of those goals, our staff has diligently identified several specific strategies upon which success can be measured over the next four years. If the results are anything like we realized from the last strategic plan, then we are in for a busy and productive few years ahead. I have the utmost faith in our employees; they give of their time and talents to make Tustin one of the safest places in Orange County. 653 of 744 MISSION STATEMENT The Tustin Police Department is committed to a policing model of Community Governance. To that end, the Mission is to work in partnership with other city departments, the residential and business community, and other governmental and non-profit agencies to reduce crime, provide a sense of safety and security and improve the quality of life for those who visit, live, and work in the City of Tustin. VISION STATEMENT It is our vision to make the City of Tustin and its neighborhoods the most livable and safest in the State of California by incorporating the components of Community Governance into our daily strategies and activities. VALUES STATEMENT For the Tustin Police Department to maintain public trust, we must constantly demonstrate that our partnership with the community will be objective and securely rooted in consistently applied ethical principles. As an organization, we propose to fairly and impartially carry out the Mission of the Department with P.R.I.D.E . Partnership -We take pride in developing relationships with the people we serve. Respect -We respect and value the dignity and worth of all persons, recognizing that diversity enriches our community. Innovation -We will remain an innovative and progressive organization through leadership, education and technology in partnership with the community we serve. Dedication -We hold an individual's right to constitutional protection sacred and place the highest value on preserving life. We are accountable and responsive to the community that we serve. Excellence - We will strive for excellence through the effective and efficient use of resources, and promote teamwork and the empowerment of employees at all levels. 654 of 744 Planning Process \"It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.\" Ernest Hemingway On January 26th, 2012, Chief Jordan held a department-wide meeting to discuss the future of Tustin PD. During that meeting, the Chief highlighted many of the achievements from the last Strategic Plan 2006-2010. As a result of the diligent work of so many of our employees, we were able to accomplish nearly all of the objectives from that plan, the most significant being the complete restructuring of our organization to accommodate the Area Command policing system and the philosophy of Community Governance. The creation of new positions and units within the department, the development of several community outreach programs and the acquisition of state of the art law enforcement technology were just some of the successes of that plan; it was a major undertaking involving nearly every employee of this department. Although this current plan is not designed to be monumental in terms of organizational change, it focuses on refining the systems we have in place and searching for more efficient and effective methods for providing police services. In order to properly plan for the future, it is necessary to take stock of the current situation. Chief Jordan discussed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing our agency, in order to properly guide the planning process. Although these are very challenging times, it is apparent Tustin is still a solid municipality with a bright future. Our goal is be poised in the right position to take advantage of future opportunities once the economy turns around and to be as fiscally responsible as possible, while still providing a high quality police service to the Tustin community. The methodology for completion of this plan was similar to the last one. We created a Strategic Plan Steering Committee (SPSC), comprised of management level employees, with the mission of guiding the three main committees and respective sub-committees along the right path towards completion of the plan. The SPSC meets on a continuing basis to oversee all aspects of the plan's development and subsequent implementation. Consistent with the Chief's shared vision, the Strategic Plan has been divided up into three main committees: Serving the Community, Serving the Employees and Ensuring Resources and Technology. The managers overseeing each of the committees quickly went to work and solicited volunteers, organized site visits, and formed sub-committees 655 of 744 to address the individual strategies within their goal framework. Those strategies are detailed in the Implementation Action Plan, included within the Strategic Plan. A plan is only as useful as the paper upon which it is written, without specific and measurable milestones from which to assess its progress. We outlined several individual strategies under each of the three main goals. For each strategy, the SPS C assigned a responsible person(s), an estimated cost and a projected completion date. In order to ensure the various strategies are carried out, the SPSC will meet on a monthly basis to evaluate the progress and maintain accountability. 656 of 744 Goals and Objectives \"Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success.\" \u2014Pablo Picasso As a result of informal interviews, staff discussions and the Chief's vision, we developed three main goals for this plan: Serving the Community, Serving the People and Resources and Technology. For each of these goals, a committee was formed, co-chaired by two members of our management staff. Within each goal is a specific set of objectives, which were designed to be clear, realistic and with measurable results. Goals, by their nature, are on a multi-year timeline, while objectives are the means to achieve those goals. The objectives can vary in terms of resources needed and the time required to complete them. Following is a summary of the three goals and the corresponding objectives: Serving the Community o Creation of the Emergency Management Coordinator position o Creation of the Community Emergency Response Team (C.E.R.T.) o Upgrade of the Emergency Operations Center (E.O.C.) o Creation of the AB-109 Officer position within Special Operations o Restructuring of our Organizational Chart o Implementation of a Data-driven model of policing o Review of the Patrol Division schedule and leave guidelines o Target hardening of all TUSD schools (Added Spring 2013) o Lockdown training for TUSD personnel (Added Spring 2013) Serving the People o Enhancement of the recruiting process o Creation of a Recruitment Team o Creation of a Workplace Diversity Action Plan o Enhancement of the Specialty Assignment rotation process o Review of the Disciplinary process o Creation of a Leadership/Succession Plan o Evaluation of the Training Matrix o Enhancement of the Employee Wellness Program o Evaluation of Special Equipment needs o Creation of a Rewards and Recognition program o Create Sergeants' Training Manual 657 of 744 o Employee Evaluation Process Resources and Technology o Implementation of an Automated Report Writer System o Enhancement of the Mobile Data Computers o Enhancement of the License Plate Recognition infrastructure o Purchase of a License Plate Recognition trailer o Maximization of building space o Establishment of a Social Media presence o Implementation of Digital Signage o Creation of an internal communication system (Wiki/Blog) o Implementation of Online Reporting for citizens o CALEA Reaccreditation o Upgrade the Command Response Vehicle (Added Spring 2013) 658 of 744 Implementation Action Plan \"I never worry about action, but only inaction\" - Winston Churchill Any strategic plan is only as effective as the subsequent method to put the plan into action. We have chosen to include the implementation action plan within this document to serve as a blueprint for staff members to make the goals and objectives of this plan a reality. Included in the implementation action plan are the specific objectives under each of the three goals, along with the responsible person(s), the projected completion dates and any associated costs, if applicable. As we move forward over the next few years, we can mark off the milestones as each one is achieved, thereby building momentum which will carry us through to the successful completion of the plan in 2015. Of course, there will be modifications made along the way, as this is a dynamic and evolving document, responding to the internal and external stimuli as necessary. 659 of 744 Committee #1 - Serving our Community Co-chairs: Lt. Strain and Lt. Tarpley Objective: 1.1 -Emergency Management Coordinator Person(s) Responsible: Lt.

Additionally, we would like to build in a goal -setting feature to assist in leadership development and succession planning. Status: In process Sgt. Blair is researching evaluations from other agencies/organizations for ideas on how to improve our current system. Costs: Staff time only Projected Completion Date: August 2013 665 of 744 Committee #3 - Resources and Technology Co-chairs: Lt. Garaven and Mgr. Miller Objective: 3.1 - writing system Person(s) Responsible: Mgr. Miller/Sgt. Harper Description: Automated report writing systems would greatly reduce the staff time associated with documenting a variety of incidents. By using technology in a way to streamline report writing in the field and coordinate interoperability with internal systems, we can minimiz e data entry and manual functions associated with police reports. Status: In process A beta system was launched in August of 2011, but there were several difficulties associated with the system. The difficulties were addressed by West Covina Service Group and currently the system is again in a testing phase. Pending further review of the current system, we will determ ine if the West Covina product will serve our needs or if other vendors need to be researched. Costs: Staff time only Projected Completion Date: December 2012 Objective: 3.2 - Mobile Data Computers enhancement Person(s) Responsible: Mgr. Miller/Supv. Kanoti Description: The software program, Net Motion , has been installed in all of the units allowing us to expand the computing experience and bring many features of the workstation desktop into police units. Net Motion allows us to remain CLETS compliant as all data transmission is encrypted and secured. The expanding applications are becoming limited by MDC capability and Internet performance. Status: In process To maximize the efficiency of the MDCs, we are working on several upgrades . These upgrades include adding RAM, 4G LTE air cards, adding MPLS to our existing T -1 line and replacement of the CPU. Costs: Approximately $30,000 for RAM, 4G and T -1 upgrades.

From consolidating the different LPR platforms into one, to purchasing additional units for deployment, to integrating the software with the national database, there is much work to be done. Status: In process We are currently phasing out the older PIPS system for the new Vigilant Video equipment. Costs: Approximately $50,000 Projected Completion Date: October 2014 Objective: 3.4 Recognition Responsible: Mgr. Miller/Supv. Kanoti Description: Creating a LPR equipped trailer will enhance our ability to develop valuable intelligence in specific high crime areas throughout the City . The mobility will allow for a flexible and expeditious response to rising crime trends. Status: In process Fleet Coordinator Tom North is gathering bids to build the trailer from the ground up. Costs: Approximately $20,000 Projected Completion Date: April 2013 666 of 744 Objective: 3.5 - Building space maximization Person(s) Responsible: Mgr. Miller/ Sgt. Taylor Description: This is an ongoing issue with a limited amount of space available and the potential to increase staff in the future. Eventually with the build -out of the Tustin Legacy, there will be a need to increase staff, whether sworn or civilian. We must be creative in how we utilize the current space available to be as efficient as possible, yet still provide a comfortable workspace for our employees. Status: In process We are exploring the possibility of upgrading the locker rooms, as well as some additional smaller remodeling projects. Costs: TBD Projected Completion Date: January 2015 Objective: 3.6 media presence Person(s) Responsible: Capt. Celano/Lt. Garaven Description: Social media is the new way to disseminate information to the community . Our goal is to establish and/or enhance our current mediums, such as Nixle, AlertOC and Facebook. We would also like to set up a PD Youtube account. We can upload any video footage for investigations, crime prevention and for special event s. Twitter would be another social media platform for us to relay important information and to solicit feedback. Status: Completed As of July 2012, we have PD Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts up and running. These sites are maintained by the Social Media Team and are guided by SOP AD300. Costs: Staff time only Projected Completion Date: July 2012 Objective: 3.7 - Digital Signage Person(s) Responsible : Capt. Celano/Crime Analyst, Howard Description: The goal of digital signage is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of internal communication regarding crime trends and quality of life issues by communicating information through enhanced technology on a 24/7 basis. This will improve the flow of information and aid in the presentation of training for department employees. The installation of video monitors strategically placed throughout all city -owned facilities will allow information sharing to the community as well. Status: Research phase Since this will involve other City departments, we will be working with IT staff on an enterprise -wide solution. Costs: Approx imately $30,000 Projected Completion Date: July Objective: - communication system (Wiki/Blog) Person(s) Responsible: Lt. Strain/PSO Ortiz Description: Communication is critical to the overall success of the Area Command system of policing. As officers work across all days and times of the week, it beco mes necessary to find more effective communication tools to share information. There are systems available that can provide us with a framework to enhance our ability to communicate through either Wikis or Blogs. Status: In process PSO Ortiz and CIO Breskin are proposing the use of Crime Free Multi -Housing Software, which may accomplish this objective. Costs: Approximately $10,000 ($3,500 annual maintenance) Projected Completion Date: November 2013 667 of 744 Objective: 3.9 - Online reporting Person(s) Responsible: Mgr. Miller/Supv. Nguyen Description: COPLOGIC's Desk Officer Online Reporting System (DORS) allows agencies to collect reports from citizens online so patrol and front desk officers will no longer complete reports in person. The system is intended to be used for reports with no suspect/lead information, primarily filed for insurance purposes. It provides a convenient way for community members to report minor incidents, crime tips, submit forms, etc., through an online service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Status: In process Supv. Nguyen will be proposing a contract of services with Coplogic to management staff for approval. Costs: Approx. $12,000 initial costs ($7,000 annual maintenance) Projected Completion CALEA reaccreditation Person(s) Responsible: Mgr. Miller Description: In April of 2014, we will go through our first reaccreditation process, which can, in some ways, be more difficult than the initial accreditation assessment. We have to ensure we have kept up all of our st andard files, along with the associated proofs. This process is overseen by the Operations Support Division Manager, however it requires the efforts of all members of the management staff to make it happen. Status: In process We are current on our proofs for most of the standards and the required reports for CALEA compliance. Costs: Approximately $5,000 Projected Completion Date: April 2014 Objective: 3.11 - Upgrade the Command Response Vehicle Person(s) Responsible: Joe Meyers Description: The Command Response Vehicle has not been upgraded since it was first built in 1999. The communication and emergency equipment inside the vehicle is beyond obsolete and needs upgrading. New MDCs and monitors, which are fully CAD equipped, will allow the Co mmunications Unit to fully operate out of the Command Vehicle. Smart boards and flat screen TVs will allow for more effective emergency planning and Incident Command operations. Additionally, the purchase of a new generator will provide a constant and reli able source of energy for the vehicle. Status: Completed Major upgrades completed. New MDCs with full CAD capability and SMARTboard have been installed. Only minor IT configurations remain. Costs: Approximately $20,000 Projected Completion Date: May 2013 668 of 744 Evaluation and Accountability \"Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishments\" - Jim Rohn A tremendous amount of time, effort and talent went into the formation of this plan. If we were to simply place the plan on a shelf and hope that it would come to fruition, we would most likely be disappointed with the results. With every good plan comes an equally effective evaluation and accountability strategy to ensure the successful completion of objectives. As we learned in the process of the last strategic plan for the department, there will be successes as well as failures along the way. We must constantly evaluate our progress and make adjustments where needed, based on economic conditions and the ever-changing world of law enforcement. The Strategic Planning Steering Committee (SPSC) will meet monthly to monitor the overall progress of the plan, provide updated sub-committee reports and make adjustments as necessary. Additionally, the SPSC will provide quarterly update reports to the Chief of Police to keep him apprised of what has been accomplished and what still needs to be done. Additionally, once a year the Steering Committee will conduct a formal assessment of the Implementation Action Plan, make adjustments where necessary, and provide a report to the Chief of Police. In turn, this information can be utilized in the budget planning process to efficiently allocate our resources and guide our decision making. Ultimately, this will ensure the group stays on track and moving in a positive direction. By assigning each objective to one or two members of the management team and linking that objective to a projected completion date, we have built in a mechanism for ownership and responsibility that will ultimately lead to successful results. Assignment without accountability is wholly ineffective and will therefore be avoided. In the end, the employees involved from creating the plan to achieving the individual objectives, will feel a sense of pride in their accomplishments and the department will be better for it. 669 of 744 Acknowledgements \"The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant\" - Max de Pree The Department would be remiss in not recognizing the hard work and dedication of the members of the Tustin Police Department who brought this plan to fruition.

He was appointed to the position in 2011, during the formulation of this plan, when former Chief of Police Tom Casady was named Public Safety Director for the City of Lincoln. Chief Peschong and Assistant Chief Brian Jackson oversee the two divisions of the department: operations and support. The Operations Division consists of five community police teams, each headed by a captain. The division also includes duty com- manders and the Traffic Enforce- ment Unit. The Support Division is comprised of Criminal Investigations, Narcotics, Crime Analysis, Education & Personnel, Victim/ Witness, Property, Records, Service Desk, Information Services, Forensics, Police Garage and Finance. Each of these units is headed by a captain or civilian manager. Strategic plan The Lincoln Police Department is a nationally accredited agency through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, CALEA. In 1989, LPD was the first agency in Nebraska to be accredited and the 103rd in the nation. The department has been re-accredited six times and during the last accreditation cycle was awarded \"Meritorious\" (accredited continuously for 15 years) and as a \"Flagship Agency\" (two continuous accreditations without corrections.) With a sworn staff of 320 and a civilian staff of 102, the Lincoln Police Department is considered a leader in technology and innovative strategies in problem solving. We have a strong commitment to community policing and intelligence led policing. Sergeant Don Scheinost and Captain Joy Citta were assigned to create the department's strategic plan during 2011. Four committees were assembled consisting of commissioned, civilian and government employees along with community members. The committees met over several months discussing, researching and creating the LPD 2012 strategic plan. The Strategic Plan consists of four focus areas, Equipment and Technology, Professional Development, Staffing and Facilities and Policing. Once implemented the 2012 Strategic Plan will serve as the vision for the growth and advancement of the Lincoln Police Department. The next several years will be pivotal to the City of Lincoln and the Lincoln Police Department. A new arena, hotels and roadways will open in the Historic Haymarket district. The police department will face a turnover in management as a number of command staff reach retirement age and new commanders begin leading the department. Budgets will continue to be closely watched. This Strategic Plan is a guideline to be used as the vision looking to the future of the department and the community we serve. introduction 5 675 of 744 6 Focus areas The twenty-seven members of the strategic planning committee were assigned to four subcommittees. They met at regular intervals to discuss critical issues and form plans for impact. Each group consisted of sworn officers, civilian personnel and members of the community. Together, they developed a common vision and a road map for the future success of the Lincoln Police Department. They recognized that, in order for this document to be meaningful, it needed to be attainable. True to this ideal, the elements contained within this plan are attainable goals which will assist the department in charting a course for the future.

Benefits to the community include web based crime mapping and most of the department's public information available to the public through any computer or smart phone. Radio System The current radio system became operational in 1988 and was upgraded in 1997, but is at its end of life. Parts are no longer available leaving the system in a compromising position should any part of the system fail. This system is used by all the city agen- cies but the critical usage is in the safety areas of 911, fire and police. Recommendation: The radio system needs to be replaced with an 800MHz digital system. Updating the system will include upgrades to some portable radios and additional radio tower sites in Lincoln and Lancaster County. The cost estimate is $15 to $18 million dollars. Due to the current economic budget climate, replacing the radio system will require a bond issue. It is paramount to begin the process of educating the public on this need in the near future to obtain a positive result with the bond issue. SWAT Team SWAT continues to be activated in a variety of critical situations. They must maintain up- to-date equipment and training. Recommendation: The SWAT team should have access to an armored vehicle, upgraded weapons, audio and video surveillance, monitoring equipment, radios and recording devices. They should have the most up- to-date body armor available. Technology assigned to a Person, not a place With the trend toward smaller cruisers, two officer cruiser assignments and the significant amount of information available to officers, it is relevant to address the placement of technology resources. Recommendation: We have extensive policing applications, most notably P3i (Proactive Police Patrol Information) and on-line reports available for officers, but the devices necessary to utilize the technology are fixed and shared. The mobile data computers are bulky, creating space and safety issues for smaller vehicles and two officer cruisers. They are also costly to purchase and install. Numerous smaller devices are currently being tested for the P3i application. These devices are less costly and are portable. They can also be mounted in cruisers, saving space and allowing for the integration of Computer Aided Dispatch and P3i to improve officer safety, productivity and efficiency. The department should also research the ability to purchase and assign smaller, portable devices to individual officers. RISING FUEL PRICES The cost of fuel has continued to increase leaving the department to search for ways to economize on this necessary product. Recommendation: Continue purchasing smaller, fuel efficient cruisers, include technology that allows the cruiser to fully functions as their office. The use of air cards in Mobile Data Computers allows officers to work from their car as if they were in a station decreasing the need to travel. Two officer cruisers, Global Positioning Satellites and Automatic Vehicle Locators used by 911 dispatchers will allow assignment of the closest cruiser to a call for service. Consideration should be given to providing officers with their cruiser fuel use reports on a monthly basis. 7 677 of 744 8 Equipment & technology Digital technology Advances in technology continue to permeate the entire department from bar coding in Property, on line reports in records, virtual evidence rooms and in-car digital cameras. Recommendation: The technology available should be integrated into the department's daily functions. Property should have an electronic bar coding system, allowing for accurate documentation of chain of custody and reduce the space needed for storage. Virtual evidence rooms allow other necessary agencies like city and county attorneys to view and access evidence, saving employee time retrieving and copying evidence for court. In-car digital cameras provide an un-biased account of events as they unfold, increasing officer safety, providing evidence for prosecution and limiting department liability. Digital cameras should be expanded to all cruisers with the ability to cover several different angles. Wearable cameras carried by the officers when they leave the cruiser are also a highly recommended option. Consideration should be given to digital storage capacity and retrieval with policies and procedures in place to keep evidence secure. Recommendations Briefings The Lincoln Police Department conducts over 10 employee briefings a day to off-site locations and offices. Because of varying shifts and assignments the information presented is repeated for several days possibly causing some of the information to drop off or new information to be missed. Recommendation: The department needs to review different formats for acquiring the daily briefing information determining if there is a better way to provide quality and timely information. 8 678 of 744 9 Professional Development recommendations Professional development includes training and advancement with each having a direct effect on job satisfaction. Training resources and opportunities to learn are critical elements in maintaining a high level of service for the community. All employees of the Lincoln Police Department, civilian and commissioned, play a vital role in meeting our mission. Preparing future leaders by keeping staff up to date with changing technology prepares the department to move into the future Our employees are our most valuable assets. We must continue to invest in their ongoing development to ensure needs are met on the individual and department level. This investment provides a rewarding and healthy work environment which in turn drives our employees to seek excel- lence. Overall quality of service will begin to deteriorate if employees spend all of their time just accomplishing their core duties and are not trained to be the next generation of supervisors and leaders. Institutional knowledge There is a need to preserve and share institutional knowledge and best practices. When employees leave after many years of service a certain amount of exper- tise and experience may be lost, especially in some specialized investigative areas or key positions in the civilian and commissioned ranks. Recommendation: Use of retired employees as instructors should be more fully explored. Lateral entry employees should also be recruited and considered as resources for new ideas or for identification of other available training options. Training Fiscal constraints have affected the ability to partici- pate in outside training other than specialized requirements. Recommendation: Strive to create public/private partnerships that would facilitate training opportuni- ties. Examples of this partnership could include the insurance industry for auto theft training, the banking industry for fraud training and the various universities for management or personnel development. Cross training with other agencies for critical incidents and disasters prepares staff to function effectively during larger incidents involving multiple entities. Seek additional funds through grant programs or partnering with community companies and organizations to fund training. Existing union contracts contain clauses for education- al advancement for some civilian and commissioned employees. A restructuring of negotiated language could make funds available for individual employees to use. 9 679 of 744 10 Professional Development Recommendations Special Assignments Advancement is not limited to promotion. Appointment to a specialized position is often a career goal for employees. Recommendation: Temporary special assignments should continue to be utilized to either provide additional training or to prepare for appointment to a specialized position. Specialized positions should continue to rotate giving employees opportunities in different areas of the department. Other Recommendations: Implement a practice of periodic meetings within and between teams or units to discuss needs, goals, obstacles and opportunities. These structured meetings provide the opportunity to offer guidance, gain feedback, and give wider insight into broader responsibilities. This is an important foundation for leadership development. Cross training should be examined as a way to provide an opportunity for advancement. Training as a \"Reward\" Staffing factors, and the perception of training being approved as a 'reward' or based on length of service, have curtailed several opportunities for employees to participate in optional training. This has led to some frustration on the part of employees trying to improve their performances. Scheduled in-service sessions also impact pre-existing staffing levels. Time commitments from outside sources may also limit the availability to provide new and relevant training to employees. Recommendation: Make training available through web-based computer programs, utilizing resources such as the Department of Homeland Security or Department of Justice programs for training not readily available locally. An on-line training library should be developed that can be accessed by all employees via the internal home page. These resources would allow employees to have training available at their fingertips at any time while still maintaining staffing levels on the street. Advancement programs There is little ability for an employee to experience positions of an advanced rank. Recommendation: Creation of detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for critical positions in the civilian and commissioned ranks is essential for passing on knowledge from those positions. Pre or post promotional process programs should be implemented to assist those seeking advanced positions. Mentoring or shadowing could be an important element of professional development. An example would include allowing those eligible for a promotion to spend a period of time with employees already in that position to begin to draw upon their experience prior to appointment. 10 680 of 744 11 Policing The Lincoln Police Department's ability to deliver core police services through community based policing is part of the on-going partnership we have with the Lincoln community. For over 30 years we have involved the community in the way Lincoln is policed. Community Based policing We have continued to refine and implement additions to our community based policing philosophy since beginning Team Policing in 1975. Partnering with community groups and neighborhood associations has been central to our organizational goals and become part of the culture of the Lincoln Police Department. Recommendation : Maintain the community policing model established over 30 years ago but continue to refine our response by including technology advances, best practices and innovative ideas. Community Based Policing works for Lincoln and we should continue this high level of partnership with the community. De-Centralized Substations As the community continues to grow officers who start their shift by reporting to the main station have to travel long distances to reach their assigned areas and begin answering calls for service. The high costs of fuel and increased travel time to reach outlying team areas continues to increase response time. Recommendation : The southeast portion of the city is one of the fastest growing areas in square miles and population. The department should plan for a full service team station in that quadrant of the city and evaluate the need to realign the geographic team boundaries to evenly distribute police resources based on need. Opportunities to combine this station with other public safety needs, such as a fire station, should be explored. recommendations technology Technology continues to rapidly change the way we police allowing for more efficient policing and response to the community. Recommendation : Citizens continue to gather information and communicate electronically. There is a need for the 911 call center to accept calls for service via text message and this method of commu- nication will only increase in the coming years. With the proliferation of smart-phones and recording de- vices, there will be an increase in cellular phone pho- tographs, video surveillance, and cellular phone video provided as evidence or sent to the police depart- ment at the onset of a report. There is a need to en- hance our ability to examine and process this evi- dence as the current backlog on cases is only ex- pected to increase. The use of Global Positioning Satellites that can monitor the location of police vehicles and our portable radios should be explored. This can increase the safety of our officers and allow dispatch to send the closest units to a call for service. Potential benefits include lower response times and reduced fuel consumption. 11 681 of 744 12 Policing recommendations 12 Budget constraints Government budgets continue to require a close financial look for cost savings while continuing to provide quality services that promote a safe and secure community. Our community continues to list maintaining quality police services as a top priority. Recommendation : Explore the use of two-officer response cars as a cost saving option. The test should evaluate times, number of calls for service and team areas. Increase the types of work and the areas volunteers/ interns can provide services on the department. Recruitment of long term skilled volunteers and interns for specific projects can increase the ability of the department to move forward without incurring additional costs. The Lincoln Police Department should also explore the possibility of taking some belated or non-urgent calls for service over the phone. Examples of these types of calls are crimes without suspects, calls for service without physical evidence and runaways. 682 of 744 13 Staffing & Facilities The Lincoln Police Department will need to plan for future growth as the city continues to increase in size. As this growth takes place, additional personnel and off site facilities will need to be developed. The police garage, range and canine facilities are also in need of redevelopment or renovation. Police Garage and K Street Storage The police garage, built in 1930, at 635 J Street continues to require costly repairs. The garage increased it's workload two years ago when it started handling maintenance and repairs for most of the city's small vehicles. Storage at a city owned building located at 10th and K Streets utilized by LPD property is limited with no opportunity for expansion. Recommendation : A new or remodeled garage facility in a central location will allow for efficient servicing of department and city vehicles. Combining the garage with additional storage for LPD property eases the growing storage problem. De-Centralized Substations As the city continues to grow in population and square miles additional decentralized police sub- stations or stand-alone Team Stations will be needed. De-centralized stations allow the department to continue providing neighborhoods with accessible police services and response times within 10 minutes to most calls for service Recommendation : A cooperative effort between the Lincoln Police Department and other agencies should be examined. The Lincoln Police Department should work with other city agencies to develop shared decentralized locations throughout the city. A shared facility would reduce cots. recommendations K-9 and Range Facilities LPD does not have a K-9 training facility for the weekly training required for the five canines and their handlers. The long term rental of the police firing range will end in the next couple of years forcing the department to move to a new location. Recommendation : The development of a police firing range is the top facility priority for the department. Combining the location of a range, training classrooms and a training area for the department canines would be ideal. Partnering with other city or governmental agencies would reduce the initial building costs to the department and potentially allow for rental use providing additional revenue. Forensic Lab The demands of the Lincoln Police Department's Forensic Lab continue to increase. Recommendation: Better facilities that can handle the future needs of the department should include the ability to handle more video evidence and blood spatter. The expansion of the forensic lab would allow LPD to accept contracted work from other departments creating a revenue stream to support on-going lab equipment upgrades. 13 683 of 744 14 Staffing & Facilities recommendations 14 Staffing LPD has continued to operate with 1.29 officers per thousand population, one of the lowest officer/ population ratios in the nation. Optimal staffing for the Lincoln Police Department is 1.5 officers per thousand citizens. However, under the current economic conditions this is not a reasonable goal. There are also several positions unique to law enforcement and a limited number of people are qualified to perform those functions, especially in our Technical Resources and Information Services Unit. There will be several retirements in the next few years that will impact the entire department. Recommendation: The department should maintain their current staffing ratio. We should continue to review each position currently filled by sworn officers determining if the department would be best served by converting the position to civilian staff allowing the officer position to complement street staffing. The effects of retirements and ability to fill various key positions with qualified and skilled individuals should be kept in mind as a potentially problematic issue facing the Lincoln Police Department. 684 of 744CALENDAR YEAR 2012 - 2 014 STRATEGIC PLAN TEMPE POLICE DEPARTMENT What's Inside Strategic Plan Framework.................2 Strategic Goals..............................3 Goal 1: Fight Crime ........................4 Goal 2: Community Involvement........5 Goal 3: Support Employees...............6 Goal 4: Innovation & Technology.......7 Mission, Vision & Values.................8 Prepared by the Strategic Planning, Analysis & Research Center Page 1 Message from the Chief As Chief of Police, I am pleased to pres ent the Tempe Police Department's 2012-2014 Strategic Plan.

Additionally, our strategic goals have been updated to reflect how we will proactively address public safety issues while streamlining and optimizing our resources during these challenging financial times. The four ma in strategic goals that will guide the efforts of the department for the next three years include: Fighting Crime & Enhancing Community Safety Promoting Community Involvement Supporting & Developing Employees Enhancing Innovation & Technology Reaching these goals will ensure that we can meet the demands of our growing, diverse, and dynamic community now and in th e future. As Chief, my commitment to achieving the highest level of organizational excellence has not wavered. I am very proud of the hard work and effort that went into developing this plan and look forward to the successes we will achieve. On behalf of the men and women of the Temp e Police Department who worked together to create our Strategic Plan, I would like to thank the residents of Tempe and our Mayor, Council and City Manager for their continued partnership and support. It is with this support that we will be able to implement our Strategic Plan and proactively address the current and future public saf ety needs of the Tempe community. Respectfully, Tom Ryff Chief of Police 685 of 744 Each year the Tempe Police Department conducts a comprehensive strategic planning process to update the strategic plan. This year's strategic planning process was redesigned to be even more inclusive of city and community priorities. The process involved four main components that included: City leader input: A full day retreat where police manage rs heard from city leaders about the current realities (opportunities and challenges) facing the city and the Police Depa rtment over the next three years. Guest speakers included the Mayor, the City Manager, and a variet y of Department Directors from across the city. Community input: Several community forums took place and provided police managers with an opportunity to communicate with citizens and community representatives (inc luding representatives from the Human Relations Commission, the Tempe Police Oversight Commission, the Chamber of Commerce, the Downtown Tempe Community, and the faith-based community) about the Police Department and acquire feedback on community priorities. Employee input: Police managers attended workgroup briefi ngs and met with union representatives throughout the fall of 2011 to inform employees about the strategic planning process, discuss organizational issues, and gather employee ideas about the future priorities of the Department. Strategic planning retreat: Police managers attended a full day workshop where they reviewed the ideas from city leaders, the community, and employees. Additionally, as part of this retreat, the Department's mission and vision were reviewed, the strategic plan goals were upda ted, and new strategies were created and incorporated into the strategic plan.

LXXIX, no. , November 2012 Organization-Wide Leadership: Expanding the Traditional Success ion Planning Model By Mitchell P. Weinzetl, Chief of Poli ce, Buffalo, Minnesota, Police Department What occurs within a police agen cy when the organizational lead er vacates the position, whether the departure is planned or it occurs rather abruptly? Will the organization flo under, or will it move in a positive direction? How about the individuals within the organization; will they stay f ocused and on track, or will they become distracted and concerned about a future that seems uncertain? The answer to these questions is simple: It depends greatly on the actions of organizations' leaders during their tenures and through the periods leading up to their departures. If the agency head has engaged in sound leadership practices, and if a positive direction and a sound l egacy have been establishe d, the organizational direction will not only stay on course but may actually improve . This is not necessarily best accomplished through a process of succession planning as traditionally consi dered, but rather through an expanded process that intentionally engages organization-wide leadership and sta ff development practices. 702 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The term leadership is broad and embodies a wide range of actions and behaviors that intend to lead and guide individual and organizational functionality and to produce specific outcomes. The most successful law enforcement leaders are those who, through their actions and in fluence, create, support, and sustain the performance of an organization in a manner that is rooted in a commitment to performan ce excellence, ethical practices, professionalism, and service. Effective leaders assu me the burden of setting the organizational tone and focus and also for establishing and maintaining the organiz ation's culture and values. This level of stewardship over the organizati onal ideals is an enormous responsibility, and because it is of paramount importance, it must ultimately rest squarely on the shoulders o f the organization's leader. The agency head must not only set and promote the organizational direction but also do this in a way that is accepted and supported by individuals within the organization. When executed properly, th is will include engageme nt, contribution, and agreement by the organizational staff, as well as participation from key external stakeholders who have been identified. If effective leadership is linked to the ability of the organiz ational leader to ensure a variety of positive organizational aspects\u2014including establishing a foundation for the culture and core values of the agency and setting expectations for individual and organizational performa nce and other outcomes\u2014then the concept of legacy leadership is related to how these principles and concep ts are handed down over time from one generational leader to another.1 Also important is a foundational premise that \"legacy-oriented leadership requires a strong continuity that addresses organizational practices and norms.\"2 In essence, at its core, legacy- oriented leadership is about recognizing the positive aspects o f the past, using the skills and experiences of the leader to build on these prior practices for the purpose of ind ividual and organizational growth and improvement, and creating an atmos phere in which those who might someday ascend to the ranks of leadership in various positions can engage in and repeat this process. Over the years, much has been said about the concept of success ion planning, but what exactly is it? Most would agree that succession planning is a process through which many organizations\u2014public and private\u2014prepare for the eventual departure of key leaders. Through this process, organizations engage in a variety of strategies to identify individuals who might e ventually assume a primary lead ership role, generally taking steps along the way to prepare these individuals for the transition. This can be important from a strategic perspective because \"during a leadership change, a succession plan maintains the continuity of the agency's mission and reduces uncertainty,\" and it can also help ensure that the organization al legacy will remain intact.3 Despite the positive aspects of s uccession planning, there are some potential drawbacks to this process, particularly if a traditional succession planning model is enga ged. In many police organizations, everyone has a pretty clear idea of who will be promoted to the next sergeant, lieutenant, or chief executive position. They know this because these promotions are often predictable to members of the organization based on a fundamental flaw in some succession planning models: \"They are overly focused on iden tifying successors for a particular job or position and not on the future leadership nee ds of the organization.\" 4 In short, many succession planning models rely on identifying a particular individual to step into the next lead ership role instead of working to establish solid leadership skills throughout the organization and among all staff. In fact, this replacement-oriented focus is cited as a key problem many manag ers identify in terms of their criticisms of various succession planning models currently in use. 5 Because some succession planning models orient toward a particu lar individual or individuals, they can have detrimental effects on other staff members. In many police and sheriff's agencies, the number of supervisory- and executive-level positions is small, and the frequency with which these opportunities arise is also very limited. Many officers have a desire to move up the ranks at so me point in their careers, but they may become discouraged if they are overlooked for these positions or are unable to develop their personal leadership skills. This is particularly true as it relates to newer generations of workers who have a need to feel valued and want to increase their individual sense of self-worth by building marke table skills. 6 Appropriate succession plans are \"not necessarily focused on creating replacements but rather on making a solid plan for the future\"7 of the 703 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] organization; however, staff may become disenchanted, and the r esult may be turnover or other performance- related problems. The alternative to a succession planning process that focuses o n one person or a scant few individuals is to engage in a process of organization-wide leadership that target s everyone within the organization as having the potential to take on a formal leadership role. Organization-wid e leadership is a concep t in which each individual organizational member, regardless of one's organizational role, is provided with the oppor tunity for instruction, guidance, and direction concerning leadership concepts and prin ciples. For too long, leadership education and the accompanying philosophies ha ve been reserved exclusively fo r those who are assigned to formal leadership roles. Additionally, more often than not, leadership education is not provided to these i ndividuals until after the promotion occurs. Because of this back-end process of leadershi p development, many aspiring leaders miss the opportunity to develop an understanding of leadership principle s early in their careers and also do not develop an understanding of how decisions are made that might impact th em within their positions. This process also occasionally results in the promo tion of individuals who have a misguided understanding of what their new roles entail, which can lead to operational problems. Although only a handful of organizational members will ever be placed in formal leadership positions\u2014 particularly in those roles that include a leadership title and the associated pay and responsibility\u2014many organizational members will be asked to take on leadership responsibilities related to projects or assignments, or they may simply become informal leaders within the organizational ranks because of their tenure, experience, charisma, or personality. While i n these informal roles and settings, these individuals will shape and mold the organization based on their knowledge, their abilities, and the ir experiences. In order to ensure that the influence of informal or aspiring leaders is consistent with key aspects of the organizational legacy, formal leaders must engage in an intentional process of mentoring and guiding. This process must be looked upon as a marathon, not a sprint, however, because legacy and leadership elements are n ot the result of \"swift interaction, but due to the accrual of modeling, educating, and feedback.\"8 This type of mentoring and guiding cannot occur, however, witho ut a proper foundation. Although it may seem a peculiar place to begin, a sound and comprehensive succession planning process must start with the competency of the organizational leader. For the legacy left behind by the organization leader to have any value, the leader must first ensure t hat the legacy is positive and productive and that it is one that others want to follow and maintain. There is an awesome responsibility on the part of the organizational leader in this regard: The individual must desire and endea vor to become the type of leader who others look up to and wish to emulate, and through that process, they must develop their own skills to a high level. Once the leader has developed a high degree of competency (somet hing that should continually be worked on, for that matter), the individual can engage in a process of developing others in a way that will car ry on the legacy. One model that can be used to pr omote an individual and an orga nizational legacy is the Leadership Replication Cycle (LRC): 704 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] The LRC process has two key components: The development of the capabilities of the individual leader, and the process through which the leader e ngages others within the orga nization in an effort to replicate the actions and behaviors of the formal leader . At its center, the LRC is a legacy-oriented leadership tool. The first steps of this model are designed to challenge the leader to actually become the leader that staff wants to follow. This occurs through a process of gathering information, reflecting upon wha t has been learned, and then using that knowledge and reflection to intentionally transform oneself, wh ich ultimately helps individuals to engage in specific actions and behaviors that contribute to positive and effective leadership. The second portion of the LRC is where the concepts of legacy-leadership and succession planning meet. In this section, the transformed leader uses skills and abilities to teach others within the organization, passing along not only the important aspects of lead ership but also a process thr ough which skills and abilities can be shared. The key benefits of this type of process (mento ring and modeling) a re that the amount of effort is minimal, and, oftentimes, the delivery method is passive. \"Mentoring is an effective and low-load way to pass on crucial knowledge, skills, and abilities in public organizations.\" 9 It is important to note, however, that this second section is not merely a conduit to developing general leadershi p behaviors; it intends to replicate the leader's style, actions, and behaviors to the extent that this is possib le and practical.10 This is important because the replicable aspects of the organizational leader are, in essence , the legacy of leadership that is hoped to survive the leader's eventual departure. In addition to implementing a ph ilosophy that promotes organiza tion-wide leadership, organizations also should engage in an organized succession planning process. The IACP Le ading by Legacy (LBL) program considers an open succession planning process, s uch as the one described in this article, to be a vitally important aspect of legacy-oriented leadership. To carry out this objective, the LBL program identifies four steps that can be used to create an environment that suppor ts leadership development and an ongoing legacy.11 Step 1: Identify the potential talent within the organization. Whether through observations or conversations, try to determine who may be interested in taking on a leadership ro le within the organization. Keep in mind that not everyone who has a talent for leadership will show a direct int erest. All supervisors and leaders should be constantly searching the ranks for the next great leader to eme rge. Stay alert and watch for informal leaders who are impacting the organization in a positive way; this is a great way to identify future formal leaders. Step 2: Provide training to those identified. Do not wait for talented people within the organization to come forward and ask for leadership tra ining. Many prospective leaders are unaware of or too humble regarding their potential, and as a result, they will be reluctant to envision themselves in a leadership role. Invite all organizational members to any in-service leadership training offered, but strongly encourage attendance by those who may benefit the most from the training. Step 3: Mentor the individuals who show promise. Once potential leader s are identified, tak e the time to teach them. These individuals will need nurturing and guidance in order to learn and grow into the leaders of tomorrow. When possible, invite these individuals to important meetings so they can observe and learn from those who are present. Most importantly, model the behaviors that are most essential in promoting and maintaining the organizational legacy. Step 4: Empower staff to make key decisions within the agency. Assigni ng responsibilities to aspiring leaders is a great way to measure their i nterests and their capabilities. It also affords them the opportunity to ease into leadership roles without feeling overwhelmed. When working on d eveloping staff who are already supervisors, share important issues and discussions, such as those that rela te to policy, procedure, or disciplinary matters. Afford them a voice, but also explain how leadership decisions are made so that they can gain insight and understanding. Succession planning is an important tool that can help ensure c ontinuity of operations for the organization and that the organizational legacy will survive the departure of the organizational leader. To safeguard against being caught unprepared, it is critical that organizations establish a clear plan in advance. Succession planning should 705 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] be \"a thorough process designed to ensure the continued effecti ve performance of an organization by planning for the development and replacement of key people when the need arises.\"12 It is important to remember, however, that this process should not rely on a myopic focus; consideration\u2014and atten tion\u2014should be given to everyone. A strong and successful strategy for succession plann ing should include an organization-wide leadership philosophy; establis hing replicable leadership behav iors that teach, promote, and reinforce critical core values and a positive organ izational culture; and a step-by-step process, which ensures that the plan is thoughtfully carried out and executed. Organizational leaders a re responsible for constr ucting and implementing a plan to carry forward the organizational legacy, and a process that intentionally works toward this end will help promote a positive outcome.

Hughes Law enforcement agencies and their design appear to differ from any other type of organization. Although usually compared with the military , police departments have bee n referred to as having \"hyper-bureaucratic military organizational attributes\u2014 those of formal rank, formal hierarchy, and a chain of unquestioned and unquestioning command.\"1 Only until a few years ago, the term police management, design ated only for those holding a title, described what those in the profession believe d to constitute leadership. However, more recent years have shown that managers are not necessarily leaders. Rat her, those placed into managerial roles should possess leadership skills, behav iors, and knowledge. Employing such a concept could improve officers' connections with their departmen ts and aid in succession planni ng when promoting future leaders within the agency. So, how do officers obtain a police leadership position, and wh at measures their leadersh ip behaviors and skills? Are the right people placed into these positions, and can these individuals' lead larger numbers of officers in the future? For the past few decad es, some police research has deal t with such topics as leadership styles of those in positions of authority. Other studies have focused on leadership as it pertains to gaining organizational commitment. Little research, however, has examined the promotio nal process and how it can impact organizational leadership and commitment. In today's world, a n eed exists to research and create changes to both the design of these agencies and the process to promote future leaders. To this end, the author explor es the current assessment process used to promote first line supervisors and discusses leadership education and its availabilit y and applica bility to all officers. He draws a connection between desired leadership styles and how a proper assessment p rocess, coupled with leadership education and training of future first-line supervisors, could enhance the ab ilities of those in positions of authority to lead the officers in their charge. Examining the Design When focusing specifically on organizational design, law enforc ement agencies are highl y structured with well- defined charts that describe th e roles that accompany the position titles set forth. In addition, top-down communication exists inside these agencies. 707 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Some arguments have highlighted the need for this design because of the severe situations officers encounter and the great amount of liability that accompanies such incidents. These organizations and their design, however, lack some items that officers would like, such as better communication networks, more participation, improved decision making, and enhanced ethical leadership. Through these requests for change, organizational commitment may increase. Research has indicated that \"participative role clarification improved organizational commitment.\"2 Inside a militaristic- designed organization, the levels of rank in management and their importance often are oversimplified and many tim es seen as a mere conduit of communication having no real influence on subordinates. Researchers have argued that \"obedience socialization and military command supervision across the hierarchal levels appear to distort the nature of police wo rk.\" 3 Police organizations face a changing environment at a faster than nor mal pace and should have a structure flexible enough to handle such situations, as well as flowing communication and leadership firmly embedded in the design. In most police structures, ranks descend from chief to deputy chief, captain, lieutenant, sergeant, corporal, and patrol officer. These levels exist more in larger metropolitan or county-level agencies main ly due to the number of officers employed. However, in some states, such as Pennsylvania, department size does not allow for such rank design, making the levels of sergeant and patrol officer more open to leadership situations. One study noted that the \"quasi-military model makes no provision for the situational effects of a leade r's behavior.\" 4 Other researchers echo this by suggesting, \"Although many agenci es appear to rely on military arrangements in terms of structure, rank, and hierarchies, this model may not effectively serve police leader s and their respective organizations. Replacing the military model of leadership devel opment with behavioral compet ency development may be more effectual in leadership and agen cy performance.\"5 Many in the police arena believe that law enforcement agencies differ greatly from organizations in the private sector. However, one study compared the scores of police leader s on the California Personality Inventory with those from the business world and found that \"results indicate very similar scores.\"6 Is there truly a difference in how leadership is applied between the policing and business worlds? Some in law enforcement will argue that at their basic cores, the two diffe r in followers, motivation, and desired leadership styles. Many people associate the word entrepreneur with the world of business. One study int roduced the concept of entrepreneurial policing with the basis behind such a term being that the leadership con cepts in policing do not differ greatly from those of business. It suggested that \"entrepreneurial policing is an open style of management linked to, but transcending, individual leadership styles because it can be pr acticed by everyone within the police service irrespective of rank. This link between the rubrics of entrepre neurship and leadership is vital because for a practical theory of entrepreneurial policing to develop, polici ng requires the active participation of future generations of police leaders.\" 7 This concept not only intertwi nes the business world with policing but also exemplifies that leadership shoul d be seen at all levels within the police organization. To further support this, the study connected entrepreneurship and policing by reporting that it \"is action-oriented cognitive human ability, which guides policing as an everyday practice and para doxically links managerialism and conformity to risk-taking behavior.\" 8 In addition, some studies have reported other perceived leadership styles gathered from sworn personnel.9 For example, researchers examined how these styles affect officer-integrity violations. Findings identified three Professor Hughes, a former police officer, is the director of criminal justice administration at Central Pennsylvania College in Harrisburg and also instructs at the Harrisburg Area Police Academy. 708 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] styles as openness, role model, and strictness, concluding that \"all three aspects of lead ership...have a significant effect on the frequency with which corruption occurs.\"10 Another study revealed that the most effective perceived style admired by officers was transformational leader ship.11 Finally, another researcher focused on officers as the \"change agents\" in police organizations, arguin g that \"police departments could be well advised to encourage participatory involve ment as a vehicle for organizational reform.\"12 As seen by this variety of research, many studies have identified styles sought by officers of their supervisors. It appears that through emplo ying these styles, officers may have stronger organizational commitment. By engagi ng in these styles, supervisors may strengthen the integrity and ethical be havior of the organization. Apparently, strengthening leadership among supervisors, especially first-line ones (e.g., sergeants), would benefit man y law enforcement agencies and their followers. If police organizations need more flexibility and incorporate l eadership at all ranks, what, then, should change , and who should participate in that change? Moreover, Does the current pro motional process truly select can didates with these styles, and, if not, how can that process be improved to do so? Analyzing Promotions and Assessment These processes can differ from department to department given the resources and number of employees. Many larger agencies usually employ a procedure involving written an d oral examinations, performance evaluations, psychological and physical tests, and drug screening created an d disseminated by a consulting department. 13 Agencies can expand and contract on these steps if they so choo se. However, this can prove costly for smaller ones that often must rely on y ears of service and performance e valuations to promote their officers. With all of this in mind, the question remains, is the current promotional process truly choosi ng candidates with the wanted l eadership styles, and, if not, what improvements can be made? One of the most difficult tasks in the promotional process is creating standardized testing, a system employed in such areas as collegiate admissio ns, government civil service, psychological measurement, and high school academic pr oficiency. As a means of bringing fairness and e quality to all who take them, t he exams seek to measure, through written words, a person's skill or personality . Prior to the test, candidates should complete a job- task analysis, which offers pe rformance dimensions needed for a certain position. While such testing ha s served its purpose, recent research has shown some flaws.14 For example, researchers administered the California Psycholog ical Inventory (CPI) to promotional candidates in Texas attending leadership training. They gave both a pre and posttest, advising \"results indicate that the CPI-260 can be utilized to assess ch ange through training and that, in this case, the training seemed effective at helping the law enforcement execut ives develop their leadership skills, awareness, and abilities.\"15 In the current processes, many candidates never attend, nor ar e given the opportunity to do so, any leadership training prior to testing. Some attributing fact ors may be cost, shift coverage, availability of training, or simply not viewing it as needed. Assessment centers also have made their place in standardized t esting and often exist in the government and public sectors. \"Over 62 percent of the respondents in a recent survey of police and fire chiefs reported that they use assessment centers, especially for promotion.\"16 Further findings showed that centers \"are inappropriate for selection procedures which purport to measure traits or constructs, such as intelligence, aptitude, personality, common sense, judgment, leadership.\"17 This study suggested an altern ative to the written assessment. It used the term task-specific centers, defining this concept as \"exerc ises (work samples) and not performance dimensions.\"18 Given the various differen ces among organizations, each could design its own task-specific 709 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] assessment using the officers, administrators, and subject-matt er experts. This would suggest better participation by officers at all levels. One downside to this concept is that \"assessors...are not determining how much leadership or judgment a subject has; they are attempting to me asure how well the subject handles a specific job- related situation.\"19 Interestingly, the study did not say that leadership may not e xist in the behavior while completing the task. Some situational leadership skills could e merge during the performance of the work. \"It would be appropriate, however, to have an exercise where the su bject was designated group leader and there was an issue to address.\"20 Then, it could be asked if this assessment measures behavior. The answer is yes. The study included a component termed behavior observation in the a ssessment process. When discussing the assessment of future leaders, lead ership is observable, thus a behavior. \"Checklists can include a short 8-15 list of items considered important...a method for recording the subj ect's actions.\"21 Revisiting the desired leadership styles of officers, it is suggested this checklist be designed specifically for those behaviors sought by the officers to be led. This would ensure the right person is chosen to lead . Another researcher said it correctly, \"Leadership is a behavioral quality which has to be demonstrated in everyday contexts.\"22 That is the concept that supports using behavior observations in task-specific center assessments . By further investing time into creating a better testing proces s to observe leadership behavior, law enforcement agencies would improve the ir organizational design. Ultimately, they would provide those bei ng led with their chosen leader. It also would be a positive step into plan ning for the future for many agencies because law enforcement organizations often do not consider the concept of succession planning. Planning for the Future The final question to investigate is, how do police organizatio ns plan and train future leaders of their departments? Many do not invest t ime or money into sending officers to leadership training. This could be at a federal, state, or local level. On a federal level, the FBI maintains the Leade rship Development Institute.23 Some states also may have some type of leadership seminars or classes. For example, Pennsylvania, through the Penn State Justice and Safety Institute, offers nine leadership development courses. 24 Of these, seven require the officer to hold the rank of lieutenant or higher, one requires the officer to be in the promotional process or promoted, and one has nothing noted about who may attend. This concept in offering leadership training does not appear to be in line with that of succession planning. Instead of supplying training to those choosing or aspiring to b e leaders, the training occur s after the officer is select ed from a list of eligible candidates. Educating in this manner appears to \"place the cart before the horse.\" After all, officers seek certain styles from those who lead them, but these styles do not appear to be measured through the current written assessment process. One research er suggested, \"The quality of p olice leadership could be improved by more effective methods to identify officers in the middle rankings p osts who had the potential to become chief officers.\"25 He advised that succession planning can increase overall polic e leadership that can be accomplished through training the right people. His research sought to \"mode rnize the police workforce, enhancing training and career progression to improve l eadership and management ski lls at all levels of the service.\"26 Another issue in succession planning might be that not enough i ndividuals want to take part. This could be for various reasons, such as satisfac tion with the current assignme nt, monetary loss, lack of support or motivation, poor test-taking ability, or a disconnect with current administ ration values. In one study, officers perceived their promotional process as \"not picking the best police officers\" a nd \"the testing and selection method.\"27 Whatever the reason, this does not suggest a lack of those who can lead given the right tools. Sometimes, as stated in another study, officers have the \"perception that promotions are not based on merit and reflect a hidden administrative agenda.\"28 However, in the same study, \"bl ack test takers indicated leade rship as a prominent concern.\"29 While this is a positive sign of those focusing on leadership, this notion needs to be permeated throughout the organization. Proper succession planning can mak e this possible with researchers agreeing on \"the importance of creating a seamless continuity in leadership development and succession planning.\"30 By law 710 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] enforcement changing the admission and availability of currentl y offered leadership training simultaneously with the current promotional pr ocesses, police organizations ca n begin to assure that they chose the right leaders. Conclusion Research has shown that the current design of police organizati ons does not support change easily. However, research also has demonstrated that officers want improvements in how their future leaders are chosen and the styles these superiors should exhibit. Making leadership training available to those aspiring to become leaders and changing wr itten assessments to those that m easure task behavior could help bring about t hese desired advances. Further research could focus on leadership training and how to build it into an organi zation's succession planning, thereby improving the overall leadership throughout. In this day and age of increasingly complex challenges for the law enforcement profession, such changes seem warranted. Concerning policing in the 21st century, one researcher aptly stated, \"Our job now is to go out and garner learning from wherever it exists and increase the richness of our leadership culture.... Police leadership is not essentially different from all other forms of leadership.\"31 Endnotes 1. Toch, \"Police Officers as Change Agents in Police Reform,\" Poli cing and Society 18, no.

Evolving human factor s will equally impact law enfor cement as the nation's population ages, immigration increases and minority group fertility rates skyroc ket. Hi-tech Crime Fighting Almost every high-level police executive conference in the past few years has featured a seminar or two on \"intelligence-led policing.\" The core of intelligence-led polic ing is identification of specific criminal activities or specific criminal populations and targeted enforcement against the highest-risk crimes or criminals to achieve overall reduction in the impact of crime in a community. It is essentially risk management applied to law enforcement. In one of the early works advocating intelligence- led policing, author Mark Riebling encouraged police officers to become more lik e spies. But just where does the intelligence come from? The human element of intelligence-led policing involves the int elligence analyst. How many police departments even had an intelligence analyst a decade ago? Now even my own small agency of about 40 has a full-time intelligence analyst with a professional background as an attorney and trainer. As we move into the next decade, intelligence analysts will become more common at smaller- and m id-sized police agencies, and are already absolute requisites for effectiv e larger agencies. The 2001 ter ror attacks and subsequent terrorist efforts awoke police to the need to understand the infrastructures in communi ty food and water supplies, power grids, telecommunications, transportation systems, and even financial institutions as those entiti es became prime terror targets. Not only does that mean that police administrators and command staff must develop new areas of familiarity and forge new networks, but it also implies that the increasing ly professional intelligence analyst will continue to gain prominence in the police agency. As police agencies mak e basic changes in gathering, assessing, communicating and sharing information, the analyst will be at t he center of systems development and management. The decrease in cost and increas e in quality of surveillance ca meras, coupled with a greater public acceptance of street surveillance, will push the trend toward more cameras in high population centers and particularly in high vehicle- and pedestrian-traffic areas. Great Britain, with an e stimated four million public surveillance cameras in operation, has led this trend. A spree of Irish Republican Army bombings in the early nineties fed the appetite for mass public surveillance. In some areas of Great Britain, a new camera cluster calle d The Bug is undergoing extensive testing. This device f eatures an array of eight camer as. The cameras are bolstered by software that prompts them to scan for suspicious behavior, such as running o r sudden and violent body movements, and then lock on the suspect and track th e suspect on camera. How long w ill it be before we see similar devices in metropolitan subways and busy street corners in major U.S. citi es? 714 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] What lies ahead in video surve illance? Among other things, ther e will be surveillance systems a generation beyond 'The Bug' that recognize the patterns of a particular cr ime, such as an assault or robbery, and instantly dispatch police officers. Facial recognition systems that ident ify known criminals or wanted persons and telegraph their location and tr avel direction to officers are a lready available. One developer is working on small surveillance drone aircraft that can actually follow suspects a nd record and transmit their movements and actions. Also under development are nanotechnology devices that will detect the components of explosive, chemical and biological weapons . These devices would be deploye d in high-threat target areas and would function as constant, real-time passive detectors. Though perhaps the trend has moderated, the American public has become increasingly tolerant of privacy intrusions following 9/11. Cour ts are just beginning to struggl e with the legal implications of new privacy intrusions. Lawyers and judges are trying to shape new provisio ns in evidence rules to accommodate the expansion of electronic surveillance and security searches. The Innocence Project estimates that mistaken eyewitness identification contributed to the wrongful conviction in 75 percent of the cases where DNA evidence conclusively exonerated the convicted defendant. This has lead courts to carefully scrutinize how police administer line-ups and show-ups and to promote the use of tech nology to record identification procedures. Court rules are already rapi dly changing in this area. Police officers are trained to remember that \"if it isn't in th e report, it didn't happen.\" Soon, perhaps, the new maxim will be, \"if it isn't on you r daily video log, it didn't happen.\" In the past few years, more state legislatures and state suprem e courts have created stat utes and evidentiary rules that either mandate or strongly encourage audio or video record ing of interrogations. More than half the states now have some rule on this topic . In 2010, that number is expec ted to grow. Though in-car video systems have been around for some time, sev eral agencies in Great B ritain and Europe are experimenting with wearable vid eo recording devices that are ca pable of recording an offi cer's activity for an entire ten-hour shift. Constant electronic recording of police activity may become the new core of police accountability. TASER International launched the AXON \"tactical computer\" that features a tiny, high-quality wearable camera that snugs around the ear, much like a wireless cell phone headset. The camera can also be mounted on other parts of an officer's uniform or equipment. Wh atever the officer sees in front of him, the AXON's camera captures. One p rosecutor in Fort Smith, Arkansas, recently credited the AXON with helping quickly clear an officer involved in a fatal shooting of a man who pointed a gun at him during a domestic violence call. Watch for more and more developers to move into the wearable camera market and more agencies to experiment with the technology. Watch for: Expanded employment opportunities for police intelligence analy sts, even in the f ace of a continuing recession and declining tax revenues Further professional development for intelligence analysts and growth of existing intelligence analyst associations and new degree track s in intelligence analysis More public surveillance camera s and use of facial recognition software Advances and simplification of DNA collection and more rapid te sting methods Court decisions that furthe r guide eye witness identification m ethods and a changes to evidentiary rules that create an incentive to record interrogations Improved technology in wearable cameras and significantly great er use of wearable cameras Clashing Cultures American policing will be significantly impacted by the rapidly -changing cultural dynamics of our nation. The graying of America will see fewer younger violent criminals, but more white collar criminals perpetrating identity fraud, Internet-facilita ted fraud, money laundering an d other financial crimes. The tech-savvy 715 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] generation now rising will become even more crime-tech knowledg eable. Police will be dealing with smarter bandits. Agencies who recruit candidates with a few geek qualit ies will find themselves ahead of the technology learning curve. In the next 40 years, the number of Latinos in the United State s will double, thanks to Latino birthrates and continued legal and illegal immigration. Multi-lingual police recruits will be even more prized. As the Latino population spreads and immigration continues, look for more cul tural clashes in both inner city neighborhoods and in formerly homogenous suburbs. At the same time, the Muslim population in America will grow fa ster than any other group. Despite the peaceful religious beliefs of most America n Muslims, home-grown jihadist s will increase. The recent massacre at Fort Hood by American-born Muslim Nad al Malik Hasan may be just the beginning of terrorist attacks by jihadists trained in American mosques. Has an frequented the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Virginia, at the same time as Nawaf al-Hazmi and Hani Hanjour, two of the hijack ers in the 9/11 attacks, in a congregation led by Anwar al-Awlaki. Al-Awlaki is another U.S.-born Muslim now on the run from Yemeni authorities and believed to be a key member of al-Qaeda. Months before the massacre, Abdulhakim Muhammad murdered one Am erican soldier and wounded another as they stood on a Little Rock, Ark ansas, street. Muhammad moved t o Little Rock from Nashville, Tennessee, home of the Al-Farooq Mosque, a t arget of an investigative jour nalist's report on extrem ism. One of al-Qaeda's more public figures in Adam Gada hn, (A.K.A. Azzam al-Amriki). G adahn was raised on a goat farm in southern California and studied Islam at an Orange County mosque. Not only will the rapidly-rising Muslim population potentially bring more U.S.-born and trained terrorists operati ng in American cities, but it will bring culture clashes in communities and police will play a key role in managing and defusing those conflicts. Homegrown jihadists will be found in America's heartland, not j ust in major coastal population centers. They may, or may not, be associated with al-Qaeda and other Islamic fundamentalist groups. Homegrown terror will be an issue for every police agency. A recent terror plot thwar ted in Texas and another in Illinois shows that homegrown terror is not just an issue for the LAPD and NYPD. Th ough homeland security is traditionally considered to be a federal res ponsibility, local agencies must recognize the trend toward greater numbers and greater violence of American jihadists and take proactive measu res. The police culture will also continue to rapidly change. Reflec ting the population demographic changes, more police applicants are likely to b e the children of immigrants. Many will have been raised in a home where English was rarely or never spoke n, and may have had limited so cial contact outside their own ethnic group. Forward-thinking police administrators will recognize the poten tial strengths in continuing to diversify the police work force to better reflect the community composition. Police agencies will, at least in the short term, find themselves competing with the military for the most desira ble employment candidates. Watch for: Rises in identity theft and financial crimes and new methods of fraud Terrorist attack attempts from homegrown jihadists Continuing challenges to recruit and retain the best candidates for law enforcement employment Increasing diversity in police ranks Conclusion President John F. Kennedy observe d that, \"change is the law of life.\" This is one law that can't be broken. The most successful police agencies in 2010 a nd be yond will be thos e that adapt and change rapidly, embrace technology and analyze emerging trends in their communities. 716 of 744By Eric Meade To understand the potential futures of crime and justice, one must ex- plore a full range of issues, the con-nection of which to law enforcement may at first seem tangential at best. Our perspectives and behaviors rela-tive to crime and justice are informed by larger changes taking place around us \u2014 socially, technologically, environmentally, economically, and politically. Scanning the horizon for trends and developments that may influence the future of crime and jus-tice informs our strategies to create the future we prefer. This exercise also highlights how futures methods can yield insights into the decisions we must make today. The trend analysis below, focusing specifically on the United States, pro-vides a base for understanding the forces that may affect law enforce-ment in the future. This will enable us to better forecast probable out-comes \u2014 and envision preferable futures for society. Social and Demographic Trends There are several important demo- graphic changes that will affect the Scanning the Future of Law Enforcement: A Trend Analysis ROBWILSON39 / DREAMSTIME.COMOne of the most essential weapons in a futurist's arsenal is the trend analysis \u2014 an examination of a significant phenomenon through defined analytical lenses. In this article, the vice president of the Institute for Alternative Futures applies this tool to trends affecting law enforcement in the decades ahead. \u00a9 2010 World Future Society 7910 Woodmont Avenue, Suite 450, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A. All rights reserved. 22 THE FUTURIST July-August 2010 717 of 744Americans have come to view use of some addictive substances more as a health problem than as a criminal-justice problem. Science and Technology Trends The emergence of new technolo- gies will doubtless lead to new forms of crime. For example, expanded re-liance on Internet technology has al-ready created new forms of identity theft, identity distortion, and online extortion. The growth of virtual real-ity and online communities may ex-tend crime from person to \"ava-tar\" \u2014 the character that represents the user or acts as the user's agent in virtual reality. For example, in 2008 a Japanese woman was arrested for killing off the avatar of her virtual ex-husband \u2014 that is, she illegally logged in as him and destroyed his character. As virtual worlds play a larger role in our personal and eco-nomic lives, it is likely that these crimes will grow in importance. Back in the real world, new types of crime will emerge as we spend more of our lives online. Violent out-bursts that occur in chat rooms or e-mails may be viewed as \"cyber-hate crimes.\" Already, the use of mo-bile phones to exchange sexual mes - sages and photos (called \"sexting\") has landed many people, including adolescents, on the wrong side of the law. Countless adults are already be-hind bars for targeting children on-line, or offering up their own chil-dren, for sexual purposes. As more of our lives take place online and in public view, it is likely that more be-haviors will fall under the scope of laws against hate crimes, child por - nography, and sexual misconduct, and that opportunities to participate in those behaviors will proliferate. Technological advancements will give existing criminals new capabili - ties, often on a par with those of gov-ernments and law enforcement agen-cies. For example, the unmanned robots and drones currently used by the U.S. Army in Pakistan and Af-ghanistan could be used by gangs and other criminal elements to attack United States over the next decade. Most strikingly, non-Hispanic whites will continue to shrink as a percent-age of the U.S. population, from 65% in 2010 to 61% in 2020 and 50% in 2050. During this time, Hispanics will make the greatest gains, reach-ing 24% of the population by 2050. The increased attention paid to the Hispanic community may marginal-ize vulnerable African American populations, who will hold steady at approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. At the same time, mar - riage across racial and ethnic groups may reduce the extent to which Americans identify themselves with one racial or ethnic group. Another key demographic factor is the generational shift now taking place as the millennial generation re-places the \"silent\" and baby-boomer generations before them in the work-force, electorate, and public. Simi-larly, the juvenile age bracket will soon be made up of \"Globals\" (born 2004-?), about whom little has yet been written and whose attitudes to-ward crime and justice are more dif-ficult to anticipate. Millennials tend to be more en- gaged in civic activities than other generational cohorts and are more likely to think that the government is on their side. This attitude suggests that they may accept law enforce-ment techniques and technologies that earlier generations perceived as violations of privacy. The millenni-als' relatively high adoption of new technologies and low sensitivity to privacy concerns can already be seen on social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace, where young people regularly post detailed information about their private lives. This divergence from the values and behaviors of previous generations will also become significant to law enforcement agencies as more mil-lennials enter their ranks. Another value shift that is occur - ring in U.S. society is attitudes to-ward low-level drug use. Many Are Virtual Crimes Real? As technology enables new forms of crime, it may be difficult to establish whether or not a crime has actually taken place and where to assign responsibil-ity. Examples: A Missouri teenager, Megan Meier, committed suicide on the day after a fraudulent online chat partner suddenly broke off their relationship. Two elementary school stu - dents posted a video, \"Top Six Ways to Kill Piper,\" on YouTube, in which they suggested ways to kill a classmate they did not like. Violent video games are often cited as causing violent crime, and criticism is likely to grow as video games incorporate more advanced virtual-reality technol-ogy. Similarly, media personali-ties on the far right have been blamed for provoking the recent shooting of a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial. Such episodes and reactions may presage a broader definition of responsibility for criminal acts as technologies advance at an ac-celerated rate. \u2014 Eric Meade ISTOCKPHOTO THE FUTURIST July-August 2010 23 718 of 744communities that they serve. For ex- ample, police officers may use social networking to alert the local popula-tion of unsafe areas or conditions. Video games \u2014 especially simula- tions using virtual reality \u2014 could be used to prevent crime by teaching young people how to behave prop-erly in society. Sophisticated model-ing technology, similar to that now being developed in the health sci-ences, could allow young people to place \"virtual twins\" in criminal sit-uations in order to evaluate their own psychological and neurological responses. Economic Trends What happens to the U.S. economy over the next 10 years will have sig- nificant implications for crime and law enforcement. While many indi-cators suggest that the recession may be easing, unemployment reached 10.2% in October 2009 and is ex-pected to remain above the historical average for several years. This un-employment will drive higher levels of ordinary crime, as well as the psy-chologically regressive crime in which some breadwinners facing fi-nancial difficulty commit violent acts against their own families. At the same time, economic crisis has driven budget cuts at the federal, state, and local levels, which may re-duce the effectiveness of crime pre-vention and control efforts. The state of California faces deep budget cuts in many areas, among them prisons and law enforcement, after voters re-soundingly defeated a set of pro - posed tax hikes. Law enforcement agencies will likely find themselves being asked to do more with less. Urbanization may lead law enforce-ment agencies in rural areas to con-solidate or shut down, while subur - ban agencies may be subsumed into newly defined \"metropolitan\" re - gions. Budget constraints may affect law enforcement policy, such as by promoting the legalization of mari-juana as a means to offset cuts in prison funding (both by reducing the numbers of criminals sent to prison and by opening up a revenue source if sales of marijuana were taxed like tobacco). Many jurisdictions may seek new prevent the emergence of crime. For example, police monitoring of social networking sites may anticipate the shift from ordinary adolescent tribal- ism to gang-related violence, just as Google search data have been used to identify flu outbreaks. Services like Twitter may be used to antici - pate criminal activity or to piece to - gether the clues after the fact. In other cases, social networking may be used to organize community re-sponses to crime or to civil rights vi-olations by the authorities, similar to the role that Twitter played follow-ing the Iranian elections last year. Suspected criminals may also use so-cial networking sites to alert their lawyers immediately of their arrest, or to coordinate their stories prior to interrogation. These technologies will give com- munities an opportunity to construct systems of preventive and predictive policing that will recognize behav-ioral patterns, diagnose unhealthy social conditions, and tap into a data-base of crime-prevention strategies and outcomes to determine the best approach. This approach would likely require comprehensive sensing through video surveillance, monitor-ing of social networking sites, and direct community involvement by police officers. Given its potential ef-fectiveness, public willingness to cede some privacy in the wake of 9/11, and the demographic changes described above, this type of preven-tive and predictive law enforcement may gain acceptance by the general public. Many of these technologies offer new opportunities for law enforce-ment agencies to engage with the their prey or one another. Low-cost unmanned airships or small subma-rines could be used to transport nar-cotics and other contraband. The use of unmanned devices could hinder efforts to assign responsibility to spe-cific suspects or organizations. New technologies will also be available to law enforcement agen-cies. However, social values and opinions will impact the ultimate level of their acceptance or rejection. For example, there is growing resis - tance to the use of conductive energy devices (i.e., Tasers), particularly af-ter a series of highly publicized deaths. While there is widespread support for DNA testing, the Su-preme Court has ruled that defen-dants do not have a right to a DNA test. In other cases, contamination or alleged tampering of these samples has served as a counterweight to their general acceptance by the pub-lic. It is unclear how the public would view greater extraction of in-formation \u2014 facial features, ethnicity, height, weight, etc. \u2014 from DNA, as more and more health information goes digital. New technologies may emerge not just to prosecute, but to punish as well. For example, social networking technologies may become so essen-tial in the future that prohibiting nonviolent convicts from using them may have a deterrent effect similar to that of incarceration today. RFID and GPS bracelets are already used to monitor house arrest and parole vio-lations. These systems could be linked to databases to provide greater preventive policing of sex of-fenders and other dangerous crimi-nals. To some extent, these types of monitoring technologies may be ex-panded to the general public, just as closed-circuit TV cameras have been installed extensively in London. These systems may be further en-hanced by innovations in profiling, face recognition, gait analysis, and biometrics. It is worth noting that surveillance systems and GPS tech-nology have gotten far ahead of the laws governing their use. Social networking sites may play a much larger role in crime prevention and in identifying unhealthy social patterns while there is still time to \"At the national and inter- national levels, there may be a continued blurring of the boundary between counterterrorism and law enforcement.\" 24 THE FUTURIST July-August 2010 719 of 744lyzed above; economic conditions have social and political impacts, and technologies alter lifestyles and attitudes, with often unexpected im-plications for criminal justice. By re-viewing the larger trends at work in the social, technological, economic, environmental, and political con-texts, we can better understand the potential futures of crime and jus - tice. Across all generations and popula- tion groups, it is important to ask how society will view crime and punishment even one decade from now. There is a growing fear that the U.S. corrections system has failed in its mission. Too many are incarcer - ated and too few are corrected \u2014 that is, many never escape the cycle of re-cidivism. Longitudinal studies find higher mortality, higher health risks, and higher unemployment among those who have been released from prison than among the general population. Many thought-leaders suggest that the U.S. criminal justice system has failed to address many of the factors that eventually lead to crime, such as inequality of opportunity, health and fitness problems, and inadequate ed-ucation. Some suggest that the United States has tolerated the con-ditions that lead to crime, only to build more prisons to incarcerate the criminals. How will society define \"crime\" and \"justice\" two or three decades from now? What types of crime will be of primary concern then that may not even exist today? What para-digms for punishment, correction, and reintegration into society will be broadly accepted and institutional-ized? Only by addressing questions like these can we identify and imple-ment the strategies \u2014 and vi- sion \u2014 that will help us create the future we prefer.

Shortages of natural resources and changing public attitudes may also create new challenges for law en-forcement. For example, many police departments placed mileage restric-tions on their patrol cars when gaso-line prices passed $4 per gallon in the summer of 2008. Forecasts for \"peak oil\" suggest that, after the economy recovers and energy de-mand returns to its earlier levels, de-clining supplies could send oil prices steeply higher over the next decade. Law enforcement agencies may re-spond by reducing patrol car use, shifting to more fuel-efficient ve-hicles, focusing more on \"virtual po-licing,\" or assigning more police to foot or bicycle patrols. Similarly, public opinion may call for \"green prisons\" and \"green police stations,\" just as many are already calling for \"green universities\" and \"green of-fices.\" Government Trends Demographic shifts may increas- ingly translate into political shifts that have impacts on U.S. law en-forcement. The face of the criminal justice system will change with the face of America, as seen in the ap-pointments of Attorney General Eric Holder and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. At the national and international levels, there may be a continued blurring of the boundary between counterterrorism and law enforce-ment, leading many law enforcement agencies into uncharted territory. Planning for man-made and natural disasters will prompt much greater integration across local, state, na-tional, and even international juris-dictions, as well as across law en-forcement, fire, EMS, health, and other services. A move toward inte-gration is already evident in many federal agencies and in specific rec-ommendations such as those of the bipartisan Project on National Secu-rity Reform. Conclusion: Implications for Law Enforcement Clearly there is considerable over - lapping in the trend categories ana-technologies and processes to facili-tate effective law enforcement at a lower ongoing cost, although the ac - tual financial benefits are as yet un - clear. For example, many of these technologies will require upfront in-vestment that may be beyond the ca-pacity of the relevant authorities. Budgets may also be cut for the in-novation and research that would lead to these new technologies. Where new technologies \u2014 e.g., red light cameras \u2014 are introduced, they may reduce the revenue collected by local authorities through fines, once citizens have adjusted their behavior. Smart vehicles that automatically se-lect a safe speed may similarly re - duce the revenue from moving viola-tions. Environment and Resource Trends Climate change could have im - mense implications for law enforce-ment in the United States. Interna-tional refugees fleeing drought, disease, or food shortages would cre-ate a significant social and economic burden for communities and govern-ments in industrialized countries. Rising sea levels could dislocate pop-ulations and destabilize coastal areas within the United States. Some areas may enter a downward spiral, where the rich leave, local investment suf-fers, and the people left behind have fewer economic opportunities other than crime. Shortages of fuel, water, and other natural resources may increase theft of these resources. For instance, gas - oline siphoning reminiscent of the 1970s might revive. In some cases, criminals may profit through the il - licit sale of untreated or tainted wa-ter. Regulations on toxic chemicals may create new opportunities for criminal elements to profit by pro-viding illegal storage or disposal. New markets created by a \"cap-and-trade\" system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may be vulnerable to \"green collar\" crime \u2014 e.g., fraud, corruption, and market manipula-tion similar to that often seen in fi-nancial markets. Identity theft may emerge in these markets as \"carbon theft,\" in which one entity takes on another's identity in order to enjoy THE FUTURIST July-August 2010 25 720 of 744SEARCH Anniversary: The Next 40 years Future Trends in Law Enforcement Kimberly J.

Excessive freedom may cause workersto feel alienated or confused, resulting in a loss ofdirection and motivation. Also harmful is unrea-sonable oversight, or micromanagement. Leadersable to balance the proper levels of empowermentand accountability increase employee competence,knowledge, and skills and help the organizationgrow.SIGNIFICANCE FORLAW ENFORCEMENT Empowerment and accountability hold great importance for law enforcement officers, who pos-sess a tremendous amount of responsibility andsignificantly less line-of-sight supervision thanemployees in most other occupations. Thus, theinherently autonomous nature of law enforce-ment work carries a strong need for independentdecision making. Similarly, the potential conse-quences\u2014including liability\u2014of police-citizenencounters necessitate careful accountability. Further, today's officers are highly educated in a variety of subjects and have a wealth of knowl-edge and diverse backgrounds. They have learnedto think and make decisions independently. 2 A work environment that fails to empower these indi-viduals will erode their motivation, direction, andself-initiation. 3 The effects of this devitalized work spirit can become exacerbated among some of theyounger police officers in the current workforcewho may require considerable motivation. 4 62142.indd 862142.indd 8 7/24/2007 / 9\" \"Accountability must accompany empowerment. Skilled supervisors will carefully balance both....EMPOWERMENT Two different empowerment strategies ex- ist. In the relational approach\u2014likely the form familiar to most people\u2014leaders delegate powerand authority to officers who share in decisionmaking. 5 Also, no bureaucratic red tape exists that requires officers to continually seek supervisoryapproval before they take action. Once power isdecentralized, officers will solve problems andfind innovative ways to achieve organizationalgoals. For example, they may have flexibility tochange work hours to meet witha citizen group, select necessaryequipment to complete a taskmore efficiently, or work in atemporary task force chargedwith finding ways to eradicatea specific type of repetitivecrime. The motivational approach to empowerment involves lessdelegation of power and au-thority. 6 Rather, this strategy places more emphasis on com-munication, goal setting, andfeedback. Praise and recogni-tion offset stress and anxiety while impressingupon officers the importance of their contributionsto agency goals. 7 Advocates of this approach believe that it will increase feelings of owner-ship, responsibility, capability, and commitmentto organizational goals and objectives. 8 The key to both methods is understanding that empowerment, ideally, will come as part ofthe overall work environment practiced at eachlevel of management. Realistically, however,this is not always the case. Although an agencymay not have an empowerment strategy per se,supervisors, especially those at the first-line rank,can formulate their own informal plans and have agenuine impact. First-line supervisors, close to theday-to-day decisions, are best suited to influenceand develop officers. Any actions or decisions,however, must be appropriate for the supervisor'slevel of authority. Implementing the Process Law enforcement officers acquire skills, abili- ties, and knowledge through rigorous and exten- sive academy training, in-service and specializedcourses, and on-the-job experiences that enablethem to further hone expertise as they becomeseasoned. The empowerment process simply liber-ates officers and encourages them to recognize and use the power and abilities theyalready have gained. 9 Empow- erment also follows the theoryand practice of developingfuture leaders as those on thefront lines learn valuable lead-ership skills. They later will usethese as they receive promotionwithin the agency. Those striving to empow- er their employees will findguidance from the situationalleadership model. 10 Although primarily for directing linepersonnel in a variety of ways based on specific identifiable behaviors and situa-tions, the theory has pertinent application when at-tempting to influence and empower others. Takenin its most basic framework, the model details acontinuum of leader and follower actions that pro-gresses through four cycles toward empowerment.It incorporates components of both the rational andmotivational approaches. Prior to implementing such a plan, leaders must ensure that officers have a complete and ac-curate understanding of their functions and rolesand also must remain cognizant of any deficienciesor issues that arise. Leaders will need to addressand correct noted shortcomings before progressingto each new cycle. The end result moves beyond mere delegation of tasks. It culminates in confident, self-directed, 62142.indd 962142.indd 9 7/24/2007 4:16:21 PM7/24/2007 4:16:21 PM 735 of 74410 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin Situational Leadership and Employee Empowerment PAR TICIPATING Officers feel more confident and motivated.

When the plan is implemented properly, officers will aligntheir performance with learned supervisor pref-erences. 11 Ultimately, employees in the line and staff positions of the organization will work moreclosely toward the same goals. Identifying Roadblocks Unfortunately, some agencies will see their empowerment efforts fail for several reasons. Leaders may hold responsibility by\u2014 only speaking of empowerment but never ac- tually taking steps toward implementation; 12 never properly training, educating, and preparing officers to accept additionalresponsibilities; relying on their position of power for identity and security and, thus, finding the empower-ment process a threat to their authorityand worth (both to themselves and to theorganization); 13 disliking change and fearing risk and the unknown;14 or simply not trusting officers to make knowl- edgeable, decisions / 11\" \"Empowerment... follows the theory and practice of developing future leaders....supervisory oversight, perhaps, because they believe their way is the best and only methodto accomplish the mission or reach goals. Other times, officers resist the empowerment process, instead preferring the strict, chain-of- command, one-way decision making found inpolice organizations of the past. Some officersmay need special attention, requiring less freedomand more oversight. This commonly occurs withnew, resistant, or disgruntled officers or thosehaving performance issues, thus temporarily re-quiring close monitoring. In these situations, lead-ers should slowly and carefullyinitiate the empowerment pro-cess. Their main goals will be toprovide guidance and probe forindependent thought by askingopen-ended questions, such as\"What do you think should bedone?\" and playing devil's ad-vocate to stimulate thinking. ACCOUNTABILITY Much of the literature on empowerment fails to address the essentiality of holding em-powered employees account-able. Failing to provide reasonable supervisoryoversight can result in officer misjudgments, over-confidence, or abuse of authority. The resultingerrors in police work that may occur can havedisastrous consequences. Whereas the process of empowering officers with more autonomy, power, and authority flowsdown the police hierarchy, accountability starts atthe bottom and moves up. Empowered employeesare responsible for completing tasks properly, dili-gently, and efficiently. As they do so while becom-ing more self-directed, trust builds among thoseoverseeing them. Supervisors learn which officersuse power and authority appropriately and wisely.However, if not held responsible, officers may driftand become confused or unmotivated. Empower-ment requires accountability to be meaningful. Similarly, officers understand that what they do matters and that others recognize their efforts.Praise and recognition reward those who fulfillgoals and expectations. But, employees who failto try or whose work is substandard meet withcorrective consequences, such as retraining, lessfreedom, and stronger, more invasive supervisoryoversight. Accountability also sends a message to others in the organization. Those not directly affected will be watching and notice anyaction or inaction by the super-visor. This will set the tone forfuture behavior, demonstrateexpectations, and establish thevalue of achievement, as well asthe repercussions for nonperfor-mance. Follow-through by thesupervisor is crucial for advanc-ing the empowerment processwithin the agency. Establishing the Plan Accountability begins with careful planning by the law enforcement supervisor, who establishes perfor- mance standards, measurement milestones, desiredoutcomes, a system for reviewing progress, andcontingency planning for unexpected adversity.Officers should take part in this process and acceptnew responsibilities. Communication and regular feedback prove vital, especially during the selling, or coaching,phase. As officers meet milestones and goals,supervisors must make them aware of theirprogress as this provides positive reinforcementand encourages further growth. And, when of-ficers do not meet goals, this information willhelp them negotiate any changes they needto make. 62142.indd 7/24/2007 4:27:40 PM7/24/2007 FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin\" \"...once supervisors give of cers authority and power, they must ensure that their employees complete work properly.Officers will need reinforcement to overcome the fear of making decisions and taking actions without prior approval. Supervisors must allow them time to ask any questions that may arise and must clarify anything not understood. Agencies cannot realistically hold officers accountable with-out a clear understanding of goals, objectives, and a means of evaluation. Supervisors must provide adequate resources and, when feasible, extensive training opportunities to ensure that officers have the right skills. 15 They should refine or develop policies and procedures that create and clearly define a culture of empowerment as the process is continual. Recognizing Barriers Implementing accountabil- ity can prove challenging. Un- fortunately, efforts can fail for several reasons, including\u2014 communication gaps or failures; confusion regarding expectations or goals; misunderstood or nonexis- tent means of measurement and evaluation; neglect of proper oversight by supervisors trying to avoid a reputation as a micromanager; supervisors' failure to address issues because of a fear of potential confrontation, conflict, or employee resentment, particularly in police work, where strong personalities abound; or inaction by supervisors afraid that taking ac- tion at an inappropriate time will backfire and result in a setback or a perception by officers of a lack of trust. In many cases, supervisors simply fear that em- ployees will see reasonable oversight as something sinister. Unfortunately, the word accountability itself often carries the negative stigma of punish- ment or discipline. However, once supervisors give officers authority and power, they must ensure that their employees complete work properly. CONCLUSION Only through empowerment will officers become fully engaged, motivated, and willing to follow leaders. Supervisors must carefully design and orchestrate the empowerment pro-cess. Too much freedom will result in officers feeling alienated or confused and will leave them open to guessing in uncertain situa-tions. It also will make them vulnerable to undue influ-ences, such as negative peer pressure and a lackadaisical work ethic. Accountability also must exist in the right proportion. Too little may send the mes- sage that supervisors are dis-interested or ambivalent. Too much may stifle independent thought and decision making. Supervisors must create a culture where independence, innovation, and risk taking are nurtured and tempered with reasonable super-visory oversight. This venture will result in more productive officers, stronger leaders, and a law enforcement agency better prepared to support the community it serves.

Schafer, Associate Professor, Center for the Study of Crime, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Carbondale, Illinois Other articles included in this issue of The Police Chief have provided an overview of the contemporary challenges and best practices as sociated with professional and ethical policing. This article reviews highlights of the advances of professional policing in recent decades and ill uminates the obstacles that continue to prevent the image of police from becoming more positive. Also included is a discussion of the future of police ethics, including pre-service behavior standards, evolving forms of off -duty behavior that mi ght be problematic for police agencies, the role technology may play in preserving a healthy police image, and the future of accountability to citizens and communities. Pre-service Behavior Standards Questions and debate surrounding th e regulation of pre-service behavior are not new . The use of alcohol, and especially underage drinking, by candidates is a long-standing issue. Contemporary manifestations of the behavior standard discussion now center on issues such as youth ful experimentation with controlled substances as well as digital and online behavior. In a time of dwindling applicant pools and high employee attrition, some agencies have questioned whether conventional zero-tolerance stances are feasible and responsible. Agencies currently struggle with the question of whether pre-se rvice experimental use of controlled substances should disqualify an applicant. Does such use reflect poor char acter or judgment, suggesting that an applicant is ill suited for police work? Does it suggest that the applicant might have credibility issues when testifying in court? If some drug use is allowed, what are the parameters on the type of drugs, the frequency of use, and the time lapse since the last use? 1 With the rise of computer and network technology comes the need for candidate accountability for digital and online behavior. Would it be appr opriate to refuse employment t o an otherwise exemplary candidate who downloaded audio, video, or other computer files without proper purchase or permission? Does an applicant who made an illegal copy of a co llege roommate's CD have serious flaws in judgment and character? Does the response to these questions differ depending on the position fo r which a candidate is applying\u2014for example, a local patrol officer position versus a federal special agent position? As with controlled substances and underage consumption of alcohol, the debate focuses on the parameters of acceptable digital and online conduct. Social-networking sites on the Internet provide people with a p ortal for connecting with others, sharing information and the opportunity to express their creativity. To day, many future police officers make extensive use of online profiles, photographs, videos, and blogs. Departm ents have found these sites to be rich in information for evaluating candidates and therefore mine data f rom these sites during background checks. It has been found that users of the networking sites often feel uninhi bited online and express themselves in manners different from how they behave i n person. In addition, some use rs even create false profiles of themselves. Confronted with this new source of personal information about c andidates, agencies need to decide on acceptable parameters of creativity expressed on personal Web s ites. Agencies certainly seek to hire candidates of integrity, whose character and conduct will not be assailed on the witness stand. At the same time , those preparing to enter police work may have different views and values about their behavior than their potential employers. 2 At present, it is not clear whe ther an occasional \"music pirat e\" 740 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] will make a poor or non-credible police officer. Executives would be well advised to cons ult with local human- resources experts to understand how and even whether to account for such behaviors in the screening process. Digital Technologies and Off-Duty Behavior Besides raising concerns at the pre-employment screening phase, digital technologies create new opportunities for existing personnel to engage in off-duty conduct that may be lawful but may still promote a negative image of their agency. Recent years ha ve produced many instances wher e officers of various ranks and their families have been discovered in compromis ing or morally questionable on line behavior. Online conduct that is sexually overt or morally questionable or that demonstrates bias or poor judgment can be a real problem for agencies. How should agencies handle officers using eBay to sell images of themselves masturbating?3 What about officers posting pictures of themselves engaging in group sexua l relations? Are there parameters on what officers can post on their blog or personal page at a social-ne tworking site? Arbitration procedures and the courts are constantly shaping the parameters of protected and p unishable behaviors. Police departments must keep themselves updated on these rulings. The moral and legal parameters governing off-duty behavior exem plify the notion of a gray area for a standard of conduct. Currently there is limited information available to guide agencies and executives in setting appropriate and lawful parameter s in the personal use of modern technology. As the volume of relevant incidents increases with time, policies and procedures to assis t executives in handling these incidents will need to be prepared. Poor handling of these matters may actually com pound the problem by bringing media attention and public scrutiny to the agency. Executives considering actio n against an officer should seek the advice of their agency's legal counsel to ensure that their actions are w ithin the boundaries of the law. Technology and the Police Image In the last decade, in-car video camera systems have become bot h a tool for law enforcement (e.g., recorded evidence of field sobriety testing) as well as a means of ensur ing police transparency. The audio and video images provided by these systems have allowed countless officer s to rebut false claims of abuse and inappropriate conduct.4 Video-recording capabilities are diversifying rapidly. Many cel lular telephones now incorporate low-resolution recording devices. These first-generation devices are small in size, have limited quality, and may not include audio recording, and they can usually capture video for only a short period of time before reaching the system's memory capacity. However, as technologies expand into second an d third generations, significant improvements are typical. This means that in the next decade agencies will likely deploy small, high-quality wearable video- recording devices in the field with officers. The military is a lready using expensive and somewhat cumbersome systems in combat zones. It is only a matter of time before improved, streamlined, and c ost-effective systems can accompany officers on patrol. These devices will be able to record every interaction officers have with citizens, creating evidence supporting officers when they perform their duties in an approp riate manner. Averting just a few lawsuits could offset the expense of such a system. But would the culture of a given police agency embrace this technology? At times, officers have resisted in-car systems because of the fee ling they create that Big Brother is watching. Although these systems can provide evidence that officers are p erforming their duties in an appropriate manner, their presence also carries an implicit assumption that officer s might not behave in a lawful and respectful manner. Reasonable people can di sagree on whether an agency should compel its professional officers to be recorded during the course of the ir duties. In agencies where they are able to speak for officers, labor organizations likely have views on the use of such devices. Beyond audio and video recordi ng, other technologies are enhanc ing the level of transparency within police operations. Some departmental Web sites allow citizens to map r ecent crimes in their neighborhood.5 Computer systems and expanded telephone/ voicemail networks (for both entire agencies and specific officers in an agency) make an organization more open and improve access to em ployees. 741 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] At the same time, the expansion of inexpensive, handheld video- recording technology in the hands of citizens has also enhanced the transpare ncy of policing, although citizens have used these devices mostly to highlight cases where officers have overstepped their rights in effecting arrests. Proper use of audio, video, and Web-based information systems can help to create an image of police officers and agencies as open, honest, and accessible. Agencies should c ontinue to work with technology manufacturers to develop new tools and applications that will both preserve t he integrity of policing and enhance the image of police professionalism. Accountability Regrettably, there are daily re ports of officers and agencies t hat have allegedly violated their oath and duty to the community they serve. While many of these allegations will ultimately be found frivolous, others illustrate failures in ethics and accountability systems. The volume of na tional news on this matter obscures the tremendous advances the police profession has made in recent de cades. Although each contemporary misdeed still provides cause for concern, it is important to recognize the achievements in improving officer professionalism and agency account ability. Unfortunate incident s do occur, but policing has succeeded in laying the foundation for a strong and pervasive culture of integrity. The remaining question is how to improve street- level police operations. Although accountability mechanisms, hi gher educational standards, and ethics awareness training are all laudabl e steps, do they suffice to bring about a fundamental improvement in the routine behaviors of police officers on the street?6 Agencies must embrace the devel opment of new technological applications not only to enhance officer safety and improve the success of prosecution efforts, but also to allow citizens to better unders tand crime and policing in their community. Police execu tives need to provide effective leadership to ensure a culture of true integrity and accountability in their agency. Those who design ethics tra ining and other educational seminars must seek out ways to move beyond simply telling officers to do the right thing; ethics training should ideally empower officers to anticipate the complex moral choices they must make , sometimes in a matte r of seconds. Agencies must continue to reinforce the notion that officers and agencie s serve the public; this service includes an element of transparency and accountability. Plan for the Realities of Tomorrow For decades, police agencies have struggled to generate and sustain a positive police image and an ethical organizational environment. Num erous advances have been realized, but the process continues. Police officials and community leaders must continue their dialogue in the searc h for ways to strengthen their organization's culture of integrity. In looking toward the future, police exec utives should consider how technological and social change creates both new challe nges and new opportunities. Shifting social values and behaviors mean different prior experiences that prospectiv e employees bring to an agency . These values, coupled with emerging technologies, also modify how some officers will express themse lves when off duty. Professional organizations must begin to explore the legal and ethical parameters of pre-s ervice and off-duty behavior, with the goal of providing executives with a better understanding of the rights of employees and agencies. Technological and social changes also represent an important opportunity for agencies to enhance their image and improve their ethics. Technological applications provide ne w ways to monitor officer conduct, which has the potential to enhance officer safety, improve offender prose cution, and protect officers from frivolous complaints and lawsuits. At the same time, however, these benef its can be offset by po tential opposition from officers and labor associations that view these technologies as invasive and unnecessary. Agencies now have increasing oppor tunities to provide transpare ncy in various aspects of their operations. Transparency enhances accountability and can improve the overal l image of an agency, yet it can also provide critics with ammunition to make distorted claims. Police execut ives must understand both the opportunities and difficulties presented by technological and social change. The implications of these developments may vary from agency to agency, but the k ey for all police executives is to plan today for the realities of tomorrow. 742 of 744[POST Management Program 2015] Notes: 1.
