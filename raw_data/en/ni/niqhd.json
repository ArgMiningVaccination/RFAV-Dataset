In our culture, we're used to the idea that \"more is better.\" If beta-carotene is good for the eyes, then a whole bunch of beta-carotene must be really good for the eyes. This type of thinking is not how Mother Nature works when it comes to nutrition. Foods are balanced. Foods are loaded with lots of nutrients but never in megadose quantities. You'd be hard-pressed to find a food with 1,000 mg of ascorbic acid, let alone the 5,000 mg-10,000mg doses often sold at stores or from health care professionals. In the case of nutrition, \"more\" definitely isn't better. So where are supplement manufacturers getting the nutrients to make their pills? Most of what's being sold to us (even the supps with the healthy folks and rainbows on the label) are chemicals, repackaged in creative ways. Most supplements contain mega-dose vitamin isolates without their little guy partners, also known as vitamin fractions. Others are simply chemical compounds made in factories, also known as pure, crystalline vitamins. Both are synthetic and both are a detrimental to long-term health because they're man-made, not nature-made. Mother Nature knows best. Nutrients need each other to work effectively in our bodies. The big guys need the little guys just as much as the little guys need the big guys. When we take supplements in high doses or in isolation from their natural counterparts, there will be consequences. Initially, our bodies might do well with these synthetics because of our extreme deficiencies. But over the course of time, synthetic vitamins can create even deeper deficiencies. How to determine if your supplements are synthetic or food-based Does this mean we have to throw out our supplements altogether? Not so fast. First we need to know the difference between whole-food concentrates and synthetic supplements. It's all in the label. Read the ingredients. The ingredients tell it all. If a nutrient is listed as a food like liver, a glandular, an herb, fish oil, pea vine, or alfalfa, you're good to go. If there are chemical names like niacin, thiamine, or tocopherols, you've got a synthetic on your hand. Look at the DV percentage. The percentage of Daily Value is based on chemically pure vitamin fractions. If the nutrient on the label is listed at 100% or more, you've likely got a synthetic product on your hands. Remember, nature is low dose but highly potent. Beware of singular vitamins. Mother Nature works in tandem. Her nutrients are never found alone. If you're taking a supplement all by itself, such as vitamin E or D, it's guaranteed to be synthetic. Don't buy the hype. The supplement industry is an industry just like anything else. Major supplement manufacturers often sponsor studies and/or donate money to research programs at universities likely having some influence on both the study design and the results and conclusions reached. The simple truth is that profit margins are much higher when manufacturers replicate standardized compounds rather than go through the careful, labor-intensive, more expensive process of compounding whole foods. When it comes to supplements, it's safer to stick with intuition and follow Hippocrates' advice: \"Let food be thy medicine "}
