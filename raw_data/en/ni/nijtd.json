However, beyond the understanding that they're vital to whole-body health but not visible to the naked eye, most people can't explain exactly what chakras are, where they're located in the body or how they affect the physical and emotional self. Read on to learn all about the ancient energy system of the chakras, including its origins, mechanisms and (possibly) how to balance your own chakras. What Are Chakras? Chakras, meaning \"wheel\" or \"disk\" in Sanskrit, are thought to be portals through which the main energetic channels of the body flow. There are more than 72,000 energetic channels in the body called nadis (pronounced \"nah-dees\"), according to Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, global activist and founder of the Art of Living Foundation. Similar to veins carrying blood through the body, nadis are pathways carrying vital life force energy, often referred to as \"prana,\" throughout your entire being, according to practitioners of the chakra system. There are three major nadis involved in the discussion of chakras: ida, pingala and sushumna. These nadis run up and down the spine in a DNA-like helix, and chakras form where these three nadis intersect. Although there are more than 100 chakras in the body, seven main chakras align on the axis from the base of the spine to the top, or crown, of the head, and these chakras are what most people refer to when discussing the chakras. History of Chakras The concept of chakras is an ancient one. Originating in India, chakras were first mentioned in the Vedas, ancient yogic and spiritual texts, between 500 and 1500 BCE (though some Indian scholars believe the system can be traced back even further). The chakra system is closely linked to the practice and teachings of both yoga and Ayurveda, an ancient traditional medicine system. \"The Vedic way of life was all gathered by observation and intuitive knowledge,\" says Shankar. \"It's amazing how [ancient peoples] could feel the connection between the microcosm and the macrocosm in those days\u2014how stars, planets and the nadis/chakras in the body are connected.\" How Do Chakras Influence Health? The purpose of chakras is to maintain the free flow of energy in our bodies, which explains the translation of chakra as a \"wheel\" or \"cycle.\" \"Chakras are electromagnetic vortices that take in and redistribute subtle life force energy in and around the body,\" says Damla Aktekin, inner child energetic wound healer and founder of A Drop of Om. \"Understanding this system can give you a roadmap for what areas of your body and your life need attention and care right now.\" Each of the chakras is associated with nerve bundles, organs or glands in the particular area in which they're located. As such, they not only affect the physical functionality of that region but also may influence an individual's emotional and spiritual state. What Is a Blocked Chakra? When a chakra is balanced, energy flows freely throughout the body. However, when the free flow of energy is blocked in a chakra, which can occur due to certain lifestyles, experiences, physical environments and more, imbalance occurs. If a chakra is obstructed, a person may exhibit physical and emotional manifestations of the imbalance. It's unhealthy for the chakras to be either completely blocked or continuously overflowing with energy\u2014balance is the goal. However, when a non-life-affirming (stressful or traumatic) event occurs related to a particular chakra, that chakra begins to work faster to try to resolve the issue. \"When your nervous system goes into a fight, flight or freeze mode, your heart beats faster and your blood flow increases,\" says Aktekin. \"Your chakra system mimics this [reaction] on an energetic level by going into an overactive state and increases its rotation and activity where necessary.\" For example, imagine you find yourself in the aftermath of a car accident in which you were unharmed. You would still need to talk (thereby activating your throat chakra) to explain the situation to a police officer. Afterward, you most likely would feel like you didn't want to talk anymore (which indicates throat chakra energy depletion) and would probably want to lie down and rest (energy depletion in all your chakras), explains Aktekin. \"Over time, if the chakra keeps rotating at an unusually fast pace, it eventually breaks down and slows to a depleted rotation, even appearing as not rotating,\" says Aktekin. \"This means that chakra will then try to take energy from the other healthy rotating chakras, which means a complete depletion and an almost stopped motion in the entire chakra system.\" This extremely slowed movement is what most people refer to as a \"blocked chakra,\" but Aktekin prefers to call them \"not fully flowing\" chakras. \"In an ideal case, you want to have a flowing and resilient chakra system that knows when to open or close\u2014rotate or not rotate too much\u2014and doesn't get stuck in a certain position creating imbalances,\" says Aktekin. A lack of flow within the chakras can manifest as heaviness, discomfort, numbness and occasionally as pain in the body, she adds. Pain or discomfort in an area of the body might correspond to an area of your life that isn't flowing or functioning optimally, according to Aktekin. The stagnation manifesting physically due to a blocked chakra can begin to affect other areas of life as well, such as interpersonal relationships and career performance. \"Your emotions are felt and stored in your body, including complex emotional patterns related to traumas and stresses of your life,\" says Aktekin. \"These patterns of emotions may not be currently helping your life, especially if they require too much energy from your nervous system and energy body (chakras). These places of discomfort and pain are amazing opportunities for finding other ways to engage with life.\" In other words, unprocessed emotions may turn into physically stored symptoms. Because of this connection, chakras can be an important part of your inner guidance system. Awareness and understanding of the chakras can lead to a more holistic understanding of the connection between the physical, emotional and energetic body. The Seven Chakras The seven main chakras correspond to specific places in the body. Together, they create a symbolic energetic healing roadmap. Each chakra has specific attributes, such as a corresponding number, element, sense, color and more.

All chakras are meant to rotate at a healthy pace, taking in and redistributing subtle life energy throughout the body. If a chakra becomes blocked, there are ways to clear or restore balance to the affected chakra. How to Identify a Blocked Chakra Recognizing the physical and emotional effects of blocked chakras is the first step in restoring balance to the chakra system. A blocked chakra generally correlates with a heavy, stuck or uncomfortable sensation, including tingling or numbness in some cases. By tuning in to your body, you can discover any chakra blockages. To begin, mentally scan your body from feet to head (first chakra to seventh chakra) and head to toe (seventh to first), noticing anything that occurs, says Aktekin. Pain or discomfort in a certain area of your body may correlate to an area of your life that isn't flowing or functioning as you'd like. Once you identify where you're feeling \"off,\" you can begin to identify why that chakra region requires attention and what might bring balance to the area. For example, if your body scan takes you to your heart, notice where in your life there may be an imbalance of giving and receiving. Or, if your focus is being drawn to your throat chakra, think about all the ways you communicate with others using your words. If you're someone who frequently experiences stomach pain or digestive issues, the solar plexus chakra may be asking you to look at the power dynamics in your life. \"Our early developmental patterns often show up as certain body or chakra issues and patterns that repeat,\" says Aktekin. \"Becoming aware of these patterns opens up the doorway for you to take action toward your health and find ways to nourish yourself and meet your physical and energetic needs.\" How Can Chakras Be Cleared and Kept Healthy? Practicing yoga is one of the main chakra-balancing activities, as both systems have ancient Vedic roots and are therefore interconnected. In fact, there are specific exercises one can learn to support the health of each chakra. Meditation is also important. According to Shankar, if people could go on a silent meditation retreat every six months for three days, they could reboot their entire chakra system. Because frequent meditation retreats may not be practical for many individuals, he highly recommends breathing exercises, such as pranayama, a yogic breathing technique designed to help clear physical and emotional blockages in the body. Two of the three major nadis terminate in the nostrils. If healthy breath and energy are flowing through the nadis, the chakras remain open and flow appropriately. Certain types of music may also positively affect the chakras, according to Shankar, who recommends listening to anything with big drums to activate the the root and sacral chakras, instruments like the saxophone for the sacral and solar plexus chakras, string instruments like the cello and harp for the heart chakra, flute and piano for the throat chakra and tinkling bell sounds, gongs or even chirping birds for the third eye chakra. As for the crown chakra, \"by then, you want the whole symphony,\" says Shankar. Who Can Help Unblock Chakras? If blocked chakras are impacting your life physically or emotionally, there are certain practitioners who may be able to help resolve energetic stagnation for individuals interested in exploring this concept. \"In the case of long-standing childhood wounds and trauma and/or when it feels overwhelming to feel into your body, I recommend getting the help of a professional energy healer you trust,\" says Aktekin. That practitioner might [reiki](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/what-is-reiki/), [acupuncture](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/acupuncture-vs-acupressure/), tapping, [light therapy](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/best-light-therapy-lamps/), [crystal healing](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/guide-to-healing-crystals/), aura cleansing, massage or other types of energy medicine. The theory of chakras is that when they are in balance, you can live your best energetic life. Tune into your own chakra system to see if there are any areas that feel stuck, and maybe you can free the energy flow to feel more vibrant and healthy. Train Your Mind, Change Your Life.
