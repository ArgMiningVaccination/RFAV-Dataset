However, that doesn't make the ache and pains, plugged and runny noses any less irritating. Wouldn't it be great to not only get through an entire winter season but enjoy it and stay healthy throughout? This is not impossible. In fact, [Naturopathie](https://naturopathiend.com/naturopathic-medicine/) has six simple solutions for you to follow to strengthen and protect your immune system to keep you feeling healthy and strong all winter long. Boost Your Immune System During The Winter Here are six ways to improve your immune system during winter and stay active. 1. Ensure You Wash Your Hands Often and Properly Think about just how many times you're shaking hands with people, touching doorknobs, handling money and using your phone. All of these are breeding grounds for germs, dirt and bacteria. It's of utmost importance to ensure you're frequently washing your hands with proper care by using warm water and soap for approximately 15-20 seconds each time. 2. Eat A Protein-Filled, Healthy Diet It's important to eat a healthy diet filled with low-carb vegetables, protein sources such as meats, nuts, or eggs, and healthy oils such as olive oil or avocado oil. Veggies like broccoli and cauliflower are extremely low in calories and full of antioxidants, making them a great choice to load up on your plate for winter meals. Garlic is another great source for strengthening and enhancing your immune system because it contains allicin. 3. Drink A Lot Of Water Staying hydrated is important all year long, especially during the colder seasons. Drinking water frequently and in large amounts is important to eliminate bacteria and toxins in the body and improve your general health and overall wellness. 4. Get An Adequate Amount Of Sleep Sleep deprivation can cause a myriad of health problems, one of them being a weak immune system. Functioning the same negative way sugar impacts the body, the immune system's functions become suppressed when you don't get enough sleep. Those who get less than seven hours of sleep each night are at least three times more likely to develop a cold. 5. Exercise Outdoors Exercising outside can actually boost your immune system immensely. It may not be entirely tempting to get out in the cold and work out, but the results will do wonders for your physical and mental health. Bundling up and heading outside for a jog, hike or even a walk with friends can do wonders for your immune system. 6. Take Supplements Taking daily supplements such as vitamin D, probiotics, vitamin C and astragalus can help protect and support your immune system greatly. You should also test for your vitamin D to see if your levels are healthy.
