I focus on the extremes of contemporary Mexican society \u2014disenfranchised indigenous families and members of the global meritocracy \u2014and in doing so, I demonstrate how citizenship retain s value for some while being rendered irrelevant for others. More specifically, I argue that the privileged do not position themselves as citizens through claims to public resources; instead, they accumulate cultural capital through privatized services. Th rough an examination of processes of racialization and patterns of bioconsumption, I critique the broad application of the concept of citizenship, and make a case for the consideration of the bioconsumer (individuals for whom market -based consumption of me dical services plays a formative role in how their identities are syncretically portrayed and perceived). The main stakes of bioconsumption are the presentation of self and accrual of cultural capital. Furthermore, I demonstrate how what is under negotiat ion in the alternative birth movement is the social -moral body onto which identities get mapped. Close ethnographic study reveals how the so -called \"humanization\" of birt h and the reduction of maternal and infant mortality are distant projects that are col lapsed onto one another and produce an emerging ideology of \"good parenthood.\" In this ideology, children represent parents' stake in the contemporary global meritocracy. This work therefore uncovers how traditional ways of birthing are being destroyed and reinvented through racialized class privilege, which is based on a model of neoliberal consumption that simultaneously promotes \"humanity\" and reinforces inequality by infusing transnational movements with reified class logics and racialization. I thus c onsider Mexican traditional midwivery as a unique lens for examining how indigeneity becomes an object of consumption via ethnomedical piracy within a transnational racialized economy. Through 28 months of in -depth, multi -sited research across Mexico, fr om October 2010 to November 2013, this dissertation analyzes the physical and social mobility of some individuals, and the relative immobility of others, through the lens of humanized birth. In writing this dissertation, I aim to make the following interv entions: First, I disrupt notions of citizenship -making by placing under the same lens those for whom citizenship is always just out of reach and those for whom citizenship is not a concern as their privileged access to privatized markets allows for a supr a-state existence. I offer the concept of \"supranationalism\" as a contribution to emerging literature that rethinks states as the consolidation of territory and government, thus opening up other ways of concep tualizing polity and geography. In doing so, th is dissertation challenges Foucault's 1978 framing of biopolitics . I use the topic o f birth to provide ethnographic evidence of how biopower is not only imposed by states upon citizen -subjects; but by powerful, extra -governmental, social and economic forces operating in the context of neoliberalism, thus resulting in real material consequ ences and shaping health outcomes. Second, I deploy the concepts of racialization (\"raza\" vs. whiteness , see Roberts 2012b ) and power (\"reproductive governance,\" see Morgan and Roberts 2012 ) when I critique the ways in which the global alternative birth movement inadvertently appropriates and commodifies 2 indigenous culture. When \"indigeneity\" is invoked in the realm of so -called \"humanized\" birth, the object is fetishized, separated entirely from its cultural, socioeconomic, and geographical context, and repackaged for mass consumption \u2014leading me to rethink the relationship between neoliberal citizenship and consumerism. Instead of directing attention to the body -turned - merchandise (e.g. organ trafficking and surrogacy , see Scheper -Hughes and Wacquant 2006 ), I use the example of midwifery in Mexico to examine racialized identities -turned -merchandise, with real effects for the bodies of women. Building upon studies that explore the political economy of the body under contemporary global capitalism, I use a t ransnational context to analyze the political economy of identities vis -\u00e0-vis the body. In this dissertation, I examine the disparate and unequal distribution of \"traditional ,\" and ethnomedical forms of \"natural\" birth among social collectiviti es. Building upon Roberts and Scheper -Hughes' work, the dissertation examines the mobility of humanized birth practitioners and participants who travel across borders to contribute to ideology and practices being produced transnationally, while comparativel y immobile women are socially situated in ways that preclude their participation in medical migrations. Thus, while my ethnographic research provides detailed examples of how humanized birth is reshaped and reconstituted in sites that bear stark contrast t o the social and geographic locations where the humanized birth model was originally produced, I am more concerned with how politic economic terrains are not only traversed, but are themselves transformed by medical migration. Finally, I complexify notion s of feminist liberation by asking how humanized birth may be the first step within a new regime of pressures and \"requirements\" presented by modern -day \"good parenting.\" I resist viewing children only as commodities; however, I do argue that children repr esent parents' stake in our contemporary meritocracy \u2014a system that naturalizes extreme inequality by allowing us to believe in democratic structures and the idea that education and proper preparation will open doors for children to a brilliant future. Furthermore, I suggest that the pressure of meritocracy pushes back into the womb. The difference between a privatized and public childhood begins in vitro with prenatal care. In chapter one, I offer a series of interlacing ethnographic portraits that set th e stage for the theoretical interventions I develop in later chapters. I introduce a network of transnational birth attendants \u2014midwives with diverse training \u2014in order to demonstrate how racial politics overlap with socioeconomic class to shape and constric t realms of possibility for consumption and citizenship. This chapter serves as an initial demonstration of unequal participation in the humanized birth movement and (im)mobility among midwives; thus signaling how celebration of \"going back to nature,\" com modification of indigenous culture, and simultaneous racialization of indigenous \"others\" are collapsed within the so -called humanization of birth. Chapter two points to how the humanized birth movement inadvertently commodifies indigenous culture in sy mbolically canabilistic ways. Members of the transnational humanized birth community seek \"natural\" births that reference \"traditional\" and \"indigenous\" birthing methods. However, these methods are not adopted wholesale; rather, they are reimagined by the community and reconfigured by capitalist marketing. My work builds off of Brubaker and Dillaway's 2009 assertions that natural childbirth discourse reflects class and race biases and are based on middle -class rationalist economic ideology emphasizing cont rol and informed consumer choice and requiring access to resources available only to privileged women. While Scheper -Hughes and Wacquant point to how the commodification of the body results in alienation of the self, in this present dissertation the commodification of others' (imagined) \"selves\" can lead to violence being unleashed on their bodies. 3 Chapter three problematizes uncritical notions of liberation by asking how humanized birth may contribute to a new regime of pressures and standards fo r modern -day \"good parenting.\" Through ethnographic examples of women who struggle or \"fail\" to give birth naturally (see Crossley 2007), the dissertation points to how humanized birth may inadvertently represent another way the burden of correctly produci ng future citizens falls upon women, even as it aims to liberate women from biomedical hegemony. While biopower has often been characterized as the control of populations through \"paternalistic\" institutional and governmental surveillance, humanized birth practices beg the question of how \"maternalistic\" biopower might operate through social networks. I bring a critical medical anthropology perspective to health - related \"mommy wars\" circulating in popular media and analyzes how parents use birth to stake claims to moral superiority. My ethnographic research in Mexico points to how couples seek inclusion in a global meritocracy by investing time, money, effort, and emotions into being \"good parents,\" and the criteria for good parenting is largely defined b y parenting trends in their social network (humanized birth, extended lactation, organic/holistic nutrition, Montessori and Waldorf education, extracurricular activities, etc.). As couples increasingly consider parenthood and their ability to produce well -nurtured, well -educated, well -rounded, ethically conscious children a marker of their overall success, their relationships to their children are changing. The dissertation aims to add complexity to Jordanova's remark about considering children as commodit ies. Chapter four responds to Brubaker and Dillaway's assertion that , \"We need to conduct comparative research on the subjective experiences of pregnant and birthing women at multiple social locations and multiple contexts, as well the experience and per spectives of midwives and medical providers in order to provide a more critical and meaningful analysis of the complicated intersections of ideology, politics, practice and bodily experience\" (Brubaker and Dillaway 2009). In this dissertation, examining mu ltiple social locations and contexts is exactly what I will do. Through contrasting ethnographic examples of how local San Miguelenses experience their hometown as an internal borderland that excludes them from \"gringo\" spaces (except as service workers), and how urban \"outsiders\" are excluded from \"closed\" indigenous communities in the Nahua High Mountains of Veracruz, this chapter signals how \"othering\" in Mexico is both highly contingent, and a matter of perspective. The chapter offers the concept of rac ial i(nter)dentification as a way for thinking about the syncretic nature of racialized identities. Racial i(nter)dentification points to the multiple variables that figure into immediate, unconscious mental calculi structuring encounters of difference \u2014that is, \"race,\" class, education, and other forms of cultural capital are folded into one another to produce social constructions of racial identity that include and supersede phenotype. While my argument resembles Bourdieu's habitus (1984), I have developed racial i(nter)dentification as a way of simultaneously acknowledging the readily visible phenotypic differences between those who are served and those who serve. Chapter five builds upon chapter four by examining how racial discrimination buttresses systemic violence within Mexican obstetrics, thus eliciting complicity from medical personnel, with the greatest violations being unleashed on racialized women's bodies. While others have written about \"race\" and racialized biology , my work is about the cons truction of social identities that allow for the manipulation of \"race. \" What is being racialized is not the biological body or the national body, but the moral body. Thus, I turn to the work of Michael Montoya, Marisol de 4 la Cadena, and Elizabeth Roberts to argue that raza in Latin America is a complex social category that extends beyond \"race\" to include class, education, and \"culture.\" While chapters three and six explore how whitening is sought through private medical care by educated, urban women , in chapter five I provide ethnographic examples of how \"reproductive governance\" is applied to the supposedly hyper -fertile indigenous women. In doing so, I critique the concept of \" interculturality \" and use conditional cash transfer programs like Oportunidad es as a lens for examining complex and unequal relationships of power between indigenous women and the Mexi can government. Poor indigenous women are recruited into Oportunidades , shaped into obedient mothers , and required to give birth in government hosp itals. My framing signals the inadequate attention of \"interculturality\" to political economic factors and questions the reification of cultures upon which \"interculturality\" is premised. Chapter six builds off of chapter four by examining how citizensh ip fails to encompass the way privileged women are proactively constructing whiter subjectivities (see Bashkow 2006) through New Age approaches to natural birth and participation in the humanized birth transnational network. This chapter adds to ethnograph ies on reproduction that have analyzed divergences between foreign in terests and local moral worlds and studies problematizing notions of \"g lobalization \" when it examines medical migration among the humanized birth community in Mexico. Responding to Roberts and Scheper -Hughes' edited volume , the dissertation examines the ease with which mobile humanized birth practitioners' travel across borders and contribute to transnational discourse, while re latively immobile Mexican midwives and families are restricted from medical migrations. Medical migrations and tourism imply big economic stakes for sending and receiving countries, and transnational negotiations of citizenship and capital. My work differs from previous work on medical migration and medical tourism since these discourses are implicitly nationalist and my work explores how identities are forged and leveraged by travelers in a transnational racialized economy. The conclusion of the dissertation situates the humanized birth movement in Mexico within the broader context of global New Age practices. I explain how the New Age is not only a context for examining the redefinition of social identities, but also for analyzing how consumption, or lack thereof, leads to the accrual of cultural ca pital on one hand, and social inequality on the other. New Age practices are useful for thinking about how the negotiation of social identities are inscribed with processes of racialization, socioeconomic class, power, and agency. Furthermore, I discuss ho w New Age practices challenge Euro -American ontologies of time through differential meanings ascribed to \"modernity\" and \"traditionality\" by informants with divergent positionalities in society. At the same time, notions of \"social whitening\" play out thr ough consumption of the New Age on a global stage. Finally, the conclusion addresses the importance of place when planning health programs and interventions. i For my mother and Popo, the two bold, spirited, and morally courageous women who have inspired me with their unwavering love. ii TABLE OF CONTENTS Cast of Characters iii Introduction v Acknowledgements xxvii Curriculum Vitae xxviii Chapter One 1 Portraits: Racial Politics Among Birth

A woman arrives at the door, her belly contracting fiercely and regularly. While the contractions send waves of pain throughout her body, she is calm and determined. She and her husband have driven along the dark winding path fo r several hours, family members piled into the back of their pickup truck, to seek out the midwife. The woman is alert and aware of what could happen, but she is unafraid. She has brought new life into this world many times before \u2014the grey hairs sprouting around her temples evince her years of experience nurturing and raising children. But this time she refuses to be humiliated or shunned. Everyone is quiet, as they are all witnesses to a clandestine act. The midwife has agreed to be an accomplice \u2014she will provide her expertise and aid the woman in her defiant plan. The woman and her husband enter into the midwife's bedroom, and the curtains are drawn behind them. Nothing is heard in the house except for soft whispers of encouragement, until a newborn baby c ries out into the black of night. In the city of Irapuato, warm water caresses a woman's naked body. She sways back and forth, breathing deeply, timing her movements to the rhythm of the soft music she chose for this moment. Two young midwives reassure her . She is attempting something that has not been done before in her community \u2014she doesn't know anyone who has been successful \u2014but traumatic memories of being strapped down and sliced open while bright lights blinded her sight give her the bravery to proceed . Her husband is by her side, holding her, waiting with her. Finally, the baby begins crowning at her loins, and moments later he is swimming in the water. His mother supports him with her hands, brings him to the surface of the water, and brings him to he r breast. *** My research analyzes how the remaking anew of tradition \u2014the return to \"traditional\" birthing arts (home birth, midwife -assisted birth, water birth, \"natural\" birth) \u2014has resulted in the commodification of indigenous culture and the re -inscri ption of racial inequalities on the one hand, and, despite feminist rhetoric about women's liberation from (masculine) biomedical hegemony, the reconfiguring of parent -child bonds in ways that again place the burden of correctly producing future bioconsume rs on women's shoulders. I focus on the extremes of contemporary Mexican society \u2014disenfranchised indigenous families and members of the global meritocracy \u2014and in doing so, I demonstrate how citizenship retains value for some while being rendered irrelevant for others. More specifically, I argue that the privileged do not position themselves as citizens through claims to public resources; instead, they accumulate cultural capital through privatized services. Through an examination of processes of gendered racialization and patterns of bioconsumption, I critique the broad application of the concept of citizenship, and make a case for the consideration of the bioconsumer (individuals for whom market -based consumption of medical services plays a formative role i n how their identities are syncretically portrayed and perceived). The main stakes of bioconsumption are the presentation of self and accrual of cultural capital. Furthermore, I demonstrate how what is under negotiation in the alternative birth movement i s the social -moral body onto which identities get mapped. Close ethnographic study reveals how the so -called \"humanization\" of birth and the reduction of maternal and infant mortality are distant projects that are collapsed onto one another and produce an emerging ideology of \"good parenthood.\" In this ideology, children represent parents' stake in the contemporary global meritocracy. This work therefore uncovers how \"traditional\" ways of vi birthing are being destroyed and reinvented through gendered and raci alized class privilege, which is based on a model of neoliberal consumption that simultaneously promotes \"humanity\" and reinforces inequality by infusing transnational movements with reified class logics and gendered racialization. I thus consider Mexican \"traditional\" midwivery as a unique lens for examining how indigeneity becomes an object of consumption via ethnomedical piracy within a transnational racialized economy. Through 28 months of in -depth, multi -sited research across Mexico, from October 20 10 to November 2013, this dissertation analyzes the physical and social mobility of some individuals, and the relative immobility of others, through the lens of humanized birth.i In writing this dissertation, I aim to make the following interventions: First, I disrupt notions of citizenship -making by placing under the same lens those for whom citizenship is always just out of reach and those for whom citizenship is not a primary concern. (The latter groups' privileged access to privatized markets allows for a supra -state existence.) I offer the concept of \"supranationalism\" as a contribution to emerging literature that rethinks states as the consolidation of territory and government, thus opening up other ways of conceptualizing polity and geography. In doin g so, this dissertation challenges Foucault's 1978 framing of biopolitics . I use the topic of birth to provide ethnographic evidence of how biopower is not only imposed by states upon citizen -subjects; but by powerful, extra -governmental, social and econom ic forces operating in the context of neoliberalism, thus resulting in real material consequences and shaping health outcomes. Second, I deploy an intersectional approach to the concept of gendered racializationii and poweriii when I critique the ways in wh ich the global alternative birth movement inadvertently appropriates and commodifies indigenous culture. When \"indigeneity\" is invoked in the realm of so-called \"humanized\" birth, the object is fetishized, separated entirely from its cultural, socioeconomi c, and geographical context, and repackaged for mass consumption \u2014leading me to rethink the relationship between neoliberal citizenship and consumerism. Instead of directing attention to the body -turned -merchandise (e.g. organ trafficking and surrogacy, see Scheper - Hughes and Wacquant 2006), I use the example of midwifery in Mexico to examine racialized identities -turned -merchandise, with real effects for the bodies of women. Building upon studies that explore the political economy of the body under contempo rary global capitalism, I use a transnational context to analyze the political economy of identities vis -\u00e0-vis the body. On medical migration, Roberts and Scheper -Hughes write, \"Not only people and bodies \u2014surgeons, patients, handlers and body parts \u2014migrate, but also sometimes medical therapies that travel across geographical and political economic terrains are reshaped and modified in surprising ways\" (Roberts and Scheper -Hughes 2011: 3). For Roberts and Scheper - Hughes, medical migrations emphasize the movement of objects, people, knowledges, therapies and technologies within political -economic configurations of globalized bi o-medicine. In this dissertation, I examine the disparate and unequal distribution of \"traditional,\" and ethnomedical forms of \"natural\" birth among social collectivities. Inspired by Roberts and Scheper -Hughes' work, the dissertation examines the mobilit y of humanized birth practitioners and participants who travel across borders to contribute to ideology and practices being produced transnationally, while comparatively immobile women are socially situated in ways that preclude their participation in medi cal migrations. Thus, while my ethnographic research provides detailed examples of how humanized birth is reshaped and reconstituted in sites that bear stark contrast to the social and geographic locations where the humanized birth model was originally pro duced, I vii am more concerned with how politic economic terrains are not only traversed, but are themselves transformed by medical migration. Finally, I complexify notions of feminist liberation by asking how humanized birth may be the first step within a ne w regime of pressures and \"requirements\" presented by modern -day \"good parenting.\" I resist viewing children only as commodities; however, I do argue that children represent parents' stake in our contemporary meritocracy \u2014a system that naturalizes extreme i nequality by allowing us to believe in democratic structures and the idea that education and proper preparation will open doors for children to a brilliant future. Furthermore, I suggest that the pressure of meritocracy pushes back into the womb. The dif ference between a privatized and public childhood begins in vitro with prenatal care.iv \"Humanized\" and \"Traditional\" Births In this dissertation, I focus primarily on two contrasting types of birth. \"Humanized birth\" ( parto humanizado ) is usually used in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America to describe birth that purposefully resists medicalization and technocratic practices (see Davis -Floyd 1992). This movement is analogous to the home and water birth movements in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. Births are often attended by professional midwives (although some obstetricians have joined the movement) and accompanied by doulas. In general, proponents of humanized birth criticize power inequality inherent in physician -patient relationships an d denounce medicalized practices such as unnecessary cesarean sections, episiotomies, isolation of birthing mothers in hospital labor and delivery areas, labor induction (including the use of hormones such as Pitocin), and the repetitive insertion of medic al personnel's fingers into women's vaginas to assess dilation. However, some informants expressed a more nuanced definition of humanized birth, explaining that a highly medicalized birth can be considered \"humanized\" if the interventions were medically ne cessary and/or if the interventions were \"chosen\" by the birthing mother. At the same time, some Mexican physicians have railed against the terminology of \"humanized birth,\" asking if the birth they attend is, by default, \"animalistic.\" Thus, some prefer t he term \"respected birth,\" since it highlights respect for birthing mothers' \"choices,\" which can be prioritized in both medicalized births and births attended by physicians. Likewise, \"traditional\" birth (home birth attended by a \"traditional midwife\") represents an alternative to medicalized, technocratic, hospital birth. It is also an example of resistance to the hegemonic way of birthing. However, the women who have \"traditional\" births occupy a highly contrastive positionality within society when co mpared to their \"humanized\" counterparts. Their births are less about \"choice\" and more explicitly about resistance to biopower (see Foucault 1990[1978]) and the Mexican Secretary of Health's mandate that all births take place in hospitals since every birth can potentially involve life -threatening complications. The Mexican government uses the conditionality of the cash -transfer program, Oportunidades , to incentivize recipients to adhere to the Secretary of Health's mandate, citing the reduction of maternal and infant mortality as the primary goal. These forms of \"reproductive governance\" (see Morgan and Roberts 2012) are differentially experienced and understood by poor and indigenous recipients of Oportunidades . As Vania Smith -Oka (2013) points out, some women reject \"traditional\" midwifery and actively seek out \"modern\" motherhood through medicalized birth. In this dissertation, I focus on indigenous women for whom giving birth with a \"traditional midwife\" exemplifies their refusal to be racially discrimin ated against in government hospitals, and socialized as \"appropriate pregnant subjects\" whose bodies are \"sites of risk\" (see Howes -Mischel 2009). viii In referring to these births as \"humanized\" and \"traditional,\" I am simply using the terms I encountered i n the field. When \"studying up\" (see Nader 1972), the alternative births described in this dissertation were most commonly called partos humanizados by parents, obstetricians, and professional midwives. Likewise, the women to whom I refer to as \"profession al midwives\" self-identify with this term, are classified as such by their clients, and some (with important exceptions) have undergone formal training and licensure1. With respect to \"traditional midwives,\" I am again adopting the terms these practitione rs use for themselves. Indigenous midwives most often self -identify as parteras tradicionales , while a small minority refer to themselves as parteras emp\u00edricas (\"empirical\" or experienced -based midwives). While all of these terms were the ones offered to me by informants, they also come from the realm of policy as parteras profesionales and parteras tradicionales/parteras emp\u00edricas are the terms used by the Mexican Secretary of Health and other governmental bodies like the Mexican Institute of Social Secur ity. Midwives may use these terms to describe themselves as a result of their engagement with government agencies for training, certification, hospital privileges, etc. I am by no means assigning a value judgment to either type of birth attendant, nor am I arguing that \"traditional midwives'\" practices are anchored in the past, while \"professional midwives'\" practices are representative of greater modernity (see Bauman and Briggs 2003). From here on out, I will forego quotation marks when referring to thes e practitioners. My research focused on the births of two socioeconomic extremes of Mexican society \u2014 what is missing from the story is the vast majority of Mexicans who make out their lives somewhere between these two distinct poles. Likewise, while no d ata exists as to what percentage of women have \"humanized\" and \"traditional\" births in Mexico, these two birthing strategies represent a small minority. The vast majority of births take place in hospitals and are highly medicalized, with cesarean section r epresenting 45.8 percent of births in public Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) hospitalsv and approximately 70 percent of births in private hospitals.vi In spite of these facts, I have chosen to study \"humanized\" and \"traditional\" births because of what they together reveal about the mutual imbrication of colonial legacies and transnational economies operating in the present day. My work is not about how the bulk of Mexican society gives birth, but rather about examining life and the process of br inging into life at the extremes of Mexican society in order to understand the unfolding of gendered racialization and the limitations of the citizenship concept in a globalized, neoliberal world. By contrasting racialized Oportunidades recipients with mem bers of the \"global professional class\" (Kapoor 2004), I mean to tell a complex story in a complex way. Through examining these exceptional cases in conjunction, we can begin to see how citizenship is actively sought but not fully attainable for some, whil e being devalued for others who forego government -provisioned services in favor of the cultural capital gleaned from the \"conspicuous consumption\" (see Veblen [2006]; also Ritzer 2001) of more socially -valuable bodily practices. My story uses birth as a point of departure, thus seating theoretical arguments in ethnographic accounts describing both sensual and violent moments experienced through the flesh and authored with blood, births unfolding in both symbolically cleansing water and life -producing mud; h owever, the subject of my theoretical analysis reaches far beyond the object of ethnographic description: a critical rethinking of \"race,\" citizenship, and the consumption of \"culture.\"2 1 I will return to this topic in the conclusion of the dissertation. 2 \"Culture\" as a reified object ready for consumption, not as a set of everyday beliefs and practices pertaining to a particular ethnic group. ix This positioning of my ethnographic research at the intersection be tween processes of gendered racialization and \"conspicuous consumption\" (see Veblen [2006]; also Ritzer 2001) in Mexico illuminates how participation in the humanized birth movement is used as a form of cultural capital with which to wage claims about \"rac e,\"3 gender, and identity on a global stage. While couples practicing humanized birth in Mexico are often urban, middle or upper class, fair skinned, well traveled, and highly educated, they insist the practice does not correspond directly to social class. Repeatedly, I was told the determining factor was how cultured4 the couple is. The majority of these couples holds advanced degrees in the sciences and humanities (as opposed to technical) fields, and has read widely in English or French. Their commitment to the humanized birth movement is based in their deep admiration of the work of French obstetricians such as Fr\u00e9deric Leboyer and Michel Odent, English and American midwifery and \"gentle birth\" advocates such as Sheila Kitsinger, Ina May Gaskin, Barbara Harper, Thomas Verney, and Robbie Davis -Floyd, and New Age birth methods such as Mongan Method Hypnobirthing. During in -depth interviews, they opine that the truly rich are often mystified by hegemonic biomedicine; however, they, with the fervor of religio us converts,5 vow to a sort of enlightenment with respect to birth, allowing them to see what others cannot. This enlightenment connects them to a global community, primarily in United States, Canada, England, France, Holland, Spain, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, based on shared passion for humanized birth. What their telling erases, of course, are multiple, contingent processes of gendered racialization (see DeGenova 2005).6 Many of the couples are fair skinned, but their participation in the humanized birth movement is also a process of \"social whitening\" on a global stage. My use of the term \"social whitening\" refers to the process through which individuals seek membership in a global meritocracy \u2014a meritocracy that, due to a global history of imperialism and colonization, tends to be white or aspires to social whiteness (see Bashkow 2006). In this context, \"white\" does not strictly coincide with phenotype, but, rather, refe rs to a social category 3 As I will explain in more detail below, I am not debating whether \"race\" is a biological given or a social con struct (see Montoya 2011). Rather, my work analyzes the origins and effects of processes of gendered racialization. Also, I have deliberately selected processes of racialization as an analytical lens over \"ethnicity\" because, while important differences di stinguish the various indigenous groups I describe, my overarching argument traces discriminatory politics in Mexico that contrast indigenous and mestizo individuals instead of distinguishing between different indigenous ethnicities. 4 During interviews, informants distinguished themselves and other members of the humanized birth movement from the rest of society based upon their \" nivel cultural \" (cultural level) as opposed to socioeconomic class. I do not unquestioningly accept this self -identified catego ry as accurate \u2014in fact, I am attentive to how socioeconomic status allows for education and travel, and, thus, exposure to the humanized birth movement as it unfolds in different countries around the world. Therefore, I ask if cultural capital is used to m ask economic capital (see Bourdieu 1984). 5 During interviews with informants, analogies to religious conversion and descriptions of how humanized birth has influenced their lives, reconfigured their identities, and transformed how they relate to others were common themes. 6 I borrow DeGenova's concept of racialization, but I add the words \"gendered\" and \"processes\" to draw attention to the role of gender among multiple, ongoing, interfacing mechanisms that lead to the (re)realization of racialization. x resulting from a dialectic process of perception and performance of an individual's positionality in society \u2014a calculus that includes \"race\" and class, and ultimately maps \"race\" onto class, and vice versa . Through humanized birth, participants are able to distance themselves from the majority of Mexican society, which they characterize as entrapped in a political and educational system which limits intellectuality; and with the help of professional midwives representing a foreign o r transnational identity,7 insert themselves in a transnational affluent, cultured community. Meanwhile, indigenous8 Mexican women and their traditional midwives are excluded (almost entirely) from this community. While there is a celebration of \"ancestra l knowledge,\" the humanized birth movement in Mexico \u2014departing from the work of de la Cadena 2000 in Peru \u2014 is not about claiming and enacting \"indigenous culture\" while attempting to distance oneself from \"Indian -ness\" through mestizaje and the idea of indigenous mestizos . In Mexico, indigenous people are distinctly \"other,\" and this new midwifery is decidedly not the midwifery of the old indigenous hag (see Weismantel 2001). When \"indigeneity\" is invoked, it is in \u00e1 la carte fashion. The object is fetichize d, separated entirely from its cultural, socioeconomic, and geographical context, and repackaged for mass \"indigeneity,\" \"nature,\"9 and \"tradition\"10 are collapsed onto one another. Similarly, very specific indigenous 7 Many professional midwives in Mexico are either foreign nationals or foreign -trained. 8 My usage of the terms \"indigenous women\" and \"indigenous people\" refers to individuals who self-identify as indigenous, speak indigenous languages, and live in rural, i ndigenous zones. The indigenous people with whom I worked are from the following ethnic groups: indigenous women as racialized mothers, I am not intending t o reproduce universalizations that ignore the diversity of indigenous peoples across Mexico or reduce political economic factors to a mere question of racial difference; however, I recognize that government programs and development discourse often do, empl oying similar strategies for dealing with reproductive health issues (mostly oriented around reducing maternal and infant mortality) across different indigenous populations (for example, see Cabral Soto et. al. 2000). 9 As I noted earlier, I am foregoing q uotation marks around terms offered by informants; however, I am placing them around direct quotes and concepts that I am explicitly problematizing. Throughout the dissertation, the terms \"indigeneity,\" \"Indian -ness,\" and \"indigenous culture\" are placed in quotation marks to throw into question the notion of a single, reified way of being an indigenous person. I am drawing attention to the way in which the idea of a singular \"indigeneity\" is mobilized versus the multiplicity of how indigenous people live their lives. I place \"nature\" and \"returning to nature\" within quotes to draw attention to how the notion of nature can be deployed as a reified category to satisfy specific objectives. I am not essentializing \"nature\" as pure and valuable, nor am I arguing that through humanized birth women are returning to a more natural, and, therefore, more positive state. Such value judgments lie beyond the purview of my work. However, as STS (Science, Technology, and Society) scholars and critical feminists alike would argue, the concept of nature must always be situated within social and historical contexts, and unequal relations of power (see Edu 2015, Haraway 1997, Haraway and Goodeve 2000, and Thompson 10 I place \"tradition\"/ \"traditionality\" and \"modern\"/ \"mo dernity\" in quotes when I am questioning Euro -American ontologies of time and the chronology of progress, but not when xi women \u2014only several across the entire country \u2014routinely attend international new midwifery conferences and forums. At these events they perform their indigeneity, wearing indigenous costume even if this is not their everyday attire, thus buttressing the uncritical claim that new midwifery is, in fact, a descendent of \"traditional\" midwifery, and that humanized birth means \"going back to nature\" and recognizing \"our shared humanity.\" In contrast, the \"traditional\" midwifery care indigenous birthing women receive is not celebrated \u2014instead, it must be corrected, rescripted, controlled, and surveilled. Indigenous mothers and the traditional midwives who attend their bi rths are agentive and resourceful decision -makers, whilst facing the challenges of intersecting forms of oppression (see Glenn 2002, Roberts 1997, Grankza 2014, Crenshaw 2014, and Haraway 2014). Professional midwives and international NGOs participate in t his process under the guise of capacitaciones (training workshops) meant to reduce maternal mortality (see Berry 2013; Molina 2006), their involvement bolstered by \"humanitarian reason\" (Fassin 2012). In these encounters, the issue of \"race\" comes to the s urface. Racial difference is visually evident in a classroom of indigenous midwives taught by a nonindigenous Mexican health professional, or by a foreign professional midwife. It is discursively evident in interviews of Mexican midwives and of NGO staff w hen they provide opinions on violence and inequality within the NGO hierarchy, and, in particular, the American NGO founders. While inclusion in a global \"white\" community is sought by the middle and upper classes, being the objects of humanitarian (white) intervention is often resented by the indigenous lower class. Thus, this dissertation asks, is the transnational humanized birth movement unfolding in Mexico an example of Renato Rosaldo's \"imperialist nostalgia\" (see Rosaldo 1989)? Can these trends be read as mourning for \"what one has destroyed\" and \"the passing of traditional society\"? More specifically, what does the simultaneous surveillance of indigenous midwifery practices and the \"return\" to \"traditional\" types of birth among nonindigenous member s of the humanized birth movement indicate about imperial/colonial legacies operating in Mexico in the present day? While I resist far -reaching and often totalizing terms like \"neocolonialism,\" I am interested in how colonial histories merge with present -day market logics under a rubric of bioconsumerism, thus binding bioconstitutionalism11 with supranationalism.12 Humanized birth affords many examples of \"biosociality\" (Rabinow 1996); however, this is only the beginning of my story. The ways in which mem bers of the humanized birth movement recognize themselves and others involved as \"empowered\" actors and conscientious referring to people and practices that were identified as traditional by informants. In chapter five, I will deconstruct the very presupp ositions upon which the \"traditionality\" \u2014\"modernity\" binary is based. 11 The ways in which people perceive themselves as biological beings, forge identities through specific biological practices, and wage claims based on these biologized identities. 12 How \" cosmopolitanism\" and major political formations of neoliberalism result in medical resources; cultural capital; monetary and ideological exchanges; social networks, belonging, and [bio]socialities; and health -seeking behaviors and mobilities unfolding outs ide the scope of citizenship to a particular nation or state for an increasing number of high -mobility individuals and ex -patriots. See \"A Cosmopolitanism of by Craig Calhoun and Cosmopolitan Conceptions: IVF Sojourns in Global Dubai (2015) by Marcia C. Inhorn. A useful source when thinking about how our lives and bodies are shaped by market forces is Joseph Dumit's Drugs for Life: How Pharmaceutical Companies Define Our Health . xii parents of superiorly nurtured children provokes me to question how people position themselves vis-\u00e0-vis transnational communities. At sta ke are the criteria upon which novel, value -laden, gender -racialized identities are forged. Through ethnographic details, I am not only signaling how one's positionality in society (gender, economic class, skin color, education level, experiences living ab road, etc.) influences one's perception of oneself and others, and in turn how that individual is perceived by others, but also how people and information travel transnationally, and in the case of humanized birth, how this travel often originates in the G lobal North. In essence, I am pointing to how neoliberal ideologies circulate in the South, and how consumerism mobilizes a rhetoric of \"humanity\" among the \"cultured class\" while simultaneously reinforcing social inequality by inadvertently infusing trans national movements with class -based exclusionary logics and gendered racialization. This dissertation describes cosmopolitan spaces in which highly -educated, cultured individuals are fervently spinning meanings about birth, and, consequently, about \"race ;\" and rural contexts in which indigenous women's bodies, the objects of government and NGO interventions, are scripted by racial discourse imposed from \"above.\"13 These contrasting spaces are geographically distinct and reflect deep material inequalities ( see Langer and Tolbert 1996); however, they are also mutually constituted by relationships of power \u2014neither space would exist in its current form without the other. I take a relational perspective (see Men\u00e9ndez 2010; Molina 2013). My argument is not that t hese different spaces are individually bound in ways that diminish their effects on each other; rather, they represent disparate lived realities and signal differential access to power, and, thus, the unequal production of discourse and representations on a global stage (see Fassin 2010; Malkki 1996, 2010). Furthermore, my multi -sited fieldwork is based on an interdisciplinary conceptualization of place and space.vii The dissertation demonstrates how different spaces (contested, geopolitical, transnational, gendered, and embodied) converge to create specific places. Using the example of the professional midwifery model in Mexico, the dissertation questions the extent to which health models can be successfully applied to different local contexts (see Tsing 20 15). The dissertation describes deep social inequality in the picturesque city of San Miguel de Allende, known for its large, semi -permanent population of American retirees, and suggests that this contested space provides fertile ground for an emergent mod el of care. It gives examples of how this model has spread through geopolitical and transnational spaces, and how it articulates with gendered space and embodied space in other local and institutional contexts (see, for example, Thompson 2005). Essentially , I draw attention to the impossibility of cleanly extracting health models from one local context and implementing them in another. Background A great deal of recent anthropological scholarship on \"new midwifery\" centers around how professional midwives in different countries are helping women reconnect with \"nature,\" teaching them to trust in their bodies, respecting women's \"choices,\"14 confronting and defying 13 I am not arguing that indigenous women do not describe no r ascribe meanings to their own bodies; rather, I am observing that government bodies and NGO leaders inadvertently perpetuate race-based inequalities when they fail to recognize the \"target population\" as knowledgeable interlocutors and instead utilize ra cial frameworks formulated from within a locus of power. 14 I problematize uncritical notions of free choice by drawing attention to how, for most Mexican women, choices are either nonexistent or prestructured. Women (especially indigenous and xiii hegemonic biomedical structures, and fighting for women's right to birth as naturally as possi ble (see, for example, Davis -Floyd 2009; Katz Rothman 2007; MacDonald 2008; Simonds 2007). Often, there is a tendency to position midwives as primary agents of change and main protagonists of the story since pregnant women and birthing mothers are the subj ects who are acted upon \u2014they are transformed and \"empowered,\"15 their lives changed forever by exposure to the midwifery model of birth. The work of Sheryl Nestel 2006 on reemergence of midwifery in Ontario, Canada traces how professional midwives, employ ing a rhetoric of universal womanhood, failed to engage critically with their own (white, upper -middle class) positionality in Canadian society, thus reproducing race inequalities among the midwifery profession. Hers is the counter -history of the reemergen ce of midwifery, but she fails to critically examine \"race\" politics among recipients of midwifery care and within the humanized birth transnational community. My work is the counter -history to the counter -history: it not only examines how \"race\" inequalit ies are reproduced, but asks how novel claims related to \"race\" are waged on a global stage through consumption of transnational (ethno)medicine. While my argument is not dissimilar to Elizabeth Robert's 2012 description of how Ecuadorian women pride C -section scars that evidence their participation in private medicine and assisted whiteness, I emphasize how distinct racialized identities are constructed relationally and operationalized transnationally.viii Furthermore, my work inverts the relationship between birth and \"modernity\" that is expressed in Cecilia Van Hollen's 2003 study lower class women's childbirth experiences and decision -making processes in South India. Reproduction and reproductive technologies form a crucial site for examining how people i dentify and represent themselves as \"modern\" individuals.16 While \"the modern\" is always evolving, it is always relationally defined by what is considered \"traditional,\" whether \"tradition\" is assigned a negative connotation or is romanticized and exalted (see Bauman and Briggs 2003).ix In this dissertation, I push beyond the false \"modernity\"/\"traditionality\" dichotomy to ask what can be learned from examining emergent traditionalities. That is to say, the dissertation asks how couples identify themselves as modern subjects through a \"return\" to \"traditional\" ways of birthing, thus disrupting the Euro -American ontologies of time. What is revealed about the reproduction of social inequity when \"traditional\" methods of human reproduction are used to question the linearity of progress and the binary nature of modernit y/traditionality? Thus, this work takes seriously Donna Haraway's broadening of the category \"reproductive technologies\" to not only include technomedical procedures, but also lower class) do not have options when giving birth in public hospitals. The very idea of \"choice\" emerges from a middle - and upper -class perspective \u2014\"choice\" is a privilege of those capable of paying for private medical services. My argument is informed by Bourdieu's c oncept of habitus: class provides the conditions that determine tastes; however, the role of class in determining taste is concealed and the relationship between taste and education is repressed; thus, tastes seem \"natural\" and are used to legitimate the s uperiority of the wealthy (see Bourdieu 1984). 15 I am critical of the notion of \"empowerment,\" asking what it does and for whom. Who does the empowering? For those who are \"empowered,\" were they truly \"disempowered\" before? Is hegemony really challenged if people in the Global South are \"empowered\" by ideas from the Global North? Lastly, I am wary of how neoliberalism and the concept of individualism and choice informs the notion of \"empowerment.\" 16 See, for example, Rapp 2000, Roberts 2012, Martin 2001, and Van Hollen 2003. xiv economic and biological processes that involve diaper pins, home birth, account ing techniques, population politics, breast milk, and baby formula (Haraway, 1997; Haraway and Goodeve, 2000). Instead of thinking about time in terms of rupture, this dissertation asks what can be gleaned from an ethnographic analysis of instances where the chronology appears to be reversed, and through a binational reading of anthropological literature (for example, considering Nestor Garcia Canclini's work in conjunction with that of U.S. anthropologists)? My research has been a double engagement: I pe rformed ethnography in Mexico, and, as a visiting scholar at the Center for Superior Research and Studies in Social Anthropology (CIESAS -D.F.) and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), engaged in theoretical and methodological d ebates occurring in Mexico. I aim to transform how U.S. academics think about gendered racialization, citizenship, and consumption through dialogue with Mexico, while simultaneously considering how exportation of theory from the Global North to Latin Ameri ca results in ideas being fractured, recast, and made more complex by Latin American theorists. Mexico has a critical scholarly tradition and is an ideal place to do transformative research, due to the insights of social medicine scholars like Asa Cristina Laurell (see Laurell 1997; Laurell Jaime Breilh17 (see Breilh 1998, 2003, 2008a), and, of course, anthropologists Eduardo L. Men\u00e9ndez (see Mend\u00e9ndez 1990, 1996, 2009, 2010) and Nestor Garc\u00eda Canclini18 (see Garc\u00eda Canclini 2001, 2009). I place scholarship in the North in an interdisciplinary conversation with scholarship in Mexico, thus producing a mutual dialogue instead of an Anglocentric reading of theory. Bilateral discursive engagement helps to conscien tiously dismantle colonial legacies embedded in U.S. academia. Also, unidirectional flow of frames of reference from the North to Mexico has had a profound impact on public health policy in Mexico (see Men\u00e9ndez 2009). By engaging with frames of reference f rom both North and South, U.S. health scientists can begin to apply Mexican theory to Mexican policy. This type of dialogue across borders not only helps to dismantle the discursive structure through which health sciences in the North position themselves as the primary or exclusive place to cite theory, but points to the richness of different academic disciplines around the world, and the immense knowledge and different perspectives that can be gleaned and produced by participating in a truly transnational dialogue about theory. As a dual U.S./Mexico citizen; a woman of Chinese, Mexican, Nahua, and Blackfoot descent; an ethnographer with significant research experience in Mexico; and an interdisciplinary scholar trained in the United States and engaged in th eory on both sides of the border, I aim to enact \"border thinking\" (see Mignolo 2000) to increase dialogue among global anthropologies. The Mexican Context My research moves from the realm of everyday reproductive practice to transnational organizations and policymaking, and evidences how women's bodies are often the locus where race, class, and gender oppression converge. I began my research at CASA (Center for the Adolescents of San Miguel de Allende) Professional Midwifery School \u2014an NGO co -founded by an American woman, and staffed by Mexican and American employees and volunteers. For the 17 While Breilh completed graduate studies in Mexico, he has returned to his natal country of Ecuador, where he teaches and la Universidad Andina Sim\u00f3n Bolivar. 18 Garc\u00eda Canclini is originally from Argentina and is a professor at la Un iversidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico -Xochimilco. xv past 14 years, it has been the only accredited professional midwifery school in Mexico. CASA's ongoing popularity is facilitated in large part by thousands of Canadi an and American retirees living in San Miguel de Allende \u2014many of whom are CASA donors. CASA's formal recognition by the Mexican government suggests the successful exportation of the humanized birth model and professional midwifery from the United States t o Mexico. However, I ask what might be revealed if this \"border crossing\" were to be more closely examined. Under the rubric of \"commensurability,\" how do concepts and medical technologies travel (see Pigg 2001); what are the disjunctures, deformations, and discontinuities of such travel (see Lakoff 2005); and most importantly, what are the productive and disruptive effects of this travel on the socioeconomic milieu and geopolitical landscape? Due to professional midwifery's formal inclusion in the Health Sector, and CASA's insertion in the universal health system, even the poorest pregnant women in the State of Guanajuato formally have formal access to professional midwifery services and water birth at CASA Hospital. In practice, however, women using the public health care system must request a referral for CASA's birthing services and such referrals are rarely granted. Furthermore, socioeconomically and georacially stratified birthing posture s belie uncritical notions of free choice and equal access. My work will look at how CASA \u2014in cooperation with the National Center for Gender Equity and Reproductive Health, the Panamerican Health Organization, the World Health Organization, and a slew of American and Canadian donor corporations \u2014foments its clients' sense of belonging through participation in a transnational and deterritorialized community of consumption. Here, I define \"clients\" as those who \"buy into\" the product that CASA offers \u2014 the hum anized birth model. These clients include those who David -Floyd refers to as \"postmodern midwives\" (see Davis -Floyd 2007), pregnant women seeking professional midwife - assisted birth, volunteers, visitors, and donors. Their community -wide discourse is mire d in human rights vocabulary, and suggests empowerment, while obscuring powerful, underlying forces related to neoliberal consumption. My research will ask how this discourse was made, who are the authors, and what may remain hidden in the process. As C ASA aims to expand the reach of the humanized birth model from the State of Guanajuato to the States of Veracruz, Chiapas, and Guerrero as wellx, the spread of this particular commodity across sharply disparate socioeconomic and georacial contexts calls attention to the question of citizenship. For example, while in San Miguel de Allende and in Mexico City, professional midwife -assisted home birth is a source of cultural capital and contributes to identity formation within a global meritocracy, in impoveri shed villages in Veracruz, traditional Nahua midwives risk imprisonment when they, against government instructions, secretly attend birthing mothers in their homes. These births are cast as the \"wrong\" type of home birth, since indigenous mothers and midw ives must submit to the expertise of biomedical physicians. Meanwhile, these same traditional midwives, many of whom have practiced midwifery for decades, are \"trained\" in workshops offered by CASA professional midwifery students, medical students, and ev en social workers \u2014many of who have never attended a single childbirth alone. During my ethnographic research, I observed how indigenous midwives were \"taught\" how to correctly perform midwifery, threatened with incarceration if a maternal or infant morta lity were to occur on their watch, and effectively rendered unpaid hospital referralists at the service of the state (see Carrillo 2002 and Pigg 1997, 2001). Thus, ethnography on the humanized midwifery movement in Mexico unmasks the violent contradictions embedded in xvi neoliberal consumption, and the relationship between restricted participation in communities of consumption and restricted access to citizenship. Professional midwifery student teaches a group of traditional midwives using dolls as props. xvii Traditional midwife with the baby and placenta model she has sewn by hand. xviii Hyper -self-reflexivity and Critique of How Development Discourse Reinscribes Inequality Given this dissertation's critique of multivalent processes leading to the inadvertent reinscription of social inequality between disadvantaged and privileged informants, I am both methodologically and ethically committed to Spivakian hyper -self-reflexivity will begin by \"acknowledging complicity\" (Spivak 1988b). While I am a w oman of \"ethnic\" heritage, I am also highly educated, privileged, and raised in urban and suburban United States. I cannot claim to be a subaltern, \"native\" informant. In many senses, my positionality has been advantageous \u2014I was able to interview and obser ve both \"up\" and \"down\" (see Nader 1972).xi My work attempts to uncover \"partial connections\" (De la Cadena 2015)xii and bring multiple \"situated knowledges\" under the same lens, while heeding Haraway's admonition: \" There is a premium on establishing the capa city to see from the peripheries and the depths. But here there also lies a serious danger of romanticizing and/or appropriating the vision of the less powerful while claiming to see from their positions\" (Haraway 2014: 45). Thus, I readily recognize my \"partial perspective\" (see Haraway 2014) and admit that my potential as an ethnographer was limited \u2014at times, it was difficult for me to get indigenous women, many of whom are suspicious of xinolas (city women) and/or monolingu al in their indigenous tongue, to speak openly about their birth experiences.xiii I often had to rely on a translator, which limited my access and changed the dynamic of interviews substantially. For ethical reasons, I placed women's comfort and respect for their privacy during intimate moments over my desire for ethnographic material. This meant, depending on the circumstances, occasionally choosing not to be present at the moment of birth. I made a conscientious decision to place myself in a learning role w hen dealing with traditional midwives and never sought out to teach them or correct them. Also, I purposefully limited my monthly budget to five thousand Mexican pesos (approximately four hundred dollars \u2014more than many of my impoverished informants, but mu ch less than my middle and upper class informants) in order to \"unlearn my own privilege\" (Spivak 1988a:287, Spivak and Harasym 1990:9). In turning to Mexico, and specifically to impoverished and indigenous zones, as the site for my research, I was not s eeking a \"repository of ethnographic 'cultural difference'\" (Spivak 1999:388), but, rather, hoping to illuminate a counter discourse to the pervasive story of development. Too often it has been assumed that interventions originating from the Global North (professionalizing midwives, providing traditional midwives with training workshops from medical personnel, implementation of humanized birth strategies) will produce positive results among the \"target population\" (reduced maternal and infant mortality amon g indigenous and impoverished populations). My research has shown that humanized birth is generally accessed by women who are highly educated, well -traveled, fair -skinned, urban, cultured, etc., and while I witnessed the important ways humanized birth st rategies have improved their birth experiences, I argue that the humanization of birth and the reduction of maternal mortality are distinct projects. As I will demonstrate in the dissertation, the respectful, knowledgeable, and attentive care offered by traditional midwives in contexts of scarce economic resources are generally not included under the rubric of \"humanized birth\" alongside services offered by professional midwives, obstetricians, and doulas \u2014when they are included, they occupy the niche of \"tr aditionality,\" rendering them needy recipients of expert knowledge from professional counterparts. As a result, the women who tend to seek out humanized births (i.e., home births and water births attended by gynecologists or professional midwives) are not the women at risk for maternal mortality, nor are their children at risk for infant mortality. xix Thus, while Spivak argues against the retrieval of information from the Third World for First World purposes (in humanized birth circles, this has usually mean t collecting maternal mortality statistics and using them as evidence of the dire need for humanized birth), I am attempting to show how First World strategies can unexpectedly induce gendered racialization processes that deepen inequality. In doing so, I am pushing against false notions of \"women's solidarity\" on a global scale, as I agree with Spivak that these notions obfuscate historical, cultural, and socioeconomic differences and colonial legacies. Methods I used multi -sited ethnography to follow the object of midwifery and humanized birth in Mexico (see Marcus 1995; Men\u00e9ndez 1996; Rapp 2000), thus identifying different \"windows\" through which recent shifts in birth practices and health care can be examined (see Wilson 2004). My decision -making proces s for prioritizing and selecting actors and field sites closely resembled the \"triage method\" developed by Charis Thompson in her 2013 book Good Science .xiv My ethnographic research began at CASA. However, after joining CASA students and administrators on a \"field practice\" trip to the High Mountains of Veracruz, I began to think about the issue of place -based differences and the importance geographical location plays in the reproductive care women receive. This required redefining my preconceived notion of an ethnographic field site. The field I identified was not a \"site\" per se, but, rather, a network of people. I began with professional midwives in Mexico, a contained and connected group of women, and subsequently gained access to their clientele. Simulta neously, I approached different transnational humanized birth leaders and interviewed them about their respective roles in the movement, both around the world, and specifically in Mexico. Using the snowball technique and through my attendance at multiple humanized birth conferences, I recruited more couples and humanized birth attendants, including physicians and obstetric nurses, to my study. Over the course of my fieldwork, I volunteered at two different transnational NGOs, gaining access to training wor kshops for indigenous traditional midwives. Having befriended a few indigenous midwives, and while staying as a guest in their homes during repeat visits to their villages, I was able to witness their interactions with indigenous women and the \"traditional \" midwifery care they provide. Finally, I observed medical professionals and maternity patients in both private and public hospital settings and solicited interviews with physicians and policy makers. This process led me to the Mexican states of Guanajuato I travelled to California for interviews, and Brazil for brief participant observation in what turne d out to be \"traditional Mexican midwifery\" popular education tourismxv. While the geographic breadth of this \"field\" is enormous, the specific people I travelled to meet, observe, and interview were very concrete and are conscientiously members of a cohesi ve transnational community. All the individuals in my study have acquaintances, and often great friends, among the other individuals in my study. Interviews were semi -structured and lasted from 15 minutes to three hours, with the average being approximatel y forty -five minutes. I tailored my questions to the interviewees' positionality within the humanized birth movement (whether the interviewee[s] was/were a mother, a couple, a humanized birth attendant [professional midwife, obstetrician, obstetric nurse], a traditional midwife, or a policy maker), but usually included questions to help me understand the interviewee(s) positionality in society (education level, socioeconomic status, xx ethnicity, etc.). In addition, my questions generally followed these themes : his or her occupation, life history, perspectives on gender, the Mexican health system, positive and negative experiences with birth, and the shifting political climate regarding midwifery. By not over - structuring the interviews, I resisted scripting or leading the informants, allowing them to speak for themselves. My data analysis is derived from detailed entries in my field diary, and audio and video recordings from interviews. Upon concluding my research, I engaged in an iterative process that used ope n coding to identify emergent themes and synthesize higher order constructs. Outline of the Dissertation The remainder of the dissertation is divided into six chapters, each engaging with the fields of medical anthropology and anthropology of reproducti on in novel ways:xvi In chapter one, I offer a series of interlacing ethnographic portraits that set the stage for the theoretical interventions I develop in later chapters. I introduce a network of transnational birth attendants \u2014midwives with diverse trai ning\u2014in order to demonstrate how gendered and racial politics overlap with socioeconomic class to shape and constrict realms of possibility for consumption and citizenship. This chapter serves as an initial demonstration of unequal participation in the hum anized birth movement and (im)mobility among midwives; thus signaling how celebration of \"going back to nature,\" commodification of indigenous culture, and simultaneous gendered racialization of indigenous \"others\" are collapsed within the so -called humani zation of birth. Chapter two points to how the humanized birth movement inadvertently commodifies indigenous culture in symbolically canabilistic ways. Members of the transnational humanized birth community seek \"natural\" births that reference \"traditio nal\" and \"indigenous\" birthing methods. However, these methods are not adopted wholesale; rather, they are reimagined by the community and reconfigured by capitalist marketing. My work builds off of Brubaker and Dillaway's 2009 assertions that natural chi ldbirth discourse reflects class and race biases and are based on middle -class rationalist economic ideology emphasizing control and informed consumer choice and requiring access to resources available only to privileged women. Nancy Scheper -Hughes and Lo\u00efc Wacquant's edited volume, Commodifying Bodies , explores how bodies increasingly enter into global market exchanges. The body can be bought and sold, both whole or in parts, dead or alive, effectively severing the body from the self, tearing it from the social fabric, and bringing it under the purview of market transactions in the form of sperm banks and international trafficking of kidneys, to name two examples. In Scheper - Hughes and Wacquant's volume, commodification of the bo dy results in alienation of the self, while in this present dissertation, the commodification of others' (imagined) \"selves\" can lead to violence being unleashed on their bodies. My research points to how the accrual of cultural capital through the commodi fication of \"others'\" culture is intimately and often destructively achieved in our neoliberal, globalized world. Chapter three problematizes uncritical notions of liberation by asking how humanized birth may contribute to a new regime of pressures and st andards for modern -day \"good parenting.\"xvii Through ethnographic examples of women who struggle or \"fail\" to give birth naturally (see Crossley 2007), the dissertation points to how humanized birth may inadvertently represent another way the burden of correc tly producing future citizens falls upon women, even as it aims to liberate women from biomedical hegemony. While biopower has often been characterized as the control of populations through \"paternalistic\" institutional and governmental xxi surveillance, human ized birth practices beg the question of how \"maternalistic\" biopower might operate through social networks. I bring a critical medical anthropology perspective to health - related \"mommy wars\" circulating in popular media and analyzes how parents use birth to stake claims to moral superiority. My ethnographic research in Mexico points to how couples seek inclusion in a global meritocracy by investing time, money, effort, and emotions into being \"good parents,\" and the criteria for good parenting is largel y defined by parenting trends in their social network (humanized birth, extended lactation, organic/holistic nutrition, Montessori and Waldorf education, extracurricular activities, etc.). As couples increasingly consider parenthood and their ability to pr oduce well -nurtured, well -educated, well -rounded, ethically conscious children a marker of their overall success, their relationships to their children are changing. The dissertation aims to add complexity to Jordanova's remark about considering children as commodities.xviii Chapter four responds to Brubaker and Dillaway's assertion that, \"We need to conduct comparative research on the subjective experiences of pregnant and birthing women at multiple social locations and multiple contexts, as well the experi ence and perspectives of midwives and medical providers in order to provide a more critical and meaningful analysis of the complicated intersections of ideology, politics, practice and bodily experience\" (Brubaker and Dillaway 2009). In this dissertation, examining multiple social locations and contexts is exactly what I will do. Through contrasting ethnographic examples of how local San Miguelenses experience their hometown as an internal borderland that excludes them from \"gringo\" spaces (except as servic e workers), and how urban \"outsiders\" are excluded from \"closed\" indigenous communities in the Nahua High Mountains of Veracruz, this chapter signals how \"othering\" in Mexico is both highly contingent, and a matter of perspective. The chapter offers the co ncept of racial i(nter)dentification as a way for thinking about the syncretic nature of racialized identities. Racial i(nter)dentification points to the multiple variables that figure into immediate, unconscious mental calculi structuring encounters of di fference \u2014that is, \"race,\" class, education, and other forms of cultural capital are folded into one another to produce social constructions of gendered racial identity that include and supersede phenotype. While my argument resembles Bourdieu's habitus (19 84), I have developed racial i(nter)dentification as a way of simultaneously acknowledging the readily visible phenotypic differences between those who are served and those who serve. Chapter five builds upon chapter four by examining how racial discrimi nation buttresses systemic violence within Mexican obstetrics, thus eliciting complicity from medical personnel, with the greatest violations being unleashed on racialized women's bodies. While others have written about \"race\" and racialized biology,xix my w ork is about the construction of social identities that allow for the gendered manipulation of \"race.\" What is being racialized is not just the biological body or the national body, but also the moral body. Thus, I turn to the work of Michael Montoya, Mari sol de la Cadena, and Elizabeth Roberts to argue that raza in Latin America is a complex social category that extends beyond \"race\" to include class, education, and \"culture.\" While chapters three and six explore how whitening is sought through private me dical care by educated, urban women,xx in chapter five I provide ethnographic examples of how \"reproductive governance\" is applied to the supposedly hyper -fertile indigenous women. In doing so, I critique the concept of \"interculturality\" and use conditiona l cash transfer programs like Oportunidades as a lens for examining complex and unequal relationships of power between xxii indigenous women and the Mexican government. Poor indigenous women are recruited into Oportunidades , shaped into obedient mothers,19 and required to give birth in government hospitals.20 My framing signals the inadequate attention of \"interculturality\" to political economic factors and questions the reification of cultures upon which \"interculturality\" is premised. Chapter six builds off o f chapter four by examining how citizenship fails to encompass the way privileged women are proactively constructing whiter subjectivities (see Bashkow 2006) through New Age approaches to natural birth and participation in the humanized birth transnational network. This chapter adds to ethnographies on reproduction that have analyzed divergences between foreign interests and local moral worlds21 and studies problematizing notions of \"globalization\"22 when it examines medical migration among the humanized birt h community in Mexico. Building on Roberts and Scheper -Hughes' edited volume , the dissertation examines the ease with which \"(ethno)medically situated\" humanized birth practitioners' travel across borders and contribute to transnational discourse, while \"s ocially situated\" women are restricted from medical migrations. Medical migrations and tourism imply big economic stakes for sending and receiving countries, and transnational negotiations of citizenship and capital. My work expands upon previous work on m edical migration and medical tourism since these discourses often focus on the economic effects for countries where medical tourism unfolds, whilst my work explores how identities are forged and leveraged by travelers in a transnational, gendered, racializ ed economy. The conclusion of the dissertation situates the humanized birth movement in Mexico within the broader context of global New Age practices. I explain how the New Age is not only a context for examining the redefinition of social identities, but also for analyzing how consumption, or lack thereof, leads to the accrual of cultural capital on one hand, and social inequality on the other. New Age practices are useful for thinking about how the negotiation of social identities are inscribed with proc esses of gendered racialization, socioeconomic class, power, and agency. Furthermore, I discuss how New Age practices challenge Euro -American ontologies of time through differential meanings ascribed to \"modernity\" and \"traditionality\" by informants with d ivergent positionalities in society. At the same time, notions of \"social whitening\" play out through consumption of the New Age on a global stage. Finally, the conclusion addresses the importance of place when planning health programs and interventions. In this dissertation, I place individuals with disparate socioeconomic and georacial positionalities under the same lens to problematize the appropriateness of citizenship as an analytic in neoliberal contexts. The humanized birth movement seemingly repre sents a \"return\" to the past, a reversal of chronology, and a challenge to Euro -American ontologies of time since women seek \"traditionality\" in a quest to identify themselves as modern. At stake is the relationship between states and individuals who, by r econstituting citizen and consumer subjectivities, are challenging anthropological notions of how biopower operates. 19 Smith -Oka (2013) argues that the program also produces indigenous women as \"modern\" citizens. 20 Some eagerly seek biomedical attention while giving birth, while others resist mandates due to prior experiences of racial discrimination. 21 For example, Sesia 2007 and Pigg 1997, 2001. 2000. xxiii In the following chapters, I will use ethnographic evidence to demonstrate how inclusion in global meritocracies is mediated by both class identification and processes of gendered racialization, resulting in claims to cultural capital and \"social whitening\" on a global stage. In an effort to describe how colonial legacies continue to shape identity formation, I will point to how gender -racia lized identities are relationally constructed and negotiated, and operationalized transnationally with important political and economic effects. Nonindigenous individuals seek inclusion in global \"white\" communities oriented around commodified forms that c onflate \"indigeneity\" with \"traditionality\" and \"nature;\" however, these communities do not unseat deep social inequalities between nonindigenous and indigenous people. Instead, strategies developed in the Global North for the humanization of birth and the reduction of maternal and infant mortality are inadvertently reproducing processes of gendered racialization and reinscribing inequality between global \"whites\" and indigenous people. Thus, my work underlines how neoliberal consumption in the 21st century simultaneously promotes \"humanity\" and reinforces inequality by infusing transnational movements with reified class logics and gendered racialization. I point to the simultaneous fetichization of \"indigeneity\" and silencing/surveilling of indigenous peo ple and their practices; however, I also emphasize the agency and dynamism with which indigenous people engage the commodification of their culture. In doing so, I draw attention to a mix of exploitation and entrepreneurship that throws into question dicho tomous notions of victor and victim. When thinking about ethnomedical tourism, I am simultaneously pointing to how the commodification of \"indigeneity\" collapses multiple ways of being indigenous and repackages them for mass consumption, and also how touri sm could potentially revitalize and invigorate individuals' pride in their culture. The humanization of birth is a valuable project. Between full -time fieldwork and teaching and research engagements in the Mexican academy, I spent three years and seven mon ths in Mexico, during which time I became very close to a number of my informants. I consider some of my former informants to be good friends and have maintained contact. I do not want my work to undermine their important efforts to demedicalize women's b irthing experiences and reduce the effects of obstetric violence. Furthermore, I do not wish to minimize the amount of love and care the parents I describe have for their children. The women who I interviewed participate in humanized birth because they are committed to giving their children the best opportunities in life, starting with how they are born. While I strongly agree with the demedicalization of birth, this dissertation does not focus on crafting a normative argument that assigns value judgments t o different birthing practices. Rather, I am engaging in an analytic endeavor that uses humanized birth as a lens for examining pressing anthropological issues: the commodification of culture, unintended effects of feminist liberation, and the limits of ci tizenship in our neoliberal world. i In this text, the terms \"humanized birth,\" \"gentle birth,\" and \"tranquil birth\" are used interchangeably to signal a movement that aims to \"empower\" women, reduce unnecessary biomedical interventions and cesareans, and eliminate obstetric violence. I will describe \"humanized birth practices\" in further detail beginning on page 4. To what degree and for whom these goals are met will be critically examined throughout the dissertation. ii For perspectives on intersectionality, see Glenn 2002, Roberts 1997, Gr anzka 2014 (including chapters by Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw and Donna Haraway).

Also, in 2012 a state -funded professional midwifery school opened in Guerrero. The Guerrero school is preparing to graduate its first cohort June 2015. xi \"Up\" and \"down\" refer to socioeconomic class and existing power structures. In her seminal piece, Nader argues that while most ethnographic studies have focused on the life ways of the poor, marginalized, and oppressed, anthropologists can glean a lot more insight about how power operates in society by conducting research from within the sites from which power is deployed (that i s, focusing on informants who wield power through economic influence and bureaucratic control). xii De la Cadena takes up Strathern's (2004) \"partial connections\" to cease thinking about societies as units that inter -relate, sometimes producing hybrids (i.e . mestizaje), and instead looks at how collectives are intra -related. Intra -connected (non -unitary), fractal bodies cannot be broken up into parts or wholes because of their kaleidoscopic simultaneity of similarity and difference. \"Partial connections\" is a relational form that allows for indigenous and mestizo to appear within each other and at the same time remain distinct. xiii Of course, total honesty and transparency during the ethnographic exchange is an unattainable ideal. See Briggs' 1986 critique. xxv xiv Faced with voluminous data regarding the \"ethical choreography\" of stem cell research, Thompson applied the analogy of \"triage\" to her research, thus developing a method for prioritizing some data over other data. Likewise, the focus of my research has be en guided by the underlying principle of pursuing the most prescient frames for diagnosing social inequality. xv Combining informal interviews, in -depth interviews, and persons whom I have observed, there are 2,069 subjects included in this study, 967 of w hom were observed in large group settings (training workshops, \" pl\u00e1ticas ,\" conferences, institutional meetings, etc.) and 1,094 of whom I observed on a more individual or family -level basis. Within my study are 111 professional midwives, 166 physicians, 288 traditional midwives, 65 nurses, 14 NGO administrators, 17 Secretary o f Health administrators, 18 hospital administrators, 8 doulas, 5 promotores de salud (health promotors/community health workers), 12 prenatal educators, 7 medical school professors, 22 professional midwifery school instructors, 9 medical anthropologists, 1 1 people within the field of public health/public policy, 125 mothers (33 in the postpartum period, 17 in active labor, 7 births), 31 fathers, and 19 pregnant women. Geographically, I have observed 306 subjects in Guanajuato, 137 in Guerrero, 247 in Jalisc o, 68 in the Federal District, 296 in San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed, 700 in Veracruz, 85 in Chiapas, 72 in Oaxaca, 103 in Quintana Roo, 8 in Michoac\u00e1n, 18 in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 7 in California (people who also work in Mexico), 3 in Mexico and the United States, 20 in multiple Mexican states, and 40 dispersed elsewhere. xvi As Elizabeth Roberts documents in her 2015 article \"Reproduction and Cultural Anthropology,\" feminist anthropology of the 1970s paved the way for critique of reproduction as a category. Since then, anthropologi sts studying reproduction have demonstrated that reproduction; which had formally been cast as personal, intimate, medical, natural, and biological; is deeply political and economic, a site of global processes, and saturated with stratifications of race, l abor, class, and sex (see also Jordanova 1995; Fraser 1995; Murphy 2011). However, the authors of humanized birth (Michel Odent, Frederick Leboyer, Ina May Gaskin, Sheila Kitzinger, etc.) aim to recast birth as a powerful, individual experience that empowe rs women and celebrates their natural ability bring new life into the world. Anthropologists have shown how taking reproduction as an object of study has great revelatory effects with regards to \"globalization\" and local/global disjunctures. For example, foreign concern with overpopulation in developing countries (often originating in the United States) shapes national endeavors to control population size (see Pearce 1995; Barroso and Corr\u00eaa 1995). These attempts to reduce population size, even when they are not linked to U.S. aid dollars, often demonstrate a nation's efforts to become prosperous and modern through the appropriation of Western science and technology (see Greenhalgh 1995). How do we explain the power of the United States over the reproduc tive patterns of women across the globe? According to Men\u00e9ndez, the dominance of American biomedicine around the world is an implicit function of the hegemonic medical model (HMM). He explains that the HMM was exported from capitalists countries to Latin America, and derives its hegemonic character from the political and economic relationships implicit between countries (see also Men\u00e9ndez 2009). This dissertation builds upon these literatures and aims to provide new insights regarding medical migrations, commodification of indigeneity, parenting in a global meritocracy, and challenges to interculturality in the context of racialized reproductive governance. xvii A great many anthropologists of reproduction have focused on how biopower is exacted on women's bo dies through medicalization, restrictions on abortion, population control, eugenics programs, etc. 1998; Leyland 1995; among many others). Medical anthropologists focusing on midwifery have positioned the midwifery model as a pathway to feminist liberation and resistance to (masculine) biomedical hegemony , (see Davis - Floyd 1992; Katz Rothman 2007; MacDonald 2008; Simonds 2007). At the same time, a number of anthropologists have focused on the relationship between reproduction, modern industrial capitalism, and the intensification of global inequity with re gards to material resources (Anagnost 1995; Martin 2001; Ginsburg and Rapp 1995; Colen 1995; Whittaker 2010). Some have turned their attention to the shift from productive children who contribute to the household economy to children who are consumed for by their parents (Layne 1999; Taylor et al. 2004; Rotman Zelizer 1994). xviii In the conclusion of her chapter \"Interrogating the Concept of Reproduction in the Eighteenth Century\" ( In Conceiving the New World Order), Jordanova offers a closing suggestion for future studies: anthropologists should begin to think seriously about children as commodities. xix See, for example, Kim Tallbear's Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science; Jenny Reardon's Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in the Age of Genomics; Marcia Inhorn's Cosmopolitan Conceptions: M\u00f3nica Sans, and Ricardo Ventura Santos' Racial Identities, Genetic Ancestry, and Health in South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay. xx Roberts (2015) indicates that in the industrialized world (nation -states made wealthy through a history of colonial capitalism, biological race is used to define the right and wrong types of reproduction, which in turn shapes polic y and practice both nationally and transnationally, especially in the realms of international population policy and migration (Fraser 1995; Goldade 2007; Morgan and Roberts 2012; Pashigian 2009). Nineteenth and twentieth -century battles about slavery, misc egenation, immigration, population control, eugenics, etc. played out both national and global stages, resulting in the categorization of people into fit and unfit reproducers (Douglass 2005; Horn 1994; Nouzeilles 2003; Stepan 1991). She argues that reproduction is increasingly codified as a biological matter of great interest to nations outside of North American and Western Europe (Greenhalgh 2008; Tarlo 2003 ; Unnithan -Kumar 2004). Pointing to how historical, economic, and environmental processes in different places shape one another, she warns against comparisons that portray differences and fixed and arising separately from one another. I will be thinking with Breilh 2003, 2008b; and Waitzkin's 2 000, 2011 to analyze of public health systems in Latin America. xxvii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I am grateful to my committee for their suggestions for revision throughout the dissertation writing process. Throughout my graduate career, Charles L. Briggs has urged me to challenge established frames of reference, deconstruct binaries, and begin \"as if I know nothing.\" With his encouragement, I have embraced \"border thinking\" (thus traversing disciplinary, sub - disciplinary, and geospatial boundaries) and engaged in binational production of discourse with both U.S. and Mexican s cholars. My present ethnographic writing was cultivated and galvanized by Nan cy Scheper -Hughes. Her close accompaniment throughout the writing process inspired me to weave stories in a way that provocatively advances the goals of public anthropology, boldly intervenes in ongoing theoretical debates, and does justice to my informants. Charis Thompson has provided me with interdisciplinary perspectives on intersectionality, thus signaling spaces in my work for deeper critique of interpenetrating class, race, and gender inequalities. Ian Whitmarsh has helped me think about how a plurality of ethnic identities are transformed into a science of race, as well as how biologic race is contested by practices around nation, state, and family. His instruction in medic al anthropology theory and academic counsel have been foundational to my development as a scholar. I am also indebted to my colleagues and friends in Mexico, without whom this dissertation would have never been accomplished. Eduardo Men\u00e9 ndez at the Cent er for Superior Research and Studies in Social Anthropology (CIESAS) served as a generous and stimulating mentor during my time as a visiting scholar in the Permanent Seminar in Medical Anthropology (SEPAM). By inviting me to deliver courses in the medical school and health sciences graduate program at UNAM, Alfredo Paulo Maya and Roberto Campos welcomed me into a vibrant scholarly community that assisted me in matching the content of my theory with the content of my ethnography. Ongoing dialogue throughout the dissertation writing process with members of the health sciences graduate program at UNAM has been formative to this present work. This dissertation benefited from the institutional access authorized by Maricruz Coronado, critically grounded intervent ions by research assistance by Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda. During my three year and seven month stay in Mexico, I enjoyed the friendship and support of David Garza, Jim Blakley, Yareli de Ch\u00e1vez, Reyna Hern\u00e1 ndez Ju\u00e1rez. Finally, I am appreciative of the care I have received from family and friends in California. I have been blessed with a lifetime of inspiration and love from my mother, Tuen Yee Wong. My pursuit of a doctoral degree in anthropology was bolstered by the constant encouragement of my late grandmother, King Chun Wong. I am thankful to Kim Hartson for her friendship and for serving as a sounding board on countless decisions. My graduate experience was enriched by the presence of Ned Garrett in the department o f anthropology. I am happy to have had his guidance and comradeship throughout the different stages of my doctoral studies. I owe great gratitude to the funding agencies and fellowships that have allowed me to pursue doctoral research: the Jacob K. Javit s Fellowship, UC Regents Fellowship, UC Human Rights Center, UC Global Health Institute, UC Institute for Mexico and the United States, UC Berke ley School of Public Health ( specifically Dan and Susan Lindheim as stewards of the Roselyn Lindheim Award ), and the Ford Foundation. xxviii CURRICULUM VITAE Address: Kroeber Hall, Department of Anthropology University of California Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94709 Telephone: Citizenship: American and Mexican (dual citizenship) AREAS OF INTEREST Cultural anthropology, medical anthropology, critical race theory Topical Interests: and whiteness theory, political economy, transnationalism, Geographic Areas: knowledge production and circulation.

Rather, this work presents humanized birth in Mexico as a kaleidoscope of fractal, shifting relationships betwe en objects and subjects. In this dissertation's opening refrain, I present a series of interlacing portraits which will allow me to weave together themes and conceptual threads presented throughout. Each person featured in these portraits is complex, and h as multifaceted relationships to the commodification of indigenous culture, feminist approaches to women's liberation, racial \"othering,\" and citizenship. This polytonal ensemble sets the stage for the symphonic unfolding of race, class, and gender inequal ities within the transnational humanized birth community. Montserrat Over the course of my research, I became increasingly concerned with the privilege and power enjoyed by foreigners living in Mexico. Many of these foreigners have resided in Mexico for many years and some eventually gain dual citizenship. Thus, while \"professional midwives\"1 with foreign origins and transnational trajectories consider themselves mexicanas , counterparts who have lived out their entire lives in Mexico continually label them as foreigners, despite their years of residence within Mexico. This insistence on signaling difference may result from resentment at the perceived ease with which foreign midwives leverage cultural capital emanating from their \"Americanness,\" \"Europe anness,\" and transnationalism to acquire economic resources and positions of power. After Sagrario2 remarked about how her former apprentice's national origin has resulted in greater privilege, culminating into a directive position within the Mexican Mi dwivery Association, I began traveling to different states to meet with foreign midwives and collect their life stories. Montserrat, Sagrario's former apprentice, lived in Chiapas at the time of our interview. When I walked into her alternative birth cente r, my attention was drawn to all the alternative treatments, therapies, and supplements for sale in the reception area and the beautiful colors and artwork on the walls. I noticed a poster for a belly -painting workshop for pregnant mothers. The center's Ne w Age approach to \"humanized birth\" commodifies and juxtaposes homeopathic remedies, with workshops on the midwife's \"magic,\" and groups that celebrate women's bodies and maternity. Montserrat guided me into a side room where we could have an intimate c onversation. She has long, dark blonde hair and bright blue eyes. She began to tell me her story: Montserrat lived in Spain from the time of her birth until she went to the United States to study university. As an undergraduate, she majored in anthropolog y, and subsequently she earned a master's degree in public health. She began informal midwifery training at a clinic in Guatemala before apprenticing at CASA with the internist and professional midwives. Then Montserrat went to New Orleans where she partic ipated in home births with \"urban hippies\" and \"rural Christians.\"i 1 I am placing \"professional midwives\" in quotes since the women I am referring to generally align themselves with licensed midwives around the world but do not hold licenses to practice midwifery in Mexico. The se women have engaged in academic study of midwifery to varying degrees. 2 Introduced in further detail in Chapter 2. 2 At the time of the interview, she was working with the Red Cross and running her own alternative birth center in Chiapas. Her international training evidences her heightened mobility and i s a source of accrued cultural capital. As a transnational figure, she represents a conduit for Mexican clients to European and North American spaces where \"whiter\" pregnant women are the recipients of similar professional midwifery practices. In this way, Montserrat connects her clients to a transnational community of global professional couples who seek unity through consumption of birthing methods understood as modern because of their traditionality. Montserrat expressed to me how exasperated she feels by contradictions in the Mexican health system and obstacles she has faced as a result of her transnational training. She studied midwifery online and is a certified nurse midwife; however, the International Confederation of Midwives does not recognize her certification and she is not licensed to practice midwifery in Mexico. Although she is not certified or licensed, her alternative birth center was granted a Health Establishment Code by the Mexican government, allowing her to sign and complete birth certificates. However, professional Mexican midwives who are certified and licensed do not have access to such a code. Also, indigenous women can be certified as \"traditional midwives\" if they demonstrate specific competencies. However, when Montserrat approach ed government officials requesting to be certified as a traditional midwife, she was rejected on the basis of her race \u2014 only indigenous women can be traditional midwives, she was told. Montserrat realized that \"indigeneity\" is collapsed with \"traditionality \" in the figure of the traditional midwife, thus disabling her from obtaining government permission to practice midwifery under the rubric of \"traditionality\" in Mexico. While Montserrat strives to make claims to \"traditionality,\" she is racially identifie d in a way that precludes her from being recognized as a traditional midwife. This disjuncture points to the syncretic nature of racial i(nter)dentification \u2014Montserrat's desire to be included as a partera Mexicana (a Mexican midwife) is overshadowed by the European identity that others locate within her. I asked Montserrat what the difference is between professional and traditional midwives. \"I [practice midwifery] in a Western way,\" she answered. Montserrat's assertion, \"the precedent depends on where yo u were born,\" emphasizes how \"race,\" class, education, and the color of one's passport (and whether one has a passport at all) are collapsed into a multivariate social gradient that differentiates some birth attendants from others. However, Montserrat's at tention to class and differences in origin between traditional and professional midwives does not extend to a critical reflection on the socioeconomic and racial grades among \"professional midwives.\"3 For example, when Flor, a CASA -trained professional mid wife, was pregnant with her first child, she began looking for a professional midwife to attend her birth. Flor considered Montserrat, but as a Mexican woman and the wife of a carpenter, there was no way she could pay the 18,000 pesos Montserrat charges.) On the topic of \"traditional midwives,\" Montserrat pointed to how these midwives possess varying levels of skill and experience. \"The problem with traditional midwifery is that all 'traditional midwives' are thrown in the same boat.\" As a result, skilled m idwives who have accrued lots of experience safely attending births but lack formal academic training are placed under the same rubric by government programs and hospital physicians with midwives who do not know how to safely manage drugs, leading to the o veruse of oxytocin injections, the untimely transfer of dystocic mothers to hospitals, and infant deaths. 3 See Sheryl Nestle 2006. 3 Montserrat offered Yanira as an example of a very capable and knowledgeable \"traditional midwife\" who is well known in Mexican humanized birth circle s and who regularly attends international midwifery conferences. \"Yanira is a 'traditional midwife' but she could definitely pass a [professional midwifery] certification exam. However, one of the things the Mexican Midwifery Association decided is that pr ofessional midwives and traditional midwives cannot be treated the same way.\" The Mexican Midwifery Association hopes to administer certification exams and create a professional guild in an effort to lend legitimacy to the work of midwives across Mexico. H owever, according to the rules established by the directive board (a board that includes obstetric nurses and \"professional midwives,\" but does not include \"traditional midwives\"), only midwives who have completed an academic course of study, in Mexico or elsewhere, are eligible for admittance into the guild. \"Traditional midwives\" shall be excluded until they become \"professional midwives\" by undergoing an academic course of study \u2014a path that is unlikely for indigenous midwives who practice midwifery out o f their rural homes while also raising families. I attended a Mexican Midwifery Association meeting in Mexico City and observed that most of the board was comprised of transnational birth attendants like Montserrat. The disproportional inclusion of transna tional birth attendants and stark exclusion of indigenous and traditional midwives is reminiscent of Nestel's 2006 study of how race inequalities are reproduced among the midwifery profession when professional midwives, employing a rhetoric of universal wo manhood, fail to engage critically with their own (white, upper -middle class) positionality. As the founder of an alternative birth center, Montserrat worked in a small indigenous village for five years training traditional midwives. However, after five y ears she decided to evaluate her own \"savior syndrome\" and discontinue her involvement in the village in favor of focusing all of her energies on prenatal education and private midwifery care in the urban center. She said, \"Who am I? I have never lived in a [village].\" She expressed her anxiety about NGOs that work in villages because, from her perspective, their interactions with villagers represent \"a type of colonialism.\" She admitted to me that the language barrier between her and \"non -Spanish speakers\" also led her to rethink her role as a leader of midwifery training workshops.4 Over the course of my ethnographic research, I found that Montserrat's experience is not unique. While the humanized birth movement in Mexico references indigeneity, usurps tra ditional midwifery practices, and commodifies the image of indigenous women; urban, transnational informants and rural, indigenous counterparts did not engage equitably under the rubric of humanized birth. As my fieldwork progressed, humanized birth became a critical lens for evaluating the challenges to achieving \"interculturality\" in Mexico, despite its ubiquitous incorporation in public health and development rhetoric. Montserrat's comments opened a space for me to ask probing questions about potential \"neocoloniality\" embedded within the Mexican Midwifery Association's organizational structure. Montserrat explained to me that in Mexico, there are a lot of \"hippy doulas\" \u2014\"all those women who drink their menstrual blood\" \u2014who could better serve pregnant w omen as professional midwives; but in Mexico, you have to have money to become a professional midwife. Furthermore, a lot of upper -class Mexican women who aspire to professional midwifery go to midwifery school in El Paso, Texas, thus forgoing licensure in Mexico. She opined that professional midwives in Mexico must be independent and rebellious. \"We could 4 Interestingly, Montserrat signals indigenous midwives' inability to speak Spanish instead of her inability to speak indigenous languages. See Molina 2006. 4 care less about the Secretary of Health's norms.\" According to Montserrat, those who are not sufficiently independent and rebellious disappear from profe ssional midwifery, including those who have completed a full course of academic study such as the one offered at CASA \u2014they get married and become homemakers, or they become nurses or physicians, or do other things. \"Being a professional midwife is a hard j ob.\" Paula Within a week after interviewing Montserrat, I traveled to Mexico City to interview Paula, one of the professional midwives Montserrat mentioned. Paula is an older woman with fair skin and white hair. Her poised movements and demeanor signal a life of privilege, beginning with her childhood and adolescence in Veracruz. She moved to Mexico City to study university, but she quickly fell in love and married, dedicating herself to homemaking and raising children instead of completing her studies. A fter a traumatic, highly -medicalized birth experience, she familiarized herself with the prophylactic method and became a firm believer that women can have natural, vaginal births. Her conviction impelled her to teach prenatal education courses to \"empower \" women for 15 years, but after seeing how this \"empowerment\" vanished as soon as women arrived at the hospital and submitted to biomedical authority, she became increasingly dissatisfied with her work. From Paula's perspective, (masculine) biopower is exe rcised over women's bodies within a patriarchal medical system, but my participant - observation draws attention to how humanized birth social networks (premised on standards to maximize the benefits of natural birth for mother and child) is an unintentional mechanism through which women, impelled by feminist ideals, exact \"maternal biopower\" on each other. Paula decided to return to her studies, completed a master's degree, and worked at a private foreign language school. She began reading about humanized bi rth and was deeply moved by the work of Sheila Kitzinger, anthropologist and natural childbirth activist in the United Kingdom, and when she and her husband moved to London for his work, she was able to meet Kitzinger and discuss her traumatic birth experi ences. Paula then spent time observing births with midwives across Europe \u2014England, Austria, Holland, and Ireland. Upon returning to Mexico, she was determined to become a midwife. She met a midwife/anthropologist in Tepoztl\u00e1n, Morelos5 who connected her t o Patricia Kay, an American midwife who was attending water birth for American and transnational couples living in Mexico. Like Montserrat, Paula is most definitely a transnational figure whose accrued cultural capital positions her as a conduit for client s to a humanized birth community of consumption originating in the Global North. Paula and a group of prenatal educators, along with one obstetric nurse and one acupuncturist, began taking classes from Patricia before traveling to El Paso, Texas to acquir e clinical training. (Later, Patricia Kay also gave classes to CASA's first and longest -lasting clinical director, thus playing a foundational role in the midwifery school.) Upon returning to Mexico, Paula led a civil association, traveling to different c onferences around the world, lobbying for home birth, and obtaining funds from Japan International Cooperation Agency, Mexico's Secretary of Social Development, and the MacArthur Foundation. The name6 selected for the association means \"midwives\" in Nahua and is meant to draw attention to how, in Paula's words, \"professional midwifery is the recipient [of knowledge] from traditional midwifery.\" For 5 A town known for a large population of resident foreigners. 6 Omitted here. 5 the last 11 years, Paula has dedicated herself to attending births, and the association she led is no longer r egistered. Throughout my fieldwork, I observed how encounters between traditional midwives and professional midwives positioned professional midwives as experts and traditional midwives as knowledge recipients, even when these encounters were framed as op portunities for mutual exchange. The dispersal of Paula's civil association throws into question the plausibility and sustainability of positive, equitable engagements between mobile humanized birth practitioners and their immobile, indigenous counterparts . She explained that the midwives of her association \"passed the baton\" on to other associations in Mexico, Brazil, and the Caribbean. These associations form a Latin American network, and while their connectedness points to the transnationalization of hum anized birth, I argue that it does not diminish the \"solitary contractuality\"7 defining how disparate groups interact in Mexico. Our interview was cut short when two couples, potential clients, arrived at Paula's home seeking information regarding the ser vices she offers. I was happy to sit and observe as the exchange took place between Paula and these two couples. Paula's domestic worker had shown the two couples into the library while Paula and I were talking in the garden. Paula entered into the study a nd exclaimed, \"Here I am, the one who is called 'midwife.'\" One of the couples had a rather bohemian style, while the other couple displayed all the trappings of affluence. Paula explained that while she is certified in the United States, her certification is not valid in Mexico, so if there are any complications with the birth, they have to switch to Plan B at a small clinic where a \"technical, medical team\" compromised of a surgeon, an obstetrician, and an anesthesiologist would place an epidural and perf orm a cesarean. Then the moment came for Paula to tell the couples exactly how much her services cost. She recommends prenatal consultations every month until the 22nd week, then twice a month, and weekly during the third trimester. She charges 600 pesos per consultation. She always attends births with a fellow midwife, and they charge 19,000 pesos to be split between them for each birth. Paula also works as a team with a homeopath and a biodynamics practitioner. Thus, the base price for prenatal care and birth with Paula is about 31,600 pesos, plus charges for homeopathic treatments and biodynamic sessions. Considering that minimum wage in Mexico was 67 pesos daily at the time of this research, birth with Paula represents 1.3 years of earnings at minimum wage. The cultural capital of her U.S. training overshadowed her lack of certification in Mexico for the affluent couples she serves. While Paula makes the most of lucrative opportunities afforded by humanized birth despite certification, the traditional indigenous midwives who participated in her extinct association did not enjoy similar opportunities. Paula's heightened mobility, fair skin, and high socioeconomic standing form a nexus that bares stark contrast to the comparatively immobile, indigenous, i mpoverished midwives she no longer engages. Yanira I traveled to Tepoztl\u00e1n, a short distance from Mexico City \u2014an artsy community comprised of affluent Mexicans and American ex -patriots. There, I spent the day with Yanira, the traditional midwife Montserr at described as possessing as much knowledge and skill as an academically -trained professional midwife. While this was our first meeting, I already knew a bit about Yanira from an American -made documentary on her work. At the time the documentary was film ed, Yanira was attending birthing mothers at a feverish pace. Both 7 Urry 2007:156, referring to Aug\u00e9 1995:94. 6 Mexican and foreign women traveled to Cuernavaca to give birth in her thriving home clinic. After the documentary, however, Yanira also became the target of kidnapping threats. Shaken to her core, Yanira and her husband abandoned Cuernavaca overnight. Initially, Yanira moved to Veracruz, hoping to take over Adeli's cliente, but ended up opting for a lower -profile lifestyle and a slower -paced practice in Tepoztl\u00e1n. Her work load has fallen fr om forty to ten births per month. I wondered about how Yanira's increased celebrity within transnational humanized birth forums caused interactions to shift between Yanira and members of her hometown. I gently inquired about the specific circumstances cau sing her to abandon her successful, well -known Cuernavacan clinic, but Yanira told me that the occurrences were too painful for her to talk about. Instead, she told me about how she became a midwife and about the unique position she holds within the transn ational humanized birth community. Yanira's mother, two aunts, grandmother, and two great -grandmothers were all midwives and curanderas. Her Nahua grandmother married a Spaniard, and was trilingual in Nahuatl, Spanish, and Latin; however, Yanira is monol ingual in Spanish. Yanira began assisting her mother and grandmother when she was seven, and started attended births on her own when she was fourteen. Yanira was first exposed to the transnational humanized birth community when she met Jan Tritten at a mi dwifery conference. Subsequently she met the editor of an Italian midwifery journal and accepted an invitation to speak about traditional Mexican midwifery in Italy. As her reputation spread and her birthing clinic grew, Yanira began receiving apprentices from around the world \u2014Austria, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Costa Rica, the United States, and even Israel. She has organized an \"exchange\" with these apprentices, and has traveled to their countries to speak about her work. Her next speaking eng agement is in Moscow. She explained to me that Midwifery Today invites \"the most traditional\" midwives to speak internationally, all expenses paid. Yanira is a special case in Mexico since she, along with a few others across the entire country, has constr ucted an identity that employs place -based knowledge as currency within transnational circles. Yanira's celebrity depends on the balance of two contradictory elements: despite her mono -national origins, she has become transnational, and despite becoming transnational, she continues to be perceived as mono -national. As I delved deeper into my fieldwork, tracing humanized birth -oriented social networks to interview and observe all the \"usual suspects,\" I began wondering if Yanira's paradoxical position is en gendered by the transnational humanized birth community's fetishization of indigeneity8--a fascination that allows for several indigenous women to serve as representatives of traditional Mexican midwifery at international conferences, but does not permit m erging of traditional and professional midwifery. When I asked Yanira what a \"traditional birth\" means to her, she responded, \" parto respetado \" (a respected birth). Her response interested me since I had never heard a traditional midwife use this term. Parto respetado is a term used interchangeably with parto humanizado among humanized birth practitioners. As biomedical birth attendants increasingly criticize the terminology of \"humanization,\" arguing that it inappropriately suggests that biomedicalized births are \"animalistic,\" parto respetado has gained popularity as the term of choice.ii I asked her to clarify what she meant. She explained that she respects the woman's choices, encourages 8 See Chapter 2. 7 women to move around during the birth, practices delayed cutting of the umbilical cord, and prepares a birth -inducing drink using chocolate, cinnamon, and zopatle .9 She uses la sobada and la manteada as necessary.10 During prenatal consultations, she inquires about the mother's diet and previous births, evaluates blood pre ssure, and tests urine samples for protein levels and infections. While Yanira describes her midwifery techniques as \"nothing extraordinary,\" the amount of attention they have drawn from a global audience certainly is. Yanira's case piqued my interest sin ce she was selected for being one of the \"most traditional\" midwives in Mexico; however, she does not speak Nahuatl and practices popularized \"traditional\" methods. During the course of my research, I had many opportunities to observe midwives who primaril y or exclusively speak indigenous languages and whose repertoires are comprised of remedies and techniques unbeknownst in transnational circles, yet these midwives are not present at humanized birth conferences nor Mexican Midwifery Association meetings. However, the delicate balance upon which Yanira's paradoxical identity rests has not gone undisturbed. Her increased mobility provoked violent reactions in her community, resulting in a type of exodus. Ironically, Yanira's mobility in humanized birth circ les dictates and limits where she can live, resulting in immobility in everyday life. Yanira and a Spanish apprentice 9 During the course of my research, I have observed that delayed co rd cutting is highly valued among humanized birth pracitioners. Likewise, chocolate, cinnamon, and zopatle is a well - known \"folk remedy\" that has achieved international \"cult status\" among those interested in traditional Mexican midwifery. Adeli (see belo w) taught this remedy to workshop attendees in Brazil. 10 Described in Chapter 6. 8 Luc\u00eda I also interviewed Luc\u00eda, an obstetric nurse living in Mexico City and one of Yanira's former apprentices. She first met Yanira at an international conference organized by Adeli. Jan Tritten, Founder of Midwifery Today, Robbie Davis -Floyd, author of Birth as an American Rite of Passage , and a number of Brazilian midwifery advocates were also in attendance. She explained to me tha t at the time she was curious about midwifery, but as the mother of two, she could not travel too far from home nor commit to apprenticing every day. She apprenticed under Yanira twice a week for more than a year. Luc\u00eda emphasized to me how generous and open Yanira had been towards her apprentices. Yanira accepted everyone who wanted to learn, allowing her students to sleep and eat in her home free of charge. However, as the mother of five boys, Yanira had to begin assigning apprenticeship dates to her va rious students so there would not be too many people in her house at the same time. When it was her turn, Luc\u00eda spent two weeks apprenticing in Yanira's home together with another woman from Brazil. At the time, it was common for Yanira to have more than one birthing mother at a time in her clinic. One day, three women were giving birth at exactly the same time. When Yanira informed her two apprentices that the three of them would each attend a birth, Luc\u00eda thought, \"Me? How?\" She had never attended a bir th before. The mother she attended was giving birth to her sixth child and the birth progressed smoothly, without any complications. When the woman's water broke, Luc\u00eda was bathed in amniotic fluid and was \"baptized\" as a midwife. When Luc\u00eda felt she had \"learned a bit\" from Yanira, she joined forces with another obstetric nurse from the Center for Maternal and Infant Research, Birth Studies Group. Luc\u00eda is not comfortable attending births alone, but enjoys partnering with another obstetric nurse. She has attended nearly 80 births over the last seven years. In addition, she gives perinatal education workshops at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Panamerican University, and the National Institute of Cardiology. Most of her time, however, is d edicated to leading the Mexican Midwifery Association, for which she is the president. She started the association using funds from the MacArthur Foundation with the goal of reducing maternal mortality. Although Luc\u00eda has limited experience attending bi rths in comparison to my other informants, as the former apprentice of Yanira, she is able to leverage her proximity to \"traditional\" and \"indigenous\" birthing practices in a way that Yanira cannot. Luc\u00eda's influential position as President of the Mexican Midwifery Association, helps to illuminate pathways to power and prestige within the humanized birth movement in Mexico. While Yanira's unique and paradoxical position in the humanized birth community provides her with access to transnational meetings, i t was also the impetus for the violent backlash that caused her to flee her hometown. Another indigenous informant11 complained to me that her inclusion in a Midwifery Alliance of North America conference in Canada had been solely based on her physical appe arance \u2014during the conference she was fetishized as a living \"poster\" of indigeneity. Thus, I argue that while Yanira serves as a representative of \"traditional midwifery\" at international midwifery conferences, Luc\u00eda's trajectory demonstrates that true cul tural capital is derived not from being Yanira, but rather, by being near to Yanira. Luc\u00eda does not fulfill logical requirements for the post of President of the Mexican Midwifery Association \u2014she is neither a professional nor a traditional midwife, nor do es she 11 See Mayra's story in Chapter 2. 9 possess extensive experience attending births. While Luc\u00eda was a key player in determining that traditional indigenous midwives would be excluded from the professional guild until completing an academic course of study, one could argue that Luc\u00eda al so has not completed an academic professional midwifery program and therefore should be excluded from the guild. Luc\u00eda's qualification for her post is based on her hospital -based training as an obstetric nurse (suggesting continued biomedical hegemony desp ite positioning of humanized birth as resistance to patriarchal biopower and medicalized birth). The underlying logic that buttresses Luc\u00eda's position as President also evidences how deeply the simultaneous commodification of indigeneity and exclusion of i ndigenous people is embedded within the humanized birth movement. Emma Emma is a Swiss woman who works as a midwife in Tulum, Quintana Roo. Before moving to Mexico 16 years ago, she studied naturopathy in university. She has eight children with her Mayan husband. Emma and her family live near the crystalline waters of the Riviera Maya in a small but touristy town that attracts visitors to the pyramids and resorters on holiday. This was not always the case. Before living in Tulum, Emma and her family lived for five years in her husband's Mayan village, but she was never accepted by the villagers \u2014her white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes, height, and body shape were too much for them to look past. She wanted to practice midwifery in her husband's natal village, but the women did not want her to attend their births, saying that a white woman could not really know. As a result, Emma now attends the births of foreigners. Emma's experience echoes that of Montserrat \u2014while she aimed to construct a \"local\" identity and integrate herself into the community, her European origins, phenotype, and multilingualism (which did not include native Mayan) led to her been racially identified as \"Other.\" Moments of rejection render visible the syncretic nature of racial i(nter)dentif ication. Despite being rejected by Mayan villagers, Emma's commitment to racial equity made a deep impression on me. As the mother of half -Mayan, half -Swiss children and the wife of a Mayan man, Emma is sensitive to racial inequality in Mexico. She descri bed to me how her husband went to pick up their baby from the hospital on one occasion and was stopped by a police officer on the street and accused of stealing the baby since such a fair baby could not possibly be his! For him to be the father of a baby t hat fair, the police man reasoned, the mother would have to be Caucasian, and that was just ludicrous! The police officer's assumption that \"white\" and \"indigenous\" do not mix points to reified notions of inter -ethnic interaction (and its limits). Racializ ed categories upon which inclusion/exclusion are based persist despite centuries of biological and genetic admixture. Emma seemed almost allergic to whatever privilege she might be granted based solely on her skin color. She told me how she is sometimes called a \"professional midwife,\" and how she makes a point to correct the speaker by explaining that she has never had any formal training, and, thus, should not be grouped with professional midwives just because she has fair skin. In Quintana Roo where s he lives, there is a large Mayan population, but in general, professionals and those who are in positions of power tend to be g\u00fceros (fair-skinned) and have Spanish surnames. For Emma, race and national origin are more salient categories than socioeconomic class. For example, she explained, when she showed a Louis Vuitton -carrying woman from Mexico City a video on water birth, the woman responded, \"How nice! But I already scheduled my cesarean.\" According to Emma, the women who seek out humanized birth are either foreigners living in Mexico or Mexican intellectuals who can think beyond Mexico's 10 \"paternalistic culture\" and \"culture of fear.\" While I understand the point Emma is trying to make, a key argument of this dissertation that power is not necessarily exercised by men and exacted on women. I use humanized birth as a lens for examining \"the matrix of women's dominations of each other\" (Haraway 1990: 155). In closing, the importance lent to \"race\" versus class cannot be parsed as simply as in Emma's deter mination (see Chapter 4). An important part of my argument is that \"race\" is mapped onto class and visa versa through processes of racialization. Class can by no means be denied. When interviewing Carolina, a prenatal yoga instructor in the city of Monterr ey, I asked her to describe the socioeconomic class of her clients and she responded with one word: \"High.\" Her work is about \"transcendence\" through practicing yoga, and she explained that while there exist a few \"transcended\" people who are \"extracts fro m the lower classes,\" these people do not attend her classes. A midwifery student at the same health center described her clients as \"middle -upper class, professional, educated, and informed.\" Two obstetric nurses in Mexico City insisted that while they at tend births of women from varying socioeconomic backgrounds, all of the women they attend are well educated and well read. Later that day, a homeopath and midwife told me that her clients are middle -upper class, informed, and actively seeking alternative c are. Given the ethnographic examples in this dissertation, my point is not to deny class in favor of \"race,\" but rather to explore how race makes class, and how class makes race. 11 COMMODIFYING INDIGENEITY: POLITICS OF REPRESENT ATION Chapter Two Mexican midwifery is \"good to think with\" because it enables us to explore the consumption of cultural medical practices and the idea of a traditional past in ways that are exploitative of the very people it claims to celebrate, embrace, and represent. While other anthropologists have deconstructed the complexity of biopiracy12, Mexican midwifery serves as an entryway for examining the multivalence of \"ethnomedical piracy.\" Building upon how others have thought about cultural marketplaces (see Chow 2002; Camaroff 2009; Clifford 2013), Mexican midwifery is an example of an emerging global ethnomedical marketplace.13 Although indigenous people are often discursively produced as specific types of subjects through research on topics such as la nd use, casinos, psychological pathology, and drug addiction (to name a few), Mexican midwifery is a unique example of how indigeneity as an object of consumption is sought through reproduction and health. In this chapter, I will offer examples of how peop le who self -identify as indigenous leverage their own racialized identities in order to use the commodification of \"indigeneity\" to their favor; however, I also want to think critically about the historical underpinnings at play when ethnomedicine is usurp ed by transnational humanized birth practitioners. In this chapter, I offer midwifery in Mexico as an example of \"imperialist nostalgia\": \"Nostalgia for the colonized culture as it was 'traditionally.' . . . Imperialist nostalgia uses a pose of 'innocent yearning' both to capture people's imaginations and to conceal its complicity with often brutal domination.\" (Rosaldo 1989:107 -108) Using Rosaldo's terms, I suggest that traditional ways of birthing are destroyed through power, then reinvented through pri vilege. What is striking about this example, however, is how reinvention of Mexican midwifery provides a pathway to cultural capital, status, and profit. I explore how in Mexico, indigenous people are commonly politically and culturally excluded as ahistor ical \"Others,\" while their \"culture\"14 is consumed and marketed as an object of desire. Consuming the Indigenous \"Other\" On a bright and dusty summer morning, I boarded a second -class bus to Matehuala, where I made a connection to Estaci\u00f3n Catorce. Befor e this trip, I had attended several training workshops for practitioners classified as traditional midwives. At each of these events, I was struck by visible manifestations of power inequality. The event in Estaci\u00f3n Catorce was billed as an encuentro (an e ncounter, or a meeting of two cultures) between professional medical personnel and traditional midwives. It was sponsored by the Secretary of Health's office for Traditional Medicine and Intercultural Development (TMID) and was organized by an anthropologi st\u2014elements suggesting a forum for mutual exchange of ideas. 12 See, for example, Cori Hayden's 2003 book, When Nature Goes Public: The Making and Unmaking of Biopiracy in Mexico. 13 Another example is t he commodification and sale of shamanism to Western consumers, as in shamanic tours to the healing compound of Joao de Deus in the Brazilian Amazon. 14 While I resist the notion of a homogenous culture among all indigenous peoples, I am pointing to how such a notion is socially constructed and then commodified. See Coombe 1998, hooks 1990, and de Certeau 1984. 12 At the encuentro , nurses, physicians, anthropologists, and professional midwives gave PowerPoint presentations to traditional midwives \u2014again, these professionals emerged as the source of expert knowledge. Many are interested in New Age therapies, and some even dedicated their presentations to the benefits of medicinal plants. While watching various professionals teach \"traditional\" remedies to the traditional midwives, I wondered if I was the onl y one struggling with the irony of the situation. I perused the agenda for the three -day event. Were the traditional midwives to have an opportunity to share their expert knowledge? The last two entries, at the end of the final day, were presentations by \" traditional midwives.\" While all other entries named the presenting professional and title of the presentation, the \"traditional midwives\" were unnamed and no indication was given regarding their presentation topics. Sofia 13 Looking around, I asked my self what was different about this encuentro compared to other workshops I had attended. As I scanned the crowd, I noticed a curious number of piercings and tattoos, foreigners with camping gear, and many people from Mexico City.iii At the entrance to the encuentro , beside the registration table, was a display of natural products for sale (shampoos, teas, marmalades, homeopathic remedies, etc.) These products and event publicity materials were branded with a cosmic/floral image in earthy tones, and the word \" Nanahtli.\" According to the brand's website, \"Nanahlti\" speaks to women in the Nahuatl world, represents the resolve to recuperate and dignify the ancestral knowledge of \"our people,\" and plants conSCIENCE - iousness.15 Staffing the table was Sofia,16 a young woman with chestnut -colored hair wearing a tank top and a long skirt (a friend of the anthropologists who organized the event). Traditional midwives were not involved in the production of any items being sold; however, one traditional midwife, Liliana, was given the task of manning the table for a few hours when Sofia was away \u2014 the expression of boredom and lack of interest on her face provoked me to wonder about the feeling of dispossession. At the registration table was a sign up sheet for those who wished to participate in a nocturnal \" temascal ritual\" (an indigenous healing practice, similar to a sweat lodge), for an extra fee. Liliana 15 My translation. https://nanahtli.wordpress.com/ 16 For the sake of anonymity, I have changed all of the names of specific individuals. 14 That night, I searched the hotel where the traditional midwives and professional midwifery students were staying, loo king for a few professional midwifery students, friends of mine from earlier research whom I had not seen since they set out to perform their year of social service in different government hospitals across Mexico. The hotel was bursting with guests, and numerous cots were shoved into the rooms. After knocking on what seemed like an endless number of doors, I finally found the right room. The professional midwifery students I was searching for had gone to the temascal ; their suitemates, traditional midwives, stayed behind. Curious about the disjuncture between how the encuentro had been promoted and its manifest reality, I traveled to the TMID office in Mexico City where I interviewed two planners of government health programs. I asked them to explain th e relationship between their published work on \"interculturality\" and what had unfolded at the encuentro they sponsored in Estaci\u00f3n Catorce. They did not want to be associated with the event, explaining that while they sponsored the encuentro , they were no t involved in its planning or execution. Both doctors that I interviewed assured me what I had witnessed is not representative of their work. They have planned and executed more than 50 highly successful Encounters for Mutual Enrichment Between Health Pers onnel and Traditional Midwives at which traditional midwifery knowledge was \"rescued\" from the ongoing threat of extinction. I asked when their next encuentro will take place, stating I would travel any distance to attend the type of event they described, as it would be very informative for my research. . . . I was told that Encounters for Mutual Enrichment are no longer being planned. * * * In this ethnographic sequence, we can observe how subtle processes of gendered racialization surrounding indigenous traditional midwives render them needy recipients of expert knowledge produced by foreigners and mestizo professionals working in urban settings. In Fit to be Citizens? Public Health and Race in Los Angeles 1879 -1939 , Natalia Molina (2006) analyzes the sp ecific mechanisms operating during the first half of the twentieth century in the United States to racialize Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. For example, she cites purported lack of knowledge of the English language as a marker, rendering Mexican s uncivilized and inferior to whites in a racial hierarchy socially constructed from positions of power. This kind of logic only worked in one direction; health officials never questioned how their lack of Spanish language skills might have hampered their ability to provide culturally appropriate care. I argue this type of logic, paired with \"humanitarian reason,\" justify the power differential inherent in all the workshops and encuentros I have observed. Didier Fassin's 2012 book, Humanitarian Reason: A Moral History of the Present, describes humanitarianism as a relatively recent invention resulting from particular ethical constructs, which, in turn, make intervention not only possible but necessary. He is less concerned with bad faith of some and good conscience of others, and more concerned with what is gained and what is lost when a rhetoric of compassion and suffering occurs in lieu of interests and justice, thus legitimizing actions by declaring them humanitarian. He points to domination in the upsu rge of compassion \u2014it requires a political asymmetry; it presupposes a relation of inequality.iv My ethnographic work not only points to the relationship of inequality operating in encounters between government health personnel and traditional midwives, but also how \"indigeneity,\" \"traditionality,\" and \"nature\" are conflated and subsequently commodified/fetichized by nonindigenous \"allies\" for economic profit. In these settings, the image of \"indigeneity\" is juxtaposed or overlaid on items or \"traditional ex periences\" for sale, 15 but indigenous people do not profit from these transactions and often cannot even access the goods that make use of their image. Essentially, I am describing how humanized birth in Mexico is based on rhetoric of shared humanity while n ot including indigenous peoples; it usurps and reinvents indigenous birthing practices and images. The many contradictions of global humanitarianism, as described by Didier Fassin, are visibly present at the encuentro in Estaci\u00f3n Catorce: [Humanitarianis m] is both a moral discourse (based on responsibility toward victims) and a political resource (serving specific interests) to justify action taken in the name of shared humanity. Its ambition is thus indivisible (it includes all human beings without distinction of race, class, religion, ideology) but its implementation is always situated (where others are thought to be in need of assistance). (Fassin 2010: 239) Thus, my work uncovers oppositional forces at work during training workshops like the one desc ribed above, and more generally in the humanized birth movement in Mexico: a discursive debate about \"humanity\" and \"humanization of birth\" which criticizes the biomedicalization of childbirth and celebrates \"traditional\" birth practices, and the concurren t commodification of \"indigenous medicine\" by which non -indigenous individuals consume \"indigeneity\" while indigenous people are not engaged as equals. In Mexico, a great deal of political propaganda is being produced around programs meant to provide indig enous populations with culturally -appropriate services, but these programs are often underfunded, if not entirely defunded. For example, while the TMID office is responsible for planning programs related to \"intercultural\"17 development and traditional medi cine, it does not possess the funding to implement these programs18. In Mexico's decentralized health care system, individual state governments are responsible for implementing and funding programs. Even when programs are implemented, they usually lack perm anence \u2014lasting only until the next elections. Thus, images of indigenous people, \"tradition,\" and \"nature\" lend value to 17 \"Intercult urality\" is a concept that informs policy in Mexico. It has been deployed by Mexican Secretary of Health in ways that juxtapose allopathic medical services with \"traditional indigenous\" services, instead of actually integrating them. I have observed on mul tiple occasions the consistent privileging of allopathic medicine over \"traditional indigenous\" services offered in disjointed, decontextualized forms. For example, patrons of \"traditional indigenous\" services are often charged a fee, while allopathic serv ices in government hospitals are always free of charge (resulting in further commodification of \"indigeneity\" and an upsurge of \"traditional medicine\" tourism among nonindigenous people while indigenous individuals seek remedies elsewhere). In my opinion, \"interculturality\" has done little to challenge hegemonic biomedicine, leaving relationships of domination/subordination intact. Further examples will emerge later in the dissertation. 18 Many individuals, both laypersons and Mexican medical anthropologis ts alike, would argue that funding for health programs in Mexico not only exists but is plentiful \u2014however, within a context of pervasive corruption, funds are routinely diverted to individuals' pocketbooks instead of being used to develop programs. In a pr ivate exchange with an informant and government health worker, I asked about a specific politician, describing him as \"the man who is extorting Seguro Popular (Mexico universal health insurance) funds and leaving hospitals in his jurisdiction without medic ations.\" My informant responded, \"I don't know who specifically you are talking about. We all do that! Even me.\" 16 consumer items and political propaganda produced by non -indigenous people in urban settings; however, these items for sale and \"intercu ltural\" programs often do not fulfill their intended purpose.19 My ethnographic observations hark back to Returns: Becoming Indigenous in the Twenty - First Century , wherein James Clifford (2013) points to indig\u00e8nitude , a process of rearticulation similar t o n\u00e9gritude20. As Clifford points out, \" Indig\u00e8nitude is sustained through media - disseminated images, including a shared symbolic repertoire ('the sacred,' 'Mother land')\" (Cliff ord 2013:16). Clifford places his work in conversation with Chow's Protestant Ethnic and the Spirit of Capitalism (2002) and Comaroff's Ethnicity, Inc. (2009). Chow and Comaroff link the performance and commodification of ethnic identities to a new regime of cultural production and reception. They argue capitalist globalization encourages differences so long as these differences do not upset the dominant political -economic order. Cultural traditions are preserved as simulacrum, performed in a theater of ide ntities, while ethnicity is produced and commodified in a \"global shopping mall of identities\" (Clifford 2013:30). This is a realm where ethnicity -for- tourism, folklore as fakelore, and nostalgic \"culture\" belie neoliberal marketing. Clifford, however, ar gues such critiques are all -too-neat, seeing everything as an effect of systemic power. Clifford links the performance and commodification of ethnic identities to a new regime of cultural production and receptionv, however he resists descriptions that port ray power as totalizing, and argues instead for dialectical analysis of hegemonic forms and countercurrents. At stake is the issue of agency \u2014people with their own dynamism. This dissertation explores how humanitarian discourse and processes of gendered rac ialization lead to the commodification of \"indigeneity\" and the consumption of culture; at the same time, I underline the agentive dynamism of indigenous informants. I add to Clifford's work by providing complex ethnographic examples that suggest that whil e unequal power structures are operating in the transnational humanized birth movement, indigenous individuals are also agentive actors who appropriate cards in decks stacked against them. Through ethnographic examples, I examine the evaluative work on th e part of indigenous women to achieve what they consider to be better birth outcomes. My work documents the strategies these women employ when proactively seeking out citizenship -based health services or subversively evading racial discrimination in biomed ical settings (see Scott 1985). Building upon Bourgois 2002, I argue that these actions, based on logical responses to an unjust reality, provide 19 During a seminar I gave on September 10, 2014 at the Center for Superior Research and Studies in Social Anthropology (CIESAS), Mexico City, Alfredo Paulo Maya (co -coordinator of the medical anthropology program at the National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM]) argued that \"intercultural\" programs are exculpation strategies whose true purpose (placating human rights groups by developing p rograms for which \"indios\" are purported beneficiaries) is routinely and satisfactorily met \u2014thus the continuity of \"interculturality\" as a political goal over time. 20 Clifford asserts global indig\u00e8nitude is inescapable, and its very existence challenges Western projects of civilization, modernity, and progress. Indig\u00e8nitude deconstructs the opposition of linear and cyclical times in Western etiology: \"When these 'ancient' traditions are understood to be effectively 'modern,' the whole direction of Wester n historical development wavers.\" (Clifford 2013:28) Tradition, Clifford argues (similarly to Garc\u00eda Canclini 2009), is an adaptive process and a source of transformation \u2014not practices associated with the past. 17 dominant sectors of society with further evidence for labeling indigenous women as \"backward,\" child -endangeri ng irresponsible mothers, and in dire need of humanitarian interventions. Thus, I remain attentive to these women's limited access to citizenship -based resources and resist the notion of \"insurgent citizenship\" as, in my opinion, it romanticizes material poverty and exclusionary processes by emphasizing the innovation of people with \"differentiated\" access to formal citizenship (see Holston 2009). (Ethno)medical Tourism in Binational Health Policy In October 2012, I traveled to Oaxaca City, Oaxaca to p articipate in Binational Health Week, a weeklong policy forum that brought together public health experts and officials from North and Latin America, but primarily from California and the State of Oaxaca. The event drew representatives from academic instit utions, such as UC Berkeley School of Public Health and Mexico's National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), public health providers, such as Seguro Popular (Mexico's universal health care coverage) and the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS ), and international health organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization. While attending the event, I received an invitation from the coordinator of migrant health care for the Oaxaca Secretary of Health to join a group of 11 special guests, mostly Americans, on a day trip to Capul\u00e1lpam de M\u00e9ndez, a small indigenous village in the Northern Sierra. I eagerly accepted his invitation. Mealtime entertainment for binational policy forum attendees. Capul\u00e1lpam was named a \"Pueblo M\u00e1gico\" in 2008 \u2014a designation granted by the Mexico Tourism Board that aims to promote a series of towns across the country by acknowledging their natural beauty, cultural riches, or historical relevance. Upon researching this village online, I read: The new designation and the healing center were expected to boost tourism. The center, now open, employs traditional healers who provide medicinal plant therapy, massages, temascal , and herbal baths. The center has an herbal pharmacy and of fers basic training courses about a great variety of medicinal plants. The temascal is a type of sweat lodge that gives physical and spiritual purification using the four elements of fire, air, water, 18 and earth to give relief from the stresses of daily lif e. Participants may reach a level of consciousness similar to that of meditation.21 When we arrived to the intercultural clinic, we were greeted by a Oaxaca State Secretary of Health physician, Arturo. His opening remarks about the clinic prepared us for the ethnomedical tour on which we were about to embark. He explained that traditional medicine is opposed to allopathic biomedicine, which for him is synonymous with European medicine. He argued that Mexicans should strive to preserve traditional medicine, because doing so means defending a shared national heritage. Immediately striking to me was how the clinic was constructed: although the clinic is described as \" inter cultural,\" in actuality, the clinic is divided into two distinct structures, separated by a grassy area. One structure houses the public biomedical clinic, which offers free or near -free medical care (for example, a consultation with a biomedical physician costs ten pesos, or less than one U.S. dollar). Inside the other structure is the trad itional medicine clinic, which offers traditional healing treatments for a charge (a five -minute limpia22 costs 50 pesos or approximately four dollars, entrance into the temascal is 170 pesos or roughly fourteen dollars, and a belly massage to cure empacho23 is 50 pesos). When I inquired about the degree to which biomedical physicians and traditional medicine healers work as a team to treat patients, I was told that the two types of care providers do not \"interfere\" with each other's patients or treatments, w ith one important exception: biomedical physicians act as gate keepers since they perform a physical examination and provide medical permission before patients may partake in the temascal ritual. I listened to Arturo explain the importance of initiatives like this clinic for recuperating traditional and indigenous medical knowledge. He argued that most of this valuable knowledge has been lost due to traditional healers not passing down their wisdom to future generations.24 The visitors and I were escorted into the laboratory and pharmacy in the traditional medicine clinic. In the laboratory, there were 17 clearly labeled boxes, each indicating to visitors the types of herbs on display. Having already performed substantial research among indigenous healers and midwives25, I noticed that the quantities of herbs in the laboratory were insufficient for 21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capul\u00e1lpam_de_M%C3%A9ndez Alyshia G\u00e1lvez includes a photo of the center's temascal in her book 2011 Patient Citizens, Immigrant Mothers (see page 62). Capul\u00e1lpam is a part of the Ixtl\u00e1n de Ju\u00e1rez re gion, where G\u00e1lvez carried out a portion of her ethnographic research (see page 14). 22 A spiritual cleansing, described in greater detail on the next page. 23 A ethnomedical term that describes instances where food gets lodged somewhere along the digestive tract with detrimental effects for overall well -being. 24 While I argue that \"tradition\" undergoes constant transformation and negotiation, my ethnographic encounters suggest that a great deal of \"traditional knowledge\" is passed down from one generation t o the next; however, this transmission is not recognized by state officials since it occurs outside of the realm of Foucault's (1973) \"medical gaze.\" 25 Later in this chapter I will describe some of my interactions with traditional midwives and healers wh o were key informants throughout my research. During extended stays in their homes, I learned about their traditional medicine practices through participant -observation. I joined these informants on shopping trips to buy supplies for creating traditional r emedies, watched as they prepared teas and gave massages, listened to their methods for making tinctures and balms, read 19 producing remedies, prompting me to ask myself if their primary purpose in the \"traditional laboratory\" was to be seen, but not used. I also noticed that a number of herbs commonly used by indigenous healers were not represented among the specimens laid out on display then ushered into the room where limpias are performed, and two types of herbs were laid out on the ground, but pirul , the herb most commonly used for limpias, was conspicuously absent. Limpias are rituals that rid individuals of harmful energies \u2014 burning incense, rubbing an uncooked egg on the individual's skin to draw out negativity , spitting mezcal in order to cover the afflicted with an antiseptic mist, and sweeping their body with cleansing herbs are regular components of this ritual. As I wondered to myself how traditional healing was carried out without basic herbal ingredients, I had a feeling that I was in a showroom. Were we being interpellated as consumers in a simulacrum of \"traditional medicine\"? We were then guided into the \"pharmacy\" where the members of the group began exuberantly purchasing herbal balms and shampoos. Medicinal plants on display in the laboratory. their hand -written recipes, went on countryside walks to gather fresh herbs, and was at times the recipient of their expert care. 20 Herbal balms and shampoos for sale in the pharmacy. During our visit, there were no patients at the clinic. While the rest of the group admired the installations, I stealthily escaped from the tour. I w ondered what members of the community thought about the clinic. I walked to a wooden cabin nearby \u2014the home of an indigenous family that also served as a snack bar (selling gum, sweets, potato chips, and soda) for local villagers. The snack bar attendant, M ar\u00eda del Rosario, and a patron were at the cabin when I arrived. I asked them why there were no patients at the clinic. They explained that while there is a doctor and a nurse assigned to the clinic, the doctor is often away in the town of Ixtl\u00e1n, and the nurse has been gone for several days attending a workshop. I asked Mar\u00eda del Rosario if many people visit the clinic. She responded, \" S\u00ed vienen, (\"Yes they come, a lot of people come. A lot of people come for tourism.\") She went on to say that the traditional medicine clinic built by the Secretary of Health is not necessary because, for many common ailments, villagers possess enough traditional knowledge to heal themselves with herbs in their own home s. \"Cada madre tiene su propia forma de curar sus nenes.\" mother has her own way of curing her babies.\") While her comments are perfectly aligned with Eduardo L. Men\u00e9ndez's observations about autoatenci\u00f3n (all the health care seeking, decision -makin g, and healing that take place in multitudinous settings beyond the clinic that often go unnoticed by health officials since they unfold prior to encounters with physicians and medical institutions, and often render would -be encounters unnecessary [Men\u00e9nde z 1983]), they contradict the Secretary of Health representative's 21 assertions that traditional medical knowledge has been lost and must be recuperated and preserved through government interventions which defend Mexico's national heritage. Mar\u00eda del Rosario further explained that when her children have an ailment that she is unable to cure herself, she takes them to the curandera (the local traditional medicine midwife) who provides three treatments for 100 pesos26. After leaving Mar\u00eda del Rosario's shack, I walked a little farther down the path and ran into a young man, Francisco, whom I asked about his experiences at the clinic. Francisco told me he had inquired about the midwifery services in the traditional medicine clinic before his wife's recent birth, but was told the midwife was only present a few hours on specific mornings. When his wife went into labor, Francisco rushed to the clinic, only to find that neither the physician nor the midwife was present. He made arrangements to transport his wife to th e hospital in Ixtl\u00e1n as swiftly as possible, where she had a biomedicalized birth. After these brief conversations, I returned to the group at the intercultural clinic. As far as I could tell, my brief absence had gone unnoticed. Consuming Indigeneity: A High Priced Commodity In this chapter, I am applying theories of cultural consumption to the object of my ethnographic inquiry: the reinvention and commodification of present -day Mexican midwifery. I am documenting how indigenous midwives are excluded an d denied professional status while their \"traditional\" cultural practices are pirated, lionized, romanticized, and sold for profit by affluent urban Mexicans and by international practitioners in humanized birthvi circles. What humanized birth proponents de scribe as an international feminist liberation for educated women is based in the exploitation of cultural -intellectual property rights (traditional midwifery) and the reproduction of inequality in Mexico, as the indigenous practitioners of these birthing arts and practices are prevented from practicing them in Mexican hospitals. While I have observed indigenous midwives defy government restrictions, challenge biomedical authority in hospital settings, and attempt to market their traditional knowledge by fo rming their own association and opening a shared clinical practice, these examples of resistance emerge within a context of power and political economy that, more often than not, capitalizes on images of indigeneity while obscuring the lives, experiences, and opinions of indigenous people. Furthermore, the diverse methods indigenous midwives use to attend births are not equitably included by members of the humanized birth community under the rubric of humanized birth, since they are relegated to the realm o f traditional medicine from which humanized birth draws, then improves and develops. Essentially, I am describing how humanized birth in Mexico is unfolding with a rhetoric of shared humanity while using and commodifying, indeed, dismembering, and reassemb ling indigenous birthing practices and images for economic profit. Thus, my work uncovers oppositional forces at work during training workshops like the one described in the introduction, and more generally in the humanized birth movement in Mexico: a disc ursive debate about the humanization of birth which criticizes the biomedicalization of childbirth and celebrates \"traditional\" birth practices, and the simultaneous commodification of \"indigenous medicine\" by which nonindigenous individuals consume \"indig eneity\" while indigenous people are excluded. 26 For more on the experiences of modern -day curanderos in Mexico, see Campos Navarro 1997. 22 Portraying Indigeneity: Politics of Representation When writing about the relationship between genetic molecular sequences and key historical events, Tallbear writes, \"Native American DNA could not have emer ged as an object of scientific research and genealogical desire until individuals and groups emerged as 'Native American' in the course of colonial history\" (Tallbear 2013:5). That is to say, the pan -racial group defined as \"Native American\" does not exist except through opposition with \"settlers.\" Furthermore, the very grouping of humans into \"races\" is predicated on the notion of purity and the idea of original populations \u2014it therefore \"tells a story from the standpoint of those who did the encountering\" (Tallbear 2013:5). Importantly, these \"scientific\" narratives represent a type of knowledge that is made to matter more than others, rescripting what is historically salient, and potentially defining what is politically salient. Thus, Tallbear emphasizes real material consequences: \"Native American DNA is material -semiotic\" (Tallbear 2013:7). In essence, Tallbear is science and technology studies methodology to argue that natural and social orders are coproduced \u2014in this case, the social and genetic categor ies of \"indigeneity.\" She refers to Clifford's 2001 notion of \"articulation\" to hold dynamism and transformative elements of cultural practices and identity formation under the same lens as potentially harmful effects of power. Despite persistent eviden ce of marginalization of indigenous peoples and examples of profit -seeking around constructed images of indigeneity, I am attentive to Clifford's point about dynamism (see Clifford 2001 and 2013) \u2014I am careful not to deny indigenous informants and friends o f their agency by portraying them only as victims. Thus, I am concerned not only with how indigeneity is portrayed by non -indigenous ehtnomedicine enthusiasts, but how indigenous individuals portray their own ethnic identities. I suggest that while indigen ous people have suffered from centuries -long structural violence, they have also devised strategies for leveraging their indigeneity and, at times, view their indigenous heritage as a source of pride. My perspective does not sanitize the effects of violenc e and long -standing exclusion, nor does it diminish the agency and dynamism of indigenous individuals; rather, I aim to cast indigenous informants as agentive, proactive people who experience their indigeneity both as a source of marginalization and also a s a valuable resource. In this chapter, I am pointing to \"indigeneity\" as something that is produced, circulated, and sold. I am not arguing that there is one, singular \"indigenous culture\" that encapsulates all indigenous people. I recognize there are m any ways of being indigenous; simultaneously, I point to how \"indigeneity\" and \"indigenous culture\" are constructed as objects of consumption, thus erasing diversity among indigenous peoples. Through ethnographic research, I documented how \"indigeneity\" be comes a consumer item, especially through \"indigenous\" medicine. In this dissertation, my use of the terms \"indigenous women\" and \"indigenous people\" refers to individuals who self -identify as indigenous, speak indigenous languages, or live in rural, indig enous zones. The indigenous people with whom I worked are from the following ethnic groups: A primary goal of this chapter is to provide several examples to illustrate the complex politics of representation of indigeneity. In addition to constructed representations of traditional and indigenous medicine that unfolded when I visited the intercultural clinic in Oaxaca, I have, on different occasions throughout my ethnographi c research, observed how indigenous individuals perform their \"indigeneity\" for foreigners and transnationals. At times, it seemed that indigenous informants enjoyed ritualized representations of their indigeneity \u2014that their indigeneity was a source of pri de and a resource to be strategically employed to achieve desired 23 outcomes. Other times, indigeneity seemed to be a liability, and indigenous informants made concerted efforts to potrary themselves as \"modern\" individuals who practice Western techniques. F inally, in some instances, indigenous informants felt used for their indigenous appearance, fetishized as an image of indigeneity, and coerced into acting and speaking according to the interests of non -indigenous others. * * * During summer 2011, I volu nteered and performed participant observation at Center for the Adolescents of San Miguel de Allende (CASA). In July I was invited by Sagrario Villareal, general director at the time, to participate in field practice in Veracruz \u2014a two -week trip wherein professional midwifery students gave workshops to traditional midwives in government hospitals and subsequently joined them in their homes to continue the \"exchange\"27 of knowledge. I accompanied a professional midwifery student, Francisca, to the Nahua vil lage of Zacatochin where we observed Do\u00f1a Eugenia, a well -respected traditional midwife. This tiny village in the mountains is the farthest I have been from the conveniences of urban life. Zacatochin is perched high above the clouds, leading to a feeling o f isolation from the nearest town, located a 45 -minutes windy drive down the mountain. Water is pumped once a week to a public spout in the center of the village and, on this day, women dressed in traditional blouses and batas (heavy, black wool wrapped fr om women's bellies to their ankles and tied with colorful silk cloth at the waist) gather to wash laundry. Nahua women and their families travel long distances, as far as from the other side of the Orizaba volcano, to give birth with Do\u00f1a Eugenia \u2014her use o f traditional herbs commingled with biomedical techniques like application of an IV drip appeal to women who want the security of giving birth with someone possessing biomedical knowledge, the comfort of laboring with the support of a woman who has learned generations of traditional healing techniques, and the safety of knowing they will not be discriminated or mistreated while delivering their baby. Do\u00f1a Eugenia is an example of hybridity \u2014someone who enters and exits modernity with ease (Garc\u00eda Canclini 20 09)28. Her work throws into question portrayals of \"traditionality\" and \"traditional midwives\" as frozen in some prior time, exempt from transformative processes that occur in \"the outside world.\" One night, I observed Do\u00f1a Eugenia attend two simultaneo us births. A 20 -year-old, Mar\u00eda Elena, was giving birth to her first child in the living room of Do\u00f1a Eugenia's home - clinic, while a second woman, Juana, was birthing in Do\u00f1a Eugenia's bedroom. I evolution of Mar\u00eda Elena's birth: Mar\u00eda Elena's arrival with a horde of family members in tow, Do\u00f1a Eugenia direction of the extended family to the patio while only Mar\u00eda Elena's husband accompanied her during the birth, the moment Do\u00f1a Eugenia examined the shape of Mar\u00eda Elena's belly and pred icted a female child, the second when the baby girl emerged from 27 While the purpose of the field practice is to engage in bilateral exchange of knowledge, I observed a mostly unilateral flow of knowledge from \"knowing\" professional mi dwifery students (most of whom were only beginning to attend births or were totally lacking in experience) and \"unknowing\" traditional midwives. 28 In Chapter 5, I deconstruct the \"traditionality\" -\"modernity\" binary, thus problematizing the idea of hybrid s ubjects who move between the two temporal frameworks. Also, I am attentive to the ways in which \"hybridity\" has been used only to describe \"subalterns\" and to the concerns some scholars have about this concept being inherently racist. However, for the time being, I am referring to Garc\u00eda Canclini 2009 to begin to trouble the idea that \"traditional\" midwives are antiquated subjects whose practices are necessarily rooted in the past. 24 her mother's vagina, wailing and filling her strong lungs with oxygen for the first time, the minutes when Do\u00f1a Eugenia massaged the mother's belly to encourage the placenta to detach from th e uterine wall, and the wordless entrusting of the plastic -bagged placenta to Mar\u00eda Elena so she can bury it close to her home. I did not witness Juana's birth as she was uncomfortable with my presence, and I respected her wishes. Since only a curtain c overs the passageway to Do\u00f1a Eugenia's bedroom, I heard the birthing while waiting outside. Later, I asked Do\u00f1a Eugenia to describe the birth, and she did so with an air of formality, as if presenting a case at medical grand rounds before an attending phys ician. I wondered to myself as she spoke, did I represent an authority figure in her eyes? During the night she hardly had any pain, only the mucus plug. It was very slow and I thought they would have to go to the hospital. After, she started to have more pain, and at five in the morning I checked her dilation and she was at two centimeters. I told her it would be better for us to go to the hospital, but she said no \u2014she wanted to wait a little longer. I conceded since they have a truck and I knew we could s till go to the hospital later. At eight in the morning she started to have regular contractions, her water broke, and she bled a little \u2014all normal signs her cervix was opening. At 8:50 I performed a vaginal exam, and it was definitive we were going to stay ; she was completely dilated. At 9:06 a baby girl was born. I moved the [umbilical cord] a tiny bit, encouraging the placenta to come out, and the placenta came out on its own. The bleeding was normal; she bled a little. I suctioned [the baby's] phlegm imm ediately. The baby has good coloring, good movements, very active movements. The baby cried. After, I was orienting [the mother], encouraging her and stimulating her to breastfeed. Then, the mother and child stayed together. I dried her vaginal area, chang ed her sheets, and placed the baby girl with her mother. The mother is content, happy, conversing, and laughing. She is content because she didn't go to the hospital, and since the beginning she said she didn't want to go to the hospital. . . . She is aro und 34 years old and says this will be her last child. (Spoken report of Do\u00f1a Eugenia on July 9, 2011) The spoken report Do\u00f1a Eugenia gave is striking because of the performative element that was evident to me even as it was occurring. Juana has quit e a few white hairs, and I suspect she is in her forties, but Do\u00f1a Eugenia told me she is \"around 34\" since medical guidelines stipulate that births in women 35 and older are high risk and must be referred to the hospital. Furthermore, Do\u00f1a Eugenia systema tically demonstrated she had done everything as instructed in workshops: she monitored Juana's dilation and bleeding, ensured there was viable transport to the hospital, successfully prevented hemorrhage, cleared the baby's airway, checked the baby's well -being, helped the mother with breastfeeding, was careful not to separate mother and child \u2014and all this in a hygienic environment! Her use of the medical case presentation method is evidence of her experience working in biomedical contexts, thus disruptin g definitions of what it means to be \"traditional\" versus biomedical and humanized. Furthermore, the \"objectivity\" of the case presentation format serves multiple purposes: by presenting the births in this way, Do\u00f1a Eugenia frames herself as a medically ap propriate birth attendant, while also implying that her intention was to refer the birth to the hospital. In doing so, Do\u00f1a Eugenia portrayed herself as both capable of independently attending birth and obedient to government mandates. However, what is mis sing from her report 25 is just as important as the operative functions of what she chooses to include. At the very end of the report, Do\u00f1a Eugenia acknowledges that Juana never wanted to go to the hospital, before pausing and briefly reflecting on what to sa y next. She quickly concludes by saying that Juana is about thirty -four years old. Do\u00f1a Eugenia (accidently?) admitted that Juana did not plan to go to the hospital and that Do\u00f1a Eugenia permitted Juana's will to be fulfilled \u2014against the stipulations plac ed on mothers by Oportunidades . This birth is recorded in the official registers as having occurred in Juana's home, without the help of a birth attendant. Indigenous women in the region must give birth in the government hospital, or else lose their condit ional cash transfers. Midwives are ordered not to attend the births of women thirty -five and over since these women are at additional risk for maternal mortality. Do\u00f1a Eugenia's assertion that Juana is \"around 34\" is significant since she is again ameliora ting the disobedience to government mandates that could be associated with her involvement in Juana's birth. I can only speculate about Juana's exact age given her wisened face and grey hairs, but what interests me more is the context within which women we igh reproductive decisions, sometimes leading them to make choices that are deemed \"risky\" and \"dangerous\" by the biomedical system and the Mexican government. I returned the next summer, and the next. Along with my visits, I began forming a friendship with Do\u00f1a Eugenia through letters and phone calls. She began to see me as her apprentice, and over time I earned her trust. After many intimate conversations, I asked Do\u00f1a Eugenia to sit for a formal, video -recorded interview. I explained to her that this footage could potentially be edited into an ethnographic film and used to demonstrate the work of traditional midwives to American anthropology students and conference attendees. She acquiesced, on one condition: that I not start the video camera until she had finished dressing herself in her traditional indigenous attire, put on her best jewelry, and combed her hair. I agreed. Do\u00f1a Eugenia is among the few women in the village who does not wear indigenous attire on a daily basis. I gazed curiously at her s low and deliberate movements while she searched among several plastic bags, until she finally selected the traditional blouse she wanted to wear while being filmed. She folded the pleats in her bata (a large piece of black wool cloth that is worn as a skir t) and straightened out the lace and ribbons on her blouse ever so carefully, in a methodical, almost ritualistic fashion29. Her purposefulness caused me to reflect on Clifford's assertion that, \"media images can lapse into self -stereotyping. And they expr ess a transformative renewal of attachments to culture and place. It is difficult to know, sometimes even for participants, how much of the performance of identity reflects deep belief, how much a tactical presentation of self.\" (Clifford 2013:16) Why was it so important for Do\u00f1a Eugenia to be seen by imagined foreigners in indigenous clothing when she wears Western clothing \u2014long sleeve sweaters, button -down shirts, long jean skirts \u2014 in her everyday life? Was this ritual production for foreign consumption? O n the other hand, considering that many indigenous women in her village do wear traditional clothing on a daily basis, what does it mean for Do\u00f1a Eugenia to wear Western clothing in most situations, and especially when going on shopping trips into town and during interactions with midwifery patients and staff at the village clinic? Moments like these have led me to believe that 29 It struck me that while different informants make concerted efforts to po rtray themselves in ways that meet disparate goals, the politics of representation at play in this scene are not too far afield from a doctor putting on the emblematic white coat. 26 \"presentations of self in everyday life\" (see Goffman 1959; Hendrickson 1995) are based on a syncretic and situational sense of ide ntity/identities. Do\u00f1a Eugenia 27 Leveraging Syncretic Identities Don partero ). He is one of the few men that attend birth in the High Mountains of Veracruz, but his gender has not limited his clientele. He is well -regarded for his extensive knowledge of herbal remedies and leads an indigenous organization of traditional doctors. He and other members of the organization have formed a rotation for running the organiza tion's secluded clinic in the mountains \u2014each participating traditional doctor works at the clinic one day a week. Center for the Development of Traditional Indigenous Medicine I first heard about the traditional medicine clinic that Don Israel leads when I was staying with a Do \u00f1a Agustina during my first visit to Zacatochin. Do\u00f1a Agustina is an empirically trained traditional midwife who, when compared to Do\u00f1a Eugenia and Don Israel, has not received many biomedically -oriented trainings and certificat ions led by government workers in clinical settings. Do\u00f1a Agustina holds Don Israel in high regard and considers him to be the most knowledgeable traditional doctor in the region. On one misty afternoon, she took me on an excursion to visit his clinic. I sat with her sons in the bed of their old truck while her husband drove, and whenever we encountered a hill, her sons would jump out to push the truck up the incline. At the clinic, I observed that the \"laboratory\" for preparing herbal remedies was bare, t he traditionally -designed temascal had fallen into disuse, and while two traditional massage therapists ( sobadoras ) were present, the clinic had no clients. Since Don Israel was absent at the 28 clinic during our visit, we traveled to his house a few days lat er, traveling by collective taxi and bus before hitchhiking and walking on foot. Temascal When we arrived, Don Israel graciously invited us into his home. The outside structure is comprised of wood boards, but once inside, his family living space surr ounds an inner courtyard. At the center of his courtyard is a port -a-potty \u2014a more convenient alternative to the outhouses on stilts that are common in the region30. When I explained to him that I was eager to learn about his practice of traditional medicine , his eyes lit up. He told me about the many trainings and certifications he has received, and his collaborations with the government health sector, researchers at the state university, and chemical supply companies. As he spoke, he showed me certificates, photos of moments when he had been recognized, and book publications for which he had shared his knowledge. During the entire visit, Do\u00f1a Agustina's admiration of Don Israel's talents was apparent. I wanted to know more about Don Israel's interactions wit h the different \"knowledge -producing\" bodies he described, so I made a commitment to return and continue our conversation on a different visit. 30 An example of how traditional medicine practitioners make use of \"modern\" apparatuses in their everyday lives, thus disrupting notions that representatives of \"tradition\" make their lives out in a distinct time register from those living in metropolises. 29 Don Israel The relationship between Do\u00f1a Agustina and Do\u00f1a Eugenia is also characterized by respect, but with an undertone of rivalry, since these two are close neighbors and attend overlapping clientele. On one occasion, Do\u00f1a Agustina was openly critical to me about Do\u00f1a Eugenia, saying that the ability to attend a birth is a gift from God that should not be ex ploited for financial gain. Do\u00f1a Eugenia charges many times Do\u00f1a Agustina's fee for attending a birth \u2014 in part because she considers it her responsibility as a midwife to teach couples to value each child they bring into the world, because she feels she sho uld be compensated for her time and work, and because of the high demand for her services. Over time, Do\u00f1a Eugenia has built a home -clinic out of \"expensive\" materials (cement and glass -paned windows) with areas for several women to give birth at a time, plus a patio area that functions as a waiting room. Her home -clinic stands alongside the wooden shack where she used to live, where Do\u00f1a Eugenia still has her kitchen, out house, and bathing area; which in turn is attached to the store where she sells snacks and soda pop. Do\u00f1a Agustina considers Do\u00f1a Eugenia to be \"enterprising\" \u2014her family manages with a more meager budget, derived mostly from her sons' and husband's carpentry. 30 Do\u00f1a Agustina giving a \"sobada\" (traditional massage) I returned to the re gion where Don Israel and Do\u00f1a Eugenia live several times over the course of my field work. My relationship with both of them deepened with time despite them both being unable to receive phone calls in their homes. I wrote them both letters which, due to irregular postal service in the Mexican countryside, often took weeks or months to arrive. When they went shopping in the nearest town they would take advantage of the rare opportunity to call me. As soon as I received their phone calls I would return the call to the number from which they were dialing. Both asked me to purchase things for them that they are unable to buy in their area\u2014 Do\u00f1a Eugenia asked me to bring her a pair of gold earrings and Don Israel requested a digital camera. On one occasion, Don Israel and I traveled together to Mexico City to buy materials for making herbal remedies. Over the years, we gave each other many gifts: for 31 example, Do\u00f1a Eugenia gave me one of her batas and I gave her an embroidered satin blouse from San Miguel. On my trips to Veracruz, I would usually stay the majority of the time with Do\u00f1a Eugenia and her family in Zacatochin, and upon my departure, she would cry and I comforted her by telling her that I would return soon for another visit. Having a cup of hot cho colate in the kitchen before bedtime. After a baptism at which Do\u00f1a Eugenia was \"la madrina\" (godmother) 32 My experiences with Don Israel and Do\u00f1a Eugenia point to the mutual imbrication of agentive representations of self and commodification of culture. Don Israel was proud of the many certifications and trainings he had received. Furthermore, his having been recognized in governmental, biomedical, and university settings led to him enjoying a higher regard among clients and fellow traditional medicine p ractitioners and birth attendants. However, despite his track -record of ongoing recognition, Don Israel has stopped attending birth because he is wary of the consequences that would befall him in the case of a negative birth outcome. He follows the guidel ines he has been taught in the trainings, which dictate that he refer birthing mothers to the government hospital. Furthermore, he pondered aloud to me about an apparent increase in ethnomedical tourism. Commenting on poorly designed temascals reflecting a lack of understanding about traditional medicine and the therapeutical mechanism that facilitates healing, Don Israel asked why his authentically constructed temascal lacked visitors. How could he attract more visitors? He considered putting up a sign o n the road directing people to the temascal and offering courses on herbalism to the general public in hopes that this would attract more visitors to the clinic. Although he is no longer attending births and his clinic is under frequented, Don Israel leverages his identity as a regional leader of traditional medicine in a way that is generally satisfying to him. It could be argued that he is an example of someone who uses politics of representation mostly in his favor. However, the opposite argument could also be made: I witnessned moments when Don Israel was treated rudely by nonindigenous individuals. When we went shopping in Mexico City, he asked the clerk for a clarification about the difference in concentration between two types of oils and their appro priate uses. The shop clerk signed loudly and was curt with him and he reacted to her scolding tone by gazing down at the floor, placing his chin in his hand. I wondered about this interaction: had racial discrimination come into play? Throughout the day I noticed how unfamiliar Don Israel was with the metropolitan surroundings. Was the shop clerk's harsh response related to Don Israel being a rural, indigenous, elderly man? When we emerged to sidewalk, I made a remark about the shop clerk's rude behavior. He responded, \"People who act like that are just unhappy. We should pray for their happiness.\" As time passed and I began asking Don Israel for more details about his interactions with university researchers, chemical supply companies, and the Mexican go vernment, I began asking myself if he was unknowingly being taken advantage of. While his group of traditional doctors shared their knowledge with the Mexican Institute of Social Security from which an extensive herbal manual was published, his name does not appear in the publication nor does he receive royalties for the book. Furthermore, he has shared his knowledge of sangregado , Santa Mar\u00eda and a few other herbs common to traditional medicine with the researchers at the state university who in turn are partnering with a chemical supply company to commercialize the herb and develop balms, tinctures, shampoos, and soaps. When I interviewed him about this project, he explained that the researchers were engaging in legal patent procedures involving the nota ry public and the Public Ministry31. 31 I did not have the opportunity to interview the individuals who were pat enting herbal remedies based on Don Israel's traditional medicine knowledge. However, one example of a pharmaceutical company that relies on ethnobotany to produce and market new prescription drugs is Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \u2014a company that was started by Lisa Conte, who at the time was an analyst covering biotechnology companies for a venture capital firm in San Mateo, CA. 33 A year later, I returned to visit him. In the interim his wife's leg had to be amputated due to advanced diabetes and he had been hospitalized as the result of debilitating leg cramps. The couple was unable to pay moun ting debt from hospital bills and were sporadically going hungry. We went to town and after we sat down together to enjoy a meal, I ordered an extra roasted chicken for his family. Don Israel asserted that he only shared his traditional medicine knowledge with university researchers to protect himself from being exploited. As an academic, I know that not everything that is researched in academic settings is solely motivated by \"the pursuit of knowledge.\" While Don Israel derives a positive sense of self -worth when he is consulted and asked to share his knowledge on traditional medicine, I am concerned about biopiracy and wonder about the economic profit that may be resulting for the individuals with whom he shares his knowledge. By simultaneously pointing to the pride that Don Israel derives from sharing his traditional medicine practices, and also the potential exploitation and biopiracy of his ethnomedical knowledge, I am problematizing the binary nature upon which opposing notions of victims and agents are premised. I argue that binary representations are insufficient for the complex reality of how individuals' cultural pride is infused with potential exploitation, and how entrepreneurship unfolds on the edge of uncertainty. Do\u00f1a Eugenia's case is perhaps l ess extreme. She seeks recognition mostly from within her own community and from the staff members at the IMSS clinic in her village. She does not derive a sense of pride from accumulating certificates. In the past she was employed by the local government as a community health worker, but she was underpaid and soon realized that the work limited her from dedicating herself fully to the more rewarding task of midwifery. For similar reasons, Do \u00f1a Eugenia declined participating in Don Israel's indigenous orga nization of traditional doctors. She explained to him that with so many pregnant and birthing mothers under her watch, she simply did not have time to travel away from her home. These decisions demonstrate how much Do\u00f1a Eugenia values her skills as a midw ife and how protective she is of her indigenous knowledge. However, Do\u00f1a Eugenia's relative success depends on a delicate balance: her harmonious relationship with the village physician who turns a blind eye to her midwifery practice, her recognition amon g local mothers but \"invisibility\" to government officials, and continued luck with respect to birth outcomes. While Do\u00f1a Eugenia is a very skillful midwife, all it would take is one negative birth outcome for this delicate balance to come crashing down. S he is very aware of the risks she faces and she conscientiously manages how she is perceived (or not perceived) by others, but she is constantly teetering on the edge of uncertainty. How long will it last? When I asked Do\u00f1a Eugenia for a formal interview, she exuded a sense of pride as she performed her \"indigeneity\" for imagined nonindigenous spectators; however, other of my informants have been forced to enact their \"indigenous\" identity in a way that causes them to feel used and silenced. For example, Mayra, the only indigenous student at the Center for the Adolescents of San Miguel de Allende (CASA) Professional Midwifery School at the time, was asked to join two CASA directors on a trip to Canada for the Midwifery Association of North America annual me eting. Upon returning from Canada, Mayra came to my house for lunch and shared with me her impressions of the trip. As she began speaking, I was surprised by her lack of excitement, as I had assumed that she would be bursting with enthusiasm after her firs t international travel experience. While I prepared fish and red rice, she described to me how every time someone spoke to her at the conference, the two directors were immediately at her side, demanding to know the details of the interchange. \"What did th ey ask you? What did you say?\" She felt like she was being treated as an object of constant surveillance. Sitting on a stool 34 at my kitchen counter, Mayra pondered aloud about the school administration's choice to take her on the trip out of all the girls i n her graduating class. Then it dawned on her that she represented something of value, and that this value lies in her indigeneity. The school directors told her not to say anything to anyone \u2014 the person designated to speak was Evelyn, an attractive Americ an woman with blue eyes and auburn hair, a certified midwife, a Brown University graduate, and CASA's clinical director. Mayra explained how her strikingly indigenous physical appearance was what interested the other midwives at the conference \u2014not her pers pective or her experiences. She complained that in Canada, she felt like \"a poster\" \u2014an image at which others are meant to ogle \u2014and living, breathing, fleshy evidence that CASA's model targets indigenous women. Furthermore, as a living image, she was meant to be seen but not heard, and her every word incited fear and anxiety from her school directors, as if at any moment she would commit an error, thus tearing apart the image they were so carefully depicting. Conclusion My multi -sited ethnographic fieldwor k on the humanized birth movement sought to trace the emergence of a global \"cathedral of consumption,\" buttressed by the re -enchantment of a transnational community by the most natural of physiological acts: nonmedicalized birth (see Ritzer 2001). In my w ork, Sidney Mintz' (1985) question of how something that previously did not exist within a population's imaginary is transformed through the engineering of desire into something elemental to the everyday life of the masses comes full circle. How does a bod ily practice as foundational to humanity as eating and having sex become alienated from our physiological repertoire, only to then be commodified and reintroduced into society as a fetish that deepens unequal power relations between the \"haves\" from the \"h ave nots?\" Michael Billig, a social psychologist whose work is foundational to the social identity approach, elaborates on the psychology of consumer capitalism by linking commodity fetishism to repression (see Billig 1999). That is, his work harks back to Marx's assertion that in capitalist life the productive origins of commodities are routinely forgotten; thus, commodities contain an implicit psychology of collective amnesia. Turning to commodity fetishism, Billig argues that the pleasures of consumpt ion would be significantly diminished by an awareness of the productive origins of consumer goods. Billig suggests that the collective forgetfulness embedded in consumerism is, psychologically speaking, a form of social repression. What ethnographic resea rch on the humanized birth movement offers is a way of thinking about inequality embedded in the consumption of biological and medical goods, and divergent identities that emerge based upon the conspicuousness32 or absence of consumption. I am signaling the collective amnesia that permits inequity to operate within the realm of health care provision. Furthermore, I am drawing attention to the adverted gaze that makes the exploitation of others \u2014for example, the ethnomedical piracy described in this chapter \u2014not only possible but also real. What the humanized birth movement unfolding in Mexico affords is an example of how gender -racialized indigenous others can be excluded and dispossessed in the name of humanization, and the subtle processes that allow for this increased marginalization to occur. If individuals were to gaze directly at the fetishized commodity \u2014the origins of images of indigeneity and the effects of ethnomedical piracy on indigenous people \u2014the fa\u00e7ade upon which the very life of the fetishized com modity is premised would come crashing down. The questions linger: How much effort is involved in maintaining an adverted gaze? How much intention is 32 Here I am referring to Veblen's notion of \"conspicuous consumption.\" See Veblen 2006. 35 embedded in inattention? How much should individuals be held morally accountable for the direct and indire ct consequences of gazing elsewhere? Nancy Wacquant's edited volume, Commodifying Bodies , explores how bodies increasingly enter into global market exchanges. While Scheper -Hughes and Wacquant are directing attention to the body -turned-merchandise, the concept of bioconsumer citizenship and the example of midwifery in Mexico examine gender -racialized identities -turned -merchandise, with real effects for the bodies of women. In Scheper -Hughes and Wacquant's volume, commodification of t he body results in alienation of the self, while in this present chapter, the commodification of others' (imagined) \"selves\" can lead to their increased exclusion and dispossession. Instead of exploring the political economy of the body under contemporary global capitalism, I have used a transnational context to analyze the political economy of identities vis-\u00e0-vis the body. In the introduction to this dissertation, I used ethnographic observations to illuminate how the humanized birth movement in Mexico i s linked to a transnational community of consumption oriented toward \"traditional midwifery,\" and natural, home, and water birth. This chapter has shown that consequently a transnational market for \"natural\" and \"traditional\" birth - related products and ser vices emerge around the image of the indigenous woman, while indigenous people are increasingly excluded, marginalized, and dispossessed. \"Traditional birth\" not only represents the consumption of \"indigenous\" culture \u2014rather, it is a salient example of ethnomedical piracy and how \"indigeneity\" is sought through reproduction and health. In the rest of the dissertation, I will explore how inclusion in consumption -oriented communities is a primary way elites construct identities and how re -enchantment of a transnational community by nonmedicalized birth is deepening unequal power relations between the \"haves\" and the \"have nots.\" In chapter three, I will use the humanized birth movement to explore how a political moral economy emerges around the particular bod ily practices of people who possess cultural capital on a transnational scale. Chapters four and five adds complexity to the story by describing how gender, race, and class intersect and are mutually imbricated: that is, among gendered individuals, race do es the work of class and class does the work of race. In Chapter six, I turn to the concept of \"medical migration\" to argue that members of the humanized birth movement participate in New Age practices that conflate \"traditionality\" with \"nature\" and \"indi geneity.\" I point to how health (in this case, ethnomedicine) has become a commodity instead of an entitlement in our neoliberal age, thus producing both mobile supranationals and immobile individuals seeking citizenship through public services. I will describe both the physical and social (im)mobilities that emerge to the fore in the realm of (ethno)medical migrations. 36 HUMANIZED BIRTH: UNFORESEEN POLITICS \"Humanized birth\" ( parto humanizado ) is usually used in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America to describe birth that purposefully resists medicalization and technocratic practices (see Davi s-Floyd 1992). This movement is preceded by the home and water birth movements in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. Births are often attended by professional midwives (although some obstetricians have joined the movement) and accompanied by doulas. Generally, proponents of humanized birth criticize power inequality inherent in physician -patient relationships and denounc e medicalized practices such as unnecessary cesarean sections, episiotomies, isolation of birthing mothers in hospital labor and delivery are as, labor induction, the use of hormones such as pitocin, and repetitive insertion of medical personnel's fingers i nto women's vaginas to assess dilation. However, some informants expressed a more nuanced definition of humanized birth, explaining that a highly medicalized birth can be considered \"humanized\" if the interventions were medically necessary and/or if the i nterventions were chosen by the birthing mother. Given socioeconomic and race -based disparities across Mexico, I question uncritical notions of \"free choice.\" In the last chapter, I pointed to the multiple ways humanized birth lapses into (ethno)medical to urism and the commodification of indigenous \"others.\" While I resisted reducing indigenous medicine practitioners and traditional midwives to helpless victims and highlighted the agentive ways they self -confidently leverage \"indigeneity\" in their favor, I also attended to the political economy of humanized birth that constrains their equitable inclusion. In this chapter, I take my analysis a step further: I analyze not only the limited agency of indigenous \"others\" within transnational, consumption -orient ed, humanized birth circles, but also how the very definitions of what constitutes a humanized birth limits participants' choices even whilst celebrating \"choice\" as a central tenet of humanized birth ideology. Definitions of \"Humanized Birth\" According t o a presentation given by Dr. Alejandro Almaguer, Director of Traditional Medicine and Intercultural Development within the Mexican Secretary of Health, the goal of humanized birth is \"that women, their children, and their families live the experience as a special and pleasant moment, in conditions of human dignity, in which the woman is the protagonist of her birth\"33. Doctor Almaguer identifies the essential elements of this birth model to be: a vertical birth position, psychoaffective accompaniment throug hout labor, massage, skin -to-skin contact between newborn and mother, breast feeding immediately after the birth, demedicalization of the birth to the extent possible, prevention of the abuse and overutilization of technology, and above all, the respect of women and their decision -making.34 33 While in latter parts of the dissertati on I will problematize the assumption that humanized birth is synonymous with \"traditional\" and \"intercultural\" practices, within the national offices of the Secretary of Health, humanized birth is a \"traditional\" and \"intercultural\" matter. 34 Information in this paragraph was taken from a PowerPoint presentation Dr. Almaguer posted online: \"Modelo a humanized birth organization in Oaxaca explains, \"the humanized attention of birth is rooted in the value placed on the affective -emotional world of the people involved, and in the desires and needs of its protagonists: mother, father, infant daughter or son. It is based in the freedom and right of mothers and of couples to make decisions about where, how, and with whom to give birth, in one of the most important moments of their life.\" The pr inciples of humanized birth are respect of human and reproductive rights; respect of culture, rituals, and ancestral knowledge; and a vision of birth as a physiological, transcendent, intimate, and personal occurrence. Humanized birth is directed autonomous ly and freely by the woman, in an atmosphere of love, respect, and security; and involves no routine interventions into the natu ral process. Humanized birth ideology prioritizes personalized connection between the couple and the team of professional attend ants; respect of her privacy, dignity, and confidentiality; protection of the immediate bonding between mother and newborn child; and vision of the mother as prot agonist of her labor and birth. This type of birth is envisioned as a form of culturally compa tible care and interculturality ,35 which implies respect for her traditions, language, and other cultural factors. While these are \"official\" and formalized definitio ns of \"humanized birth,\" the most illustrative way to describe how humanized birth is co nceived in practice is through the words of its practitioners. I audited a course offered by Do\u00f1a Isabela, a traditional midwife and clinical director of the CASA Professional Midwifery School. She explained to professional midwifery students that humanize d birth involves making the birthing mother as comfortable as possible by orchestrating a harmonious environment for her to give birth in, and liberating her from misinformation about \"correct\" birthing. Women are socialized to think they must give birth lying on their backs, but it is the professional midwife's job to encourage her to eat, ambulate, and adopt comfortable positions throughout the labor process. Do\u00f1a Isabela taught students to use massage, aroma therapy, the music of the woman's choice, and, depending on the woman's religious beliefs, prayer and chanting to help the woman feel totally at ease during the birth. According to a humanized birth obstetrician and doula, guest lecturers at CASA, humanized birth at tendants must strive to mediate biomedical hyper -vigilance that often provokes couples to become unwarrantedly anxious about \"abnormalities\" that are really just normal variation in pregn ancy and fetal development. Additionally , humanized birth practitioners help couples connect emotionally with their unborn babies by guiding interaction with the fetus throughout pregnancy. The goal of humanized birth practitioners is to help couples \"give birth conscientiously\" and to lead them into conscientious parenthood. Another guest lecturer, an obste trician from Quer\u00e9taro, taught professional midwifery students to resist \"masculine desires\" for quickness and medical intervention, to respect the natural physiology of birth, and to view birth as an intimate and unique moment within a woman's sex life. T he goal of the humanized birth practitioner is to make the woman feel supported and empowered, while also preserving the integrity of the phenomenological experience of the child being born. An obstetric nurse who attends humanized births in Mexico City em phasized the importance of knowing each individual mother personally, using her name when speaking to her, coaching her on breathing techniques during the labor, looking into her eyes, and being present without distractions during her birth. After the birt h, obstetric nurses consider it part of their job to help mothers adapt to breast feeding and make sure that the new family is doing well. Likewise, a young obstetrician and apprentice of humanized birth in Guadalajara told me, \"The 35 See chapter 3 for a discussion about \"interculturality\" and its limitations. 38 key is the relationship we build with patients. They are more like family than patients. We don't even use that term.\" He expressed that what is \"humanized\" about humanized birth is the relationship based on love and respect between the couple giving birth and the person who attends their birth. A humanized birth advocate in San Luis Potos\u00ed emphasized the importance of tranquility during birth at a workshop for expectant parents. She explained that the requirements for a tranquil birth are patience, no unnecessary interventions, the privacy of a private hospital, a quiet environment, absolutely no talk of pain from anyone present, constant accompaniment by whomever the woman chooses, freedom of movement, not being connected to monitors, freedom to eat and drink, and only a minimu m number of required physical examinations throughout the labor process. In Monterey I heard a contrasting perspective from a midwifery apprentice at a transnational NGO. While the humanized birth advocate in San Luis described stringent requirements for a chieving a humanized birth, the midwifery apprentice explained that the priority is not that the birth take place at home or that the baby be born vaginally; rather, the priority is that the woman's embodied knowledge and the role of the baby as protagonis t be prioritized throughout the birth. If the woman becomes too exhausted during the labor and wishes to switch to a medicalized birth or even cesarean, this is still a humanized birth because the woman's decisions were respected. While this midwife identi fied similar goals for humanized birth as some of the perspectives above (home birth, water birth, the active involvement of partners and doulas, the presence of family members and especially siblings of the baby being born, the absence of excessive pain a nd screaming, delayed cutting of the umbilical cord by a family member), the primary criteria was that the birth be controlled by the mother and baby. For a transnational midwife who gives \"traditional Mexican midwifery\" workshops in Brazil, a humanized birth is the marriage of emotional and physiological, spiritual and corporal, and soul and body. Humanized birth practitioners are advocates of women, life, babies, and families. These advocates lead the movement from many posts around the world, resulting in the globalization of humanized birth. Similarly, a Colombian nurse midwife living and practicing in Guadalajara works to help couples transition from thinking about birth as a physiological act to a transcendental act that will leave a mark on the fut ure of both woman and child. For her, birth is something that effects future generations because the way people are born is predictive of individual's emotional wellbeing and how they will treat others in society. The words and work of both of these midwi ves signal the transnationalization of the humanized birth movement and the emergence of a globalized rhetoric for describing this type of birth. When I interviewed the dean of a prestigious private medical school in Mexico City, he emphasized the dearth of scientific literature being produced in Mexico about humanized birth when compared to countries like Brazil. (At the same time, the MacArthur Foundation is working to apply ideas authored in Brazil to the Mexican context through engagement with the Mexi can government and advocacy for the reduction of maternal mortality and Millenium Development Goals.36) In his opinion, adopting humanized birth practices is a strategy for bringing Mexico to the table of progress along with other developing countries. The challenge facing obstetricians who wish to attend humanized births in hospital settings is \"the struggle 36 Personal communication with Sharon Bissell Sotelo, the Director of the MacArthur Foundation's Mexico Office on September 6, 2013 39 against the routine of traditional care.\" In his perspective, \"traditional care\" represents medicalized birth and progress is aligned with an ethos of limited interventions bolstered by scientific evidence. Over the course of three decades, he has stopped performing routine episiotomies and no longer has nurses shave women's pubic hair and place enemas, since \"normal birth with interventionism has not d emonstrated better maternal and perinatal results than natural birth.\" \"Doctor in the public hospital; the same doctor in his private clinic.\" (Artist unknown.) Over the course of my fieldwork, other physicians railed against the terminology of \"human ized birth,\" arguing that it implicitly suggests that medicalized births are \"dehumanized\" and \"animalistic.\" They preferred more neutral terms like \" parto respectado \" (respected birth ), \"parto elegido \" (chosen birth), and \" parto natural \" (natural birth), since these terms highlight respect for birthing mothers' choices, which can be prioritized in both medicalized births and births attended by physicians. Furthermore, physicians agreed again and again that the \"interventionism\" instituted in public hospita ls runs counter to the conditions necessary for humanized birth. For this reason, these physicians echoed that humanized birth belongs to the realm of private practice. At a private hospital that boasts a cesarean rate that is less than half that of the national averagevii and focuses on the integration of natural healing, I inquired about the types of services the hospital is able to offer because of their unique emphasis on holistic medicine, ecological living, and alternative birth methods. Birth -related services offered by the hospital are 40 psychoprophylactic workshops, art therapy for older siblings of the new baby, homeopathic kits for pregnant mothers, \"handprints\" and \"footprints\" of the newborn carved into wood by indigenous artisans37, reading lists of English -language texts on natural and alternative birth38, and doula services. One of the chief officers of the hospital told me that the hospital was designed to look like a top -notch hotel, not a hospital, and all of the food served to guests is organi c. The hospital implements 100% lactation (there are no baby bottles in the hospital) ,39 immediate skin -to-skin bonding between mother and child, and non -horizontal birthing positions. Obstetricians at the hospital do not routinely shave women's pubic hair, apply rectal enemas, place IVs, ask mothers to fast, perform episiotomies, or use synthetic oxytocin. The lobby of the private hospital dedicated to the integration of natural and holistic healing. 37 Yet anoth er example of the commodification of indigeneity within the humanized birth movement. 38 Evidence that humanized birth is a transnational movement that traces its origins in the \"Global North.\" 39 I argue that this all -or-nothing approach sets women up for failure since not all mothers and infants are able to breastfeed immediately after birth. 41 Marketing \"Nature\": The Expense of Humanized Birth Humanized birth is expensive, despite its proponents' criticism of the commercialization of biomedicine. In Monterey, I visited a center that offers obstetric care, prenatal yoga, healthy cooking classes and nutrition counseling. The center operates out o f a mansion in the most affluent neighborhood of the metropolis. The taxi driver who drove me to the center told me that driving a client to that ar ea of Monterey was a rare experience since it was more likely for its residents to travel by private helicop ter than by taxi. This center plays an important role in the humanized birth community in Mexico and transnationally since it has organized and hosted international conferences featuring American and French experts on humanized birth. When I spoke to Eliza beth, the center's founder and a woman of British heritage who travels constantly between Mexico and the home she has with her husband in California, she spoke at length about how biomedicine is undergirded by the pharmaceutical industry. As a cancer survi vor who rejected biomedical interventions and instead adopted a holistic diet, she opines that the wellbeing of patients can often be achieved through organic and holistic methods, but biomedicine fails to explore these possibilities since they are not as lucrat ive as pharmaceuticals (see Dum it 2012 on how the pharmaceuticalization of everyday life shapes consumer's understanding of health and prevention).40 Later that afternoon, I asked to speak with the obstetrician at the center \u2014a leader of the \"health r evolution\" who uses \"best practices for both mother and child.\" The obstetrician responded that he could fit me in if I were to book a patient appointment and pay his 800 peso consultation fee (about two and a half weeks of salary at minimum wage). He exp lained that if he were to grant me an interview, he could have seen a patient during that time, for which he would earn 800 pesos. However, if I were to book a patient appointment, I could use that time to ask him whatever I wanted about his work. I decli ned his invitation to pay for an interview since doing so would have violated the procedures regarding compensation of informants outlined in my Internal Review Board permissions for research, and moreover, because my most pressing questions about how huma nized birth is marketed to patient -consumers at this center had already been answered. My intention behind interviewing this particular obstetrician was not primarily to document yet another practitioner's definition of humanized birth, but to discern wher e the center fell on the continuum between a universalizing \"humanization\" of birth, and marginalizing commercialization of services. Interestingly, when I interviewed the deans of a prestigious private medical school in Mexico City, the perspective th ey expressed about humanized birth was ironically parallel to Emma's remarks about biomedicine. They spoke to me about how \"humanized birth\" was becoming a buzz word in Mexico, and how obstetricians were beginning to see their lack of involvement as a misse d economic opportunity. Instead of allowing \"alternative birth attendants\" to reap all of the commercial gain, some were beginning to market humanized birth practices based on scientific literature from Brazil, thus securing their participation in the boom . When I returned home to San Miguel, I sat down for a formal interview with Dr. Tellez, a physician that I had been observing for months at the General Hospital. He described his academic trajectory to me, which includes a degree in homeopathy. While he is a proponent of minimal intervention, he frowned upon the commercialization of humanized birth, saying that the expense of a natural childbirth is fortunate for physicians and unfortunate for patients. He 40 In Chapter 5, I discuss in detail how humanized birth is a lucrative source of income and status for professional humanized birth practitioners. 42 explained that in Mexico, patients often believe that expensive services are the best, so when a bodily practice like humanized birth becomes \"trendy,\" it also becomes expensive. Shortly after my interview with Dr. Tellez, I spoke with Jaime Breilh, Director of Health Sciences at the Universidad Andina S imon Bolivar in Quito, Ecuador, about my research. He succinctly described what I was observing in my fieldwork: \"When ancestral knowledge is commercialized, it becomes a functionalist element and is no longer emancipatory.\" Building on my argument in chap ter two, I argue that not only does humanized birth fail to fulfill its inclusionary promise relating to the rhetoric of \"humanity,\" but furthermore, it often fails to truly liberate even those who are able to access its benefits through the pathway of con sumption. Unexpected Politics of Parenting : A New Moral Imperative My research utilizes the humanized birth movement in Mexico as a lens through which to analyze transnational tr ends in parenting. I argue that couples from the global professional class (Spivak 2003, 618) often view parenthood as the \"last stop\" to creating a successful life . That is, upper middle - and upper -class couples aim to follow a life trajectory that includes higher education, professional development, marriage, home ownership, and parenthood . The criteria for good parenting is largely defined by parentin g trends in a transnational social network originating in the Global North (examples are \"humanized birth,\" extended lactation, organic/holistic nutrition, Montessori and Waldorf e ducation, extracurricular activities, etc.) As couples increasingly consider parenthood and their ability to produce certain types of future bioconsumers a marker of their overall success, their relationships to their children are changing, often resulting in greater demands on the parents' time and economic resources. Social networks: A gathering of families of children who have been born via humanized birth. 43 The chapter describes how parents and families form social networks oriented around a particula r type of birth. While \"humanized birth\" has so often been described as a pathway to feminist liberation and resistance to (masculine) b iomedical hegemony, I problematize uncritical notions of liberation by asking how humanized birth may be the first step within a new regime of pressures and \"requirements\" presented by modern -day \"good parenting.\" Through examples of women who struggle or \"fail\" to give birth naturally (see Crossley 2007) , my ethnography signals how humanized birth inadvertently represent a nother way the burden of correctly producing future bioconsumers falls upon women, e ven as it aims to liberate them from biomedical hegemony. The Mexican women who participate in transnational humanized birth social networks share notions of what constitu tes good mothering and ideal birthing. Social bonds rest upon mutual understandings of what mothers must do to achieve the best possible birth; at the same time, mothers are bound both by the expectations of their fellow humanized birth proponents, and by the very logic of how a humanized birth should progress. Humanized birth illuminates how the neoliberal meritocracy framing contemporary parenting not only concerns children's development post -birth, but how moral imperatives related to \"proper parenting\" pushes back into the womb. As the term \"meritocracy\" suggests, there is a fine, often vanishing line between elevating standards and provoking competition, shared passion and mutual obligation, defending rights and imposing ideology, challenging power and reinventing limitations. While humanized birth emerged out of resistance to biomedical hegemony and feminist desire to wrest the power over birth away from (male) doctors and place it back in the hands of birthing women, I point to the irony of humanized birth , and ask how humanized birth social networks may represent \"maternalistic biopower .\" Humanized birth circles are motivated by mutual concern about biomedicalized birth and desire to improve birth outcomes for mother and child; however, they also inci te a sense of obligation within women that can have harmful physical, psychological, and emotional effects. While I eagerly recognize many instances when my informants reported feeling empoderadas (empowered), I am also signaling the murky edges of humani zed birth experiences and problematic moments in wh ich exchanging biomedicalized birth for humanized birth may be replacing one form of tyranny for another. The ideology of humanized birth leads couples to make significant economic investments41 towards ach ieving their ideal birth, and inspires mothers to agentively choose physical pain over anesthesia. These parents meet their socially -influenced obligations to give children the best start in life through consumption and elected suffering. My work engages in a debate with a great deal of anthropological scholarship on \"new midwifery\" that revolves around how professional midwives in different countries are helping women reconnect with \"nature,\" teaching them to trust their bodies, respecting women's \"choice s,\"42 confronting and defying hegemonic biomedical structures, and fighting for women's 41 See Chapter 5 and the Conclusion for more detail on the costs of humanized birth. 42 I problematize uncritical notions of free choice by drawing attention to how, for most Mexican women, choices are either nonexistent or prestructured. Women (especially indigenous and lower class) do not have options when giving birth in public hospitals. The very idea of \"choice\" emerges from a middle - and upper -class perspective \u2014\"choice\" is a privilege of those capable of paying for private medical services. My argument is informed by B ourdieu's concept of habitus: Class provides the conditions that determine tastes. However, the role of class in determining 44 right to birth as naturally as possibleviii. In these texts , birthing mothers are transformed and \"empowered,\"43 their lives changed forever by exposure to the midwifery mod el of birth (see Davis -Floyd 2001 and 2007). While my work employs humanized birth as its analytical object, the subject of this dissertation extends far beyond birth. I argue that parenting is a primary way that individuals accrue cultural capital within a transnational meritocracy, and as a result individuals are incited to demonstrate good parenting before their children are even born. That is, the interpellation of individuals as parents originates in vitro , and is perpetuated through social mechanism s that challenge anthropological notions of biopower. Medical anthropologists have also developed an extensive literature on midwifery, positioning the midwifery model as a pathway to feminist liberation and resistance to (masculine) biomedical hegemony (s ee Davis -Floyd 1992; Katz Rothman 2007; MacDonald 2008; and Simonds 2007, among others). In contrast, this chapter challenges notions of unrestricted liberation by pointing to how humanized birth may impose a new regime of standards for modern -day \"good pa rents.\" While biopower has often been characterized as the control of populations through \"paternalistic\" institutional and governmental surveillance, humanized birth practices beg the question of how \"maternalistic\" biopower might operate through social n etworks. Furthermore, t his chapter aims to add complexity to Jordanova's (1995) suggestion that anthropologists begin thinking seriously about children as commodities. I provide ethnographic examples that illustrate the complex intertwining of 1) how givi ng children the best upbringing increasingly entails material consumption among privileged families [commodities are consumed by parents for their children], 2) how children are parents' stake in a transnational neoliberal meritocracy [children are commodi ties that are consumed by parents], and 3) both commodities for children and children as commoditi es are bolstered by love, care, and sacrifice .ix In contrast to cross -cultural ethnographies of child rearing, I am probing a transnational neoliberal meritocr acy that superimposes class -infused logic and globalized notions of gender on place - based practices to drive contemporary parenting trends. Thus, my work queries how meritocracy -fueled phenomena \u2014examples are \"helicopter moms\" and \"tiger moms \"\u2014unfold in places penetrated by deep disparitiesx. Mommy Wars The term \"mommy wars\" began circulating in 1986 when Leslie Morgan Steiner published her book Mommy Wars: Stay -at-Home and Career Moms Face Off on Their Choices, Their Lives, Their Families . Since then, th e term has come to encompass any controversy that poses one type of parent's superiority over another. As parenting becomes a key category through which individuals stake claims to moral superiority and accrue cultural capital within their social communiti es, a flurry of contentious issues emerges to the fore of public debate. One contemporary example is whether to vaccin ate your child against measles, with one camp taste is concealed and the relationship between taste and education is repressed; thus, tastes seem \"natural\" and are used to legit imate the superiority of the wealthy (see Bourdieu 1984). 43 I am critical of the notion of \"empowerment,\" asking what it does and for whom. Who does the empowering? For those who are \"empowered,\" were they truly \"disempowered\" before? Is hegemony really ch allenged if people in the Global South are \"empowered\" by ideas from the Global North? Lastly, I am wary of how neoliberalism and the concept of individualism and choice informs the notion of \"empowerment.\" 45 arguing vaccination places children at a higher risk for developing autism, and the other ca mp arguing non -vaccination places children at a higher risk for infectious diseases and leads to the spread of disease to other children. Other ethical examples include whether sending your unsupervised child to the park to play is negligence; the legality of circumcision and whether parents have th e right to circumcise toddlers ; and whether leaving your children i n a hot car is child abuse. Developmental debates unfold around what types of discipline are violent and damaging to a child's emotional well -being; what teaching methods are best for child ren's intellectual development, including, but not limited to, the debate over home school versus traditional school; and how much and what kind of acade mic testing is most appropriate. In the social, moral, reli gious, and emotional realms, parents ponder how to best teach children about gender and race dynamics; how to best instill moral and religious values in children given their exposure to people and events that counter what is being taught at home; how to ad apt a schedule observed by all family members that benefits children, such as family meals ; and what types of verbal expressions are e motionally damaging to toddlers. With regards to children's physical wellbeing, topics include the best techniques for get ting c hildren to eat and sleep ; children's proper nutrition (vegan, organic, and holistic diets, and preventing childhood obesity, etc.); breast milk versus formula, how long to breastfeed babies to optimize their physical well -being, and the challenge thi s presents to working mothers; whether electronic devices are damaging children's brains; cloth diapering versus disposable diapering; and methods for coping with t he challenges of potty training. T he list is unending! Many parents feel an enormous amount of pressure to \"get it right\" \u2014they feel their children's physical, emotional, psychological, and intellectual development depend on their good parenting, and their deficiencies as parents could have detrimental effects on their children's lives. The resul ts are \"guilty mother syndrome\"; parents' anxiety that their own emotional troubles, depression, and \"brokenness\" will negatively affect their child; fathers juggling careers with active parenting and demanding their paternity be taken as seriously as mate rnity (for example, through paternal leave); and reproductive endocrinology, assisted reproduction , and, at times, \"fertility envy\" for couples experiencing infertility. A plethora of self -help books, videos, and web -based materials circulate to aid paren ts in their quest to become experts in the field of parenting. While past generations learned parenting by doing, present -day parenting is a skill perfected through accrual of expert knowledge, dedication, and correct decision -making. What was once \"just l ife\" is now something to blog about \u2014hence the rise of mommy bloggers. The most popular parenting books on the market focus on how to prevent power struggles, raise joyful and resilient children while remaining peaceful and connected, teach children discipl ine and responsibility without yelling and aggression, \"unconditional\" and \"zen\" parenting, how to reason with children using logical explanations, how to strike a balance between nurturing and enabling children, how to have \"the happiest baby on the block ,\" the link between raising children and a deeper understanding of self, how to avoid common parenting \"mistakes,\" \"rules\" for \"surviving\" parenting, strategies for unleas hing the potential of children's d eveloping minds, and how to win your child's heart by parenting with purpose. While these books share the notion that there are better versus inferior ways of parenting for the development and overall well -being of children, and better means nonaggressive discipline, unconditional nurturing, and sustained intellectual engagement ; this chapter brings a critical medical anthropology perspective to health -related \"mommy wars\" circulating in popular media and analyzes how parents use birth to stake claims to moral superiorityxi. 46 Moral Superiority: Birthing Se lf-Assured Children On a chilly morning in December 2010, I hiked up the cobblestone road leading to the Center for the Adolescents of San Miguel de Allende (CASA) for the very first time, stopping frequently to ask for directions. While San Miguel de Alle nde is known for its large population of resident American and Canadian expatriates and is a popular destination for international and national tourists, CASA is perched at the top of the Santa Julia hill in a working -class barrio. I was eager to visit CAS A, since among its many programs was the only government -accredited midwifery school in the country and its maternity hospital represents a key site for the unfolding of \"humanized birth\" in Mexico. CASA's location suggests that the majority of its materni ty patients are working -class Mexicans, but I soon discovered that its clientele was more transnational and from a broader , and more elite, socioeconomic range than I had expected. When I finally arrived at CASA , I was struck by its charm: the beautiful c athedral -like dome, arched windows, warm yellow and burgundy hues, and pitter -patter of water in the courtyard fountain. As I walked down the hospital corridors, I saw a wooden sign on one of the birthing rooms exclaiming, \"It's a Boy!\" in Spanish. A staff member gave me a tour of its newly appointed water birth facility and led me to a plaque proclaiming that, having undergone a workshop with Martha Lipton (\"water birth educator, gentle -birth guardian, and celebrity\" within humanized birth circles), CASA h as earned the designation of internationally certified water birth center. A CASA pamphlet listed prices for different types of births. Significantly, I noted the cost of water birth was nearly twice t hat of non -water birth. A few months later, I was acco mpanying Magdalena, one of the profe ssional midwifery students, during her rotation in the CASA maternity hospital. She explained that the demographic of couples seeking water birth varies starkly from those seeking non -water birth: couples interested in water birth often travel great distances to give birth at CASA, are familiar with the \"humanized birth\" movement and its European origins, ar e often transnational , possess a higher level of education, and can afford a more expensive birth. Two years afte r Magdalena had graduated from CASA, I visited her and interviewed some of her home birth clients. In contrast to the transnational couples that travel for midwifery services at CASA after reading about their unique model online, Magdalena has amassed her clientele purely by word of mouth. Her clients are professional and entrepreneurial Mexicans who live within the greater Guadalajara area, and a number of them are clustered in the city of Irapuato. Magdalena's clients connected me with other mothers fro m the same social circle who are also passionate about humanized birth. The women I interviewed formed friendships with each other by sharing tips and insights about humanized birth while waiting to pick up their children from school. I sought out Yasmin, Magdalena's first client in the city of Irapuato . A couple minutes after ringing the large, copper bell hanging above Yasmin 's front gate, Yasmin appeared and led me through the courtyard and into the well -appointed living room of her two -story home. She was more youthful than I had imagined, and I wondered how she and her husband had become so well established at such a young age. Over the course of our conversation, Yasmin explained that she and her husband own a textile manufacturing company specializin g in the mass production of cloth diapers. Their respective families are both from Irapuato, and her mother and grandmother live just a few houses away. Yasmin is 26 years old and the mother of three children. Her first two sons were born via cesarean wh en she was 22 and 23 years of age, respectively. Defying all odds, she gave birth to her third son in a home water birth. 47 Yasmin and her third son, born in water at a home birth During her first pregnancy, Yasmin had wanted to give birth naturally, but as the labor unfolded, her dilation subsided. Yasmin was in the hospital for two days, and despite rhythmic contractions, every time the hospital personnel checked the condition of her cervix, her dilation was at one centimeter. At that time, she had not yet informed herself by reading any \"humanized birth\" literature or participating in psychoprophylactic birthing classes and relied solely on the obstetrician's guidance when deciding how to proceed. The obstetrician told her everything was fine, but that at any moment fetal distress could occur. Yasmin explained, \"Of course, when any mother hears the words 'fetal distress,' she'll do whatever the doctor recommends so that her child isn't injured.\" Yasmin was afraid of cesarean since she had never undergone surgery, and she recalled the anxiety she felt when the hospital staff shaved her pubic hair and applied an IV and anesthesia. They jostled her, jerking the sliced -open flesh of her belly. When they had extracted her baby boy, they showed Yasmin her newbo rn, giving her only a few seconds to catch a glimpse of her child before whisking him out of her sight. 48 Pediatrician suctions newborn's mouth in the first minutes after birth Newborn tangled in measuring tape after post -birth evaluation by pediatrici an 49 Later, when she was in the recovery area and her baby boy was returned to her, they had already fed him formula. The baby was satisfied and did not seek colostrum from her breasts \u2014 Yasmin was a stranger to the biochemical process of birth, and although s he desired ever so greatly to nourish the babe with her own milk, breastfeeding was physiologically out of synch with the surgery she has just experienced. She told me, \"It wasn't until two or three days later that I realized I had become a mother and had had a baby. When you give birth [vaginally], you close a cycle. In comparison, cesarean leaves ugly traces [on a mother's psyche].\" A year and three months later she was pregnant again, and they told her, citing the possibility of uterine rupture, \"Once a cesarean, always a cesarean.\" Her doctor instructed her, \"Go think of a date [for the cesarean].\" They scheduled the surgery. Yasmin said her second cesarean was \"terrible and frightful.\" In the operating room, the surgical team joked around among th emselv es while she was possessed by fear because the anesthesia had not properly taken effect. She was still moving her feet and feeling sensations in her body when they began cutting. She could hear her heartbeat throbbing loudly, drumming almost out of her che st, and she begged, \"Please, don't open me.\" They gave her an inhalational anesthetic, covering her face with a mask and inducing her to sleep. When she awoke, she was still frantic. Her baby was no longer in her womb, and neither her husband nor the docto r was present. What had happened? She was overcome by desperation and physical pain. Her husband later told her their son was born limp and blue, like a dead rabbit. Yasmin believes the inhalational anesthetic had a noxious effect on her baby as well. Cesarean section in a public hospital 50 Upon discovering she was pregnant a third time, Yasmin was determined not to have another cesarean. \"It is not possible that I cannot give birth vaginally!\" she exclaimed. She told her obstetrician she wanted to have a vaginal delivery, but he responded, \"Are you crazy? They only do that in the United States! And they are crazy because it cannot be done. The women and doctors who pursue vaginal birth after cesarean are crazy gringos.\" Yasmin asked herself, \"Only crazy g ringos can do it? I don't think so!\" She decided to take psychoprophylactic classes, and the coursework she studied helped her make a definitive decision: yes, she can give birth naturally. Yasmin discussed her desire to give birth vaginally with Celia , a doula invested in \"humanized birth\" practices. Celia gave Yasmin two options: a pro -birth obstetrician or professional midwives. The obstetrician told her that while Yasmin was at risk for uterine rupture, he was willing to see how the pregnancy progresse d before making a decision. Yasmin 's husband was comfortable with the obstetrician's plan. However, Yasmin wanted to meet with the professional midwives as well, but her husband was skeptical and anxious; his wife not only wanted a vaginal birth, but a vag inal birth at home, attended by midwives! Two weeks before the birth, they journeyed to Guadalajara to meet Luc\u00eda and Marisa for the first time. An hour into the interview, her husband was convinced. Both Yasmin and her husband were moved by the careful explanations the two professional midwives provided for each of their questions. They were struck by the difference between the physician's dismissive statement, \"You don't need to know,\" and the midwives' close attention. A week before the birth, the obste trician told the couple that something was amiss with the fetus' position and prescribed medication that would induce contractions. By the time she left the doctor's office, Yasmin had already decided she wanted nothing to do with that obstetrician ever ag ain. This time, she was not going to have an induced labor, painful synthetic oxytocin - driven contractions, or cesarean. Her third son was born after 40 weeks gestation. They placed a blowup birthing pool in their bedroom on the second floor. It was Decem ber, but they took the chill off with space heaters. Yasmin was left feeling nothing but joy after her third birth, explaining that the experience transformed the way she and her husband both relate with their youngest son. Her husband was a participant in the water birth, not just a spectator as he had been in the hospital births of their other two sons. After the birth, Yasmin thought, \"Wow! How beautiful! My life has changed!\" It is now the couple's mission to inform other women of their options, and th ey use their cloth diaper business to facilitate their mission. In the eight months following Yasmin 's water birth experience, four other mothers followed suit, giving birth vaginally after having prior cesarean sections. Yasmin expresses how grateful she is for what she has learned about her body, connecting with her fetus, and breastfeeding. She now knows that her body needs three days of labor to prepare for her delivery. She believes that if she had waited a third day during her first birth, her baby wo uld have been born naturally and safely. \"That is just how my body is.\" She recognizes, however, that natural birth is about respecting the fetus' readiness to be born and communicating to the fetus when the right time has arrived. On the third day of her third delivery, while her mother and husband were knotted by anxiety, Yasmin went to bed by herself and whispered to her fetus: \"Baby, you have to be born now.\" A few minutes later, her water broke. The harmony she experienced during her water birth contin ued in the ensuing years. Her third son benefited from a year and eight months of breastfeeding, while she only managed to give each of her other two sons six months of breastfeeding. Yasmin asserts that her youngest 51 son and children born through \"humanize d birth\" are more loving and emotionally secure than other children and form closer connections with their fathers. For Josefa and Tom\u00e1s, the differe nces between their two sons do not end with how the boys were born; rather, they are different because of the disparate circumstances surrounding their births. Tob\u00edas was born via cesarean. He becomes angry, scared, or anxious when he hears a loud noise; for example, the vacuum cleaner, the washing machine, or a slamming door. In contrast, Timoteo, who is stil l a baby and was born in water, will only turn his head in curiosity to see what has made such a loud noise. Timoteo sleeps even in the noisiest environments, likes to sleep on both his mother and father's chest , and is soothed by the rhythm of their heart beats. Timoteo is a tranquil baby, while Tob\u00edas seems to be perpetually decentered by his traumatic birth experience. At the time of the interview, Tob\u00edas was almost four , and his innocence and inquisitive nature caused him to ask questions that provoked a deep emotional response in his parents: \"Why did they snatch me from inside my mother when I was so happy being with her?\" As the couple describes, children born via cesarean are haunted by the unnaturalness of their surgical beginn ings. In contrast, Jose fa and Tom\u00e1s ' subsequent experience with professional midwives was \"the birth of a human being.\" What is remarkable about the many birth stories I heard during my ethno graphic research is not only the emphasis on resist ing biomedical hegemony to achieve d esired births , but also the striking moral dimension embedded in their recounting of events. At times, their retelling seemed akin to religious conversion stories, as if through delivery they themselves had been delivered. Through psychoprophylactic traini ng and familiarization with transnational \"humanized birth\" literature, these women and couples prepared themselves for arduous labor and learned to place their faith in \"nature,\" \"tradition,\" and their innate capacity to give birth naturally over biomedic al protocols. They cast cesarean as traumatizing, terrifying, and violating, while depicting \"humanized birth\" as beautiful and empowering. Perhaps even more compell ing is the way couples described \"humanized birth\" as the way by which self -assured, well adjusted, happy humans are brought into the world. Even when labor lasts for days on end, couples asserted it is worth going through the pain of natural labor since the result is a healthier and more contented child . Basing their claims on the biochemical process that unfolds during an undisturbed childbirth (most notably, the secretion of oxytocin into the bloodstream, catalyzing the \"let down reflex\" and facilitating the production of breast milk), these couples affirmed that \"humanized birth\" practices a re correlative with easy, continued breastfeeding, thus strengthening their children's immune systems and reducing their likelihood of developing numerous diseases later in life. In essence, children born via \"humanized birth\" are described as the fortunat e offspring of conscientious, caring, brave, and intelligent parents; their births link them to children also born in water, at home, and with the help of professional midwives in the United States and elsewhere in the Global North. My argument is not a rebuttal to these couples' assertions, nor do I criticize their decisions. I agree wholeheartedly with the reduction of obstetric violence and unnecessary biomedicalization through safe, natural alternatives. However, stopping there would reduce the scope of my research to (albeit valuable) advocacy around a woman's right to determine the conditions of her birthing. I nstead, I am undertaking an analytic project; thus, the novelty of my research lies in the unveiling of multiple ironies embedded in humanized birth. In this chapter, I specifically draw attention to how \"humanized birth\" ideology represents a new set of expectations to which women strive to conform and sometimes fail to fulfill. 52 From left to right: Josefa with Timoteo and Tob\u00edas, Tom\u00e1s, an d Celia (see her story, below). The Secret Tyranny of \"Humanized Birth\": When Mothers Fail to Meet Expectations In August 2013, I visited Dr. Horacio Garc\u00eda44, a perinatologist, hospital administrator, and clinical professor at the National Autonomous Univ ersity of Mexico, at his private clinic near Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. His clinic is inconspicuously tucked into a small residential street, but once inside , I was struck by a plethora of photographs of healthy newborns intermixed with angel figurines , catholic relics, and el Ni\u00f1o Jesus (a Baby Jesus doll). Dr. Garcia's clinic features a roomy, light -filled water birth suite on the secon d floor with a sofa, regular queen -size bed, full bath, Jacuzzi, skylight, marble waterfall with an angel statue, and large windows providing views of the tree - and flower -filled garden. The suite was designed to maximize the comfort of the family and ease of labor. A cord hangs above the Jacuzzi so the mother may suspend her weight and stretch her back while birthing. Wooden bars are fastened to the wall to facilitate prophylactic exercises that relax the pelvis in preparation for birth. Dr. Garc\u00eda intentionally rejected a hospital bed in favor of a regular queen -size bed so t hat his clients would feel at home in the b irthing suite, and to promote family bonding after the birth. 44 Described in further detail in chapter six. 53 The \"bedroom\" portion of the birthing suite at Dr. Garc\u00eda's clinic. While Dr. Garc\u00eda's attention to detail signals his commitment to humanized birth, or as he prefers, \"respected birth,\" h is training in perinatology gives him a different perspective regarding pain and safety during child birth than many of his doula and professional midwife counterparts. While Dr. Garc\u00eda is in favor of birth pr eparation courses , he emphasizes that if instru ctors teach pregnant women they can definitely achieve a vaginal birth using a set of relaxation techniques during labor, the results can be detrimental. On one hand , Dr. Garc\u00eda has been called to evaluate cases where the mother was in labor for over three days, but when he determined the situation was posing a risk to the child's health, the mother was intransigent \u2014she was determined to give birth vaginally. On the other hand, Dr. Garc\u00eda has had to intervene in cases where the mother is exhausted, in pain, and no longer wishes to continue with her humanized birth plan, but others around her exert pressure on her to not give up. In one instance, he was asked to consult on a home birth that was already at an advanced stage of labor. The birthing mother was b egging for anesthesia, but her husband was insisting she not be given anesthesia since he was concerned about the effects anesthesia would have on his child. The woman's two doulas were coaching her to push through the pain. When Dr. Garc\u00eda arrived, the bi rthing mother's cervix was dilated to eight centimeters. She grabbed his arm and exclaimed, \"Operate me! I'm so tired! I've already had so much pain!\" As Dr. Garc\u00eda described, in this moment her emotional connection with the two dou las and her husband shat tered. She looked into Dr. Garc\u00eda's eye s and pleaded, \"Doctor, don't leave me.\" Dr. Ga rc\u00eda reassured her he would not leave her, but he explained that at such an advanced stage of labor, administering 54 anesthesia was no longer an option. He continued accomp anying the woman and forty -five minutes later the baby was born. Both circumstances \u2014when mothers insist on vaginal birth even when they may be putting their child at risk, and when birth attendants and family members apply pressure to achieve a natural bi rth despite the mothers' excessive pain and exhaustion \u2014complicate uncritical notions of what humanized birth means for mothers and newborns . In both cases, humanized birth is cas t as an accomplishment, while giving into pain and accepting medical intervent ions is portrayed as failure on the mother's part. Beginning in earlier stages of pregnancy, women who subscribe to humanized birth take courses in meditation, self -hypnosis, breathing, and relaxation techniques in hopes that they will be able to harness t heir willpower, overcome physical pain, and give their child the best start in life \u2014a birth free of synthetic drugs, hormones, obstetric violence, and traumatic memories that may leave lifelong emotional scars. Dr. Garc\u00eda is hypervigilant of the potential slippage between demedicalized empowerment and dogmatic endangerment . He explained to me that in Mexico, the prevailing cultural notion is that the more a woman suffers during child birth, the more she must love her child.45 Dr. Garc\u00eda contrasts himself with other obstetricians who practice humanized birth. He is critical of humanized obstetricians who are so resistant to performing medical interventions that they call upon him to intervene instead. In the case of a woman who had been in labor for three days and was fully dilated for over five hours but her contractions had stopped, Dr. Garc\u00eda arrived at the request of his colleague and administered intravenous pitocin to restart them. \"I then withdrew from the birth as a hero.\" With his own patients, Dr. Ga rc\u00eda explains that cesarean is a final option \u2014that way, if the birthing conditions are not favorable, he has saved the birthing mother the emotional distress of feeling she has failed. The way in which natural birth has, for some women, become a marker of good mothering while failure to achieve vaginal delivery without medical intervention is deemed a personal failure was evident in many of my interviews with parents. For example, Celia recounts her reproductive history as a tale of trial and tribulation r esulting from her physical inadequacy until she was finally able to overcome her limitations and reach empowerment. Celia has had five pregnancies. Her first was an ectopic pregnancy resulting in the removal of a fallopian tube. Thereafter, she had difficu lty becoming and staying pregnant. After several miscarriages, Celia and her husband Javier finally gave up trying. Then Celia became pregnant with their daughter Sandra. These combined events led Celia to think of maternity as a \" don.\" A don is a talent bestowed upon an individual by God; thus, Celia's difficult reproductive history has led her to believe that the ability to produce a child is a divine gift \u2014some women have been blessed with the knack of producing children while others have not. Sandra's birth was unexpected. After Celia's water broke, twelve hours passed without a single contraction. Her obstetric team administered oxytocin, but when it did not produce the desired effect, they later administered intravenous prostaglandins in order to indu ce the birth. When Celia finally began to have contractions, they were strong and painful. Celia demanded anesthesia \"a gritos \" (screaming at the top of her lungs), even though she had planned for a natural birth. The anesthesiologist took \"an eternity\" to arrive at Celia's bedside, and then took 45 Matthew Gutmann (1998) studied the natural, physical and \"psychically overwhelming\" mutual dependency between Mexican mothers and their children \u2014a relationship that takes precedence over all others and, when combined with modern transformations (for examp le, mothers working outside the home), can cause children to suffer tremendously. 55 several more minutes to set up his epidural kit. He placed the epidural with difficulty and \"scolded\" Celia for being too fat. After that, Celia had regular contractions and Sandra was born an hour later. Even thou gh Celia and Javier had advised the pediatrician before the birth of their wish to keep Sandra with them for skin -to-skin contact and bonding, the medical team whisked Sandra off to evaluate her health as soon as she was born and to observe her in the nurs ery. Later, when the infant was finally returned to her mother, Celia was unsuccessful at breastfeeding because the nurses had already fed the baby formula. Twenty months later, Celia became pregnant with Santiago. She describes her prenatal obstetrician as very \"pro -cesarean.\" He told her she would require a cesarean because she had gained too much weight. Later, he told the couple the baby had a double nuchal chord and the birth must be via cesarean. When they talked to the obstetrician about their birth plan, he insisted that an intravenous drip would be necessary, but agreed to many of the other humanized birth practices they requested. However, when Celia was forty -one weeks pregnant, he told them if the baby were not born in a matter of days, he would have to induce the birth. The couple became very anxious. At 11:00 a.m., at forty -one weeks and two days gestation, Celia began having contractions and had normal bleeding. She took a bath to ease the pain. She heard the daily \"Ave Mar\u00eda\" on the radio sig naling twelve noon and transitioned to the bedroom. She could not lie down due to extreme pain in her lower back. Upon arriving at the hospital, her cervix was already eight centimeters dilated. The obstetric team took her to the labor and delivery room on a gurney despite her wish to continue walking. They instructed her to lie down even though the lithotomy position (back flat, legs spread, feet in stirrups) caused her great pain. Later, they allowed her to sit up and the pain subsided. The attending obs tetrician at the time of the birth was a woman. She said to Celia, \"If you want a natural birth, you must cooperate.\" This prompted Celia to become quiet and introspective and to concentrate her energy. When Santiago was born, they passed him to Celia imme diately, but moments later they whisked him away. Unlike her experience after Sandra's birth, the pediatrician took only five minutes to evaluate Santiago's health and return Santiago to Celia. While Celia was never able to achieve exclusive breastfeeding with Sandra, she accomplished it easily with Santiago because she had overcome her distrust in her own body. After the birth, Celia felt like \"superwoman\" because she had persevered throughout the experience and \"everything turned out well.\" When she told her closest female friends about her birth experience, they exclaimed, \"You are super wild! You are a carnivore!\" Celia said, \"Everyone had this attitude of 'Wow!' when I told them.\" Santiago's birth was the impetus for Celia to study prenatal education, and with Javier's financial and moral support, she earned her certificate and became a prenatal educator. Celia opines that information about birthing options is empowering since it can attenuate women's fears, and because obstetricians are unable to unila terally dictate the terms of the birth to couples that are well informed. \"Yes , it is painful, of course. But I decided, and I chose.\" Celia's telling of her reproductive history highlights the complexity of humanized birth as it unfolds in the lives of M exican women. On one hand, Celia's story is an example of how humanized birth can lead to empowerment and feminist liberation. On the other hand, her account is peppered with comments signaling her own inadequacies prior to her successful birthing without medical interventions. By casting maternity as a \"don,\" Celia explains her ectopic pregnancy and subsequent miscarriages as resulting from her deficient knack for motherhood. Celia identifies her faulty will power and inability to overcome physical pain wh en 56 she describes how she requested anesthesia and abandoned her plan of no interventions during Sandra's birth. Underscoring the circuitous relationship between how physicians place the mandate of correct motherhood through self -discipline on pregnant wom en's shoulders and how women internalize these obligations, Celia mentions her excessive weight gain during both pregnancies as the reason for the anesthesiologist's difficulty placing the epidural and for the obstetrician's insistence that Santiago requir ed delivery via cesarean section. Instead of pointing to the synthetic hormones she received during labor or the missed opportunity to initiate lactation immediately after the birth as causes for her difficulty breastfeeding Sandra, Celia situates the problem as resulting from her distrust in her own body \u2014thus, her inability to breastfeed was a physiological shortcoming resulting from psychological misgivings. During her second birth, the solace she found in the Ave Mar\u00eda counters celebrations of La Malinch e as the original literate mother (see Haraway 1991, Moraga 1983), and instead points to the Madonna -like chosen suffering of \"morally superior\" mothers who give birth naturally. While Celia's reproductive history ends with victory and perhaps even the acc rual of cultural capital through heightened recognition within her social network, I point to the multiple ways Celia has interpellated herself as an inadequate mother along her path to eventual success. Celia's telling of her reproductive history unveils unforeseen politics of parenting, and, specifically, how the ideology of \"humanized birth\" \u2014the idea that through conviction and preparation, birthing mothers can overcome the pain of labor to achieve a liberating and empowering natural birth experience tha t will result in better health ou tcomes for both mother and child \u2014can inadvertently lead to some women feeling a sense of disappointment and failure. Furthermore, while \"humanized birth\" is hailed by feminist proponents as an alternative to (masculine) bio medical hegemony, I argue that it places a different, potentially noxious set of pressures on women. While I am not dismissing the benefits of humanized birth for many women, I am using a critical lens to signal that, instead of a wholesale liberation, \"hu manized birth\" once again obliges women to correctly producing future bioconsumers . Humanized Babies and Cyborg Feminists? Thinking of reproduction as a discursive field brings up questions of \"authorship.\" Colonial legacies, racial discrimination, mascu line dominance, and scientific ways of knowing are deeply embedded in the production of \"truth \" about human reproduction \u2014potentially masking women's embodied knowledge. For example, Don na Haraway's work on the social construction of nature asks who are the agents creating representations of birth and reproduction, and to what end (see Haraway 1989)? Who has the power to defin e women's health? Humanized birth is envisioned by its participants as inherently feminist since it inverts Sherry Ortner's (1972 ) identification of women's association with nature as the basis of their devaluation and instead casts \"going back to nature\" and the life -giving capabilities of female physiology as a source of empowerment and liberation. While for Ortner culturally construct ed notions of nature buttress the universality of female subordination and seeps into the underlying logic that assumes the inferiority of women, humanized birth proponents have seized \"nature\" as a source of power and positive identification. However, my ethnographic work points to an inversion within this very inversion. I argue that this reinvention of nature is still dependent upon unequal power for its maintenance. Elsewhere, I point to how the humanized birth movement in Mexico inadvertently reinfor ces racialized logics rooted in colonial legacy and contemporary imbrication with the United States, and thus reflects desire for cultural capital 57 based on \"social white ning.\" While Donna Haraway (1990 ) interpellates cyborg feminists to author narrative st rategies that rewrite stories in which inequities of race, sex, and class are naturalized in \"functioning systems of exploitation;\" in this paper, my focus is on the textual politics leading to persisting, unequalizing logics of class, gender, and sexualit y, even through a movement that aims to position women as powerful agents by claiming \"nat ure.\" While Haraway argue that within the humanized birth move ment, the masculine biopower that proponents seek to resist has instead been replaced by a maternal form of biopower that similarly restrains women. That is, women have fled the hospital, escaped the \"medical gaze,\" rejected obstetric violence embedded in patriarchal biomedical systems, and have recast the home as a space not of subordination, but of freedom. And yet, these very women are entangled in a social support system whose fabric is interwoven with definitions of what represents a correct and ideal birth. I challenge uncritical notions of women's liberation through humanized birth by pointing to how its social networks can lead to the subordination of participants to a new regime of requirements for a glorified, moralized motherhood \u2014an ideal which i s only sometimes achieved, and may thus results in feelings of failure and insufficiency. Underneath the battles to resist male -dominant capitalism and women's sexual appropriation \"in a mascul inist orgy of war\" (Haraway 1990: 154, referring to Sofia 1984) is, still, matrix of women's dominations of ea ch other\" (Haraway 1990 : 155). While a movement among Mexican and Latin American women to move beyond the textual politics of science and technology to something even more radical ( el recobrar el poder de las mujeres, taking back the power of women through ownership of nature, thus \"seizing the tools to mark the world that mar ked them as other\" [Haraway 1990 : 175]) would seem like a cyborg project of the twenty -first century, humanized birth does not sati sfy Haraway's utopic vision of \"a politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created by indu strial capitalism\" (Haraway 1990 : 161). The moralized, feminized, \"whitening\" humanized birth which these feminists of color practice is not what Haraway imagined when she wrote that cyborgs are \"suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing,\" (Haraway 1990 : 181), but I suppor t Harawa y's suggestion regarding the utility of suspicion. H umanized birth points not only to how science and technology provide fresh sources of power, but how New Age, \"traditional,\" and \"holistic\" therapies also require fresh sources of analysis and political action (see Haraway 1990 and Latour 1984). In conclusion, I point to what the authorship of reproduction as a discursive field does, and what te nsions it reveals or conceals. R esearch on reproduction is an important place to begin untangling the p olitics of representation and uncovering the relationship between gnoseological creativity and social and geopol itical power. I have argued that couples from the global professional class (Spivak 2003: 618) accrue cultural capital through participation in a \"whitening\" transnational meritocracy that dictates gendered parenting trends. What the term \"meritocracy\" obscures is the class -logic upon which the criteria for \"good parenting\" is based. Cultural capital masks economic capital, naturalizing the idea that \"good parents\" can and do spend large sums of money on their children. Thus, the very notion of \"meritocracy\" perpetuates and reinscribes socioeconomic inequality. In the next chapter, I explore the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and t he (re)production of socially -defined racial categories. 58 RACIAL I(NTER)DENTIFICATION Chapter Four A common theme emerged throughout my fieldwork: the \"othering\" of \"them.\" Who is \"el otro\" During in -depth interviews, more affluent informan ts were sometimes deeply critical of the things \"they\" do. Over time, I reflected on why criticisms were not offered about \"us Mexicans\" and the things \"we\" do. Who were informants referring to? While at times it was clear from the context of the convers ation that \"they\" were indigenous people, at other times, \"they\" encapsulated marginalized people in Mexico more generally: urban poor, rural farmers, the uneducated, and recipients of government aid or public services (often indigenous women) . After sever al years of living in Mexico, I realized that the disparity between those who form the powerful elite and those who struggle to make ends meet at the margins of Mexican society follows a color gradient. Upon turning on the television any given evening, vi ewers can observe the difference between the fair -skinned actors and actresses on the screen and average men and women on the street. If a darker -skinned actor or actress appears in a telenovela, it is likely that he or she is playing the role of a servant . Whiteness continues to be an ideal in Mexico, but unlike some Asian and Middle Eastern countries where skin creams and sun protection are used to physically whiten skin, whiteness in Mexico emphasizes extra -phenotypical factors, almost masking the effort invested into individual portrayals of whiteness, and the sustained role of \"race\" and racism in everyday life. Education, habitus, socioeconomic status, and cultural and social capital are all variables in the calculus of whiteness. The racial judgments that are made about self and others using complex, interlacing social and physiological criteria are what I call \"racial i(nter)dentification.\" It is through this construction of self through contrast to others that acid remarks aimed at \"them\" were rarely explicitly racists. Racial i(nter)dentification emphasizes how racial identification of self and others is necessarily a syncretic process. In this chapter, I use contrasting ethnographic examples from San Miguel and the Nahua High Mountains of Veracruz to provide texture to the concept of racial i(nter)dentification and thus explore how \"racism\" operates through processes of differentiation. The Exclusion of Racialized Locals in \"Gringolandia\" After the initial enchantment of San Miguel's cobble -stoned streets, vibrant -hued buildings, baroque cathedral, mariachis, and officers on horseback subsided, I began thinking more carefully about the unequal politics of transnationalism and identity embedded within my chosen ethnographic \"field.\" I noticed that in San Miguel, the rebozo -cloaked women clutching mud-streaked babies while begging in the street all have indigenous features. Brown -skinned primary school -aged children wander in and out of local businesses during school hours, begging and demanding alms ( employing the form of conjugation used for giving an order), their practiced \"needy\" expressions and aggressive tones elicit feelings of discomfort and guilt, effectively luring coins from the hands of many unaccustomed visitors and foreigners. Meanwhile, on weekends the town center is flooded with tourists and wedding guests from bigger cities \u2014many of who flock to the local Starbucks, converting the international coffee chain into a bustling and noisy hot spot. On Saturdays, the parish on the main square h osts a wedding every half an hour \u2014the beautiful fair -skinned women gather near the zocalo to take photos in their elegant beaded gowns. 59 I spoke to Flor, a CASA midwifery student at the time, and an informant who has evolved into an extraordinary friend. Sh e told me that in San Miguel, there are invisible walls \u2014 spaces she cannot access \u2014these are the unspoken rules of inclusion and exclusion for lower - class Mexican women. Having only begun to think about gendered racialization processes, I didn't fully unders tand her meaning and ini tially I was incredulou s. How could this be if I had never encountered any obstacles moving through numerous spaces in San Miguel ? Panoramic views of San Miguel de Allende 60 As a brown -skinned woman, I was still thinking of raci sm in terms of phenotype instead of considering how racial i(nter)dentification works to make judgments about individuals' positionality in society based on complex criteria that include and supersede phenotype. I could not understand how Flor, a woman who is significantly fairer than I, would be discriminated against but not me. Having initiated my ethnographic fieldwork only several months before, I had not yet arrived at that hyper -self-reflexive moment that anthropological work on inequality requires. I still did not understand how my affluence was written on my body \u2014wrapped up in my tone of voice, exuded in my gestures, written in my face -forward gaze, and embedded in my everyday ways of engaging with others. Over time I was able to shed many of these v isible markers that had up until then been invisible to me. For now, I still had much to learn. Flor looked at me in the eyes and said, \"Of course you've never been discriminated against! Because you are you, Rosalynn! I could never go into Starbucks.\" I c hallenged her. Could she demonstrate to me how this racial i(nter)dentification was operating at Starbucks? She proposed that we do an experiment: we would go to Starbucks and attempt to use the bathroom. I was to remain silent, submissively by her side. S he explained that while young people with fair skin and large pocketbooks are invited to loiter at Starbucks (sometimes without making a purchase), lower -class Mexicans are interrogated and often barred from the premises. We would inevitably be turned away . We approached the Starbucks entrance nonchalantly, hoping to blend in with the constant flow of young iPhone -carrying patrons on this busy weekend and to cross the threshold into the courtyard. (Starbucks is located in a former hacienda that now houses a number of boutiques and art galleries. There is a bathroom in the courtyard for anyone visiting Starbucks or the neighboring stores. In actuality, these bathrooms are considered \"public\" to anyone who possesses the right amount of cultural capital \u2014but not for everyone, I was about to find out.) The guard stopped us. Where were we going? Flor answered, \"We had a coffee here this morning. We'd like to use the bathroom.\" He asked to see our receipt, stating that we could not come into the building without a s ales receipt. She responded, \"I threw it away after we left. I'm pregnant and the pressure of the baby on my bladder is causing me a bathroom emergency!\" She patted her plump belly to emphasize her words. The guard was unmoved: \"If you don't have a receipt you can't come in.\" Flor retorted, \"If you don't let me in, I'm going to pee in my pants!\" The guard responded, \"Then pee in your pants. You can't come in.\" While it may seem that Flor was barred from the premises because of her lower -class standing and not due to being identified as a racialized \"Other,\" throughout this chapter I present race in Mexico as a complex algorithm which orders social hierarchies based on criteria that extends far beyond biology, genetics, and phenotype to also include class, e ducation, national identity, and other forms of cultural capital. I offer racial i(nter)dentification as a tool for analyzing the multiple variables contributing to the immediate, often unconscious, mental calculus that occurs during quotidian encounters o f difference. Racial i(nter)dentification goes beyond \"racial profiling\" by discarding U.S. racial politics as the frame of reference, taking transnational encounters as the lens for analysis, examining social interaction in \"internal borderlands\" like San Miguel where both colonial legacy and contemporary international relations are woven into the fabric of everyday life, and explicitly attending to the amalgam of non-biologic elements that are folded into notions of \"race.\" 61 Flor and a fellow professio nal midwifery student, with a baby whose birth she attended. 62 About a year later, I spoke to my landlady, Pati, about the gendered racialization processes that were occurring around me. Pati had recently broken up with her common -law husband, with whom she had two children, due to his relapse into alcoholism. I lived in a small room above their living quarters and paid about $120 dollars monthly in rent, utilities included. Over time, we became close friends, and she shared plenty of her heartaches with me. One evening, we were sitting in the kitchen, chatting, when she told me that as a housekeeper it would behoove her to improve her conversation skills in English and thus be able to communicate with her American employers. When I offered to help her, Pati e xplained to me that she had already attempted to sign up for a language exchange program at the Public Library but was refused. (The Public Library, Biblioteca P\u00fablica, in San Miguel is actually an NGO funded by donations from foreigners \u2014the Municipal Libr ary, which pales in comparison, is located around the corner and is unknown to the majority of Sanmiguelenses. The Public Library traces its origins to 1954, when Mrs. Helen Ware set out to provide access to educational and reading materials for Mexican ch ildren.) The language exchange program pairs American retirees and expatriates with \"local Sanmiguelenses\" so that both can improve their speaking skills in the others' native language. Pati went to the Public Library one afternoon after cleaning house an d asked to be placed on the wait list. The attendant at the desk gave her the \"once over\" and decided that she was unsuitable for the program. \"I'm sorry \u2014there are no available spots and you cannot be placed on the waiting list.\" Having already pondered t he invocation of humanitarianism during training workshops for traditional midwives that inadvertently reinforce racialized hierarchies and commodify indigenous cultures46, I wondered about the visual politics of NGO programs that seek exchange with the loc al community whilst making certain community members appear and others disappear47. Program participants that -never -were like Pati are invisible to foreign participants in the language exchange program \u2014language partners learn curated versions of \"culture\" b y conversing with each other about personal experiences \u2014therefore La Biblioteca P\u00fablica's native English -speakers will never know about Pati's desire to learn, the houses she cleans, or her home and children tucked away in a meter -wide hillside alley48. After listening to her story, I wondered if I could be \"racially misidentified\" \u2014if I could intentionally \"racially darken\" myself, and thus experience some of the discrimination my friends were experiencing. It was obvious to me that Flor and Pati's perceived class had a lot to do with how they were being treated. This was not the que stion. Rather, I was testing the degree to which perceptions of \"race\" were also influencing the mental calculus through which individuals decide how to treat other individuals. I had learned that social class is operative during moments of encounter and exclusion, but how is \"race\" collapsed within social class (and vice versa) as a marker for social categorization? I dressed myself in \"indigenous\" clothing \u2014an embroidered linen bl ouse, a long skirt, and sandals \u2014and twisted my long, black, waist -length hair into two braids. I had visited the Public Library on several prior occasions as my American 46 See my description in chapter two of the \" encuentro \" in Estaci\u00f3n Catorce between traditional midwives and medical personnel. 47 I am adapting Haraway's 1990 approach to \"tex tual politics.\" 48 I am pointing to the irony of how some forms of inequality are hidden from privileged sojourners while others are revealed and even marketed. For example, compare Pati's exclusion from the language exchange program to the emergence of \"fa vela safaris\" and other forms of touristic voyeurism of poverty and suffering. 63 self, dressed casually in T -shirts, cotton blouses, and jeans. How would this change i n dress/presentation of self alter the cordial treatment I had experienced? Upon entering the Biblioteca P\u00fa blica, I chose a table in an area with about a dozen tables and no patrons. I pulled out my copy of Hannah Arendt's book On Violence and began under lining and writing in the margins. My objective was to act as I would on any other day, so I carried on with work as usual. I could feel a library employee standing nearby staring at me, wondering what to do, but I feigned ignorance of his conundrum and co ntinued reading. A minute later an older Caucasian woman sat down a couple of tables away. The library employee spared no time approaching her table and asked her, in English, if he could prepare her something to drink from the library's caf\u00e9. She said, \"N o, not now. I'm fine, thank you.\" He then approached my table and asked me hesitantly, in Spanish, if he could offer me anything. I responded, also in Spanish, \"Not right now. Thank you.\" (By this stage in my fieldwork, my American accent was virtually und etectable, and I had mastered the art of passing for a woman born and raised in Mexico.) He then responded, \"In that case, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. This space is only for our patrons.\" At that point , I could have then spoken to him in perfec t American English , forced him to acknowledge his racist presumption, and demand he retract his statement . Perhaps this is what I should have done. B ut I felt the purpose of the experiment had been served. My intention had not been to challenge existing ra cialized hierarchies, but to conduct \"undercover\" ethnography to try to comprehend the mechanisms of inclusion/exclusion from which I had thus far been shielded. As my research progressed, a key strategy for my achieving ethnographic acuity was to learn to shed all visual markers of privilege, manage my phenotype, and experience exclusion first -hand. Furthermore, to gain the trust and respect of my lower -class Mexican informants, it was important that I live like them. I limited my spending to approximately 400 USD monthly \u2014an amount that dictated what I was able to buy at the grocery store and caused me to travel by bus and on foot instead of taking taxis. As an ethnographer committed to my craft, it was crucial for me to maintain congruence within my embodi ed experience of having limited resources.49 Throughout my ethnographic research I knew I possessed the cultural capital to stop being excluded at any moment, but it was important to me not to disrupt the experience of rejection and presumed inferiority. S o I shuffled off into the street like an \"indigenous\" woman who understands the unspoken racial code of this transnational town. While I chose subservience as a response to the library employee's racial i(nter)dentification, the racialization performed by American -led NGOs is not met without resentment from the local Mexican population and Mexican employees at these NGOs. Over the course of my research, I have realized that it is not unusual for American founders at humanized birth NGOs to be accused of ext ortion. Mexican employees and \"beneficiaries\" of NGO programs wonder about the apparent disproportion of their salaries and resources when compared to the lifestyles NGO founders lead. Throughout my research, I was often asked by individuals associated wit h the NGO how founders are able to engage in so much personal travel, leading a transnational life that includes a home in a US metropolis and an extravagant hacienda - style house in Mexico on a sprawling plot of land, among other properties. One NGO founde r explained to me how hard he has worked his entire life in the world of Public Health, with sparse 49 Over time, this embodiment led to a decline in my physical health. I lost weight, but my cholesterol sored. I was never at risk of serious or chronic illness, but I quickly le arned about the pragmatics of limited economic resources and malnutrition. 64 economic returns. His posture, phrasing, and tone of voice gave me the impression that ongoing criticism has led him to preemptively justify his actions. Up on moving to Mexico, he explained, he had the opportunity to design and build a beautiful home for the very first time. Unfortunately, the property he has amassed in Mexico has led to suspicion within the NGO he runs, and has resulted in a nasty lawsuit fr om a spiteful, disgruntled ex -employee. Some of his friends, also leaders of NGOs meant to benefit the local Mexican community, have had similar experiences. When I interviewed him, he was contemplating filming interviews of himself and his friends and put ting together a documentary about \"the do -gooders,\" what moves them, and the challenges they face. During the same trip, I interviewed a few of his current employees, and they spoke to me at length about the personal kindness of the NGO founder and the imp ortance of his advocacy efforts. Shortly thereafter, he and his wife both left Mexico, returning to their hometown in the Unit ed States. Since then, he has been supervising t he NGO transnationally, and is reinserting himself into the Mexican context. My in tention is not to minimize the altruistic intentions of individuals engaged in humanitarian work; rather, I am pointing to tension resulting from inherent inequality embedded within humanitarian encounters (Fassin 2012). From \"Race\" to Gendered Racializat ion Processes and Racial I(nter)dentification In Mexico, the category of g\u00fcero (which literally translates to \"fair -skinned\") can signal a phenotypic category, but often is indicative of a social category using socioeconomic status as a primary criterion f or inclusion. For example, the term \" g\u00fcero \" is used by shop owners to show respect for potential clients, even when the client is not fair -skinned. There is an underlying tone of subservience in this terminology, which can be traced back to Mexico's coloni al past. My work examines what I call \"racial i(nter)dentification\": the dialectical, relational, and power - laden process resulting in the construction, negotiation, negation, and (re)production of racialized identities that are operationalized transnation ally with political and economic effects. Racial i(nter)dentification can work in both directions \u2014as with examples of \"social whitening,\" the opposite can also occur. People who are fair -skinned and lacking indigenous heritage can be racialized, \"socially darkened,\" and treated as inferiors because of their limited education and lower -class standing. While others have written about biologized race and racialized biology50, my work is about the construction of social identities that allow for the manipulatio n of race. What is being racialized is not the biological body or the national body, but the moral body. Instead of deploying the concepts of \"race\" and racism, I am pointing to how racial i(nter)dentification unfolds in and through processes of gendere d racialization. That is, troughout this dissertation, I resist the reification of \"race\" and instead use ethnographic observations to critical ly analyze processes of gendered racialization. In doing so, I am taking an intersectional approach to ongoing co nversations about racialized identities to which other anthropologists \u2014 for example, Michael Montoya (2011), Marisol de la Cadena (2000 ), and Elizabeth Roberts (2012 )\u2014have greatly contributed. My approach builds upon a hefty literature on \"intersectionali ty\"\u2014the study of how dimensions of inequality co -construct one another , an intersectional way of thinking ab out the 50 See, for example, Kim Tallbear's Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science ; Jenny Reardon's Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in th e Age of Genomics ; Marcia Inhorn's Cosmopolitan Conceptions: IVF Sojourns in Global Dubai ; and Sahra Gibbon, M\u00f3nica Sans, and Ricardo Ventura Santos' Racial Identities, Genetic Ancestry, and Health in South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Urugua y . 65 problem of sameness and difference in relation to power , a foundational log ic of interlocking oppressions, and an examination of systemic do mination that overlaps sexuality, race, gender, economic class, etc . (Granzka 2014; Cohen 1997). According to Granzka, scholars of \"strong intersectionality\" (as opposed to \"weak intersectionality\") engage in constant self - reflexivity, wielding the concept as an analytic tool that critiques power and privilege, and producing counter hegemonic knowledge about marginalized and subjugated groups. Kimberle Crenshaw's analogy of the increased likelihood for injur y due to crossing traffic at an intersection elucidates how b lack wo men sometimes experience gender discrimination in a similar way to white women, other times they experience racial discrimina tion similarly to black men, and still other times they are discrimi nated against as black women \u2014 not the sum of racism and sexism, but something t hat supersedes these individual categories and cannot be described as a derivative of white women's or black men's lives. Crenshaw emphasizes gender disc rimination against women who are ready marginalized you to race and or class , and argues that while racialized women face some of the same obstacles that more elite w omen face, they also encounter obstacles that are unique to them. In this chapter, I primarily examine the \"race\" axis of intersectional forms of oppression. That is, I aim to explore the racialization aspect of gendered racialization . I am by no means elevating racialization to the most significant criteria for analysis \u2014socioeconomic class, education level, gender, geographic location, etc. are important, inte rsecting units of analysis. However, I am suggesting that analyzing racialization in this chapter will point our attention to how colonial legacies continue to shape identities. My research provides many examples of the \"class apartheid\" to which Gayatri Spivak refers \u2014the class divisions within individual nations that lead people of the same \"culture\" to live divergent realities, and the elite global professional class that is so often blind to the \"Third World subaltern\" (Spivak 2003:618). One of the aims of this dissertation is to draw attention to the complex ways class is embedded in gendered racialization processes, and vice versa, to create multivalent social categories. Among gendered individuals, o ne may ask if \"race\" is doing the work of class or i f class is doing the work of \"race.\" I will argue, \"yes,\" and \"yes.\" Racialization and class, as well as resulting categories like education level and geographic location, are mutually imbricated and compounded in people's lives. That is to say, people cannot experience their positionality in society through only one of these factors; they necessarily structure their identity and their relation ships with others through the combination of these intersectional factors.xii By placing emphasis on racialization as an analytical lens, I am questioning how a history of colonialism shapes the contemporary transnational order (see Mignolo 2000). CASA: Spearheading the Professionalization of Midwifery from the City of San Miguel The humanized birth move ment in Mexico at once references state and national geopolitical boundaries, while referring to ideology, birth practices, policy, and proven results from abroad. The movement points to the effectiveness of midwifery in reducing maternal mortality in Mal aysia and Sri Lanka, as well as the sustained low infant mortality rates in Switzerland and Holland, where midwifery holds a priviledged status and is widely respected as the best and safest way to give birth. Importantly, CASA's donor network is largely based in the United States, and a significant portion of its members (from co -founders to directors and even students) are transnationals. 66 CASA is a physical and metaphysical space that forms connections between peoples and social groups that are not b ased upon propinquity. Urry writes, \"There are multiple forms of 'imagined presence' occurring through objects, people, information and images traveling, carrying connections across, and into, multiple other social spaces\" (Urry 2 007:47). CASA forms a ne twork connecting 70,000 foreign donors and thousands of poor Mexican recipients. Furthermore, CASA is tied to many corporations in the United States through financial contributions \u2014over 40 percent of their donations come from American corporations51. The community CASA forms through multiple forms of connectedness is \"real\" due to its financial impact, but it is \"fictitious\" in the sense that donors and recipients do not share a lived reality. This fluid community evidences that, in addition to the corpor eal travel of midwifery students and CASA administrators and affiliates, CASA is a site of physical movement of objects (money and other resources), imaginative travel through multiple print and visual media (for example, in pamphlets and solicitations for donations), and communicative travel through person -to-person messages (via email, texts, letters, telephone and fax).52 CASA is an \"assembly of humans, objects, technologies and scripts that contingently produce[s] durability and stability and CASA's positionality within San Miguel de Allende, a transnational site of circulation and unrelenting movement, make the professional midwifery model of care mobile \u2014so much so that in September 2011, the Ministry of Pub lic Health and Population in Haiti and the Mexican Subministry of Health Prevention and Promotion agreed to send two to four Haitian women to learn professional midwifery at CASA, in order to reproduce CASA's model in their home country53. On the subject of mobility, Urry writes, \"Individuals thus exist beyond their private bodies, leaving traces of their selves in space ... These changes involve novel, extensive and flickering combinations of presence and absence of peoples\" (Urry 2007:15 -16). The heighten ed mobility and perpetual travel of CASA employees and volunteers form a network across North America and the world, thus opening up the possibility for the spread of the professional midwifery model across spatial distance. Through these women, CASA has become a node which allows for an emerging ideology about birth and respect for women's bodies to propagate, spread, and fortify. Transnational space disregards transnational borders. By pointing to transnational space, I am emphasizing the way the hu manized birth movement is informed and shaped by forces originating beyond Mexican borders. These forces have profound effects for the way individual women experience birth at the local level. CASA and its professional midwifery model could not exist with out the City of San Miguel de Allende. San Miguel, to put it simply, is a perpetual \"contact zone.\" However, I would like to depart from this oversimplification to provide a more nuanced explanation of how San Miguel provides a fertile (but not unproblem atic) ground for the professional midwifery model of health provisioning. 51 Personal communication in March 2011 with Sagrario, General Director of CASA at the time. 52 While imaginative travel implies that the reader/viewer of print and visual media is imagining themselves in the distant location described or depicted in the media, communicative travel is a way to achieve co -presence in the midst of absence through communicative propinquity (see Larsen, Urry, and Axhausen 2006). 53 Personal correspondence with Sagrario, September 2011. Sagrario was the Advisor for Mexico' s National Center for Gender Equity and Reproductive Health, a sub -bureau of the Ministry of Health, at the time. 67 San Miguel de Allende is characterized by a large, visible population of semi -permanent resident American or Canadian retirees. (Increasingly, upper -class Mexican families and you th also flock to San Miguel on the weekends for a brief escape from their hometowns.) These senior Americans and Canadians live on a different economic and moral scale than the Mexican locals, and, thus, from the perspective of many Mexican locals, they e njoy the privileges of tourists on an ongoing basis. Urry, referring to Baumann, writes, \"The tourists 'pay for their freedom; the right to disregard native concerns and feelings, the right to spin their own web of meanings ... The world is the tourist's oy ster ... to be lived pleasurably and thus given meaning' (Baumann 1993:241). Both vagabonds and tourists move through other people's spaces, they involve the separation of physical closeness from any sense of moral proximity and they set standards for happ iness\" (Baumann 1993:243: Urry 2007:33). While I confess that Baumann's assessment is rather harsh, it is true that in San Miguel two distinct worlds exist: the world accessible to most American and Canadian long -term residents, and the world in which man y Mexican locals struggle to survive. San Miguel is comprised of two distinct phenomenological landscapes \u2014two disparate realms of possibility \u2014 unfolding simultaneously. I argue that stark economic disparities (most long -term foreign residents receive pen sions or have savings in U.S. dollars, while a large portion of local Mexicans work in the service sector earning close to the minimum wage in Mexican pesos) have led to two distinct economies, making some experiences (like dining out at one of the \"mid - range\" restauraunts) unreachable for many Mexican locals. Currently, minimum wage in Mexico is 67 pesos per day (approximately 5 USD). Dinner at a \"mid -range\" restaurant would easily cost 500 -600 pesos per couple, or eight to nine days' wages. Rent for a studio apartment, equipped with American -style conveniences (furnished, with television, microwave, wifi, heating, etc.) costs around 700 USD per month, or what a Mexican local earning minimum wage would earn in 6.5 months. Entire neighborhoods and real e state developments, such as Los Frailes and Las Ventanas, are cost prohivitive to Mexican locals \u2014prices are hundreds of thousands of dollars, and often extend into the millions \u2014more than Mexican locals earning minimum wage will earn in a lifetime. In San Miguel, the percentage of Mexican families depending on near minimun wage earnings is high since the service sector is central to San Miguel's economy. On this note, Urry comments, \"Such non -places are spaces: where people coexist In this article, I place Urry's solitary contractuality in conversation with de Genova's \"pluralization of urban space that identifies transnational processes as simultaneously capable of violent disjunctures and creative ferments, both of which are disproportionately felt among the poorest people\" (de Genova 2005:123). San Miguel for sojourners is touted as \"The Heart of Mexico,\" and holds the history of the M exican Revolution. Furthermore, in October 2013, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler Magazine Reader's Choice Awards identified San Miguel to be the #1 city world -wide, citing \"great atmosphere, excellent restaurants, culture and ambiance galore.\" However, San Miguel fo r Mexican locals is sometimes characterized by one word: \"Gringolandia.\" Over the course of my research, I have recognize the \"reverse discrimination\" my native - Sanmiguelense informants described as a result of San Miguel's fragmentation and the pressure of solitary contractuality (Aug\u00e9 1995:94). Due to San Miguel's division into two parallel but mutually exclusive worlds \u2014for many Mexican locals, San Miguel is not always experienced as an authentic place. Urry writes, 68 \"Cities are becoming ... less places of specific dwellingness and more organized in and through diverse mobilities and the regulation of those multiple mobilities.... These are the new global order, points of entry into a world of apparent hypermobility, time -space compression and distanciatio n, and the contested placing of people\" (Urry 2007:148 - 149). In San Miguel, services such as bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, casinos, and gyms have emerged to impress and entertain visitors and \"foreign\" residents. San Miguel memoria lizes movement and circulation, but the idyllic resort town that foreigners enjoy eclipses the difficult reality many Mexican locals face. Often, Mexican locals live in the shadows of American and Canadian proximate strangers, and this experience has prof ound consequences for their individual psyches. I told Sagrario , \"I imagine that always seeing so many services intended for Americans that locals will never be able to afford affects locals' self - esteem.\" Sagrario responded, \"And we are so aware of it!\" Some argue that San Miguel has become so touristy that it caters almost entirely to foreigners and upper -class Mexican visitors, to the detriment of the Mexican people. These frustrations are \"backstage\" while San Miguel is \"on performance\" on the globa l stage. Urry writes that notions of certain tourist destinations are \"not fixed and given but on the move, traveling the world via the media, the internet and the World -Wide Web, or packed away in suitcases of informal commercial importers, music pirates and drug dealers. There is no given original paradise on these paradise islands\" (Urry 2007:58). While San Miguel is not an island, it is considered an enclave \u2014admist threats of kidnapping and narco trafficking in many regions across the Mexican landscap e, San Miguel is touted as a safe place for English -speaking retirees to stay and enjoy themselves for extended periods of time. From my perspective as someone who has resided in San Miguel for several years, San Miguel is eerily reminiscent of Jamaica K incaid's Antigua in A Small Place . The beauty of its cobblestoned streets and colorful colonial buildings is undeniable. However, like the Antiguans of A Small Place, Mexican Sanmiguelenses experience discrimination and corruption as part of their everyday lives. Kincaid describes the colonial possession of Antigua by Great Britain and how this resulted in the subservience of Antigua to England and English culture. Claudio Lomnitz -Adler (2005), de Zavala (1976), and Su\u00e1rez -Orozco and P\u00e1ez (2009) all point to the eclipse of European dominance and the simultaneous ascendency of the United States to the post of hegemonic world power as key to how Latin American countries experience the United States. In Mexico, fear of cultural degeneration in the face of ub iquitous U.S. cultural influence is paired with the \"sneaking admiration\" of U.S. -style modernity. Fitzgerald (2009) points to the plethora of U.S. styles, slogans, and media images that cross into Mexico, and how U.S. styles function as a sort of social c apital \u2014a marker of modernity. Not only are U.S. styles imported into Mexico, the United States also influences the way Mexican traditions are celebrated and represented \u2014certain aspects of Mexican culture are stylized for foreign observers. In Skulls to the Living, Bread to the Dead (2006), Stanley Brandes discusses how the Day of the Dead has become a kind of cultural capital used to attract tourism, and benefits the economic, political, and social well -being of towns and the national state. In San Miguel, this cultural capital is exercised constantly \u2014a multitude of holidays lead to \"traditional\" parades, fireworks, and celebrations almost every week. When Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n inaugurated Rosewood San Miguel, a landmark resort, in March 2011, the spectacularization of inauguration was for the benefit of 69 potential tourists to San Miguel. There was the sense that the whole world was watching \u2014and Mexican locals were watching t oo, but their gaze was not of consequence since they could never hope t o step inside the front doors of Rosewood San Miguel (except as receptionists, waiters, and housekeepers). Ironically enough, Rosewood San Miguel's philosophy is \"a sense of place.\" For many Mexican locals, entire zones of San Miguel are characterized by a lurking, and not easily ignored, sense of placelessness. In the presence of so many luxuries that locals can never take part of, except from the position of service workers, locals feel displaced. While I purposefully resist Urry's notion of \"non -place\" and the total lack of agency it implies, I emphasize that San Miguel is simultaneously a site of belonging and dispossession. Pleasant images of San Miguel can be like one -way reflective glass \u2014sojourners may see diversion and relaxation in their own r eflection without seeing the Mexican service workers on the other side of the glass, while Mexican locals watch sojourners' performance of being \"leisured\" through the glass without being able to cross to the other side or see themselves in these moments o f enjoyment and ease. Urry argues that \"the performances of place often cannot be realized or there are contested performances or 'emotional geographies' of place\" (Urry 2007:261, referring to Bondi, Smith, Davidson 2005). I suggest that in San Miguel, the emotional geography is a well -kept secret, and is only momentarily revealed when specific violent acts against foreigners catch media attention. For example, San Miguel was abuzz after the murder of three elderly U.S. citizens in late January and earl y February 2011. According to CBS News, \"For decades the city of San Miguel de Allende, nestled along the mountainous region of Central Mexico, has attracted scores of Americans, Canadians and Europeans seeking to retire in the mild climate and tranquil, culturally -rich region. But in just the past three weeks, the safe haven community \u2014known for its low crime rates \u2014has been shattered by the unsolved murders of three Americans.\"54 More recently, in September 2013, a 72 -year-old Canadian woman was bludgeon ed to death in her home55, causing many foreign women, especially those who live alone, to fear for their safety. It was as Urry said: \"To be a tourist is to be on the front line in places of positive affect but places that can transmute within a split seco nd into places of carnage\" (Urry 2007:270). The real San Miguel is fraught with inequality and suffering. As I've already mentioned, locals earn in pesos despite the \"dollarization\" of the local economy. Pointing to the weakened adquisitive power of man y Mexican's wages and increasing poverty, ex -presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador writes, \"Currently, the earnings per person of 70 percent of Mexicans is less than 2,680 pesos monthly\" (a mere 175 USD monthly, seeL\u00f3pez Obrador 2010:95), and explains that as a result, 41 percent of the economically active population do not earn enough to afford good nutrition (L\u00f3pez Obrador 2010:97). Many Mexican locals are displaced because it is difficult to impossible for them to find an affordable place t o live in the pricey center of their own town. I remember once being invited to the home of a well -respected medical professional (an employee at San Miguel's Seguro Popular clinic by morning and a private clinician by night) in a colonia beyond the edges of town. This man was born and raised in San Miguel, and trained at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I had 54 Keteyian, Armen. \"Mexican Murder Mystery: Three Americans Dead in Last Three Weeks.\" CBS News 15 February 2011. 2 April 2011 < http://www.cbsnews.com/8301 -31727_162 - 20032001 -10391695.html >. 55http://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2013/09/27/mexican_police_suspect_robbery_was_motive _in_brutal_beating_that_killed_canadian_artist.html 70 passed by a gleaming shopping plaza and several luxury resorts to get to his home, and when I finally found my way, I was stan ding on a dusty path in front of a 15 -feet-wide cinderblock box. A few minutes further away from the town cent er, a good friend of mine, Frida , a restaurant kitchen worker and pet sitter, lives in a small structure without electricity. I do not mean to overemphasize the deep social inequalities that separate sojourners from Mexican locals. Also, my intention is not to deny locals their agency. In pointing to the emotional geography of San Miguel, I attempt to demonstrate the disruptive features of fore ign and local juxtaposition, while also alluding to the productive possibilities of these encounters. San Miguel, a place where \"traditionality\" and ultra -modernity intermingle, is fertile ground for the production and revision of ideology, especially wit h respect to birth and respect for women's bodies. I argue that San Miguel, as a contact zone, makes the production of emergent health models possible \u2014if only through donations of American and Canadian dollars. However, I also mean to point to the carefu l and constant negotiation of CASA's work in San Miguel, specifically because of the deeply penetrating divide between people of white and brown skin. Sagrario told me that the American founder's primary role is to fundraise since she is the only one who c an. Sagrario commented, \"If our founder were not an American, but a Mexican woman, our donors would say, 'Oh, that's a nice organization,' forget about us and never donate a single dollar. We could not exist without [her].\" Perhaps her judgement is more black -and-white that reality (or should I say more white -and-brown), but the frustration she expresses points to important lapses in communication between Mexican locals and foreign donors. The Exclusion of Urban Outsiders in the Nahua High Mountains of Veracruz While in San Migu el, processes of racialization (and dollarization) distinguish Mexican locals from American and Canadian retirees, in the High Mountains of Veracruz, racialization operates to cast indigenous people as lazy and violent, especially towards women. During my first visit to Zacatochin I conducted an extended formal interview with Ferm\u00edn, the medical intern at IMSS clinic. As is the case with most rural areas in Mexico, the clinic is staffed by a nurse and a single medical intern who is required to complete a one -year internship as a graduation requirement for medical school. Over the course of the interview, I increasingly felt that Ferm\u00edn was suffering from social isolation and was eager to speak to someone about his loneliness and anx iety. He explained to me how frustrated and exhausted he felt. While he arrived at Zacatochin full of anticipation and an enthusiastic desire to help and heal, he opined that the \"cultural problems and lack of education\" have destroyed his hopeful outlook. According to Ferm\u00edn, the medical knowledge he learned in medical school are worthless when faced with the medical and social problems of rural, indigenous zones. Medical students are taught prevention, but the idea of prevention is useless given the dire living conditions and the poor mentalities of the people. His interactions with the local villagers are primarily motivated by the fact that virtually all of the villagers are IMSS Oportunidades recipients, and they are required to submit to certain medic al screenings in order to receive their Oportunidades stipends. He said that the only reason why villagers come to the clinic is because they are accustomed to state -run cash transfer programs and expect to \"receive, receive, receive,\" without any effort o n their part. As a result of the conditionality of Oportunidades cash transfers, during medical exams, his patients act as if they are there \"by force.\" 71 Fermin preparing to perform an ultrasound on an indigenous patient 72 Ferm\u00edn was struggling with the so litude of being a man from Mexico City and working in a rural clinic in an indigenous village. Nonetheless, his experience paled in comparison to the violent experiences of his female school mates. One of his classmates suggested to a female patient and h er family that she go to the hospital immediately. She filled out the transfer papers, but the family decided not to take the woman to the hospital and returned home instead. The woman died in the night, and her family blamed the doctor for not insisting and accompanying the woman to the hospital. Soon after, the intern woke up during the night when she heard the woman's bereaved husband cutting through her window screen with a machete. She was able to call for help and the man was apprehended without hav ing inflicted any harm on the intern. Conflicts like these, along with stories of attempted rape, penetrated Ferm\u00edn's perceptions of the indigenous community surrounding him. While he decided to study medicine because he longed to help people in need, thi s commitment to altruism was overshadowed by depressing judgments about indigenous villagers shortly after beginning his year -long internship. He told me, \"Here there are no values.\" He felt deflated by the gender inequity, domestic violence, sexually -transmitted disease, infidelity, and alcoholism among the villagers. He criticized Zacatochin villagers for not spending their Oportunidades money on adequate nutrition, but yet they all have cable television! Towards the end of our interview, Ferm\u00edn confesse d a secret to me. Ferm\u00edn wears a wedding ring and tells the villagers he is married when this is not the case. According to Ferm\u00edn's sham, his wife lives in Mexico City, where he went to medical school, and where he spends his weekends. In reality, Ferm\u00edn lies about being married as a strategy for preventing or at least diminishing accusations of sexual molestation from villagers. If the people in the village new he is not married, he reasoned, they would say that he only wants to perform pelvic exams becau se he wants to touch the village women. Ferm\u00edn's secret points to how men are also gendered subjects who face expectations shaping their habitus and restricting their relations with others. I wanted to measure the desperate image Ferm\u00edn painted against de scriptions of social problems from people with a different set of engagements with the community. I asked Do\u00f1a Eugenia for her opinion on the matter. Her primary concerns had to do with how women are treated and related effects on the physical and emotion al health. She told me that her own marriage was arranged and while her husband has become a friend with whom she lives in harmony, there has never been a romantic connection between them. In general, the custom of arranged marriages has given way to more \"modern\" pairings in which couples pick each other. However, this does not mean that women's choices are not restrained in other ways \u2014once married, the women's decisions can be severely restrained by her husband's family. Do\u00f1a Eugenia gave me an example of a woman \"in the next village.\" (I wonder if the woman actually lived in the next village, or whether Do\u00f1a Eugenia was attempting to anonymize one of her own fellow villagers.) She told me that after her husband died, her husband's family told her that if she ever remarried, they would take her children from her and prevent her from ever seeing her children again. In another case, Do\u00f1a Eugenia provided treatment to a woman who was badly bruised. When she insisted that the woman tell her the source of her b ruising, the woman admitted t hat her husband had been beating her. Angered, she told her patient, \"Tell him that if he want s to hit someone, he should come to my house and hit me!\" When she encountered her patient's husband in the street, she told him, \"I know what you've done, and if I ever find out about you hitting your wife again, prepare yourself, because I will report you to the authorities!\" 73 Do\u00f1a Eugenia listening to fetal sounds Do\u00f1a Eugenia during a postnatal visit with a mother whose birth sh e attended 74 The man promised never to hit his wife again, and his wife continues to reassure Do\u00f1a Eugenia that he has remained true to his word. Do\u00f1a Eugenia is the descendant of a long line of curanderas and parteras , so she commands respect within the com munity, and she uses her authority to demand non -violent treatment of the women in her village. I also interviewed Padre Filadelfo to assess his opinion of residents of Zacatochin and the surrounding communities. As the priest for twenty -eight chapels in t he zone, he has accumulated many experiences with the locals, and is often the keeper of their secrets. He told me that when he arrived to the region, he was fearful since he had never interacted with indigenous people before. Over time what he discovered, however, is that the people in these communities compose a spectrum, and like anywhere else, there are people at either extreme. Before he arrived, he explained, \"they described the place to me as being really ugly with respect to the people [who live her e]. [The villagers] fight for their rights \u2014for sure \u2014but especially when politicians deceive them to get their votes and when the time comes do not fulfill their promises. It is not violence for the sake of violence.\" According to Padre Filadelfo, the form er priest was never able to gain the communities' trust. The former priest was a guero (fair-skinned) and had a French surname. When Padre Filadelfo arrived to the zone, he made a concerted effort to treat the villagers as equals and to prove that he was d ifferent than the former priest. Padre Filadelfo has learned that, in general, the community members are primarily Nahuatl speakers and possess limited fluency in Spanish. They understand the meaning of the messages he delivers from the pulpit but are not familiar with all of the Spanish words. Padre Filadelfo is working on learning more Nahuatl so that he can better communicate with the community he serves. Instead of wishing that villagers become more like non -indigenous people living in cities, he hopes that they preserve their linguistic and cultural traditions, and considers it a \"defect\" when mothers don't dress their young daughters in traditional bata. While some mothers appreciate the time they save when their young daughters dress themselves in p ants instead of having to facilitate wrapping the bata and others consider pants to be a more practical, warmer option during the cold winter months, Padre Filadelfio frowns upon this potential loss of cultural heritage. The padre explained to me that whi le men often have to go to the cities to find employment, they tend to marry girls from their own villages, and this practice preserves the coherence of the community. That is, men have a perception of city women that is less favorable than village women w hen it comes to finding a spouse. Once married, marriages tend to last a lifetime. While marriage continues to be endogenous, he argued that gendered relationships are evolving with time. Just in the time that he has been priest in the region, he has notic ed a drop in alcoholism, and a related reduction in domestic violence. Padre Filadelfo counsels his young female parishioners to consider possibilities outside of motherhood and marriage; likewise, he urges fathers to send their daughters to school along w ith their sons. He told me with confidence that in the short time he has preached in this region, the interrelations between the villagers and within families has improved, and this is evidence of the positive effects of the church's teachings. While Padre Filadelfo described most of his communication with villagers to be effective, this had not always been the case. The first time he was invited to a baptism, he noticed that the head of the table was set with the most abundant food. Assuming that he was th e guest of honor, he sat down at the head of the table, only to be informed that that spot was meant 75 for the padrinos of the baby and was asked to choose another seat. His assumption signals the patriarchal hierarchy of the Catholic church with respect to its parishioners. While the perspectives of Ferm\u00edn, Do\u00f1a Eugenia, and Padre Filadelfo coincide in pointing to gender inequity and violence, they differ in what is presumed to be the origins of social problems. For Ferm\u00edn, the problem is cultural. He locat es the cause of social problems as emerging from the villagers themselves \u2014since their indigenous culture is the source of the social pathologies that plague the community, he is convinced that nothing can be done to improve the situation. For Do\u00f1a Eugenia, positive change is already underway. She considers herself to be an agent of change and wields her authority to command non -violent treatment of women among her fellow villagers. In her perspective, social problems are not rooted in indigenous culture \u2014rather, they are outdated remnants of the past and antithetical to a \"modern\" future. Finally, for Padre Filadelfo, indigenous culture is something to be celebrated, and he considers it his job to learn Nahuatl to overcome the language barrier instead of his parishioners obligation to learn Spanish. He also sees a positive change in the community, but the change he identifies is a result of the church's teachings and not a \"modernization\" that originates from within the community. His assumption that he was th e guest of honor at the baptism points to the potential difference between the role he feels he plays in the community and the role the villagers feel he plays. At times, his perspective takes on a missionary flavor, and he positions himself as the person that \"saves the Indians\" by enlightening their lives with the teachings of Christ. Do\u00f1a Eugenia, godmother and guest of honor at a baptismal banquet In this chapter, I have juxtaposed locals' experience of rejection and dispossession resulting from S an Miguel's tourism economy with the struggles of medical professionals and clergy to gain entrance into \"closed\" indigenous communities in the Nahua High Mountains of Veracruz. In doing so, I reiterate my argument in chapter two that seeks to balance poli tico- economic power structures with the agentive dynamism of indigenous informants. The pluri - politics of inclusion/exclusion are dependent on spatial contexts \u2014that is, definitions of \"race,\" 76 gender, and identity shaping the encounters of difference are th emselves nested in places. While gendered and racial hierarchies provide the rhetoric that naturalized the discordant experiences of individuals living in solitary contractuality and limits the realm of possibility; the underlying algorithm includes class, education, the color of one's passport (indeed, whether one possesses a passport at all), and, as I suggested in chapter three, cultural capital accrued from participation in transnational, consumption -oriented networks such as humanized birth. Why, then , have I not just argued that what is truly at stake is habitus (Bourdieu 1984)? I insist that multiple, overlapping, structural inequalities are unfolding; thus, I offer racial i(nter)dentification and intersectionality as multivalent conceptual tools bec ause I refuse to disregard the blatant visual discrepancy between servers and patrons in San Miguel, and between institutional representatives and Oportunidades recipients in the High Mountains of Veracruz. \"Race,\" gender, and class in Mexico are intimatel y imbricated, kaleidoscopic categories. Processes of gendered racialization collapse and incorporate a multitude of social factors, yet reducing these processes to a discussion of habitus would obscure apparent phenotypic gaps readily observed throughout m y ethnographic research. In the next chapter, I will deploy my kaleidoscopic notion of inequality in a cartography of \"race,\" gender, and obstetric violence. 77 A CARTOGRAPHY OF \"RACE\" AND OBSTETRIC VIOLENCE Chapter Five Nowhe re is the dynamic of othering more salient than between health providers and the people they are meant to serve. While in San Miguel, I was invited to a directors' meeting at an NGO focused on community health. The directors considered \"ignorance\" and lack of responsibility to be primary obstacles to helping community members improve their health: for example, parents who don't teach their children to eat vegetables and themselves do not eat vegetables, individuals with poor health who do not seek treatment until it is too late, adolescents who forego using contraceptives despite the availability of information about their use and effectivity, and mothers who stay home with their newborn during the first week after birth instead of having their neonates test ed for hypothyroidism during the short period when long - term consequences can still be prevented. Whether or not healthy food is available to lower - class families, insufficient infrastructure in hospitals, accessibility of contraceptives given Mexico's ca tholic underpinnings, and the benefits and limits of women's embodied knowledge were left out of the discussion. \"Ignorance\" is not only used as the explanatory variable for negative health outcomes in boardrooms \u2014elsewhere in San Miguel a woman shared a pa inful miscarriage experience with me, explaining that the nurse at the public hospital scolded her, saying, \"You should have known that you were miscarrying. It is your fault that you didn't come sooner.\" In Veracruz, health professionals blamed vaginal infections on poor hygiene, while women insisted that \"it is not the woman's fault.\" They criticized their patient population for being bad \"sanitary subjects\" (see Briggs and Mantini -Briggs 2003), placing themselves at risk, not understanding medical advi ce, and needing to be told things \"real slow.\" Throughout my fieldwork, I noticed how physicians explained their diagnoses and treatment options in \"colloquial\" terms, which often meant giving incorrect information. In turn, this was interpreted by patient s as lying and breeded distrust and avoidance of hospitals all together. Examples are telling indigenous people that an injection contains \"vitamins\" and that baby must be born quickly or it will die. In Guerrero, I sat in on a meeting between Secretary o f Health officials about incorporating professional midwives into public hospitals and rural clinics. At the conclusion of the meeting, one official summed up the Secretary of Health's progress in the area of women's reproductive health by saying that peop le in villages are \"too closed -minded,\" making it impossible for them to do their work. I visited a regional hospitals in one of the impoverished, indigenous zones that these officials are responsible for overseeing and spoke to a physician about the diffi culties he faces when treating patients. He said, simply, \"Their problem is themselves. They are their problem.\" Again and again, health professionals told me how difficult it was to work with ind\u00edgenas due to their \"distrusting\" culture. In San Luis Poto si I visited a rural hospital in a Huastec zone. The professional midwife working working there \u2014herself a person of Huastec heritage and a speaker of the T\u00e9 enek language \u2014told me that a large number of adolescents are giving birth in that hospital. Some of the birthing mothers she attends, she asserted, do not even know what body part the the baby is coming out of. \"The people around here do not know much. \" I am interested in the way this professional midwife positioned herself vis -\u00e0-vis the community in wh ich she works and in which she herself was raised. Having graduated from a professional midwifery school in another state, she no longer grouped herself with \"the people around here.\" I suggest that the implicit 78 contrast embedded in her word choice served to socially whiten her, thus distancing her from her indigenous roots, even as her \"indigeneity\" and linguistic ability (and, implicitly, her gender) serve as primary criteria for her placement in that hospital (see Matoesian 2000)xiii. Meeting between Se cretary of Health officials about professional midwifery in public hospitals Elsewhere in San Luis Potos\u00ed, I asked two professional midwives what they hypothesized to be the cause behind a curious number of birth complications and congenital abnormalities in the region. They began listing their hypotheses: Women are not educated, have poor diets and don't drink enough water, don't take folic acid, they don't seek regular prenatal care, have poor hygiene leading to vaginal infections, and perform physical l abor during pregnancy. One professional midwife said, \"The patients are uncultured . They don't come for medical examinations. Also, they lack education. A lot of women don't even know they are pregnant 32 weeks into their pregnancy.\" They went on to descri be to me how a mother was nursing her newborn in the hospital when a nurse noticed that the baby was purple and not moving and took the baby from the mother. The medical team was able to resuscitate the baby, but if it had not been for the nurse's interven tion, the baby would have died in the negligent mother's arms. After they told me this story, I joined them in the OR, where a woman was having the remnants of a miscarriage scraped from her uterus. Doors on both sides of the operating room were propped open, leaving the woman's naked genitals exposed to those passing by in the hospital corridor. 79 Congenital birth abnormalities are bla med on women being uncultured and uneducated . Anesthesiologist teaches professional midwife how to apply medication t hrough an IV drip 80 In Chiapas, I spoke to a health official about maternal deaths. He described recent cases, explaining that the first was a woman whose eclampsia was not identified opportunely because she didn't attend prenatal checkups. In a second case, he was not sure what was the cause of the woman's death, but he knew that the traditional midwife was to blame. In another case, he again was not sure to the actual cause of death, but knew that it was an uneducated woman from a rural area. Lastly, I was told about a maternal death involving a traditional midwife who belonged to a civil association of traditional midwives and had been trained by a local NGO. The traditional midwife attempted to deliver a dystocic baby and broke the baby's neck. I met with many of the traditional midwives in the civil association. They resented being charged with causing maternal mortalities when no investigation is made into the individual cases. I later spoke to a physician who sees a large number of indigenous female pa tients. He said, \"They lack the economic support to come to the health center and buy medications, but the culture of the people living in the countryside does not allow us to go to them.\" He identified indigenous peoples' traditions and lack of education as the main reasons why patients and doctors are unable to understand one another. As our conversation broached the overlap between resource scarcity and indigeneity, the doctor reflected aloud on how he chooses whom to attend next from a crowded waiting r oom. Indigenous patients are less likely to have ready and reliable access to bathing water, and he is more likely to pick someone from the waiting room who has bathed today rather than three days ago; therefore, he tends to pick indigenous patients last, causing them to wait the longest. In Michoac\u00e1n, I interviewed a leader of an NGO that advocates for women's health, especially among Purepechan women. He spoke at length about inequality and his words point to how easily indigeneity is collap sed with pover ty: \"If you ask 'a re the Purepecha discriminated against?' some people will say no. But...the majority of Purepecha would say they are routinely discriminated against and looked down upon, or refused service, or delayed service. It's common to have that kind of discrimination. Class is probably, I think, the major issue in Mexico. The disempowerment of poor people.\" While I am sensitive to the effects of colonial legacies unfolding in the present day, I resist carrying out a Fanonian or Hegelian analysis of mutual recognition (see Hegel 1977, Fanon 2008 and Villet 2011) \u2014not because I do not consider these analyses valuable, but because I recognize that many others have done illuminating work in this field, and I think it is more productive to use a n intersec tional approach to address the questions at hand instead of applying the concept of mutual recognition to a Latin American context . In this present analysis, I am positioning myself as a medical anthropologist, and more specifically, as a n intersectional scholar of the anthropology of reproduction. Thus, using intersectionality as a lens, I bring ethnographic tools and anthropological theory to bear on racial i(nter)dentification in Mexico. What can stratified reproduction (Colen 1995) tell us about race? Raza In his fieldwork on the US -Mexico border, Michael Montoya looks at the human genome as a cultural form that constitutes social and material orders. His book is not an ethnography about Mexicans, but an examination of the people who socially produce individuals as biological Latino/asxiv. While at first glance it seems he is arguing against reductionism, determinism, and geneticization, his work turns out to be even more subversive. I share with Gravelee the desire to push beyond discussions that reite rate that race is a social construct about which biology can tell us little. While true, this insight closes 81 rather than opens the conceptual terrain about race and how it relates to biology.... I find it more productive, more faithful to my field encounter s, to resist dualistic side -taking of biology versus society in examining the diabetes enterprise. [Montoya 2011:30] Likewise, my argument is not about deciding whether \"race\" is essentially biological or primarily a social construct \u2014rather, I am concerne d with how a history of colonialism in Mexico has resulted in the lingering concept of \"race,\" thus opening a space for racialization processes which lead to the consumption of \"culture\" and the production of differential (\"race\" -infused) identitiesxv. While I resist reducing race to a matter of biology, biological race is used to define the right and wrong types of reproduction, which in turn shapes policy and practice both nationally and transnationally (see Roberts 2012). While medical anthropologists h ave extensively studied these effects in the realms of international population policy and migration56; and have analyzed how nineteenth and twentieth -century battles about slavery, miscegenation, immigration, population control, and eugenics resulted in th e categorization of people into fit and unfit reproducers57; my work addresses Brubaker and Dillaway's call to, \"conduct comparative research on the subjective experiences of pregnant and birthing women at multiple social locations and multiple contexts, as well the experience and perspectives of midwives and medical providers in order to provide a more critical and meaningful analysis of the complicated intersections of ideology, politics, practice and bodily experience\" (Brubaker and Dillaway 2009). My wo rk holds several of Elizabeth Roberts' concepts under one lens in order to then engage binational literature on citizenship and interculturality. I employ Robert's notion of raza and provide ethnographic examples of how \"reproductive governance\" is applied to the supposedly hyper -fertile indigenous women while whitening is sought through private medical care by educated, urban women. In doing so, my work is informed by a binational discourse critiquing public health systems in Latin America58. Roberts write s about how, in Ecuardor, middle -class and increasing numbers of working - class women eagerly pay to be scarred (Roberts 2012). Cesarean sections carried out in private clinics serve as a physical mark identifying women as superior to the indignities of de valued public medical services. Thus, women pay to have their bodies cut since this tranforms them into more desireable, whiter beings. Women are not seeking citizenship, since in Ecuador, citizenship in the medical realm is denigrated .59 Instead, the sca r evidences the woman's ability to stand apart from the governed masses who need to make citizenship claims to state institutions for social services (surveillance Gordon 1988; Foucault 1990). These scars enact a racialized relationship to the nation and effectively whiten women since browner bodies are cast as able to withstand vaginal birth within public maternity care. As an intersectional scholar, my reading of Roberts' work is that cesarean scars also mark women seeking privatized care as women . That is, 56 See Fraser 1995, Goldade 2007, Morgan and Roberts 2012, and Pas higian 2009. 57 See Douglass 2005, Horn 1994, Nouzeilles 2003, and Stepan 1991. 58 See and Waitzkin's 2000, 2011. 59 On the relationship between the body and political status, especia lly with regards to neoliberal economic transformations, Roberts references Biehl 2005; Briggs and Mantini -Briggs 2003; Petryna 2002; Rose and Novas 2005. 82 the cesarean scar serves as an embodied intersection of superior race, higher class, and feminized gender. Roberts concentrates on the constitution of race, especially whiteness, through the \"crucial economic and moral significance of care relations, in which life chances are forged,\" (Biehl and Eskerod 2007: 110). Even though the collective goal of blancamiento is not often spoken about through the idiom of whitening, it is sought through practices of education, clothing, language, and occupation60 and is reinscribed within private gynecological care. By including medical care as another means to mark and transform race, Roberts is calling our attention to the malleability of material reality, and thus provincializes North American tendencies to mark a divide between nature and culture, and assumptions about the universality and fixity of biological processes (Haraway 1991; Latour 1993; Mol 2002; Lock and Nguyen 2010). While in North America race is understood as inherent to the person, despite schol ars' emphasis on how race is constructed and performed (Hartigan 2010), the materiality of raza in the Andes is malleable61 and can be changed through changes in body and comportment. Raza is a \"political economy of the body\" (Lancaster 1992) \u2014not a ahistor ical, unchanging interiority. She writes, \"In Ecuador, medical care makes race\" (Roberts 2012:217). In this context, public health services were developed to intervene upon poor and indigenous populations, and especially hyperfertile indigenous women62. Thus, while raza is more pliant, plastic, and cultivatable in the Andes than in North America, it is still used to justify inequality. Similarly, de la Cadena points to how raza is shaped by employment, locale, dress, class, levels of \"decencia,\" and sexua l conduct (Cadena 2000). De la Cadena explains how pervasive racism in Peru is erased, using a rhetoric of cultural difference: \"These exculpations of racism are embedded in a definition of race rhetorically silenced by the historical subordination of phen otype to culture as a marker of difference. In other words, Peruvians think their discriminatory practices are not racist because they do not connote innate biological differences, but cultural ones\" (de la Cadena 2000:2). For de la Cadena, cultures are ve ssels of immanent inequalities, leading to the mystification of racial discrimination and \"racism without race.\" Culture is achievable, and categories such as Indians and mestizos emerge from interactions and not from evolution. One's phenotype can be subo rdinated to one's intelligence and morality if these have been corrected by \"education.\" Thus, a brown - skinned individual who is sufficiently educated can become \"socially wh ite\" (see Bashkow 2006). With respect to the Mexican context, I do not deny assoc iation s between phenotype and how people are identified as racialized beings; however , I expressly resist the idea of \"race\" as phenotype , and signal how \"social whitening\" is sometimes achieved through the accumulation of cultural capital via commodified birthing practices . Clark focuses on how educating Indians produced them as national citizens: \"By definition Indians were seen as ignorant, because it was assumed that Indians who were educated would automatically become mestizos\" (Clark 1998: 230). Robe rts writes, \"Raza entangles what in North America is understood as class relations.... However, disentangling class and raza would do damage to an ethnographic understanding of care relations in Ecuador. Identifying the kinds of food ingested or care receiv ed as social markers of class, misses the way that raza is 60 See Pitt -Rivers 1973, Wade 1993, Cadena 1995, and Colloredo -Mansfeld 1998. 61 See Cadena 2000, Lei naweaver 2009, Orlove 1998, and Smith 1996. 62 SeeClark 1998 and Ewig 2010. 83 produced within economic relations. Private gynecological care cultivates female whiteness, which is simultaneously a political, economic, and physiological state\" (2012: 230). Roberts points to how creole elites in Ecuador saw the \"Indian Problem\" as a roadblock to their civilizing, modernizing, and whitening project (Larson 2004). The solution was to frame people who accept the goals of national culture as white (Stutzman 1981). Roberts argues that the saying \"money whitens\" is not about misrecognition, but about how accumulating money results in whiter relations of care, such as private medical care. Roberts is pointing to how women become whiter reproducers, not only through education and pr ofessional advancement, but through being cared for as whiter women. This care does not cease to be patriarchal since women are cared for by surgeons who cut them tenderly, like a father towards a privileged daughter, instead of public medical patients. Again, while Roberts' primary focus is \"race,\" I reiterate that \"race\" is shot through with class differences among gendered individuals. As I described in chapter two , citizenship is a fertile terrain for negotiation between indigenous women and the Mexi can government. These women are recruited into Oportunidades (a conditional cash transfer program that shapes poor indigenous women into obedient mothers and \"modern\" citizens, see Smith -Oka 2013) and required to give birth in government hospitals. While my observations at times coincided with those of Smith -Oka\u2014 some indigenous women eagerly seek biomedical attention while giving birth \u2014I interviewed many others who resist mandates due to prior experiences of racial discriminat ion. In chapter three and six , I address how citizenship fails to encompass the way privileged women are proactively constructing whiter subjectivities through natural birth in the private sector and participation in the humanized birth transnational network. These very different en gagements with medical care undermine ubiquitous arguments for \"interculturality\" among Me xican medical anthropologists. Interculturality in Mexico aims to reduce the effects of xenophobia by incorporating indigenous cultural elements into government - provi sioned services63. In the following pages I return to how m y framing signals the inadequate attention of \"interculturality\" to gender, racial discrimination, and political economic factors . My concept of racial i(nter)dentification questions the reification of cultures upon which \"interculturality\" is premised. Deadly Consequences of Gendered Racialization When I attended a training workshop for traditional midwives given by Mexican Institute of Social Security in Zong\u00f3lica, Veracruz, I witnessed a striki ng moment when a single woman's body became a site of contestation about race, class, gender, and power. The room was divided into two glaringly distinct spaces \u2014male doctors with white coats stood in front of the room, and traditionally -dressed indigenous midwives sat in the audience. An elderly midwife, Paloma, stood up in the very last row. Paloma told a story about how the neglect of medical doctors and staff led to the unnecessary death of an indigenous woman's baby. The pregnant woman had arrived a t the hospital in active labor, and the nurses refused to attend to her. The desperate mother rushed to the restroom and gave birth to a stillborn child. The dead infant was born into 63 See my description in chapter two of how \"interculturality\" unfolds at the clinic in Capul\u00e1lpam de M\u00e9ndez, Oaxaca. My primary criticism is that traditional medicine is juxtapos ed with biomedicine, without actual integration. Also, biomedical professionals serve as the gatekeepers to traditional medical therapies, which are commodified and sold within the realm of (ethno)medical tourism. 84 the toilet. Having never been assigned a hospital bed, she left pools of blood on the hallway floor, and the nurse scolded her for making a mess and forced her to clean up the blood. Paloma ended the wrenching tale by yelling, \"I, too, could put on a white coat!\" Medical personnel teaching workshop in Zong\u00f3lica, Verac ruz The hospital director asked Paloma the name of the community worker involved in the case. When she answered him with the female, indigenous community worker's name, he nodded, as if to say, \"Ah, yes,\" and stated aloud that this community worker has b een involved in several unfortunate cases. If the community worker had succeeded in getting the birthing mother to the hospital sooner, he suggested, the case would not have ended tragically. He promised Paloma that he would reprimand the community worke r. While this seemed to appease Paloma somewhat, I was less satisfied with this resolution. In a matter of seconds, the female, indigenous community worker became the scapegoat for a health system that is failing at multiple levels. The medical personne l at the hospital we re, by a sleight of hand , let off the hook. The hospital director quickly directed the workshop attendees away from this \"disruptive\" anecdote and toward other matters. However, the incident lingers in my mind. The woman's hemorrhage and the infant's life -that-never -was had been the site of contestation, but they were not the real objects of the debate. 85 Traditional midwives in attendance at the workshop This anecdote , combined with description of \"intercultural\" health care deli very in Capul\u00e1lpam de M\u00e9ndez and discussion of the politics of portraying indigenous identities in chapter two, provide ample grounds for the analysis and critique of Nazar -Beutelspacher's (2007) assertion that in Mexico, the approximation of institutional services to indigenous populations is an encounter between two cultures, and is embedded in unequal relations with respect to the value of knowledge and distinct medical practices. My ethnographic observations suggest that indigenous and mestizo cultures unfold and evolve through engagement with one another, and are, thus, co -constitute. Indigenous informants contest and shape how their medical practices are valued, at times leveraging \"indigenous\" knowledge in entrepreneurial ways. At the same time, soci al collectivities are differentially nested in geographic places and even \"racially\" segregated in clinical spaces, signaling how material disparities result from structural inequalities. The Incoherency of Oportunidades One particularly elucidative path way for understanding the relationship between the Mexican government and indigenous groups is through detailed examination of Oportunidades conditional cash transfers. Paloma acquiesced following public dispute with the hospital director in Zong\u00f3lica . How ever, throughout my research, I observed many midwives' disparate behavior in public and private realms. Traditional midwives and indigenous Oportunidades recipients 86 performed obedience in workshop settings while enacting resistance to government mandates in their daily lives. Program successes \"front stage\" (like widespread attendance to Oportunidades - mandated workshops) did not easily translate to changes in social behavior \"back stage.\" Molyneux goes as far as to argue that Oportunidades puts mothers at the service of the \"new poverty agenda\" and inadvertently exacerbates gender inequality when it holds mothers accountable for their childrens' well -being, excuses fathers of responsibility toward their offspring, and provokes marital discord (and potential ly domestic violence) by putting cash stipends in the hands of women amidst widespread unemployment of male \"providers\" (see Molyneux 2006). According to Rodrigo, a physician turned Mayan rights advocate and board member of an indigenous association in Chiapas, training workshops offered by the state are meant to reinforce inequality in existing power structures. While the Oportunidades program has been lauded within the realm of public health64, I argue that the conditionality of cash transfers evidence s differential valorization of knowledge and medical practices while also serving to extract obedience from Mexico's racialized \"others.\" From Rodrigo's perspective, \"Oportunidades is really [an example of] the dominant society practicing coercion over indigenous people.\" As an outspoken critic of biopiracy and a proponent of indigenous knowledge, he argues that while traditional midwives' resistance to biomedical methods is deemed \"backwardness\" by medical professionals, traditional midwives are not intere sted in learning new techniques because they are confident about the effectiveness of the techniques they have been using for generations. He explained that while traditional midwives may attend training programs in order to continue receiving cash transfe rs and other government - provisioned services, they often do so with no intention of changing the methods they employ in their everyday practice of midwifery. Rodrigo's assertions are supported by traditional midwives like Yanira who, during an in - depth int erview, explained that women's participation in cash transfer program s has resulted in changes to what she reveals about her p ractice to authorities, but has not altered the substance of her midwifery. That is, women who receive support from Oportunidades tell her, \"Don't give me a birth certificate. I am going to say that [I couldn't make it to the hospital in time] and gave birth alone at home. I am going to say that I was not attended by a midwife.\" However, building upon my argument in chapter two, my ethnographic research did not point to wholesale resistance. While indigenous informants often complied with Oportunidades mandates in ways that suggested engagement at the level of form instead of substance, I also observed how Oportunidades mandates stru cture the rhythm of indigenous womens' daily lives. During my first trip to Zacatochin, I joined Francisca as she completed the requirements for her two -week \"field practice.\" Among the requirements was to deliver a workshop to the villagers, educate the m about reproductive health, and document the number of attendees as a measure of her \"impact.\" Francisca went to the municipal offices to sign up to have her workshop announced throughout the village. Since there are no telecommunicative services in the village (no telephone, internet, etc.), announcements are made via an old Volkswagen Beetle 64 See, for example, Neufeld LM. The Oport unidades Program In: Preedy VR, ed. Handbook of Growth and Growth Monitoring in Health and Disease external site.) . 87 that drives slowly along the winding mountainous pathway, blasting information through a megaphone attached to the roof. The next day, Francisca and I went to the gathering place where community -wide workshops are held \u2014cement basketball courts covered by corrugated metal, built with government funds to foster \"community development.\" We waited, and no one arrived. Francisca decided to wait half an hour past the an nounced start time, and two women arrived. Disappointed in the meager turn out, Francisca half -heartedly delivered the workshop materials she had prepared, and then we walked back to our host's home. That night, Francisca reflected on the disinterest in her workshop, and she decided that if villagers were uninterested in learning information that was to their benefit, they would have to be coerced. Furthermore, she refused to return from her \"field practice\" to report that the impact of her workshop had been the delivery of educational materials to two people. The next day, while I was at the village clinic interviewing Ferm\u00edn, Francisca returned to the municipal offices to announce another workshop. This time, she identified herself as someone who was c oming to the village on behalf of the state -level Secretary of Health and that her workshop was mandated by Oportunidades. The next day, we returned to the basketball courts and prepared for the workshop. This time, over one -hundred and thirty members of t he community, mostly women, attended. At the outset of the workshop, Francisca announced that at the end of the workshop she was going to take roll by asking to see each participants' voting registration card and cataloguing each person's name. This list, according to what she told participants, was going to be reviewed by the authorities at Oportunidades to determine compliance. In this way, Francisca insured that her audience remain captive until the end of her workshop. As a professional midwifery stud ent, Francisca was trained in medical terminology, and the intention of this \"community engagement\" experience was to allow her to develop the skills necessary to practice intercultural midwifery in rural settings. Francisca's presentation of reproductive health was littered with biomedical terms that were incomprehensible to workshop attendees and she failed to explain underlying physiological properties. The workshop \"participants\" stared blankly at her during most of the workshop. At the conclusion of t he workshop, attendees lined up as Francisca took their identification cards one by one to write down their names. This anecdote clearly highlights Francisca's abuse of power, evidencing how women with relatively greater privilege can also act as agents of structural inequality against other women. Moreover, it points to how conditional cash transfer programs like Oportunidades extract obedience from women recipients on the basis of their poverty and dependency on government -provisioned stipends. When the workshop was not a requirement for continued receipt of Oportunidades stipends, community members were almost universally disinterested. Subsequently, threat to Oportunidades stipends elicited compliance from village members. During private conversations, informants have expressed their annoyance at having to their daily routines disrupted and dictated by Oportunidades mandates. One mother reported feeling like \"a ball, bouncing from one place to another.\" Instead of validating the intended positive effect s of obligatory social services, the Oportunidades recipients I interviewed pointed to their frustration with the conditionality of the cash transfers and with forced compliance. I argue that programs like Oportunidades are shaped by notions of \"intercultu rality\" that are valuable in theory, but contradictory in practice. 88 ` Workshop on sexual and reproductive health, \"required \" by Oportunidades 89 Interculturality In Mexico, \"intercul turality\" had emerged as a buzz word in government offices, academic circ les, and a few hybrid clinics to describe respect for cultural differences through the merging of traditional indigenous medicine and biomedical methods. \"Interculturality\" is explicitly mentioned as a priority in the second article of the Mexican constitu tion. The article states, \"The nation has a pluricultural composition originally sustained by indigenous peoples who are the descendants of those who inhabited the present -day territory of our country at the initiation of colonization and who preserve thei r own social, economic, cultural, and political institutions.... Awareness of their indigenous identity should be a fundamental criteria for determining whom undertakes the ruling over indigenous peoples\" (my translation). The article goes on to state that, in an effort to ameliorate the rezagos (backwardness) in indigenous communities, authorities are obligated to assure effective access to health services that make the most of traditional medicine, as well as support the nutrition of ind\u00edgenas through food programs, especially for the child population (Article 2, Section B III). Furthermore, authorities are obligated to foster the incorporation of indigenous women into development through support for productive projects, the protection of women's health, and granting incentives to boost women's education and participation in decision -making related to community life (Article 2, Section B V). I argue that notions of \"interculturality\" are ubiquitous in Mexico, and are thus woven into development programs like Oportunidades even when not explicitly stated. The Mexican government engages with its indigenous population through the (supposedly) benevolent and equitable framework of \"interculturality.\" However, I examine the textual politics65 of \"interculturality\" to uncover how this concept has been authored from positions of power as an approach to communities that are presumed inferior. The use of the word rezago in the Mexican constitution while describing various \"intercultural\" strategies points to the contrad ictory way interculturalidad in Mexico purports to equitably grant citizenship -based rights to indigenous community members while simultaneously casting indigenous people as \"backward.\" To try to understand the concept of \"interculturality\" better, I share d my observations and compared experiences with Jaime Breilh, Director of the Health Sciences at Universidad Andina Simon Bolivar. He explained to me that in Ecuador, interculturality emerged as an indigenous movement, originating from the indigenous peopl e. It has transformed not only into a political juncture, but an intellectual one as well. The people of Ecuador began applying their critical perspective to a colonial past, and the result was an epistemological and philosophical proposal for the future. In contrast, in Mexico \"interculturality\" did not originate from indigenous people; rather, it emerged as a theoretical debate in academia and bureacratic strategy in public health policy and development . My ethnographic fieldwork suggests that \"intercult urality\" is a powerful force for producing racialized subjects, arranging them hierarchically, and extendi ng the material effects of those hierarchies. I am arguing against a na\u00efve reading of interculturality \u2014a liberal formulation that creates a utopian vi sion of a world of harmonic difference that exists apart from power. That is, \"traditional\" medicine and biomedicine do not come together on a level playing field, penetrating each other equally and evenly. The expert knowledge of physicians and traditiona l medicine doctors are not equally valued, they are not equally renumerated, nor are they equally supported by healthy policy and infrastructure (see Chapter Two) . Often, when 65 see Haraway 1990. 90 \"interculturality\" is celebrated, a series of persis tent inequalities are ignore d. I am wary of how unequal power dynamics, disparate perceptions of value, and ongoing racial discrimination can potentially be masked by emphasis on \"interculturality,\" whether it be at the level of academic debate, or public health policy. When perform ing fieldwork, I spoke to a variety of people in order to think through how \"interculturality\" is put into practice. A physician turned NGO leader and traditional medicine advocate spoke to me about different \"intercultural\" clinics around the country wher e traditional medicine is \"butchered\" and decontextualized, deauthenticated techniques are applied in isolated and incoherent ways. For example, in La Riviera Maya, one hospital installed hammocks in the waiting area as a \"intercultural\" strategy, while no thing was done to make the actual delivery of health care and therapeutics more culturally appropriate. Meanwhile, efforts to develop more substantive forms of interculturality encounter obstacles when seeking funding. These obstacles stem from the fact t hat, despite the rhetoric of \"interculturality\" within policy, the legitimacy of counter -hegemonic models are severely questioned. O ne midwife, an adjunct professor at the Intercultural University of Quintana Roo, told me \"intercultural models are not resp ected at all.\" The university at which she works is part of an emerging university system that attempts to incorporate indigenous knowledge into university -level education and requires students to s tudy the M ayan language and learn about traditional medici ne alongside biomedical methods. Nonetheless, the intercultural university model struggles to be acknowledged and valued within Mexican academia . Obstetric Violence During a visit to San Luis Potos\u00ed , I stayed for a few days with Daniela, a nurse and publ ic health officer whose life work has focused on maternal mortality. She facilitated my participant observation in a large public hospital where professional midwifery is beginning to be incorporated. After hours interviewing expectant mothers in the labor and delivery area, I was invited into the delivery room to participate in a birth. When I arrived, the woman had been in the delivery room for four minutes and the baby was crowning. The young male intern attending the birth was visibly impatient, and a m inute later he performed an episiotomy, slicing through the woman's perineum with a scalpel. During the woman's next contraction the woman pushed, but the baby did not emerge. As the contraction subsided, the intern ordered the mother to continue pushing, but a nurse interjected that since the contraction had passed, it would be better for the mother to take advantage of those few brief moments to rest until the next contraction. When the obstetric team had been in the delivery room for seven minutes with t he birthing mother, the intern hastily performed another episiotomy, this time slicing the woman's vaginal opening down to her anus. He was not satisfied with the lack of apparent progress and considered using forceps to clamp the baby's head and yank it f rom the mother's womb. At this point, the attending physician popped his head into the delivery room and asked the intern to report the woman's progress. The intern suggested using forceps to deliver the baby. The attending asked how long the woman had b een in active delivery, and the intern responded \"eight minutes.\" The attending instructed the intern to wait a while longer before using forceps, since in his view, all the woman needed was a little time. The attending entered the delivery room and instr ucted the nurse to each grab one of the woman's legs and to push them back towards her body. Having audited many professional midwifery courses, I knew that this would shift the woman's pelvis, thus widening her vaginal canal, and potentially allowing the baby to be delivered with no further intervention during the 91 woman's next contraction. However, I could not anticipate what happened next. The doctor told the woman, \"I am going to help the baby be born.\" Then, he began performing the Kristeller maneuver b y jamming his fists into the woman's uterus, using all his body weight to push down sharply and repetitively. The mother began screaming, \"I can't!\" Reacting to the pain, she grabbed onto my hand and began squeezing hard. The Kristeller maneuver is an \"ext inct\" practice in the developed world because it is widely recognized to carry the risk of uterine rupture. Even in Mexico, it is considered an option of last resort. I asked the physician why we could not turn the woman over and allow her to give birth on all fours, thus widening her vaginal canal an additional two centimeters. He looked at me as if such an inane comment did not even warrant a response, but then he retorted, \"Do you think with this [delivery] table she could turn over?\" The woman was lying on a metal table with stirrups for giving birth in lithotomy position. I responded, \"No, but if it were not for the table, she could turn over and the baby could emerge more easily.\" After the baby was born, I congratulated the woman. No one else spoke to the mother, and the baby was whisked off for health assessments. This experience, among many others, is evidence to me of systematization of obstetric violence in Mexico. While physicians are also aware of systemic violence in public health care, some h ave shared their feelings of helplessness to change it. I interviewed one humanized birth obstetrician, Maricelda66, about her internship experience in a Mexican Institute of Social Security hospital. At the time, her attending told her to place intrauterin e devices during pelvic exams with or without the consent of indigenous patients. On one occasion, she reported to him that she had requested an indigenous woman's consent and was refused. The attending ordered Maricelda, \"Go get the patient and put it ins ide her!\" Maricelda had to come up with a false reason to perform a pelvic exam and illicitly placed an intrauterine device without the patient's knowledge. She ended her recounting by exclaiming, \"That's violence!\" I was left reflecting on the potentially double meaning of her assertion \u2014forced contraception is undoubtedly an act of violence against indigenous women, but what about the trauma and years of lingering culpability Maricelda has experienced? At the same time, Maricelda's life does not unfold at the intersection of racial discrimination and gender discrimination \u2014while she suffers from the emotional sequelae of her traumatic experience, as a fair -skinned woman, she would not be the victim of forced sterilization. The incident Maricelda described is not unique to obstetric internships. Camelia, the daughter of a traditional midwife and a CASA graduate, shared guilty feelings at having to practice episiotomies on women as part of her professional midwifery internship in a government hospital. As a ch ild, Camelia first learned midwifery by watching her mother attend countless episiotomy -free births and lending a helping hand when necessary. From this experience, Camelia knew that episiotomies are, at best, unnecessary procedures, and at worse, mutilati ons of normal female anatomy. When Camelia confessed to her mother that she was practicing episiotomies as part of her training, her mother began acting \"strangely\" towards her. Later that day, I traveled to her natal village to spend some time with her mo ther, Pamela, in her home. At the height of her practice as a traditional midwife, Pamela attended twenty to thirty women a month. These days, Pamela is one of two midwives who have not ceased attending births \u2014the rest have stopped practicing due to the th reat of criminal charges were an infant death to occur on their watch. Pamela takes her chances and continues to attend pregnant women who refuse to deliver at the regional hospital where personnel routinely preform episiotomy. 66 Described in further detail in chapter six. 92 Maricelda and Camelia's guil t-ridden intership experiences demonstrate that as violence is unleashed on indigenous women's bodies, it also weighs on health care providers who feel helplessly drawn into its systemic nature. Their complicity in physically violating racialized women poi nts to the powerful reach of racism and discrimination, as well as different women's positionality with respect to systemic, intersectional forms of oppression. Maricelda now considers defending women's rights a part of her job as a private practitioner. U nfortunately, I suggest that her educated, affluent patients are not the individuals who most need their rights defended. In the following chapter, I explore (im)mobility by simultaneously \"studying up\" and \"studying down;\" thus questioning the utility of the citizenship concept for capturing the disparate experiences of racialized \"others\" for whom Mexican citizenship fails to insure even the most basic medical interventions, and global bioconsumers engaged in medical migrations for (ethno)medical tourism. The area in her home that Pamela uses to attend births 93 (ETHNO)MEDICAL (IM)MOBILITIES Chapter Six In a 2011 special issue of Body and Society on Medical Migrations, Elizabeth F. S. Roberts and Nancy Scheper -Hughes describe how \"not only people and bodies \u2014surgeons, patients, handlers and body parts \u2014migrate, but also sometimes medical therapies that travel across geographical and political economic terrains are reshaped and modified in surprising ways\" (Roberts and S cheper -Hughes 2011: 3). In respo nse, I query not only the effects of migration on medical therapies, but how geographical and political economic terrains are themselves reshaped and modified in the process. Furthermore, Adriana Petryna (2009) describes how commercial medical science base d in the United States outsources and offshores clinical research trials to countries separated by vast economic and cultural differences. My investigatio n of Mexican midwifery analyzes how traditional Mexican midwifery is transformed into a series of comm odified practices that are t hen marketed in other countries, and how humanized birth techniques originating in the Global North are combined with \"traditional\" methods through a New Age logic that confounds Euro -American notions of chronology and progress67. That is to say, the humanized birth movement in Mexico provides a salient example of how transnational mobilities foster emergent traditionalities, thereby disrupting reified ontologies of time and reconfiguring how \"modernity\" is defined and desired. While others have point ed to the tension and multiple imbrications between \"the global\" and \"the local,\"68 my observations of Mexican midwifery's movement across geographic space, border crossing, and deployment led me to contemplate how \"the local\" (in th e form of traditional Mexican midwifery) is usurped by transnational individuals and marketed across the globe for economic profit. My ethnographic observations evidence how \"medical migrations are increasingly part of the very fabric of the transnational world order\" (see Thompson 2011:205). Simultaneously studying both \"up\" and \"down\" led me to ask, \"How does ethnomedical culture travel and who is able to perform a simulacrum of traditiona l culture as culture -in-motion? Conversely, what are the mechanisms that confine others to practice ethnomedicine as culture -in- place?\" Medical Migrations: From San Francisco to San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed In November 2012, while attending the American Anthropological Association (AAA) Annual Meeting at Union Square Hilton in San F rancisco, I unexpectedly received an invitation from Martha Lipton, \"water birth educator, gentle -birth guardian, and celebrity\" within humanized birth circles, to her workshop at Kabuki Hotel in Japantown as part of the Association for Prenatal and Perina tal Psychology and Health (APPPAH) Conference. Over the past five months Martha and I had exchanged several messages and discovered we had traveled to all the same places across Mexico, and, on several occasions, had missed each other by a matter of 67 My ethnographic research on the humanized birth movement offers a counter perspective to Jennifer Hirsch's observations about how \"modern\" love and marriage is sought by Mexican transnationals \"the word 'modern' implies a contrast with the traditional, a description of the way things are now in comparison to how they have been in the past.... The prestige of modernity is so omnipresent a feature of our intellectual landscape as to be invisible; it has become one of our unexamined habits of thought\" (Hirsch 2003:13). 68 For two distinct examples, see Walter Mignolo (2000) and Anna Tsing (2005). 94 days. Finally, our presence coincided in San Francisco! Not letting this opportunity pass, I briskly footed to the APPPAH Conference. At the hotel, I wandered past various vendors' tables, replete with educational books and videos, and birth -related artesian jew elry, bookmarks, postcards, etcetera, and located the workshop hall. Moments later, Martha Lipton, earrings dangling and flowered shawl streaming, burst in with a bevy of followers. Among them was David Chamberlain, renowned author of The Mind of Your New born Baby \u2014which has sold worldwide and is available in 13 languages. Martha immediately began her talk, \"Birth and Bonding: How First Hour Programming Will Shape Your Baby's Life.\" Her presentation was peppered with personal anecdotes, including a few spec ific experiences in Mexico. Drawing from her recent travels, Martha described a workshop in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon where she probed eager parents in her audience, \"If I could guarantee a self -regulating, talented, intelligent, precocious child, . . . I'm currently accepting clients.\" Judging from their reactions, Martha said, \"These parents would pay any price.\" She explained to the parents they were too late, as some of this programming already happened at birth. She also spoke of a married couple, both o bstetrici ans, who were attending gentle birth in Puerto Vallarta. \"What a wonderful place for a destination birth!\" she exclaimed. \"You could give birth and swim with the dolphins, all on the same trip!\" Martha then described ways she uses her \"celebrity status\" to leverage power when instructing directors of private hospitals in Mexico on how to properly attend births and preserve the connection between mother and newborn. She recounted her recent experience at a hospital she inaugurated as a water birth center. When she saw newborns isolated in a nursery, separated from their mothers, thus losing valuable opportunities for first -hour \"programming,\" she authoritatively demanded of the director, \"You must stop this immediately! You must take these babies t o their mothers right now! I'll wait right here!\" When her three -hour lecture concluded, Martha and I retreated to a quiet hallway where she granted me a two -hour interview, describing in rich detail how she became a humanized birth advocate. Her journey began with a search in France for Fr\u00e9deric Leboyer and Michel Odent. After a successful water birth sans physician in her own home, Martha's prenatal care OB/GYN called Child Protective Services, denouncing what he considered to be child endangerment. Whe n police arrived at her four -bedroom home with two Mercedes Benz out front, it was obvious to them this was not the typical home where abuse happens \u2014\"the total opposite of what you look for when you're looking for abuse.\" Next, Martha apprenticed with spir itual midwives and certified nurse midwives from around the globe. People began arriving from England, France, Sweden, and Norway to give birth in the Jacuzzi installed in her living room. After a trip to Russia where the Russian Orthodox Patriarch anoin ted her, Martha had a dream while dozing in the park with her baby. \"In that dream state I folded time and I saw the future.\" She envisioned a vibrational birth: A woman walks into a pyramid and descends into a pool of water, where she \"let the baby out.\" Then, the woman \"picks up the baby into the 'habitat'\" (skin to skin), walks out of the pool, and is cloaked by singing observers. When Martha awoke, she thought, \"I have to start a nonprofit organization and spread the word about water birth.\" She hired a n attorney, wrote the bylaws, and paid the fees, putting at least two million dollars of her own money into the project, which was fine, she explained, because she was married to a millionaire when the nonprofit was created. \"From that day until this one, I haven't stopped.\" She has since spread the word in 49 countries, spoken with health ministers 95 and presidents (for example, of Russia and Costa Rica), and developed projects in Germany, Denmark, and Norway. Martha suggested I meet with Larissa and Jose Felix, founders of the Mexican water birth organization Tranquilo, and entrepreneurs of Port -a-Pool. After returning to Mexico, I traveled to San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed to interview them at their home. Arriving early with no one home, I waited, admiring the ornately carved sun on their heavy wood door. Minutes later, Larissa returned in a minivan with their five -year-old daughter from Montessori school. Their little girl popped out of the van, a picture of perfection \u2014red ribbons in her hair and pretty white shoes with beading on her feet. Then I met Jose Felix \u2014together, he and Larissa made a handsome, fair -skinned couple that could pass for Anglo. The grandeur of their enormous home was impressive \u2014wood and tile floors, marble countertops, luscious couches, and fine f urniture oozed luxury. The family ate only organic, vegetarian food, and offered me chocolate -covered amaranth, nuts, and fresh fruit. Their dining room table held a wooden box with an assortment of teas and a silver hot water thermos. A Michael Kors shopp ing bag was perched on a couch armrest in their living room. There were children's toys scattered around the house and a jungle gym in the backyard; yet their baby was more interested in playing with Jose Felix's iPhone, promptly dropping it on the floor. Jose Felix did not flinch. When Larissa and Jose Felix met in New York, he was working at a stock brokerage firm and she was studying international relations at Barclay College. Both come from entrepreneurial families \u2014her family owns numerous beachfront h otels, while his owns funeral homes and crematoriums. They recounted how they were drawn to humanized birth five years ago while attending a conference in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon. Barbara Harper, Michel Odent, and David Chamberlain were in attendance \u2014\"the hu manized birth leaders of the world.\" So far, Larissa and Jose Felix have coached 30 couples in the City of San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed over the past two years. They teach relaxation and self -hypnosis strategies, and help women trust their bodies and stop fearing labor pains. While their Port -a-Pool business required a significant initial investment, it generates insufficient revenue to support their lifestyle. For them it represents a hobby that, in Larissa 's words, \"inspires me, and I have come to see it as a social responsibility. I not only feel that I have to and want to do it, but I like doing it\" (my translation). Jose Felix enthuses that water birth education fascinates him, and hopes to grasp important opportunities to present their courses to large companies a nd influential people. Couples taking their course began arriving. They are all educated, English -reading, and working professionals in the fields of real estate, mortgage assessment, law, graphic design, and human resources. When I asked what drew them to water birth, the human resource manager joked that his conjugal family's religion is water birth and Montessori school; for those who wish to marry into this family, it does not matter what else they believe, as long as their children are born by water birth and attend Montessori school. Larissa began her workshop by describing characteristics of \"tranquil birth\": no unnecessary interventions or manipulations, privacy, silence, accompaniment, freedom of movement, and freedom to eat and drink during the b irthing process. Larissa and Jose Felix's three home births were attended by Dr. Maricelda Hern\u00e1ndez Tellez, an obstetrician who \"converted\" to gentle birthing after witnessing Larissa give birth with 96 zero intervention, and now attends water births at Ho spital Lomas, a private hospital nearby69. Hoping to tour the facilities, I walked to Hospital Lomas and explained my research to the head nurse. She told me all the birthing suites were occupied and could not be viewed, but ceded to a general tour. I was q uickly flanked by two nurses assigned to guide me. I perceived from her tone of voice and gestures that she was signaling to them to guard me and ensure I did not pry. As luck would have it, both nurses enjoyed boasting about their top -notch facilities. \" This hospital is 100% private, so it's targeting a certain clientele, which is the upper -middle and upper class. It is a very exclusive hospital.\" As we toured the labor and delivery area, I complimented them on their hospital's amenities, which, truth be told, were quite impressive. This fueled them to show me the birthing suites: a regular suite, a junior suite, and a master suite \u2014complete with flat screen TVs, sofa beds, closets, full bathrooms, living rooms, second bedrooms, large balconies, refrigerato rs, and minibars. Bottled water was placed in pyramid formation on dressers, Kleenex was fashioned into shapes of fans, and ends of toilet paper rolls were folded in triangles. During my next visit to San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed a year later, I was finally able to i nterview Dr. Maricelda. Her office building appeared to be a private practice where a group of physicians work. Seeing only Dr. Maricelda's name in enormous metallic letters across a marble wall in the reception area, I realized the entire space \u2014which incl udes a multimedia room, a multipurpose classroom, a play room and jungle gym for patients' children, an exam room, and several offices \u2014was solely hers. Dr. Maricelda's receptionist led me to her \"main\" office. Dr. Maricelda with photos of the children whose births she has attended. 69 Throughout the course of my fieldwork, the analogy of religious conversion reoccurred in interviews with informants. 97 In describing her patients, Dr. Maricelda explained that since hers is a private practice, her patients are middle class and above. Their average educational level is university. Generally, the women are in their late twenti es or older, communicate via email (a distinguishing factor in Mexico), first -time mothers, and most have only one child. She tends to deliver children for couples in stable marriages, and rarely sees single mothers. My in terview with Dr. Maricelda spurr ed me to seek out other humanized birth obstetricians and inquire about their clientele. In Guadalajara, I entertained myself while waiting for an audience with a renowned humanized birth obstetrician by counting the number of iPhones being used by patrons i n the reception area: five. As I waited a little longer, I could hear different couples speaking English and French, as one of each pair was a foreigner. When I asked the obstetrician about the sociodemographics of his clientele, he explained that while hi s clients all have a high \"cultural level,\" he does not consider many of them to be wealthy. \"My patients are more cultured than rich.\" His patients have at least a bachelor's degree, while others speak five languages and have multiple postgraduate degrees . (Even a bachelor's degree is a distinguishing factor when compared to the general population in Mexico.) Commenting on the truly rich, he said, \"All of those who go to really expensive places [to give birth], it is because they have a lot of money to pay , but not enough brains to ask questions.\" In Mexico City, I asked another humanized birth obstetrician to describe his clientele and he responded that they are middle -upper and upper class. About fifty percent pay a portion of the cost of birth with heal th insurance, while the other fifty percent pay the entire price out of pocket. Nearly all of his patients have university studies, while many have earned postgraduate degrees. Most of his clients are bilingual and articulately express as a unified couple exactly what they are seeking from his humanized birth practice. Like his clientele, he himself is a transnational, holding dual US/Mexican citizenship, and is married to a Spanish woman who earned a master's degree at Duke before working for the World Wid e Fund in Washington D.C. His daughter was born in water. I interviewed several humanized birth obstetricians whose lives also included transnational experiences , including a tall, blue -eyed obstetrician/entrepreneur who studied English at UC Berkeley, me dicine at UC Irvine, and genetics in Switzerland before opening a private hospital for patients seeking \"natural\" medical alternatives. My interactions with humanized birth obstetricians, Martha Lipton, Larissa , and Jose Felix highlight how their social class and economic capital have allowed them to open nonprofit organizations and for -profit businesses through which they meet their \"social responsibility\" to promote humanized birth. While I do not deny the authenticity of these individuals' desire to impr ove the way children are born and the noble intentions behind their work, I recognize that a definitive tendency toward consumerism (and, at times, \"conspicuous consumption\" [see Veblen 2006 Ritzer 2001 ])\u2014 the idea that parent -clients would pay any pr ice for a certain type of child; that couples might plan a \"destination birth\"; the fact that hospital suites where humanized births take place resemble those of a five -star hotel; and that all the merchandise relate to humanized birth --acts as a filter, i n addition to a couple's level of education and exposure to birth in other countries, resulting in couples with a certain profile becoming members in the transnational movement for humanized birth while others are excluded. Eventually, I ended u p across the desk from Dr. Garc\u00eda , a perinatal expert whose private medical practice near Estadio Azteca includes a birthing suite with a queen -sized bed, bathroom, Jacuzzi, 98 skylight, and fountain wi th the statue of an angel.70 He spoke to me about his desire to \"give back\" \u2014as someone who received a stellar public education, he now teaches UNAM medical students for virtually no pay. (His comments led to a sense of solidarity during the interview since at the time, I was also teaching UNAM medical stude nts\u2014an invaluable and rewarding experience with little economic benefit. ) Dr. Perez' garden -view birthing suite with Jacuzzi, skylight, and fountain When I asked him to describe the women he attends, he looked into my eyes and said, \"women like you.\" He went on to say that his patients are women who hold advanced degrees in the humanities and sciences (as opposed to technical fields), are foreign or transnational, bilingual or multilingual, and who pla ce more emphasis on values than aesthetics. A year later, when I had an occasion to make a gynecological appointment, I thought back to all the obstetricians I had interviewed over the course of my ethnographic research and the one that sprung into my mind was Dr. P\u00e9rez. What this says about my own subjectivity is for the reader to decide. At the very least it signals that as much as I am committed to uncovering social mechanisms that marginalize and disenfranchise, when it comes to my own health matters, I sometimes revert to my own transnational identity, education, and privilege. Throughout the 70 I was struck by how reasonable his prices were when compared to everyone else I had interviewed (8,000 pesos for a water birth, includi ng postnatal care). The services he offers at his private practice are still inaccessible to lower -class Mexicans (across Mexico, minimum wage ranges from 61.38 to 64.76 pesos daily; 8,000 pesos represents about six -months salary) but is approximately a qu arter as expensive Paula's midwifery services (see chapter one). 99 course of my fieldwork and during the process of writing , I was careful to recognize, confront, and explore the implications of my \"complicity\" (see Kapoor 2004 ). Bioconsumption and the Limits of Citizenship Martha Lipton is the quintessential medical traveler: her combined geographic and social mobility buttress her authority as a leader in the transnational humanized birth movement. CASA has emerged as a specia l site in the transnational network for humanized birth \u2014it has earned a great deal of recognition and attracts volunteers and visitors from around the world. Some of CASA's credibility rests on the fact that it has been certified by Martha Lipton as a wate r birth center \u2014her name appears on a plaque prominently displayed in CASA's main hallway. Thus, CASA deploys the social capital of its association with someone whose privilege has allowed her to become a humanized birth \"celebrity\" and a representative of expert knowledge from the Global North. Martha's influence in the humanized birth movement unfolds across the Mexican landscape. Through followers like Larissa and Jose Felix, her teachings are spread among affluent, professional couples who, through rea ding English and French -language texts about birth practices originating in the United States and Europe, seek inclusion in a transnational community of bioconsumption. Not only couples, but humanized obstetricians and birth attendants, position themselves as transnational subjects. Couples and birth attendants encounter each other as resources for enhanced mobility within a social network that emerges outside of the realm of citizenship. Through the bioconsumption of bodily practices that associate them wi th consumers who are giving birth elsewhere, participants in the humanized birth movement lead privatized lives that render citizenship irrelevant. Throughout my research, I was struck by socioeconomic and georacial patterns distinguishing participants in the humanized birth movement from those the movement references but does not include. I argue that the concept of (im)mobility allows us to think about how some people are able to position themselves as consumers within transnational networks, while other s continue to make their lives out within the citizenship modality. Considering the intersections between (im)mobility and neoliberal consumption helps test the limits of citizenship, thus highlighting when it is an appropriate analytic, and when it ceases to describe people's behaviors and motivations. Petryna's (2002) concept of biological citizenxvi is premised on the responsibility of the nation -state to care for its citizens, and that basic health care is a citizenship -based right. I am specifically pus hing against biological citizenship by conceiving health (in this case, ethnomedicine) as a commodity instead of an entitlement. My focus on (ethno)medical migrations brings into view a transnational political order in which biological and medical practice s produce both mobile \"supranationals\" and comparatively immobile counterparts who are socially situated in ways that encourage them to seek citizenship through government provisioned services.71 Thus, I argue that the very presupposition of equality embedd ed within citizenship as a concept must be reexamined in our neoliberal age. Rose and Novas' (2008) re interpret biological citizenship when they emphasize the transnational nature of emerging citizenship projects and the partial delinking of citizenship a nd 71 In the case of traditional midwives, being \"undocumented,\" or \"without papers\" is an interesting metaphor to consider, given that they are denied entrance into the guild created by the Mexican Midwifery Association for professional midwives. 100 nation. While I find their proposal to be provocative, I am committed to matching the transnational content of my ethnography with transnational content in my theory. Thus, I bring Latin American (and especially Mexican) scholarship to bear on the conce pt of biological citizenship, thereby drawing attention to the roles consumerism, socioeconomic class, and representations originating in the Global North play in the construction of global, biological, consumption -oriented communities. In Consumers and C itizens: Globalization and Multicultural Conflicts , Nestor Garc\u00eda Canclini (2001)72 argues that while citizenship used to signify equality of abstract rights and collective participation in public democratic spaces, nowadays questions of belonging, informat ion, and representation are answered in the realm of private consumption and mass media \u2014effectively rendering citizens of the 18th century into consumers of the 20th (or 21st) century73. Signaling the decline of nations as meaningful unit of social analysis , Garc\u00eda Canclini notes how people's sense of belonging and identity is increasingly defined by participation in transnational or deterritorialized communities of consumption. Identity is now configured by consumption \u2014how much one possesses and is capable of appropriating. Thus, Garc\u00eda Canclini argues that the neoliberal conception of globalization reserves the right of being a citizen for elites. Following Charles Hale (2005), I consider neoliberalism to be a mode of global governance that has led to cons umption as a primary way the \"haves\" construct identities, leading to a regime of inclusion -exclusion that, in the case of Mexican midwifery, feeds off of the \"have nots\" in a symbolically cannibalistic or vampiric way (see Weismantel 2001, Scheper - Hughes and Wacquant 2006, and Anagnost 2006) and (re)produces uncritical notions of \"indigeneity,\" thus reinscribing inequality and disparity. In chapter two, I described how fetishized \"indigenous\" medical practices are consumed and claimed by elites, while simu ltaneously being surveilled, controlled, disciplined, and denied to indigenous people (see Billig 1999). In this chapter, I argue that while \"biological citizenship\" and \"consumer citizenship\" are useful analytical tools for some contexts, they are insuff icient for assessing the mobilities and immobilities that emerged among informants during my ethnographic research. Furthermore, (im)mobilities are not just geographic, but also reference upward mobilities. I am signaling the operative relationship between social geographies and citizenship projects. The parenthetical composition of (im)mobility is a permanent sign post for the complexity of mobilities afforded by immobility, and vice versa. Mobile Humanized Birth Practitioners and Participants, Immobile Mexican Midwives and Families After a few phone and email conv ersations with Sagrario Villareal to arrange institutional access for research performed at Center for the Adolescents of San Miguel de Allende (CASA), I traveled to San Miguel de Allende for the first time in December 2010. Sagrario later told me 72 Argentine -born anthropologist at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana in Mexico City and director of its program of studies in urban culture. 73 In a time when political campaigns are broadcasted on te levision in a way that resembles marketing, Garc\u00eda Canclini argues that individuals feel summoned as consumers, even as they are interpellated as citizens. 101 that as general director of CASA , she received an endless stream of solicitations from gringa researchers and volunteers wanting to involve themselves in CASA's work. Her answer is always the same \u2014a cordial but uninvested \"yes.\" She has found that while many foreigners expres s their desire to collaborate, their help is often ineffectual or fleeting, and may at times even be detrimental. Over time I began to understand the elements shaping Sagrario 's perspective. Unbeknownst to me, I surpassed her expectations when I followed through with my o ffer to spend four months over summer 2011 volunteering at CASA, faithfully arriving every day to perfor m video editing and translation as well as liaising with the country sales manager for Laerdal International, thereby obtaining didactic materi als for the midwifery students. In exchange, Sagrario allowed me to audit CASA's professional midwifery classes, sit in on administrative meetings, and interview all the students. By the end of summer I had perform ed at least one in -depth interview with nearly every st udent. Shortly before returning to Berkeley to commence the academic year , Sagrario granted me an in -depth interview (the first of many, deeply personal conv ersations we shared over the next several years) and told me how pleasantly surprised she was to see my sustained commitment to volunteering and carrying out research at CASA \u2014she has had experience with many eager foreigners over the years, but these exper iences had not resulted in mutual collaboration and ongoing partnership74. Her exper ience with other volunteers has not been as positive: she shared how resentful she felt when American student volunteers came to CASA, believing that they can touch and manipulate Mexican women's bodies, knowing very well that they are not trained to do so and would not be able to perform these activities in their home country. However, her fraught relationship with foreigners does not stop with entitled volunteers, but exte nds to donors as well. Sagrario expressed her frustration and exhaustion \u2014she is tired of perpetually conforming to the desires of Americans, and pleasing Americans at fundraising events. Why don't Americans living in Mexico try to adapt to Mexican standard s of living? This tension also unfolds in her daily life, outside the confines of her work post. She talked to me about the injustices she has personally suffered as a Mexican woman living in San Miguel. She explained that if she hails a taxi on any stree t in San Miguel and a white person is also hailing a taxi half a block ahead, the taxi will bypass her and pick up the white client. In that moment, Sagrario 's social and symbolic capital as general director of a renowned NGO disappears as the taxi driver makes a racialized judgment based on a centuries -long history of imperialism leading to present day socioeconomic differences between Mexico and the United States. This same phenomenon was readily admitted to me by a taxi driver \u2014he will often pass up Mexic an passengers to pick up \"gringo\" passengers instead. While he recognized that he is engaging in \"reverse -discrimination,\" for him the determining factor is who is more likely to pay a larger fare. Subsequently, Sagrario resigned from her position at CASA and accepted a contract as an adviser at the Center for Gender Equity and Reproductive Health i n Mexico City. Soon after she left CASA, the clinical and academic directorships were filled by American women. She scoffed, saying that when she was general di rector, she was careful not to hire foreigne rs for key administrative posts as, in her opinion, such an organization should be run by Mexican women 74 Sagrario emerged as a key informant throughout my fieldwork; thus, my commitment to volunteering r eflects both the importance my involvement at CASA played in accessing the transnational humanized birth network, and the deep friendship that we developed. 102 for Mexican women. Th is theme of bowing down to foreigners ha d followed her to her new job. Recently some \"g ringo people\" came to visit the Center for Gender E quity and Reproductive Health. She prepared a presentation for their visit but had no luck explaining any of the current programs to them since they didn't speak any Spanish whatsoever. They wanted to see statistics on reproductive health in the State of Puebla, so Sagrario assumes they are considering investing deve lopment funds in Puebla. In spite of the language barrier, Sagrario perceived that their intention was to show Mexicans \"the right way\" of doin g things \u2014she was very critical of this, stating that America's lacking health system produces poor health outcomes when compared to its neighboring country, Canada. While Sagrario was working in Mexico City, she returned to San Miguel often to visit her teenage and adult children. Whenever she returned to town , she invited me to her home. On one such visit, she expressed her frustration at being a \"second class citizen\" in midwifery circles when compared to foreign midwives who are not licensed to practi ce midwifery in Mexico. Several times she asked me the same rhetorical question: \"Why, why, WHY do foreign midwives come to Mexico to practice midwifery? She commented extensively on the privilege these midwives enjoy, which she argued is based entirely on their cultural capital and not actual training or skill. She offered the following anecdote to illustrate her point: Recently Sagrario attended a birth with two midwives from Europe. Although the first -time mother had been in labor for quite some time, the European midwives did not want to check her dilation. Finally, at Sagrario 's urging, they discovered that the mother was fully dilated but that the baby was not emerging due to a nuchal c ord (a t angle in the umbilical cord). Sagrario suggested that th ey administer low - dose oxytocin, but the European midwives resisted for the next several hours. The birth had to b e transferred to the hospital. Upon arrival, Sagrario asked the physician if she could administer low-dose oxytocin at four drops per minute a nd the doctor agreed. Even though Sagrario considers that many f oreign midwives are not as well trained as she is, she observes their elevated status in Mexican midwifery circles . For example, foreign midwives offer courses and workshops at high rates \u2014hundreds of pesos if the course or workshop lasts several hours , and thousands of pesos if it lasts a few days. Sagrario asserted that a Mexican midwife would never be able to charge as much \u2014she could not cha rge as much \u2014no one would come. Furthermore, Sagra rio had recently attended one of the first Mexican Midwifery Association organizational meetings, discovering that despite the Association's name, the Association is comprised almost entirely of foreign midwives, and that the majority of the women on the d irective panel are from the US and Europe. Even more offensive from Sagrario's perspective was that a panel member from Spain began her midwifery training under Sagrario's tutelage. Nonetheless, within the organizational structure of the Association , it is as if this unlicensed Spaniard is more knowledgeable about midwifery than Sagrario \u2014a possibility Sagrario deemed ludicrous. At the meeting she confronted the issue, asking why she had not been invited to participate on the directive panel. Her question w ent unanswered, and years later she is still not a participant in the directive panel. Hypothesizing to me and to herself, she said that the Mexican midwives in the organization idolize their foreign counterparts, believing that they are more knowledgeable and better trained, just because of their US and European origins. In her opinion, what was happening within the Mexican Midwifery Association was an example of neocolonialismo (neocolonialism, her term) occurring in the name of humanized birth and profess ional midwifery. Indignant, Sagrario told me that she was intent on fighting against this ongoing phenomena of doors opening for foreign women living in Mexico and slamming shut in 103 the faces of Mexican women. I asked her if I was included among the foreign women she was maligning, to which she responded that I am an exception \u2014an \"amiga\" \u2014someone who is an ally and a supporter, but who does not attempt to usurp positions of power based on my \"expert knowledge.\" Traditional Midwifery Popular Tourism? My tho ughts continued to circle around how certain women are able to construct lucrative, transnational identities as professional midwives within humanized birth networks, while others are not able. I realized that the middle - and upper -class lifestyles of tran snational midwives had not only called the attention of Mexican counterparts like Sagrario, but also resulted in these midwives being the targets of blackmail and kidnapping threats. Three years before, while performing preliminary research in La Costa Gr ande region of Guerrero, I too had been the target of kidnapping threats. As a young anthropologist doing ethnography in Mexico for the first time, I did not yet understand, nor was I able to anticipate, the sentiments my transnational, multilingual, multi racial identity provoked among the rural farmers whom I was attempting to study. After repeated phone calls demanding $40,000 and chilling remarks by the anonymous caller about my whereabouts and activities the day before, I decided to abandon La Costa Gra nde as a potential field site. I never returned. After being targeted, I began to see kidnapping and anonymous threats as symptoms of deep socioeconomic inequality, and I reflected on steps to prevent this same problem from recurring in other impoverished sites. Over the next several years, I conscientiously adapted myself to the socioeconomic level of my informants; this meant changing my habitus, the clothing I wore, and the very food I ate. One well -known professional midwife, Adeli, fled to Brazil from Veracruz after her children's private school became a target for kidnappings. W hen I heard about Adeli suddenly uprooting her family and relocating to Brazil, I wondered what factors contributed to her being identified as a target. Many of the individuals I interviewed mentioned Adeli \u2014she has discursively emerged as an important figure in the Mexican humanized birth movement, even in her physical absence. I decided to seek her out in Florian\u00f3polis, the capital city of Santa Catarina, Brazil, known for its high quality of life, unparalleled Human Development Index score among Brazilian capitals, nightlife, tourism, and dynamism. Florian\u00f3polis is a second home destination for many Argentines, North Americans, Europeans, and people from S\u00e3o Paulo ; as a result it is perhaps the \"whitest\" city in Brazil (see Bashkow 2006) . After spending a week with Adeli in her home and around Florian\u00f3polis as a participant in a workshop she held on \"Traditional Mexican Midwifery,\" I had a better understanding of the decision -making process that led her to move to Brazil and forge a new life with the three children she has with her ex -husband, a Japanese artist. Adeli is of mixed Jewish and Mexican heritage and was reared in the United States and Mexico. Her parents are writers and intellectuals. She has tight brown curls, piercing blue eyes, and the warmest of smiles. She exudes positive energy with her every word and gesture \u2014the way she carries herself signals her training in dance at UC Santa Cruz and in the Congo. Like other successful professional midwives in Mexico, she studied midwifery in Texas. I was excited to meet her, but as the workshop unfolded, I was equally intrigued by the other participants in the workshop, most of who had specifically traveled to Brazil from oth er Latin American countries to learn from Adeli. I was surprised at how fair the group was \u2014I was among the darker women 104 in the room, and although we were in Brazil, there were very few women of African descent. As we went around the room introducing oursel ves on the first morning of the workshop, Adeli commented to the group that I was the only Mexican in this workshop on \"Traditional Mexican Midwifery.\" I quickly explained to the group that perhaps I, a person of mixed ethnic heritage reared in the United States, am not the most adequate representative of Mexico. Participants at the workshop on \"Traditional Mexican Midwifery.\" I am second from the right. For most of the week, the group sat in a circle on the beach or in boats, listening to Adeli's anec dotes of births she attended and her personal reproductive experiences. Adeli is a remarkable storyteller \u2014her anecdotes highlight the spiritual and emotional elements of birthing, and are infused with symbolism and imagery. However, as the workshop transpi red, I realized that very little of what was being taught is traditional Mexican midwifery. That is to say, the techniques that Adeli discussed represent her own style of midwifery, and most are not the traditional techniques of indigenous midwives in Mexi co. For example, her workshop included New Age explanations of homeopathy and how to make tinctures from placentas and placenta art. 105 Participants on a boat to a beach restaurant where the workshop was held that day Using rebozos to manipulate the shape of the birth canal by applying pressure to the pelvis. 106 Throughout the week, I increasingly wondered if what I was observing can be more aptly described as traditional midwifery popular tourism: middle - and upper -class women from across Latin America who are not midwives but are interested enough in New Age notions of traditional midwifery, indigeneity, and going back to nature to travel internationally and spend a week on Brazilian beaches with someone who offers herself as a representative of tradit ional midwifery knowledge.75 Participants watching, filming, and photographing Adeli prepare herbal cosmetic balms. My curiosity of whether the workshop was an example of traditional midwifery popular tourism became more persistent after we went as a g roup to a spa and participated in a nighttime temascal ritual. Compared to the temascales prepared by indigenous people in Mexico for healing purposes, this temascal was decidedly mild. The temperature was not as extreme as the traditional version, the doo r was opened quite often to let participants cool off and breathe fresh air, and no flogging with fragrant herbs was involved. While I sat in the temascal dressed in a bathing suit, some of the women around me began stripping off their clothing. Ana, a you ng 75 The fact that professional midwives go unquestioned when they stake claims to traditional knowl edge, while traditional midwives are excluded from a national guild for professional midwives unless they undergo a formal course of study, speaks to the unequal power relations operating within Mexican midwifery. I will return to this topic in the conclus ion. 107 woman with dyed flaming red hair and a deep voice, laid her naked body across my lap and began touching herself, occasionally touching my arm and side. I was not certain what to do but I felt uncomfortable being fondled, so after a few minutes I reposit ioned myself, lying down on the floor in a corner. Moments later I heard her moans in the pitch black as she reached orgasm. I disappeared for a while in the darkness, listening to the sounds the others were making, and remaining inaudible to them until A deli called out my name and asked, \"Will you sing 'Amazing Grace'?\" I did, lying down, my lungs filling with hot rosemary -infused air, and my voice was stronger and throatier than ever, filling the small space with a palpable vibration. In this moment, my years of singing in church as a child lent a sense of closure to what, I would soon discover, represented an emotional journey for the other women. After the ritual was over, the women emerged, hugging and kissing each other, and crying. By the end of the night I was covered with the sweat and tears of two dozen women. I felt awkward with each embrace \u2014the feeling of other women's naked breasts pressing against my body was strange and unnerving to me. The next day, as we sat on the beach and shared our exper iences, most of the women recounted how being in the temascal had forced them to deal with old emotional traumas, and by the end of the ritual, many had let go of the fear and pain which they had been harboring. What was striking to me about t his experie nce was how the temascal ritual had been extracted from its original geographic and sociocultural contexts; usurped, transported, and manipulated for profit within Florian\u00f3polis' tourism industry; and infused with New Age meanings, which led to experiences of sexual liberation, emotional cleansing, and psychological healing among the participants that were wholly distinct from the way my indigenous informants experience the temascal . Furthermore, my own interpellation to perform \"Amazing Grace\" made me wond er about the intermingling of traditional and indigenous practices with Anglo -Christian elements. How does the New Age notion of healing allow for the mixing of concrete practices originating from disparate contexts and rooted in divergent ideologies? What are the unintended consequences of this ostensibly clean extraction of healing practices from the social milieu for which they were created? After returning to Mexico, I looked over my accounts to think ethnographically about what the sum of money I had s pent represented for the majority of Latin American women. In addition to the cost of international air travel and hotel accommodations, the base price for the workshop was $795. The participants also had to pay for passage on two boats, a fee for the tema zcal, and food. Also , during the course, participants eagerly purchased birth -related jewelry, birth manuals, music, and rebozos from Veracruz (the iconic shawl worn by \"indigenous Mexican midwives\" and a \"tool of their trade\").76 76 Rebozos are used by indigenous women in Mexico for many different activities \u2014carrying children, transporting firewood, protection from the beating sun, warmth during cool evenings \u2014 it is like a backpack, handbag, coat, and umbrella wrapped into one. While wrapping a pregnant woman in a rebozo and forcefully jerking the material can be used to jolt a misplaced fetus back into proper position (this technique is called la manteada ), during field work I observed that traditional midwives are more inclined to use controlled hand movements to manipulate the fetus' position (a type of massage called sobada ). Since la manteada is not the most prevalent technique I observed among traditional midwives, I am curious about the rebozo's \"cult status\" among humanize d birth practitioners. Upon typing \"rebozo parto\" in an internet search ( parto is the Spanish word for \"birth\"), Adeli's name appears several times on the first page, along with a doula from Mexico City who trains doulas internationally (in the United Stat es, Canada, 108 After the workshop had e nded and the other participants dispersed, I spent an extra day on the beach with Adeli and her boyfriend. I enjoyed getting to know them both outside of the workshop setting. Adeli shared with me her deeply held desire to improve women's birthing experie nces, and I observed during my week -long stay how she combines this passion with entrepreneurial spirit. Through the workshops she offers and ongoing speaking engagements, Adeli is able to provide her children with a comfortable upbringing and enjoy an aff luent Florian\u00f3polis lifestyle. However, as we spoke, her hesitance about how Mexican ethnomedicine is enacted in Florian\u00f3polis and participants' reactions arose. She identified the differences between a traditional temascal in Mexico and the less therapeut ic, more touristic version we experienced during the workshop. For participants to truly experience a level of meditative consciousness resulting in healing from psychoemotional traumas, the temascal has to be very hot, pushing participants towards their p hysical limits. Nonetheless, participants expressed deep transformative experiences during the temascal. Adeli wondered aloud of this had more to do with the social dynamic of the group than body -mind -spirit effects of the temascal. * * * Almost exactly two years after my first in -depth interview with Sagrario, I joined her on a supervisory trip of CASA graduates working in public clinics in the State of Guerrero. While the CASA model envisions training indigenous women from rural communities in professio nal midwifery so that they may return to their places of origin, practice professional midwifery among a \"vulnerable\" and \"at risk\" population, and, thus, reduce maternal mortality, I have observed that this is rarely the case . The gap between what CASA a ims to do (train indigenous women to reduce maternal mortality among indigenous women) and what actually manifests led to the inception of a pilot program in Guerrero, for which Sagrario was partly in charge, as a CASA graduate, an adviser at the Center fo r Gender Equity and Reproductive Health, and an expert on midwifery at the federal level. The program was developed to curb the trend of CASA graduates either abandoning the practice of midwifery after graduation, or solely attending births of non indigenou s women in the private sector. CASA graduates who do actively practice midwifery have gen erally avoided working in rural zones for lifestyle reasons \u2014after four years of intense study and clinical training, they generally settle in urban zones where they r eceive higher remuneration for their services and their children can get a better education. Furthermore, the distance from urban conveniences (hot water, cell phone signal, internet, food other than beans and tortillas , etc.); the feeling of isolation produced by separation from friends and family; and the slow wearing down of the soul from routinely witnessing deep social pathologies such as widespread alcoholism and normalized domestic violence have deterred CASA graduates, many of whom studied professio nal midwifery in hopes for \"a better life\" after graduation. Through the public employment of CASA graduates at rural clinics in indigenous zones across the State of Guerrero, the Mexican government aimed to outweigh d etractors to rural living with econom ic balances (i.e., a salary of 12,000 pesos per month, to be raised to 14,000 pesos in the second year of the program). While the salary the Secretary of Health offered pales in comparison to the sums foreign and transnational midwives like Paula and Monts errat earn per Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Belfast, and England), and a Chilean midwife who was a fellow participant in Adeli's workshop. 109 birth, it rivals the salary of other publicly -employed medical personnel, and is more than many Mexican midwives, professional or \"traditional,\" expect to earn. Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio Sagrario and I spent two weeks together travelin g across Guerrero, visiting and assessing CASA graduates as they provided prenatal care to indigenous women from their rural posts. On one sunny afternoon, we were lurching up a windy mountain road with our driver, a Secretary of Health worker for the Stat e of Guerrero. Sagrario and I crammed into the passenger seat of the truck since neither of us wanted to get motion sickness while sitting in the truck bed. My eyes were glued to the pavement, snaking back and forth along the mountainside . Suddenly, Sagrar io saw something off to the side of the road, and our driver halted the truck to a screeching stop. Emerging from the truck, we saw a short -statured, indigenous man \u2014bewilderment and desperation in his eyes \u2014holding the limp body of his unconscious wife. Sag rario ordered the driver to help her load the woman into the back of the truck, and she quickly grabbed a bag of IV saline solution from her purse. With the calmness and efficiency of someone with extensive clinical experience, Sagrario inserted the IV nee dle into the woman's arm as our driver jolted down the mountainside. (I later asked her why she carries IV saline solution in her purse and she told me that she is always prepared for the possibility of someday intervening in a life - threatening situation.) When Sagrario arrived with the patient, Mar\u00eda del Carmen, and her husband, Ignacio, at the closest semi -urban clinic in San Lu\u00eds Acatl\u00e1n, she was informed that while the clinic has an operating room, it does not have a surgical team to perform the procedu re Mar\u00eda del Carmen needed to stop her potentially fatal hemorrhage. During the ride to San Lu\u00eds Acatl\u00e1n, Sagrario had diagnosed the cause of Mar\u00eda del Carmen's hemorrhage as miscarriage of an unknown pregnancy. Unable to access the necessary treatment in San Lu\u00eds Acatl\u00e1n, Sagrario decided to take Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio to the closest urban hospital in Ometepec. Three hours after seeing the couple on the side of the road, Sagrario finally left them with hospital personnel, who were already initiating surgical management of Mar\u00eda del Carmen's acute uterine bleeding. During the long car ride from the winding road we found the couple to San Lu\u00eds Acatl\u00e1n and then on to Ometepec, Sagrario asked Mar\u00eda del Carmen if she wanted to have any more children. Mar\u00eda del Carmen answered no, and Sagrario sought her consent for tubal ligation, explaining that this would prevent any similar complication from happening in the future. Mar\u00eda del Carmen consented, and Sagrario passed this information along to hospital staff, asking that they perform the ligation in addition to the surgical management of Mar\u00eda del Carmen's hemorrhage. Sagrario and I then took Ignacio to the Health Jurisdiction Offices in Ometepec to meet with the head administrator and discuss the case with h im. I watched the encounter with the administrator unfold, as Sagrario insisted that the administrator personally look after Mar\u00eda del Carmen's case, and as Ignacio slouched and stared sheepishly at the floor. Instead of locating the origin of the problem in Mar\u00eda del Carmen's biology or in inadequate health resources and infrastructure in rural indigenous zones , the administrator complained about how difficult it is to provide health care to \"gente ind\u00edgena por su cultura\" (indigenous people because of the ir culture). The administrator made harsh and discriminatory comments as if Ignacio were not present in the room \u2014as if Ignacio did not even exist. Ignacio's facial expression never changed; he continued to stare at the floor until Sagrario and I signaled t o him that it was time to leave. The next day, we returned to check on Mar\u00eda del Carmen, who was already being prepared for discharge. She had not received a tubal ligation. One staff member said that the 110 operating room was not suitable for such a surgery due to a recent earthquake (the earthquake occurred two and a half months before), while another staff member indicated that the problem was actually blood. If they performed the tubal ligation, Mar\u00eda del Carmen would have to be administered at least one pack of blood, but the blood bank's policy is to refuse blood to any patient whose family cannot replace the same amount of blood on the patient's behalf. Since Ignacio was assumed to be anemic like the majority of indigenous people in the region, he was not a candidate for blood donation, thus precluding Mar\u00eda del Carmen from receiving blood or a tubal ligation. From left to right: Sagrario, Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio Sagrario's blood began to boil. She was visibly angered by this news, and she stor med down the hospital corridors until she found the chief of staff and demanded that Mar\u00eda del Carmen be given a tubal ligation immediately. She insisted, telling him that he knew perfectly well that if they missed the opportunity to ligate, the patient wo uld not return and would likely have more children, in addition to potentially suffering another hemorrhage in the future. The chief acquiesced, and we left the hospital...for that day. * * * The next day, we drove to a small village tucked deeply into the Guerrero countryside. To get there, we had to ford four streams and small rivers, holding our breath while hoping that the water would not rush into the cabin of the truck or damage the truck's engine. Then came the biggest challenge: driving along a fain t mountainside path that withered away until we found 111 ourselves on a narrow ledge. The truck crept forward, cautiously, slowly...and then it happened. One of the wheels had slipped over the edge cliff, and for a second we were suspended, balancing in the air , throwing our weight toward the side of the mountain. The driver put his foot on the gas and the wheels spun until the truck climbed back to safety. When we finally arrived to the tiny hidden village, we were famished. Perhaps our brush with death had un consciously motivated us to fill our stomachs with whatever sustenance we could find. Arriving at a villager's house, we were welcomed into her kitchen (the area in her cabin around the fire she uses to cook) and promptly served chipilis (a weed that grows abundantly in the area, and a source of free food) in clear broth (I suspect that the broth was made from water and salt instead of meat or bones). Unboiled water is undrinkable in the area, so we all accepted Coca Cola. After satisfying our bellies, we paid the woman for the food and began a long trudge up the hill to visit a first -time pregnant woman. When we arrived to an adobe house at the top of the hill, we asked for Ver\u00f3nica, but Ver\u00f3nica's father -in-law emerged. He asked us to explain our business with Ver\u00f3nica, and when Sagrario explained that she wanted to perform a follow -up prenatal exam since Ver\u00f3nica had been totally absent from the San Lu\u00eds Acatl\u00e1n clinic, the father -in-law cocked his head to the side, considering Sagrario's proposition, bef ore heading over to a cell phone sitting in a cut -off plastic water bottle, taped to the top of a wooden post. He dialed his son's cell phone number and his son answered from the taxi he drives in Mexico City. They spoke in Mixtec, conferring about what to do. A couple minutes later, the husband in Mexico City asked to speak to Ver\u00f3nica, to inform her that she should submit to the prenatal exam. Ver\u00f3nica came to the post, heard her husband's instructions, and hung up the phone. Ver\u00f3nica's father -in-law talking to his son through the cell phone on the end of the wooden post 112 Ver\u00f3nica led us to a woven -straw bed, similar in construction to a trampoline, in the patio of the family's adobe home. Sagrario performed the prenatal exam and determined that everyt hing was fine. She inquired why Ver\u00f3nica was no longer seeking prenatal care at the clinic in San Lu\u00eds Acatlan. Ver\u00f3nica explained that on her last visit, she was told the baby was undergoing \"fetal distress,\" displayed cardiac rhythm abnormalities, and ha d a nuchal chord. Ver\u00f3nica demonstrated a steely, unshakable confidence in her capacities to sense the well -being of her fetus and give birth to a healthy child (in contrast to David -Floyd's 1992 assessment of the American paradigm which mires women in fea r). Relying solely on mother's intuition, she determined that her baby was perfectly fine and that the medical per sonnel were manipulating her in order to lure her onto the operating table. We asked her what she planned to do: how would she, a 19 -year-old first-time mother, give birth in a small village with no midwife? Her answer was simple and matter -of-fact: \"By myself.\" Victoria receives a prenatal exam from Sagrario and another professional midwife * * * After similar visits in other villages, w e returned to the place where we found Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio on the side of the road. From there, we beat our way through thick brush and foliage until we found a small one -room cabin tucked among the trees. Mar\u00eda del Carmen's sister -in-law, Valeria , was in tears as she translated the story of the couple's journey home from the hospital, late at night, with no money, no medicines, and no place to stay. To get home, the couple had to enga\u00f1ar (deceive) the taxi driver, only admitting they had no money to pay him 113 once he had driven them home. It was the only way. Ignacio's mother also cried, saying that it felt so good to be treated well by gente77 and that she was touched that \" doctoras \" would come all the way to their home to offer help. Searching f or Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio's cabin in the woods After hearing about Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio's tribulations during their return home, Sagrario was again on the rampage. We drove three hours to Ometepec, Sagrario fuming every kilometer of the way and planning a tongue lashing for the Health Jurisdiction Administrator. Our driver, anxious about what was in store, said, \"I will take you wherever you want to go, but do not face me with those monsters.\" He explained that the administrator is a close fr iend of the governor, has support of the union, and his sister is the municipal president. As someone within the circle of power, he is accustomed to abusing the local population. Once we arrived, Sagrario reminded the administrator that he had personally assured her he would provide Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio with transportation home. She told him that he broke his promise and is not trustworthy , and threatened, \"I am not leaving here without a solution.\" After some squirming on his part during Sagrario' s tirade , the administrator was left speechless. He 77 Gente can literally be translated to mean \"people.\" Howver, this term is often used to contrast \"decent fo lk\" from \"the dregs of society\" and evidences her presupposition that Ignacio and the rest of his family are somehow lesser people than Sagrario and myself. 114 pulled out two 500 peso notes (approximately eighty dollars) from his billfold and handed them to Sagrario as reimbursement for Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio's travel expenses and had a nurse bring the pos toperative analgesics and antibiotics Mar\u00eda del Carmen required from the health center. Then he sent us to a restaurant in the town center, telling us to eat to our heart's content, \"The bill is on me.\" Tranquilino helps Mar\u00eda del Carmen sit up in the bedroom portion of the cabin 115 The inside of Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio's cabin; their children and family members Supranationalism: The Limits of Citizenship While marginalized individuals like Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Ignacio seek minimal government -provi sioned medical services and are deeply moved by rare experiences of kind treatment by gente , their affluent counterparts are oblivious to the trials of state -issued health care. Due to limited economic resources and ongoing racial discrimination, Mar\u00eda de l Carmen and Ignacio can only hope that their dire health needs will be met through the trope of citizenship. Since they are not positioned to leverage scientific knowledge and the performative medicalization of their suffering bodies as Petryna describes , biological citizenship is always just out of reach. For mother's like Ver\u00f3nica, being denied agency within government hospital settings fosters agentive disinterest in pursuing ever -aloof biological citizenship and willful determination to go it alone. I n contrast, Larissa and Jose Felix' privatized lifestyles78 unfold entirely outside of the realm of citizenship. For them, citizenship is neither unattainable nor aloof \u2014it is simply inconsequential. Instead, their identities are linked to a transnational meritocracy around parenting and birthing that allows cultural capital to stealthily stand in for economic capital. Furthermore, I have provided examples in this chapter that contrast the relative physical and social mobilities of a humanized birth practi tioner, a Mexican midwife, and impoverished 78 See chapter three. 116 indigenous patients and their families.79 The landscape I am describing is fraught with conflicting interests, and as mobilities collide into immobilities, social tensions surge. Each example offered highlights a different aspect of this complexity. I dispute Appadurai's 1996 notion of \"flow\" and instead build upon Ong's 1999 portrayal of how power works in globalized contexts since my work not only describes (ethno)medically mobile travelers on the one hand and so cially situated individuals on the other; but rather, highlights the tensions that emerge from physical propinquity and divergent access to transnational consumption and national citizenship. Sagrario comes in contact with foreigners who she perceives as more privileged but less skillful than her. Their mobility and her relative immobility, along with associated cultural and economic capital inequality, caused her to express frustration and resentment. Adeli is an example of someone who has leveraged a tr ansnational identity to accumulate both cultural and economic capital \u2014she is a U.S. -trained Jewish Mexican American whose livelihood depends on successfully portraying herself as a \"traditional Mexican midwife.\" Adeli's experiences again show that both ph ysical and social mobility are premised on one's ability to position oneself in a transnational community of consumption vis -\u00e0-vis traditional and professional categories. Her \"border crossing\" was met with resistance in her community, leading her to flee Brazil. The contrasting ethnographic examples of Sagrario's exclusion from the Mexican Midwifery Association advisory panel and threats to the safety of Adeli's children demonstrate that while some informants enjoy heightened mobility and others are cons trained by immobility, the social categories that separate the two groups can sometimes be equally binding in emotionally challenging ways. In this chapter, I have highlighted moments that add complexity to the concept of medical migration in order to desc ribe how people from disparate socioeconomic and georacial spectrums experience (im)mobility. Conclusion In Mexico, neoliberal economic restructuring has led to the dismantling and defunding of social safety nets. Cash transfer programs like Oportunidade s situate poor indigenous women at the crossroads of multiple forms of oppression and require them to alternate between performances of need and performances of capacity (see G\u00e1lvez 2011 and Smith -Oka 2013). While Maldonado suggests that the government's \" cultural approaches\" to national health problems hold individuals responsible for self -care (see Maldonado 2010), Gutmann describes working -class Mexicans as having \"a widespread belief that formal government institutions and officials could not be trusted to provide them with the necessities of life, and a general feeling that self -reliance was both the cross and the honor they would bear in life\" (Gutmann 2002:2). The ethnographic examples in this chapter collectively suggest that neoliberal governance is not only premised on self -care, but is resulting in the restructuring of the very meaning of citizenship. G\u00e1lvez links neoliberal models of self -reliance to Foucault's \"technologies of self\" (Foucault 1988) and Ong's dual technologies for the formation o f neoliberal subject: \"technologies of subjectivity\" and \"technologies of subjection\" (Ong 2006:6). In contrast, I am pointing to the limits of governmentality. My observations from the field do not support the argument that self -government and internalize d discipline reinforce power structures and further regulate populations. While scholars are increasingly pointing to how neoliberalism is resulting 79 Other examples include Do\u00f1a Eugenia, Do\u00f1a Agustina, and Don Israel in chapte r two; Paloma and Pamela in chapter five. 117 in the simultaneous expansion and delimitation of citizenship80, my work aims to decenter citizenship and ex plore other forms of subject -making. I am not discarding citizenship; rather, I am emphasizing moments in which citizenship is either not attainable or simply not the object of desire. Thus, I agree with scholars who critique the exceedingly narrow and rac ialized sphere of citizenship, but I depart from these critiques by asking what is unfolding beyond. My rethinking of citizenship resists uncritical assumptions about how health as a human right unfolds in our neoliberal age. While countries like Mexico an d Brazil are investing in nascent universal health systems, supranationalism and medical migrations point to the transnational nature of health care in the contemporary world and the delinking of nation and health provision. Recognizing the disjuncture bet ween national health systems and legal citizens \u2014that is, attending to how some individuals seek \"citizenship\" that is always just out of reach while others secure inclusion in transnational health -related communities through consumption \u2014throws into questio n the very premise upon which universal health systems are based. Can health as a universal good (both as a moral value and as concrete medical services) exist in an epoch that, ideologically speaking, combines neoliberal notions of choice with capitalisti c realities of deep socioeconomic inequality? The gap between state provisioned health services and market driven health acquisition is inscribed in individuals' identities, granting of greater or inferior value to those individuals as moral subjects. Whi le many have researched how inequalities (socioeconomic, race, gender, etc.) become embodied through unequal health care provisioning, my research goes in the other direction: I attend to how unequal access to biological services reinscribe inequalities wh ich are then incorporated into identities. Galv\u00e9z Chavez 2008; Coutin 2003; 2005. 118 CONCLUSION The humanized birth movement provides a telling example of how \"traditional\" practices are usurped and reinvented using a New Age logic that commodifies indigeneity through clai ms to \"ancestral\" knowledge while failing to include the very people it celebrates. The humanization of birth in Mexico demonstrates how New Age practices are buttressed by transnational markets that restrict some and privilege others. In this dissertation , I have provided ethnographic examples detailing how New Age interpretations and practices travel around the globe and unfold within specific places. That is to say, while medical migration is global, its effects are nested in the lived realities of my in formants. By studying both \"up\" and \"down\" simultaneously, I have queried how transnational communities of consumption provide the conditions through which different forms of inequality converge and are reinforced. Throughout the dissertation, I have resis ted binary questions like, \"Is it race, gender or class?\" because this framing is inadequate for describing the messiness I observed in the field and potentially hides more than it reveals. Affluent participants achieve \"social whitening\" and access global \"white\" communities of indigeniety and feminized, moralized mothering practices. Thus, this dissertation signals how on the one hand, economic capital facilitates access to female -centered social networks through which cultural capital is accumulated, and on the other hand, \"whiteness\" and \"indigeneity\" are coproduced and co - constituted. The transnational humanized birth movement points to the syncretic meanings and outcomes of New Age practices. I offer the New Age as a series of consequential contradictions \u2014that is, The New Age is not just a philosophy, a way of life, or the passive intersection of an ecumenical global spirituality and \"traditional\" cultural forms \u2014The New Age does something : the dual production of new \"traditional\" identities, and the \"traditionalization\" of new movements. Latin American social scientists have critiqued European and Am erican sociological approaches for advancing a globalizing argument which privileges the perspectives of cosmopo litan spirituality seekers (see De la Torre et. al 2013)xvii. In contrast, they attend to both the circulation of teachers, symbols, rituals, knowledges, and concepts on the one hand; and process of resignification, reinscription of what it means to be \"ethni c,\" and reappropriation of the New Age by the masses on the other hand . By signaling that New Age is characterized by practitioners as a countercultural form of spirituality, an alternative to materialism and consumption, and a symbol of postmodernity and cosmopolitanism81, these scholars argue that the New Age engenders the dynamization of existing syncretisms into new hybrid cultures, and simultaneously, the essentialization of ethnic identities. My concept of racial i(nter)dentification injects intersec tional inequalities of race, class, and gender into De la Torre et al.'s emphasis on how multicultural , New Age encounters result in novel syncretisms t hat redefine social identities.82 My ethnography pushes back against De la Torre 's (2013) reading of the emergence of New Age practices in developed capitalist countries as an alternative to capitalist modernity among middle -class actors with access to art, science , and cosmopolitan culture. I n the case of humanized birth, participation by middle -class actor s in 81 See Melton 1990, Heelas 1996, Hanegraaff 2001, and Champion 1995 . 82 For examples of the effects of New Age practices on the contempo rary construction o f identities, see Galinier 2008, Sarrazin 2008, and De la Pe\u00f1a 2002 . 119 transnational communities of consumption leads to the accrual of cultural capital. Moreover , privatization of (ethno)medical services results in the decentering of citizenship as the most appropriate category for analysis. While De la Torre argue s that the encounter between middle - class actors and indigenous and \"popular\" cosmovisions has resulted in cultural exchanges (in contrast to a globalized homogenization or the creation of a world -wide culture) , my ethnographic fieldwork highlights the inequity inherent in these \"exchanges.\" At the same time , however, my critique is a kaleidoscopic departure from Molini\u00e9 's (2013) denunciation of the hybridization of New Age practices as nothing more than a reshuffling of colonial forms of exploitation.83 The sub tlety of my argument lies in my sensitivity to the effects of intersecting forms of social inequality. I take a moderate approach that combines both systemic power with the dynamism and agency of marginalized populations. In doing so, I problematize the as sumption that New Age practices are adopted evenly among \"the masses.\" My ethnographic examples add complexity to the interaction between New Age practices and contemporary construction of identities by pointing to the important effects of processes of gendered racialization and socioeconomic class. Thus, my work highlights the variability of social positions (and associated restrictions) from which individuals negotiate and portray their identities. The humanized birth movement in Mexico is a valuable exa mple for rethinking the arguments presented in the literature on New Age practices. I argue that tourism and transnational consumption of ethnomedicine exploits the image of indigeneiety when it usurps \"traditional\" medical practices and refashions them in to hyper -mobile commodities. Furthermore, my research on humanized birth in Mexico clarifies the apparent contradiction between Molini\u00e9 and Aguilar Ros' (2013) arguments and conceptualizations of the New Age as a postmodern, cosmopolitan, and countercultur al alternative to materialism and consumption. As I have argued in the introduction to the dissertation, the great irony of the humanized birth movement in Mexico lies in parents' perspective of themselves as critics of late capitalism; all the while, thei r very rejection of consumerism bolsters ongoing commodification of culture, reinscription of racial hierarchies, and (false) appropriation of indigenous notions of racial \"hierarchy\"84. New Age Ideologies and Ethnomedicine According to Michael York, t he New Age Movement is an open availability process that converts various spiritual traditions into public property. The sacred is commodified, allowing it to be bought or sold, and thus consumed in a free -market. York points to the irony of the New Age ratio nale: spiritual commercialization often clashes with the traditions from which it appropriatesxviii,xix. In this dissertation, I have argued that what humanized birth proponents describe as an international feminist liberation for educated women is based in the exploitation of cultura l-intellectual property rights of traditional midwives and the reproduction of 83 In a similar vein, Aguilar Ros 2008 suggests that tourism exploits native spirituality. 84 See example in the introduction about how specialized baby carriers made of cloth serve as non-commodity commodities among women who enact a feminized, moralized, \"purified\" motherhood. These women place cloth carriers in opposition to prams and baby carriages, which they critique for being commodities. Also, see section in Chapte r 2 about the expense of having a humanized birth. 120 inequality in Mexico (see Chapter 2 ). Thus, my work not only uncovers the clash between commodified New Age forms and traditional practices, but also highlights how intersecting forms of social inequality are actually reinforced and reinscribed by New Age ideologies that are purportedly value inclusiveness and \"humanity.\"xx In the context of traditional midwifery in Mexico, traditional midwives are exclud ed from practicing in hospitals. While some regions offer certification for traditional midwives, the exam - based evaluations pose a virtually impossible obstacle for traditional midwives with limited formal schooling. As G\u00e1lvez describes (see G\u00e1lvez 2011:7 5), traditional midwives face legal problems if they practice without certification, and as a result, many have been forced to cease practicing. What I am arguing differs from Kudlu (2013) in that he signals a paradmigmatic shift from \"pharmaceuticals\" to \"services\" and describes how the ayurvedic doctor is kept within the loopxxi. In contrast, I argue that while traditional midwives are largely excluded as participants in the commodity chain, their image is usurped, commodified, overlain on \"traditional\" se rvices and goods, and sold. My argument is not about the \"large -scaling\" of traditional midwifery and concomitant \"deskilling\" of practitioners \u2014rather, I am diagnosing the (false) appropriation of traditional midwifery, the commodification of indigeneity, and the exclusion of traditional indigenous midwives. Furthermore, while Nazrul Islam is concerned with how Eastern medicine is desired by the West and how this desire has transformed Ayurveda into wellness therapy (a process he calls \"ideological contamin ation\"); I am concerned with how desire among the \"global professional class\" (see Spivak 2003) for \"going back to nature\" and \"traditional ways of birthing\" reinforces socioeconomic stratification and processes of racialization in the name of humanization , places the burden of cor rectly producing future bioconsumers on women's shoulders using the rhetoric of feminist liberation, and commodifies culture under the guise of rejecting consumption. Remaking \"Anew\" of Tradition In Mexico, tradition is remade \" anew\" through New Age iterations of humanized birth. Furthermore, as humanized birth practitioners and traditional birth attendants come into contact during training workshops, conferences, and fairs, a reordering of \"tradit ion\" and \"progress\" is challengi ng Euro -American ontologies of time. While this has led to a change in how indigeneity is imagined and desired by non -indigenous individuals, it has translated into material differences for only a few specific indigenous participants, and has failed to dis rupt undergirding racial hierarchies rooted in colonial legacies. Examples of this complex relationship between emerging traditionalities and the commodification of indigeneity under the New Age paradigm are many. In Guerrero, Dr. Gilberto, a health offic ial within the state -level Secretary of Health, told me that his office aspired to be the \"pioneers\" of vertical birth positions in Mexico. For him, going back to birth postures regularly assumed by women before the biomedical naturalization of the lithoto my position (lying on one's back, feet in stirrups) was a strategic way for the state of Guerrero, a state among the poorest nation -wide with respect to health indicators, to identify itself as a leader towards modernity and progress through corporal techn iques that have been \"scientifically proven in the First World.\" In the context of demedicalization, modernity is aligned with \"ancestral knowledge.\" Meanwhile, for Do \u00f1a Eugenia's indigenous clients, modernity is sought through medicalization and pharmace uticalization. While they avoid interacting with hospital staff due to previous experiences of racial discrimination, they seek out' Do \u00f1a Eugenia's services over other 121 local traditional midwives because of her skillful placement of an IV drip during the la bor process, administration of intravenous vitamin solution during the recovery period, and extensive in-home pharmacy of pills promising quicker results than traditional herbal remedies (see Friedlander 1975) . Do\u00f1a Eugenia also offers herbal treatments, but even these services are sufficiently \"modern\" since she does not rely solely on traditional knowledge passed down through the generations; rather, she studies texts produced by the University of Chapingo which catalogue the effectiveness of herbs based on clinical and laboratory studies. In doing so, Do \u00f1a Eugenia is drawing from academic expertise produced at an institution that groups traditional and alternative medicines in New Age fashion: herbalis m, the therapeutic uses of temas cal, and healing mass age are taught alongside African traditional medicine, Chinese medicine and acupuncture, Ayurvedic medicine, biomagnetism, and homoepathy. Thus, for Do \u00f1a Eugenia's clients, modernity is achieved through being cared for as modern beings. Do\u00f1a Eugenia p reparing an IV to administer postnatal vitamin solution The complex and, at times, contradictory perspectives of Dr. Gilberto and Do \u00f1a Eugenia's clients are not unique by any means. A prominent humanized obstetrician in Guadalajara and a handful of his cl ients are featured in a French documentary on birth practices around the world. For him, humanized birth is part of a greater movement towards natural and ecological living. He not only wants to help women become more in tune with their bodies, but 122 to hims elf become more in tune with the earth through sustainable farming and raising lifestock. Nearby, a Colombian nurse turned midwife uses \"tra ditional\" Mexican rituals, temaz cal, dance circles, and herbs with her transnational clients. In Cuernavaca, Yanira85 combines acupuncture with the traditional midwifery techniques that pique d the interest of American film makers. A transnational organization in Monterey, Nuevo Leon offers transcendental yoga, chiropractic treatments, and humanized birth services alongsid e \"ancestral\" baking classes. In a private Mexico City hospital dedicated to \"natural\" healing and minimal intervention, the highest technology from around the world is combined with a dedication to organic living. My perspective on the rupture and reorde ring of existing Euro -American ontologies of time responds to phenomena similar to those observed by Robbie Davis -Floyd in her discussion of \"postmodern\" midwifery , but my bares stark contrast David -Floyd, \"postmodern\" midwifery is a pr oductive combination of elements from traditional midwifery and modern -day obstetrics (see Davis -Floyd 2007). That is, the \"postmodern midwife\" merges techniques from past and present in a way that benefits birthing mothers. While in Davis -Floyd's view the interpenetration of traditionality and modernity have a positive impact on women's births, my dissertation reframes the question entirely. I am less concerned with making value judgements about humanized birth as a potential paradigm shift in obstetrics a nd more concerned with the racialization, politics of portrayal, and socioeconomic inequalities that it often buttresses and masks. I am not disputing that the humanization of birth and reducti on of obstetric violence are valuable projects , but I ask, in p ractice, who have these projects been good for? While the humanized birth movement has facilitated access to demedicalized birth in the private sector for the global professional class, traditional midwives face government -sanctioned limitations on their work. T he current nation -wide health policy dictates that all births ta ke place in hospital settings; however, I discovered a great deal of regional variabili ty between policy and practice . In some places, indigenous midwives and mothers use subversive st rategies to seek the midwife -attended births they desire. In other places (see Van Hollen 2003 and Smith -Oka 2013), indigenous women seek \"modernity\" through biomedical births and are actively turning away from traditional midwifery. In still other places, traditional midwives have transitioned to the role of contraception advocates in order to escape blame for maternal mortality, but nonetheless continue to be scapegoats for negative birth outcomes. In other zones, traditional midwifery is framed by NGO wo rkers and members of the community as a response to inadequate health infrastructure in the state. Elsewhere, midwives have ceded births to hospital staff, but regularly provide prenatal care and provide mother's with guidance that often takes precedence w hen making reproductive decisions. In Veracruz, midwives contend that the distance to the nearest hospital from their rural communities combined with irregular transportation make it impossible for many births to be attended in hospitals, resulting in the ir moral obligation to attend births when they are already unfolding. However, their argument is met with further, unwritten measures attempting to curtail the practice of traditional midwifery. At a training workshop, I listened as traditional midwives complained to the regional hospital director about difficulties obtaining birth certificates for the babies they had delivered. Some were even being charged a fee by corrupt hospital administrators for birth certificates that are officially free of charge. Despite attempted censure of traditional midwifery, in some municipalities across Veracruz midwives are interpellated by government officials to perform unpaid duties as 85 Introduced later in this chapter. 123 community health workers and contraception advocates (see Pigg 1997, 2001 ). One tradit ional midwife maintains a positive relationship with the medical intern in her village by submitting to his \"supervision.\" While he is still a student and she has attended thousands of births, she turns in a weekly report tallying the number of home visits she has performed, how many hospital references she has made, and how many women she has convinced to use contraceptive methods. I witnessed noticeable absences in her report \u2014that is, she prepares herbal remedies and attends births for her fellow villager s, but these midwifery activities not included in the report. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile for her to continue to deliver her weekly report to the medical intern because, in exchange for her submission to his \"supervision,\" he turns a blind eye to her practice of midwifery. At the same time, her ongoing provisioning of midwifery minimizes his need to intervene in obstetric and gynecological cases, freeing him from potential accusations of molesting the village women and violent backlash were he to incur a negative birth outcome. Thus, while their performative relationship seems characterized by submission to biomedical authority, the midwife and the intern are complicit partners \u2014he silently supports her as she fulfills her role in the community, and she all eviates him from his anxiety -provoking obligation to intervene. The official story is that the women in this community are giving birth \"alone\" in their homes because their indigenous physiology and broader hips lead to speedy births that make it impossi ble for them to arrive on timexxii. This type of community -wide secrecy is not unique to Veracruz. I interviewed traditional midwives and indigenous mothers in the mountains of Guerrero and while traditional midwives tell officials they are not attending birt hs in that region, it is not uncommon for women to give birth \"alone.\" One mother told me that she gave birth \"alone\" to eleven children, and each time, the birth was so swift that she could not make it to the hospital. In Oaxaca, the threat of financ ial loss has not been sufficient for making sure women attend all of their prenatal visits, so the Secretary of Health instituted a \"Obstetric Godmothers Program\" ( Programa de Madrinas Obst\u00e9tricas ), thus adding a financial incentive for female members of t he community to assure that their pregnant neighbors attend all required prenatal consults. After her contract ended at the Center for Gender Equity and Reproductive Health, Sagrario accepted a position within the Guerrero Secretary of Health. From her pos t, she proposed that instead of paying stipends to lay women for assuring that pregnant women comply with biomedical mandates like in the neighboring state of Oaxaca, traditional midwives in Guerrero who pass a certification process should be paid monthly stipends for their midwifery work. Shortly thereafter, Sagrario began focusing her energies on the freshly inaugurated professional midwifery school in Tlapa, Guerrero, leading her away from advocacy for the practice of traditional midwifery. In Chiapas, traditional midwives spoke openly to me about their practice of midwifery, and mothers were forthcoming about choosing to have a traditional midwife attend their births instead of trekking to a distant hospital that is often overcrowded, understaffed, and lacking medical supplies. One mother told me that while the Oportunidades program requires her to go to prenatal consults, this has no effect on the prenatal care she receives from the midwife she trusts. While she relies on the knowledge of the midwife to make decisions about her pregnancy, physicians at the government clinic remain totally unaware that she is receiving ongoing midwifery care. Concurrent prenatal care with traditional midwives is a common omission in clinical settings. In this region, trad itional midwives do not act as hospital referralists at the service of the state; however, their active role is not often officially acknowledged. The 124 ambivalent relationship between traditional midwives and clinical care providers is mediated by Global Pe diatric Alliance, an NGO bas ed in San Francisco, California. Global Pediatric Alliance's binational team negotiates with government leaders on behalf of traditional midwives. In Quintana Roo, virtually all births take place in hospital settings, very few traditional midwives continue to attend births, and the population adheres to the national policy. Traditional midwives in Quintana Roo are frequent recipients of workshops, credentials, and certificates, but one midwife complained to me that the result a ll of this \"training\" has been their conversion into contraception promotoras. She commented, \"We are the social workers outside of the hospital. There are no rights for ind\u00edgenas.\" She complained that despite generalized compliance with government mandat es and attendance at relentless social worker -led trainings, traditional midwives are still the scapegoats for maternal mortality in the state. In the process, multiple measures of inequality and related risk factors for maternal mortality are obscured. Throughout my ethnographic fieldwork, I noticed that the regional variability of restrictions placed upon traditional midwifery practice stem from content differences among the training workshops that traditional midwives receive. While in states like Verac ruz, Guerrero, and Quintana Roo traditional midwives are instructed to refer birthing mothers to the nearest hospital, in the Huasteca region of San Luis Potosi state, traditional midwives are \"medicalized,\" instructed not to use herbal remedies , and taugh t to perform an episiotomy during all of the births they attend. Transnationalism in the Humanized Birth Movement Humanized birth in Mexico is the result of transnational flow of ideas, people, and practices; but to what degree are comparisons of profess ional midwifery and alternative birth in Mexico and in the developed world meaningful and informative? Given that such comparisons can be made, what are they informative about? In Chiapas, I interviewed Andrea, the local director of Global Pediatric Allian ce. In her opinion, when people use Chilean professional midwives as an example of how professional midwifery can be transformative for women's health through marked reduction in maternal and infant health, their argument does not take into account the pol itical, economic, and social realities of Mexico. According to Andrea, it is impossible to compare the unfolding of professional midwifery in Chile with that of Mexico because of their distinct contexts. I agree with Andrea in that strategies for ameliorat ing negative health outcomes in one nation will not bear the same effects in another nation if they are applied in exactly the same way\u2014for professional midwifery to result in a similar reduction in maternal mortality in Mexico, a number of adaptations acc ounting for georacial and socioeconomic differences must be made to the Chilean model; however, I am more concerned with the question of why these comparisons are being made. I argue that such comparisons are born of lingering and consequential aspirations of modernity and \"whiteness,\" and a d esire to be aligned with whiter, more developed countries. During that same trip, I visited an organization of traditional indigenous medicine doctors and midwives, where I interviewed the director and several members of the staff. At the time of my visit, some traditional midwives from the association were on a trip to Germany, where they had been invited by a group of obstetricians and professional midwives to appear at a conference. The organization has very limited funding, and its members' lives are marked by poverty. In this dissertation, I have explored how the image of indigeneity is fetishized in international forums and have argued that in many cases, this celebration of \"ancestral knowledge\" and 125 \"humanization \" is ironically and, at times, unwittingly rooted in notions of racial hierarchy that in effect reify and reinscribe race -based inequality. Through ethnographic examples, I have suggested that this decontextualization and appropriation of indigenous people s' images is articulated in multiple and complex ways: while some indigenous individuals feel objectified; others engage with transnational politics of representation, using their indigeneity as a resource through which to achieve various sorts of recognit ion that are meaningful to them, despite continued economic scarcity; and still others leverage their identities with lucrative results, leading to violent backlash from their communities. Consumption and \"Social Whitening\" on a Global Stage Issues of \"social whitening,\" consumer ism, and transnationalism intersect in the humanized birth movement. More specifically, parents and families form groups oriented around a particular type of birth; their participation in these groups, which often times reiterate d iscourse originating in the Global North and connect them to a transnational movement, is an expression of how patterns of consumption and \"social whitening\" operate in tandem. My perspective draws from and simultaneously resists both Rose and Novas' interpretation of Petryna's biological citizenshipxxiii and Garc\u00eda Canclini's consumer Nikolas Rose and Carlos Novas broaden Petryna's no tion of biological citizenship by pointing to new fo rms of identity and morality created along with novel transna tional citizenship projects. Similarly , I point to the transnational moral communities to which parents in the Global South seek membership, inclusion, and belonging. In the same vein as Rose and Novas, I assert what is at stake is not necessarily materia l, economic, or medical resources, but, rather, claims to cultural capital through production of new identities and novel moral scales. Individuals who identify with the humanized birth movement and practice natural, home and/or water birth, skin -to-skin contact with the newborn, and extended breastfeeding consider themselves better parents, and affirm their children are more emotionally balanced, self -assured, and intelligent. However, I resist Rose and Novas' suggestions regarding the partial delinking of citizenship and nation since I argue that broadening the notion of citizenship to include transnational social networks runs the risk of stripping citizenship of its essential meaning and depleting its analytical usefulness. By bring ing Latin American (a nd especially Mexican) scholarship to bear on the concept of biological citizenship, I draw attention to the roles consumerism, socioeconomic class, and representations originating in the Global North play in the construction of global, biological, consump tion-oriented communities. Nestor Garc\u00eda Canclini argues that while citizenship used to signify equality of abstract rights and collective participation in public democratic spaces, nowadays questions of belonging, information, and representation are answe red in the realm of private consumption and mass media \u2014effectively rendering citizens of the 18th century into consumers of the 20th (or 21st) century. Identity is now configured by consumption \u2014how much one possesses and is capable of appropriating. Thus, according to Garc\u00eda Canclini, the neoliberal conception of globalization reserves the right of being a citizen for elitesxxiv. From my perspective, the fact that so much of contemporary social life is ordered by neoliberal patterns of consump tion problematiz es citizenship as an adequate explanatory concept for how individuals negotiate both transnational and locally situated inequalities in their everyday lives. During ethnographic research, I observed how b ioconsumer s citizens seek inclusion in global biolog ical and consumerism -oriented communities rather than rights and resources from a particular nation or state. Thus, my dissertation explores processes of inclusion/exclusion and patterns of bioconsumption that produce both \"suprac itizens\" and 126 \"noncitizens, \" and critiques tendencies to apply the concept of citizenship too broadly.86 What is truly at stake for the bioconsumers I observed are presentations of self (see Goffman 1959) and the accrual of cultural capital, not government -provisioned services. None theless, a simple switch from the citizenship modality to the consumer modality would be too reductive. What I observed were neoliberal parenting in action, and the many ways neoliberal ideology reproduces classism, gender inequality, and mother -blaming e ven as it casts parents as expert consumers with many options from which to choose. Thus, in this dissertation, I resist viewing children only as commodities since I observed the deep love with which parents raise their children and the thoughtfulness and carefulness that guide decisions regarding their children's wellbeing. However, I do argue that children represent parents' stake in our contemporary meritocracy \u2014a system that naturalizes extreme inequality by allowing us to believe in democratic structu res and the idea that education and proper preparation will open doors for children to a brilliant future. Furthermore, I suggest that the pressure of meritocracy pushes back into the womb. That is, the difference between a privatized and public childhoo d begins in vitro with prenatal care.87 The great irony lies in the fact that these parents view themselves as actively resisting materialism , but their very refusal of the corruption they diagnose in consumerism, nationalism , and late capitalism leads to the commodification of culture, heightened moralization and gradation of motherhood, reinscription of racial hierarchies, and (false) appropriation of indigenous notions of spirituality. The humanized birth movement explicitly avoids direct references to consumption. That is to say, these mothers reject the most expensive baby carriages, nannying services, and similar markers of commodified or elite motherhood. Instead, they seek cloth wraps with which to bind their children to their bodies and promote mother -child bonding. Their cloth wraps, however, are not the woven shawls that indigenous women use; they are sold by specialized companies that use the internet to market humanized birth products as non -commodity commodities. These women's project \u2014to enact a motherhood \u2014is a critique of Garc\u00eda Canclini's description of consumption since it unfolds around a moral fluorescence and through moral spaces that allow ideologies to flow \"freely.\" The goal of these mothers is not to have the most, but to be the best. It is not that the pathway to citizenship in neoliberal societies is through consumption (as Garc\u00ed a Canclini 2001 argues); rather, cultural capital is earned by parents who set themselves apart as morally superior in neoliberal meritocracies. 86 Scheper -Hughes 2000 also problematizes contemporary anthropological citizenship by pointing to \"super -citizens\" and \"sub -citizens.\" Her terminology suggests a hierarchical scaling of citizens in which some individuals have access to more citizenship rights than others. While I do not disagree with Scheper -Hughes, I use the terms \"supracitizen\" and \"noncitizen\" to describe individuals whose lives unfold outsid e of the realm of citizenship \u2014marginalized individuals for whom citizenship is always just out of reach and transnational elites whose privatized lives render citizenship simply irrelevant. 87 On the privatization of childhood and neoliberal parenting, see Lareau's Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life ; Charis Thompson's \"Three Times a Woman\" and Making Parents: The Ontological Choreography of Reproductive Technologies ; Folbre's Greed, Lust and Gender: A History of Economic Ideas. 127 REFERENCES i It is worth mentioning that \"urban hippies\" and \"rural Christians\" are two very distinct groups in the United States that, despite their shared enthusiasm for humanized birth, do not map onto each other at all. Furthermore, while some humanized birth proponents in Mexico would not take offense at being described as \"urban hippies\" and even use \"hippy\" as a term to describe themselves, it is important to point out that these categories originating in the United States do not map di rectly onto humanized birth in Mexico. That is to say, Christian practices and and what it means to be \"hippy\" have different roots in the U.S. than in Mexico. ii In the context of my ethnographic research, \"parto respetado\" unfolded as a multivalent descr iptor that signals birth that is respected, respectful, and that evidences the respectability of its practitioners. For a discussion of \"respectability,\" see Cooper 's lecture, \"The End of Respectability: Black Feminism and Ratchet Politics,\" delivered at t he University of Wisconsin, Madison on March 10, 2015 (available online at: https://vimeo.com/121847236) . iii While others at the encuentro labeled these participants \"hippies,\" I am sensitive to discriminatory p rocesses of racialization that unfold despite white privilege, and am therefore careful to avoid terms that have in some contexts been employed as racial epithets against white people. My purpose for describing the demographic at this event is to signal ho w humanized birth proponents may engage in lifestyle choices that actively critique capitalization while also participating in the fetishization of indigeneity. iv For Fassin, humanitarian government is the governance of those who are victims of precarious ness. The vocabulary of suffering, compassion, and assistance qualifies the issues involved and shapes the choices made in our contemporary political life. Fassin argues humanitarianism fugaciously bridges the fundamentally unequal human condition, making the intolerability of injustice somewhat bearable. (His argument resonates with the life work of Eduardo Men\u00e9ndez on hegemony and subalternity.) v Clifford places his work in conversation with seminal literature on postmodernity (\"Postmodernism\" [1984] by Jameson and The Condition of Postmodernity [1990] by Harvey) and more recent work on ethnicity (Chow's The Protestant Ethnic and the Spirit of Capitalism [2002] and Comaroff's Ethnicity, Inc. [2009]). These authors argue capitalist globalization encourages differences so long as these differences do not upset the dominant political -economic order. vi \"Humanized birth\" ( parto humanizado ) is usually used in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America to describe birth that purposefully resists medicalization and tec hnocratic practices (see Davis -Floyd 1992). This movement is analogous to the home and water birth movements in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. Births are often attended by professional midwives (although some obstetricians have joined the m ovement) and accompanied by doulas. In general, proponents of humanized birth criticize power inequality inherent in physician -patient relationships and denounce medicalized practices such as unnecessary cesarean sections, episiotomies, isolation of birthi ng mothers in hospital labor and delivery areas, labor induction (including the use of hormones such as pitocin), and the repetitive insertion of medical personnel's fingers into women's vaginas to assess dilation. However, some informants expressed a more nuanced definition of humanized birth, explaining that a highly medicalized birth can be considered \"humanized\" if the interventions were medically necessary and/or if the interventions were chosen by the birthing mother. Also, some Mexican physicians hav e railed against the terminology of \"humanized birth,\" asking if the birth they attend is, by default, 128 \"animalistic.\" Thus, some prefer the term \"respected birth,\" since it highlights respect for birthing mothers' choices, which can be prioritized in both medicalized births and births attended by physicians. Given socioeconomic and race -based disparities across Mexico, I question uncritical notions of \"free choice.\" vii While at the time of my participant -observation this hospital reported an approximate cesa rean section rate of 20 percent (more than the World Health Organization's recommended 10 to15 percent), this figure is less than half of the national averages in both public and private sectors. Cesarean section represents 45.8 percent of births in publi c Mexican Institute of Social Security hospitals (see the IMSS website [imss.gob.mx] and their publication, nd approximately 70 in private hospitals (see S\u00e1nchez, Cinthya. \"En M\u00e9xico, por ces\u00e1rea.\" Eluniversal.mx. July 18, 2010. Web. Accessed September 21, 2014.) viii See, for example, Davis-Floyd and Sargent 1996; D Daviss 2009 . ix A number of anthropologists have focused on the relationship between reproduction, modern industrial capitalism, and th e intensification of global inequity with regards to material resources (Anagnost 1995; Martin 2001; Ginsburg and Rapp, 1995; Colen, 1995; Whittaker, 2010). Some have analyzed the shift from children whose productive labor contributes to the household economy to children whose unproductive existence drives consumption of household resources (Layne 1999; Taylor et al. 2004; Zelize r 1994). These accounts posit that while raising children had once been a strategy for sustaining the domestic unit as parents age, in the present day children are born to be loved and educated to the highest extent possible. x While Ludy S. DeLoache and Alma Gottlieb published A World of Babies: Imagined Childcare Guides for Seven Societies in 2000 \u2014a cross -cultural comparison of how people raise their babies and an anthropological, psychological, and historical account of the nature versus nurture dilemma \u2014this approach does not offer a political economic critique of privilege and inclusion/exclusion in globalized markets. xi Several book has emerged to stir the parenting pot. Jennifer Senior's 2014 book All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood points to the perils of placing children at the top of the family hierarchy and giving them minimal responsibilities. While th is strategy is meant to make children happy, Senior argues it makes children, and their parents, very unhappy. Parents end up overextended, overscheduled, and overstressed \u2014a recipe that often takes a toll on their romantic relationship. Senior's perspectiv e is an outlier among parenting books, and it represents a non - anthropological approach that develops in a similar direction as my present argument. Also see Bringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting (2012) by Pamela D ruckerman. xii See Roberts 1997, Glenn 2002, Crenshaw 2014, Granzka 2014, and Haraway 2014. xiii Within the context of trial discourse, Greg Maltoesian points to how intertextuality generates inconsistency. Specifically, he analyzes the metapragmatic negotiati on framing both the authority and the reception of reported speech. The strength of Maltoesian's work lies in his attention to the performance of legal knowledge, the naturalization of discursive power, and the production of intertextual transparency. xiv Montoya first points out that for 70 years anthropologists, following after Boas, have considered race to be a social construct and fundamentally an ideology about human differences; 129 and how decades of research shows that most variation exists within so -called racial groups, rather than between them. Specifically, he studies type 2 diabetes and asks how, given this previous notion, race could be biologically meaningful. Montoya indicates drug companies and epidemiologists simply view diabetes as a biochemica l error or a population -based syndrome, without paying attention to the living conditions for Mexicanas/os along the US -Mexico border. He writes, \"Placing DNA acquisition within the sociohistorical context of the US -Mexico border, the processes and product s of genetic epidemiological research can be understood as founded upon long -standing racialized social and economic inequalities\" (Montoya 2011:13). He argues that population labels, in fact, reference the biological effects of a particular population's social history. When researchers and scientists use the notion of racial groups, they confound the fallacy of race by using it as a freestanding independent variable. Thus, Montoya points to the co-construction of cultural meanings and political economies o f diabetes. xv Using the lens of genetic research on asthma in Barbados, Whitmarsh (2008) offers an analysis of how plurality of ethnic identities and illness meanings are transformed into a science of race. Through ethnographic observations of genetic res earchers, government officials, medical professionals, and families, Whitmarsh documents how the bundling together of disease populations and biological race is contested by practices around nation, race, and family. For further perspectives on the relevan ce of race as a social, legal, and medical category (as opposed to nothing more than a social construct), see Whitmarsh and Jones 2010. xvi Adriana Petryna (2002) first developed the concept of biological citizenship in Life Exposed: Biological Citizens aft er Chernobyl. (Others have theorized related concepts that merge corporeal practices and civic status; notably, the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaste r, the Ukrainian state rejected the World Bank and U.S. cost -effective model of disaster remediation, taking a paternalistic role as the giver and taker of social resources and creating a new role for the individual impacted by the Chernobyl disaster: that of biological citizen. Individuals navigated their citizenship, rights, and social identities through the leveraging of scientific knowledge, the performative medicalization of their suffering bodies, and bureaucratic influences. Others have theorized rel ated concepts that merge corporeal practices and civic status; notably, \"sanitary citizenship\" (Briggs and Mantini citizenship\" (Anderson 2006). xvii The syncretic nature of New Age phenomena is discussed at length in De la Torre, Guti\u00e9rrez Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, and Ju\u00e1rez Huet's edited volume Variaci\u00f3nes del New Age. They argue that \"New Age\" is the intersection of an ecumenical global spirituality and \"traditional and ancestral\" cultural forms. Thus, for them, New Age practices are the result of a dual process: the production of new \"traditional\" identities, and the \"traditionalization\" of new movements. xviii York the New Age Movement as a response to the decline of \"traditional religion\" in the West. Citing Bryan Wilson, York argues that the New Age Movement conforms to the spiritual pluralism that results from secularization. xix Property -oriented approaches have been adapted to the globalization of Ayurveda. Masato Kasezawa performed research in Kerala, India to e xamine the cultural politics determining intellectual ownership of Ayurveda. Kasezawa observed the redefinition of Ayurveda as national intellectual property, and therefore an object of state control. 130 For an example of a similar analysis on yoga, see Alli son Fish's 2006 \"The Commodification and Exchange of Knowledge in the Case of Transnational Commercial Yoga in the International Journal of Cultural Property, Volume 13, Issue 2, pages 189 -206. xx This aspect of my work can be compared and contrasted to the work of Chithprabha Kudlu, who, in his Washington University in St. Louis dissertation, \"Brand Kerala: Commodification of Open Source Ayurveda,\" points to the recent emergence of global ayurvedic tourism. Instead of conceptualizing the effects of commodif ication in terms of intellectual property rights, he focuses on the \"social lives\" of ayurvedic pharmaceuticals and how the livelihoods of actors in the ayurvedic commodity chain are transformed. Like York, Kudlu describes classical medicines as \"open -source commodities,\" and specifies that their commercial viability is rooted in the continuity of a cultural practice. He signals a dual, contradictory process: while tourists flock to Kerala, where Ayurveda is a mass commodity (as opposed to its elitist stat us elsewhere), industrialization and institutionalization (and resulting homogenization and scientization) threaten the traditional role of knowledge -intensive actors: ayurvedic doctors, consumers, raw drug shops, and medicinal plant collectors. He argues that \"economic stakes\" are at odds with \"cultural stakes,\" leading to the \"deskilling\" of ayurvedic practitioners. xxi My work is more closely aligned with Nazrul Islam's 2011 research on the branding of Ayurveda, the creation of \"New Age orientalist desi re,\" and what he calls, \"wellness and spa culture.\" Similar to the ethnographic observations I have made in this dissertation, Islam underlines the role of Euro -American tourists and Indian middle -class professionals and affluent entrepreneurs in the comm odification of Ayurveda. Furthermore, Islam examines how a global demand for herbal drugs, supplements and beauty products and the commodification of Ayurveda has led large pharmaceutical companies to redefine ayurvedic drug production for profit maximizat ion (see Islam 2010). xxii See O'Neil and Leyland -Kaufert 1995 on the racialization of Inuit women's physiology and their births . xxiii A related concept of that of \"sanitary citizen.\" Charles Briggs and Clara Mantini -Briggs coined the term \"sanitary citizenship\" in their 2004 book Stories in the Time of Cholera: Racial Profiling During a Medical Nightmare to describe a key mechanism for deciding who is granted substantive access to the civil and social rights of citizenship. Those who are perceived to possess mo dern medical understandings of the body, health, hygiene, and illness are sanitary citizens. In contrast, Briggs and Mantini -Briggs show how race, class, and gender figure into medical profiling; construing certain individuals as incapable of modern medic al relationships to the body, hygiene, illness, and healing; thus rendering them unsanitary subjects. .) Sanitary citizenship is supported by binaries such as modern/traditional, global/local, and biomedicine/ethnomedicine. To be rural and poor means to o nly have access to local knowledge, to be traditional and rely erroneously on ethnomedicine. Briggs and Mantini -Bruggs suggest that, due to their relegation to the category of unsanitary subject, the poor and rural population's struggle for adequate healt h care and human rights equal to their wealthy, urban counterparts is rendered invisible. xxiv Garc\u00eda Canclini strongly implicates the United States in the global conversion to consumer citizenship. He suggests international uniformity, imposed by neoliber al planning \"far away\" (often originating in North America), has led to individuals feeling the only things accessible to them are goods and messages arriving to their homes, to use \"as they see fit.\" The tastes and consumption patterns of audiences are of ten scripted in the United States \u2014so much that Garc\u00eda Canclini calls identities \"multimedia spectacles,\" and suggests Latin America and Europe are 131 \"suburbs\" of Hollywood. In contrast to Garc\u00eda Canclini's perspective on the United States' presence in Latin America, I point to the multiple imbrications of the so -called First World and global \"whites\" in shaping what is considered progressive and desirable in Mexico. 132 BIBLIOGRAPHY Organized by Chapter Introduction Anagnost, Ann 1995 A Surfeit of Bodies: Population and the Rationality of the State in Post -Mao China.
