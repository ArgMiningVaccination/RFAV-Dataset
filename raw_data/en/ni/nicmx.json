San Marcos, Bachelors degree in Communications ATTACHMENT J 06/17/2011 A San Diego university owner and school employee indicted for visa fraud ICE investigation uncovers visa scheme at 6 schools SAN DIEGO, Calif. \u2014 The owner of a San Diego-area university and chain of English-language schools made her initial appearance in federal court Friday on charges that the schools served as a front for student visa fraud. This indictment followed a two-year probe by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Carmen Tepper, 56, of Las Vegas, the owner of the San Diego International Academy of English (SDIAE) and Southern States University (SSU), is charged in the 11-count indictment handed down last month with conspiring to defraud the U.S. government, and with making false statements in documents submitted on behalf of foreign students. The indictment also seeks the forfeiture of more than $3 million that Tepper allegedly gained through the scheme, which involved dozens of foreign students. Also charged in the case is Tepper's parent company, Tepper Technologies, and one of Tepper's employees, Denise Mastro, 46, of San Diego. Mastro was responsible for reviewing the status of foreign students enrolled in the schools and reporting it to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) \u2014 a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) database used to track foreign students studying in the United States. Like Tepper, Mastro also made her initial appearance in federal court Friday. Both women are scheduled to appear in court again July 29 before U.S. District Judge Janis L. Samrnartino. If convicted on all counts, the defendants face up to 15 years in prison and fines totaling $500,000. The schools targeted in the ICE HSI investigation have multiple campuses in San Diego County and are authorized under ICE's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll foreign students and issue I-20s, the form required for foreign nationals to obtain a student visa. Both Tepper and Mastro were authorized to certify the 1-20 forms. According to the indictment, which was unsealed Friday, the defendants falsely certified in the I- 20s that the foreign students would be required to pursue a full course of study while attending SDIAE or SSU. Once the foreign nationals obtained visas and enrolled in the schools, the defendants allegedly failed to notify DHS when students were no longer complying with attendance requirements, provided they continued to pay tuition. Federal law requires foreign students to maintain a full course of study. unless they have prior approval from the school official. As part of the investigation. ICE HSI agents, in conjunction with the State of California Premium Fraud Task Force, executed state and federal search warrants at the schools in March 2010, seizing documentary evidence from computer files and images to further their investigation. ATTACHMENT K SANI)11:.(;plINIVF,RITY IrrK i N11 Dir April 11,2016 VIA EMAIL AND CERTIFIED MAIL/ RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED Laurence Wilson Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary Yelp, Inc. 140 New Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94105 Re: Notice to Cease and Desist Dear Mr.Wilson: The purpose of this letter is to address certain improper conduct including, without limitation, the making or publishing of false and defamatory statements about SDUIS by you and your company. We provide this letter in a further attempt to address these issues. We assume our initial attempts were not received because no response was provided. We contacted you several time in writing and by phone in January 2016. The matters addressed in this letter are extremely serious to SDUIS and the offending statements must stop immediately. Accordingly, as further discussed herein, SDUIS hereby demands that you (1) immediately cease and desist all unlawful, false and defamatory acts or publications; and (2) provide written assurances that all defamatory publications have been removed from your websites and no further such statements will be published. Based on the evidence SDUIS has obtained, it is clear that Yelp.com has engaged in hostile business practices that are intended to harass, defame or otherwise harm SDUIS. Under California law, these actions may constitute numerous torts including, without limitation, defamation, libel per se,' interference with prospective economic advantage or unfair business practices under California's Business and Professions Code sections 17200, et seg. The purpose 1 McGarry v. Univ. of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 97, 112; Yow v. National Enquirer, Inc. (F.D. Cal. 2008) 550 F. Supp. 2d 1179. of this letter is to advise you and Yelp.com of the grounds upon which legal action may be initiated against you and/or Yelp.com , and notify you that if immediate corrective action is not taken, SDUIS will take whatever actions it deems necessary in order to protect and defend its rights and interests. SDUIS has been in business for seventeen years and, in that time, has provided exceptional education programs for students from all over the world. Many of these students travel to the United States from abroad on student visas, administered by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (\"SEVP\"), through which SDUIS is certified. SDUIS has established a strong reputation, both in the local community and abroad, for the quality of its services and its strict adherence to the rules and regulations of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). Scott B. a member of Yelp.com , posted a false and defamatory message about SDUIS which Yelp.com published. The baseless and unmeritorious accusations, misrepresentations, and insinuations of wrongdoing published by Yelp.com have damaged SDUIS' reputation and adversely affected its business. Specifically, without limitation, you and/or Yelp.com , or others at their behest, purposefully published or disseminated false and misleading statements about SDUIS including: That SDUIS does not abide by DHS and SEVP rules; That SDUIS made false promises to students; That SDUIS does not provide classes to students. SDUIS is also aware of additional defamatory messages that have been published on Yelp.com by the following Yelp's members including: Dylan M. Chris R. Deb. D. Deniz A. These unmeritorious misrepresentations published on Yep.com have also damaged SDUIS' reputation and adversely affected its business. It is clear that these serious accusations against SDUIS are made without sufficient\u2014indeed, any\u2014evidence. The statements, or any statements of substantial similarity, are malicious, patently false and made without merit. The defamatory statements described herein have been disseminated to SDUIS students, other members of Yelp.com on-line communities, members or friends of Yelp.com's Facebook page and the community at large. They have and will continue to cause serious damage to SDUIS' reputation, business and future earnings. These statements are actionable misstatements and constitute defamation per se.2 California Civil Code sections 45, 45a, and 46; McGarry v. Univ. of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 97, 112. nstma ersari. President Furthermore YELP chose to hide many of the actual students positive reviews under \"reviews for San Diego University For Integrative Studies that are not currently recommended\". As an example of YELP unfair business practice, Jadel G., a current SDUIS student post a positive message on 1/24/2016, his message is hidden under \"not currently recommended\". In a phone call to YELP staff. SDUIS was told that if we paid a fee to YELP such positive messages would show on the top of the reviews. YELP is engaging in unfair business practice by demanding payment to post the positive reviews of SDUIS and emphasizing the negative reviews unless we pay YELP. SDUIS therefore demands that you: 1.Refrain from making or publishing any false accusations and defamatory statements about SDUIS, USA English Language Center, its students, faculty, and staff. 2.Immediately cease any and all publications of any and all defamatory statements about SDUIS, whether the statements are made by you or other third-parties; 3.Withdraw and retract all defamatory statements or publications about SDUIS published on any website under your control within twenty-four (24) hours. 4.Provide SDUIS, either directly or through counsel, written assurances that (1) all defamatory publications will immediately be stopped and all such statements have been withdrawn or retracted from Yelp.com websites; and (2) that no further defamatory statements will be published, in any form, by Yelp.com . 5.Close the San Diego University for Integrative Studies and USA English Language Center business page on a permanent basis and do not create a new page in the future. Please respond to this letter in writing by April 15, 2016, confirming that you have and will comply with SDUIS' demands. If you choose to ignore this letter, SDUIS will be forced to pursue whatever actions it deems necessary against you and/or Yelp.com , and any other persons or entities involved, without any further notice.

Bus. & Prof. \u00a7\u00a717200, et seq. The purpose of this letter is to advise you of the grounds upon which legal action may be initiated if you and/or Connect English will not cease and desist from engaging in the activities described herein. This is the second time we have faced this problem with your business we will be forced to take further legal action if you cannot comply with our demand to cease, desist, and correct your defamatory action. San Diego University for Integrative Studies has now been in business for over a decade and, in that time, has provided exceptional education programs for students from all over the world. Many of these students travel to the United States from abroad on student visas, administered by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (\"SEVP\"), through which SDUIS is certified. SDUIS has established a credible reputation, both in the local community and abroad, for the quality of its services and strict adherence to the rules and regulation of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). Your baseless and unmeritorious accusations, misrepresentations, and insinuations of wrongdoing, have damaged my client's reputation and adversely affected its business. We have been informed that you, Connect English, and others at your behest, have purposefully disseminated false and misleading statements about my client, including, without limitation: That SDUIS intended to illegally transfer a student to your institution in terminated status., That SDUIS does not abide by DHS and SEVP legalOsiluis.edu The above statements are utterly false, without merit, and to the extent that they depict SDUIS as engaging in fraudulent or unethical activity, constitute defamation per se. We are informed that you have communicated the above defamatory statements to SDUIS students, SDUIS staff members, and even DHS/SEVP. Your malicious attempts to spread these fabrications have caused serious damage to my client's reputation and its business, which, on that basis, are actionable under California Civil Code \u00a7\u00a745; 45a; 46. It is apparent that you and your organization have leveled serious accusations against SDUIS without sufficient evidence or information.

I, the undersigned, declare I am the ATTACHMENT L January 22, 2016 Cristina Versari, Ph.D. President, San Diego University for Integrative Studies 3900 Harney St. San Diego, CA 92110 Dear Dr. Versari: Based on my 20 years of experience working in Internet and Media Technologies, Public Relations and Digital Media it appears that a number of the highly ranked negative reviews posted on the SDUIS Yelp page are in violation of Yelp's Content Guidelines. It is my opinion that the problem your business is facing is related to a well known problem with Yelp online reviews: People who write Yelp reviews are often motivated by outside factors to write extreme and often negative reviews that do nor reflect the actual experience of most people including most students at SDUIS. A number of the highly critical reviews on the SDUIS page have been \"flagged\" or ordered to seek review by Yelp's Review Feedback Group. A primary problem with many of the negative Yelp reviews pertaining to SDUIS is that they do not appear to address a direct customer experience. I have personally canvased many of your students and heard stories that highly praise SDUIS staff and faculty. A surprising number of these flagged SDUIS reviews make general statements about SDUIS related to accreditation and/or compliance of federal study abroad policies. Both of these points are well beyond the scope of an individual student but could be the type of criticism that a competitor might make. The most highly viewed criticism is linked to the profile of a person who reviews and comments on spas and restaurants in the most glowing of terms. Another suspicious and highly critical reviewer is focused on the industries of housing, real estate services, and automotive. This sometimes occurs even though exchange of discounts, goods and services for positive Yelp reviews is also a violation of Yelp's content guidelines. Sincerely, (b)(6) David J. Baker, M.A., M.F.A.

SAN DIEGO UNIVERSITY FOR INTEGRATIVE STUDIES Derek Fisher, of the Los Angeles Lakers WHO WE ARE SAN DIEGO UNIVERSITY FOR INTEGRATIVE STUDIES 3900 HARNEY STREET, SAN DIEGO, CA 92110 WVVW.SDUIS.EDU January 18, 2011 WHO WE ARE History of San Diego University for Integrative Studies Founded in 1999, San Diego University for Integrative Studies has provided educational opportunities that have focused on the cultivation of professional expertise and personal development in the field of psychology and business. Committed to remaining open to innovation as a guiding principle in its development, the University development reflects the ever-changing needs of the times. The University was created by Dr. Cristina Versari, an internationally renowned Sport Psychology Consultant and University Administrator. The State of California Department of Consumer Affairs urged Dr. Versari to open a school to accommodate the students from a recently closed school where her Sport Psychology Program and other unique graduate level psychology programs had been offered. The San Diego University for Integrative Studies was created to provide those students continuity on their studies and the opportunity to complete their degrees. In April of 1999, the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy programs were awarded institutional approval by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education under the provisions of the California Education Code, Section 94310(b). The Bachelor of Arts, Doctor of Psychology, and Marriage and Family Therapy programs were added to the approved curriculum in May of 1999. In looking toward a new era of expansion and growth, the University has created new opportunities for education consistent with the needs of a society moving toward globalization. To address these concerns, expanded programs in psychology, business and English as a Second Language were developed and are fully operational. SDUIS was created to meet the needs of older professionals starting a second career and to train professionals in applied psychology. The University provides a professional and supportive environment for mature individuals who are seeking a positive change in their lives. We believe in the power of learning in community and collaborative relationships that lead to win-win situations. Historically, students have been embarking on one of life's great transitions: homemakers creating new roles and opportunities; accomplished professionals finding new directions and dimensions; recently retired professional athletes and military personnel looking for a new purpose or expression; professionals and paraprofessionals in human service who have been counseling peripherally while desiring enhanced techniques and the opportunity to enter private practice; licensed practitioners seeking a higher degree of competence and state of the art approaches; and, finally, those improving the quality of their personal, as well as professional lives. These are all sensitive, conscientious, responsible, and aware people in search of new significance and meaning. They are one very important aspect of what makes the learning experience at San Diego University for Integrative Studies so enriching. We believe that our students are themselves great teachers because of their many years of professional experience. We also believe that they have the capacity to make a difference in our collective future as agents of change in their professions and communities. The quality of the specialized education in the unique programs we offer cannot be found at any other school. Our awareness of the relationship between mind, body, and spirit forms the basis for a socially, culturally, and environmentally relevant educational process and experience which we call \"Integrative Studies\". SDUIS faculty is committed to providing a socially relevant and highly practical experience for students so that they may begin their career well prepared with the most current theoretical and practical knowledge available. SDU1S students bring a commitment to their growth and personal expansion so that they may make a difference in their professions and a genuine contribution to the world. OUR MISSION The mission of San Diego University for Integrative Studies is to provide an educational environment for mature adult learners that is built upon the foundations laid by the great humanistic traditions in Western civilization. Those traditions stem from the study and practice of art, philosophy, psychology, and business. The University provides academic and practical training to adults who seek personal and professional growth from an interdisciplinary approach to education. SDUIS programs acknowledge and include training in cultural diversity, Eastern philosophy, language, literature, science, and the arts. The University's mission is fulfilled by offering degree and nondegree programs in psychology and business. The institutional purposes of the University's educational programs include: Preparing students for academic and professional success through direct classroom or distance instruction, supervised practicum experience, and tutorial study with distinguished faculty who have demonstrated expertise in their respective fields; Measuring student achievement through examinations and evaluations of explicit demonstrations of academic competence with attention to professional ethical standards; Encouraging recognition of the rich diversity of peoples, cultures, and ideas that add to a chosen field of study through integrative educational programs and instructional methodologies; Providing the community access to continuing education programs, special lectures, and multi-cultural events. Planning for the growth of San Diego University for Integrative Studies through this century, the mission includes: 1.Expanding our distance learning programs using Internet and correspondence learning in combination with short-term residency requirements. 2.Developing new degree programs at the undergraduate level in Business, Communications, and Computer Application. 3.Seeking grants for research, publication, and community services. 4.Creating the SDUIS Counseling Center. 5.Completion of the formal action plan for accreditation review by Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) SDUIS 2010 GRADUATION CEREMONY OUR PHILOSOPHY Integrative education emphasizes personal development, maturity, and wisdom combined with technical and professional skills. The goal of San Diego University for Integrative Studies is to prepare a graduate who possesses the competence and the understanding to help others effectively. Learning at SDUIS is designed to cultivate competence in service to others and integrates academic and scholarly discipline with intuitive and spiritual understanding. Experience in applying the skills acquired and insights gained require intensive training, internships, and community service. Integrative studies and Humanistic psychology emerged as a consequence of reductionist, biological, and mechanistic views of human beings. Integrative studies follow a holistic model by acknowledging the individual's capacity for choice, setthealing, growth, and spirituality. The implementation of this model considers individuals in their many inseparable dimensions: mind, body, and spirit and in their social, cultural, and environmental contexts. The scope of integrative studies embrace areas and methods of inquiry based upon human experience and the contemporary issues men and women confront in their daily lives. Scholastically, integrative education combines cognitive and methodological skills with affective and intuitive skills. It recognizes that maturity and effectiveness are manifestations of perspective, experience, and self-knowledge. These attributes are not only assimilated through ordinary didactic instruction but are nurtured through experiential learning. The experiential component includes small group discussion, role-playing, case studies, student presentations, simulations, clinical internships and self-assessment. Integrative education requires a commitment to change, growth, and respect for perceptual and cultural diversity. OUR STUDENTS The University provides a supportive and creative environment for mature individuals who are seeking a positive change in their lives. Historically, SDUIS students have often been embarking on one of life's great transitions, such as: homemakers creating new roles and opportunities; accomplished professionals finding new directions and dimensions; recently retired professional athletes or military personnel looking for a new purpose; paraprofessionals in human services who have been counseling peripherally while desiring enhanced techniques and the opportunity to enter private practice; licensed practitioners seeking a higher degree of competence and state of the art approaches; and, those improving the quality of their personal as well as professional lives.
