A request for a review by an independent review organization must be made within 180 days after the date of the initial appeal decision notice. IX. Claims Claims for benefits may be made before or after services are obtained. KFHPWA recommends that the provider requests Preauthorization. In most instances, contracted providers submit claims directly to KFHPWA . If your provider does not submit a claim, t o mak e a claim for benefits, a Member must contact Member Services , or submit a claim for reimbursement as described below. Other inquiries, such as asking a health care provider about care or coverage, or submitting a prescription to a pharmacy, will not be co nsidered a claim for benefits. If a Member receives a bill for services the Member believes are covered, the Member must, within 90 days of the date of service, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, either (1) contact Member Services to make a cla im; (2) pay the bill and submit a claim for reimbursement of Covered Services ; or (3) for out -of-country claims (Emergency care only) - submit the claim and any associated medical records, including the type of service, charges, and proof of travel to KFHP WA, P.O. Box 30766, Salt Lake City, UT 84130 -0766 . In no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, shall a claim be accepted later than 1 year from the date of service.

Concurrent urgent requests - within 24 hours. Urgent care review requests - within 48 hours. Non-urgent preservice review requests - within 5 calendar days. Post-service review requests - within 30 calendar days. Timeframes for pre -service and post -service claims can be extended by KFHPWA for up to an additional 15 days. Members will be notified in writing of such extension prior to the expiration of the init ial timeframe. X. Coordination of Benefits The coordination of benefits (COB) provision applies when a Member has health care coverage under more than one plan. Plan is defined below. Kaiser Permanente Cascade Silver - 23 American Indian / Alaska Native No Cost Share CA-4209 -23 53 The order of benefit determination rules govern the order in which each plan will pay a claim for benefits. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan. The primary plan must pay benefits according to its policy terms without regard to the possibility that another plan may cover some expenses. The plan that pays after the primary plan is the secondary plan. In no event will a secondary plan be required to pay an amount in excess of its maximum benefit plus accrued savings. If the Member is covered by more than one health benefit plan, and the Member does not know which is the primary plan, the Member or the Member's provider should contact any one of the health plans to verify which plan is primary. The health plan the Member contacts is responsible for working with the other plan to determine which is primary and will let the Member know within 30 calendar days. All health plans have timely claim filing requirements. If the Member or the Member's provider fails to submit the Member's claim to a secondary health plan within that plan's claim filing time limit, the plan can deny the claim. If the Member experiences delays in the processing of the claim by the primary health plan, the Member or the Member's provider will need to submit the claim to the secondary health plan within its claim filing time limit to preven t a denial of the claim. If the Member is covered by more than one health benefit plan, the Member or the Member's provider should file all the Member's claims with each plan at the same time. If Medicare is the Member's primary plan, Medicare may submit the Member's claims to the Member's secondary carrier. Definitions. A. A plan is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for Members of a group , the separate contracts are considered parts of the same plan a nd there is no COB among those separate contracts. However, if COB rules do not apply to all contracts, or to all benefits in the same contract, the contract or benefit to which COB does not apply is treated as a separate plan. 1. Plan includes: group, in dividual or blanket disability insurance contracts and group or individual contracts issued by health care service contractors or health maintenance organizations (HMO), closed panel plans or other forms of group coverage; medical care components of long -term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; and Medicare or any other federal governmental plan, as permitted by law. 2. Plan does not include: hospital indemnity or fixed payment coverage or other fixed indemnity or fixed payment coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; limited benefit health coverage, as defined by state law; school accident type coverage; benefits for non -medical components of long -term care policies; automobile insurance policies require d by statute to provide medical benefits; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid coverage; or coverage under other federal governmental plans; unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage under Subsection 1. or 2. is a separate plan. If a plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate plan. B. This plan means, in a COB provision, the part of the contract providing the health care benefits to which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from this plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar be nefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. C. The order of benefit determination rules determine whether this plan is a primary plan or secondary plan when the Member has health care coverage under more than one plan. When this plan is primary, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other plan without considering any other plan's benefits. When this plan is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of Kaiser Permanente Cascade Silver - 23 American Indian / Alaska Native No Cost Share CA-4209 -23 54 another plan and must make payment in an amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the primary plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all plans for the claim equal 100% of the total allowable expense for that claim. This means that when this plan is secondary, it must pay the a mount which, when combined with what the primary plan paid, totals 100% of the allowable expense. In addition, if this plan is secondary, it must calculate its savings (its amount paid subtracted from the amount it would have paid had it been the primary p lan) and record these savings as a benefit reserve for the covered Member. This reserve must be used by the secondary plan to pay any allowable expenses not otherwise paid, that are incurred by the covered person during the claim determination period. D. Allowable Expense. Allowable expense is a health care expense, coinsurance or copayments and without reduction for any applicable deductible, that is covered at least in part by any plan covering the person. When a plan provides benefits in the form of ser vices, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any plan covering the Member is not an allowable expense. The following are examples of expenses that are not al lowable expenses: 1. The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an allowable expense, unless one of the plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. 2. If a Member is covered by two o r more plans that compute their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit is not an allowable expense. 3. If a Member is covered by two or more plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an allowable expense. 4. An expense or a portion of an expense that is not covered by any of the plans covering the person is not an allowable expense. E. Closed panel plan is a plan that provides health care benefits to covered persons in the form of services through a panel of providers who ar e primarily employed by the plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other providers, except in cases of Emergency or referral by a panel member. F. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. Order of Benefit Determination Rules. When a Member is covered by two or more plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows: A. The primary plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other plan. B. (1) Except as provided below (subsection 2) , a plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with this chapter is always primary unless the provisions of both plans state that the complying plan is primary. (2) Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is des igned to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage is excess to any other parts of the plan provided by the Contract Holder . Examples include major medical coverages that are superimposed over hospital a nd surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a closed panel plan to provide out -of-network benefits. Kaiser Permanente Cascade Silver - 23 American Indian / Alaska Native No Cost Share CA-4209 -23 55 C. A plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other plan. D. Each plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: 1. Non-Dependent or Dependent. The plan that covers the Member other than as a Dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, Contract Holder or retiree is the primary plan and the plan that covers the Member as a Dependent is the secondary plan . However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the plan covering the Member as a Dependent, and primary to the plan covering the Member as other than a Dependent (e.g., a retired employee), then the order of benefits between the two plans is reversed so that the plan covering the Member as an employee, member, policyholder, Contract Holder or retiree is the secondary plan and the other plan is the primary plan. 2. Dependent child covered under m ore than one plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a dependent child is covered by more than one plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: a) For a dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: The plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the primary plan; or If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the parent the longest is the primary plan. b) For a dep endent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: i. If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that plan is primary. This rule applies to claim determination periods commencing after the plan is given notice of the court decree; ii. If a court decree states one parent is to assume primary financial responsibility for the dependent child but does not mention responsibility for health care expenses, the plan of the parent assuming financial responsibility is primary; iii. If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of a) above determine the order of benefits; iv. If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expens es or health care coverage of the dependent child, the provisions of Subsection a) above determine the order of benefits; or v. If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the o rder of benefits for the child are as follows: The plan covering the custodial parent, first; The plan covering the spouse of the custodial parent, second; The plan covering the non -custodial parent, third; and then The plan covering the spouse of the non-custodial parent, last. c) For a dependent child covered under more than one plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of Subsection a) or b) above determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. 3. Active employee or retired or laid -off employee. The plan that covers a Member as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the primary plan. The plan covering that same Member as a retired or laid o ff employee is the secondary plan. The same would hold true if a Member is a Dependent of an active employee and that same Member is a Dependent of a retired or laid -off employee. If the other plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule under Section D(1) can determine the order of benefits. 4. COBRA or State Continuation Coverage. If a Member whose coverage is provided under COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law is covered under another plan, the plan Kaiser Permanente Cascade Silver - 23 American Indian / Alaska Native No Cost Share CA-4209 -23 56 covering the Member as an employee, member, Contract Ho lder or retiree or covering the Member as a Dependent of an employee, member, Contract Holder or retiree is the primary plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the secondary plan. If the other plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule under Section D.1. can determine the order of benefits. 5. Longer or shorter length of coverage. The plan that covered the Member as an employee, member, Contract Holder or retiree longer is the primary plan and the plan that covered the Member the shorter period of time is the secondary plan. 6. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the allowable expenses must be shared equally between the plans meeting the definition of plan. In addition, this plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the primary plan. Effect on the Benefits of this Plan. When this plan is secondary, it must make payment in a n amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the primary plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all plans for the claim equal one hundred percent of the total allowable expense for that claim. However, in no event shall the secondary plan be required to pay an amount in excess of its maximum benefit plus accrued savings. In no event should the Member be responsible for a deductible amount greater than the highest of the two deductibles. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information. Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under this plan and other plans. KFHPWA may get the facts it needs from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose o f applying these rules and determining benefits payable under this plan and other plans covering the Member claiming benefits. KFHPWA need not tell, or get the consent of, any Member to do this. Each Member claiming benefits under this plan must give KFHPW A any facts it needs to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. Facility of Payment. If payments that should have been made under this plan are made by another plan, KFHPWA has the right, at its discretion, to remit to the other plan the amount it determines appropriate to satisfy the intent of this provision. The amounts paid to the other plan are considered benefits paid under this plan. To the extent of such payments, KFHPWA is fully discharged from liability under this plan. Right of Recover y. KFHPWA has the right to recover excess payment whenever it has paid allowable expenses in excess of the maximum amount of payment necessary to satisfy the intent of this provision. KFHPWA may recover excess payment from any person to whom or for whom payment was made or any other issuers or plans. Questions about Coordination of Benefits? Contact the State Insurance Department. Effect of Medicare. Medicare primary/secondary payer guidelines and regulations will determine primary/secondary payer status, and will be adjudicated by KFHPWA as set forth in this section. KFHPWA will pay primary to Medicare when required by federal law. When Medicare, Part A and Part B or Part C are primary, Medicare's allowable amount is the highest allowable expense. When a Network Provider renders care to a Member who is eligible for Medicare benefits, and Medicare is deemed to be the primary bill payer under Medicare secondary payer guidelines and regulations, KFHPWA will seek Medicare reimbursement for all Medicare covered services. XI. Subrogation and Reimbursement Rights The benefits under this EOC will be available to a Member for injury or illness caused by another party, subject to the exclusions and limitations of this EOC . If KFHPWA provides benefits under this EOC for the treatment of the Kaiser Permanente Cascade Silver - 23 American Indian / Alaska Native No Cost Share CA-4209 -23 57 injury or illness, KFHPWA will be subrogated to any rights that the Member may have to recover compensation or damages related to the injury or illness and the Member shall reimburse KFHPWA for all benefits provided, from any amounts the Member received or is entitled to receive from any source on account of such injury or illness, whether by suit, settlement or otherwise , including but not limited to: Payments made by a third party or any insurance company on behalf of the third party ; Any payments or awards under an uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage policy; Any Workers' Compensation or disability award or settlement; Medical payments coverage under any automobile policy, premises or homeowners' medical payments coverage o r premises or homeowners' insurance coverage; and Any other payments from a source intended to compensate an Injured Person for injuries resulting from an accident or alleged negligence. This section more fully describes KFHPWA 's subrogation and reimburse ment rights. \"Injured Person\" under this section means a Member covered by the EOC who sustains an injury or illness and any spouse, dependent or other person or entity that may recover on behalf of such Member including the estate of the Member and, if t he Member is a minor, the guardian or parent of the Member. When referred to in this section, \"KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses\" means the expenses incurred and the value of the benefits provided by KFHPWA under this EOC for the care or treatment of the injury or illness sustained by the Injured Person. If the Injured Person's injuries were caused by a third party giving rise to a claim of legal liability against the third party and/or payment by the third party to the Injured Person and/or a settlement between t he third party and the Injured Person, KFHPWA shall have the right to recover KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses from any source available to the Injured Person as a result of the events causing the injury. This right is commonly referred to as \"subrogation.\" KFHPW A shall be subrogated to and may enforce all rights of the Injured Person to the full extent of KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses. By accepting benefits under this plan, the Injured Person also specifically acknowledges KFHPWA's right of reimbursement. This right of reimbursement attaches when this KFHPWA has provided benefits for injuries or illnesses caused by another party and the Injured Person or the Injured Person's representative has recovered any amounts from a third party or any o ther source of recovery. KFHPWA's right of reimbursement is cumulative with and not exclusive of its subrogation right and KFHPWA may choose to exercise either or both rights of recovery. In order to secure KFHPWA's recovery rights, the Injured Person agr ees to assign KFHPWA any benefits or claims or rights of recovery they may have under any automobile policy or other coverage, to the full extent of the plan's subrogation and reimbursement claims. This assignment allows KFHPWA to pursue any claim the Inj ured Person may have, whether or not they choose to pursue the claim. KFHPWA 's subrogation and reimbursement rights shall be limited to the excess of the amount required to fully compensate the Injured Person for the loss sustained, including general dam ages. Subject to the above provisions, if the Injured Person is entitled to or does receive money from any source as a result of the events causing the injury or illness, including but not limited to any liability insurance or uninsured/underinsured motorist fun ds, KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses are secondary, not primary. The Injured Person and their agents shall cooperate fully with KFHPWA in its efforts to collect KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses. This cooperation includes, but is not limited to, supplying KFHPWA with in formation about the cause of injury or illness, any potentially liable third parties, defendants and/or insurers related to the Injured Person's claim . The Injured Person shall notify KFHPWA within 30 days of any claim that may give rise to a claim for sub rogation or reimbursement. The Injured Person shall provide periodic updates about any facts that may impact KFHPWA 's right to reimbursement or subrogation as requested by KFHPWA , and shall inform KFHPWA of any settlement or other payments relating to the Injured Person's injury. The Injured Person and their agents shall permit KFHPWA , at KFHPWA 's option, to associate with the Injured Person or to intervene in any legal, quasi -legal, agency or any other action or claim filed. The Injured Person and their agents shall do nothing to prejudice KFHPWA 's subrogation and reimbursement rights. The Injured Person shall promptly notify KFHPWA of any tentative settlement with a third party and shall Kaiser Permanente Cascade Silver - 23 American Indian / Alaska Native No Cost Share CA-4209 -23 58 not settle a claim without protecting KFHPWA 's interest. The Injur ed Person shall provide 21 days advance notice to KFHPWA before there is a disbursement of proceeds from any settlement with a third party that may give rise to a claim for subrogation or reimbursement. If the Injured Person fails to cooperate fully with KFHPWA in recovery of KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses, and such failure prejudices KPHPWA's subrogation and/or reimbursement rights, the Injured Person shall be responsible for directly reimbursing KFHPWA for 100% of KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses. To the extent that the Injured Person recovers funds from any source that in any manner relate to the injury or illness giving rise to KFHPWA 's right of reimbursement or subrogation, the Injured Person agrees to hold such monies in trust or in a separate identifiable accoun t until KFHPWA 's subrogation and reimbursement rights are fully determined and that KFHPWA has an equitable lien over such monies to the full extent of KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses and/or the Injured Person agrees to serve as constructive trustee over the mon ies to the extent of KFHPWA 's Medical Expenses. In the event that such monies are not so held, the funds are recoverable even if they have been comingled with other assets, without the need to trace the source of the funds. Any party who distributes funds without regard to KFHPWA 's rights of subrogation or reimbursement will be personally liable to KFHPWA for the amounts so distributed. If reasonable collections costs have been incurred by an attorney for the Injured Person in connection with obtaining recovery, KFHPWA will reduce the amount of reimbursement to KFHPWA by the amount of an equitable apportionment of such collection costs between KFHPWA and the Injured Person. This reduction will be made only if each of the following conditions has been met: ( i) KFHPWA receives a list of the fees and associated costs before settlement and (ii) the Injured Person's attorney's actions were directly related to securing recovery for the Injured Party. Implementation of this section shall be deemed a part of claims administration and KFHPWA shall therefore have discretion to interpret its terms. XII.

Allowed Amount The level of benefits which are payable by KFHPWA when expenses are incurred from a non-Network Provider.
