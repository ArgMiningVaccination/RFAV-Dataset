Why? There are several reasons, including technical barriers (discussed later), but probably the most significant impediment to development is that wild-type Lm is a significant food-borne pathogen with increased virulence among immunocompromised individuals. While clinically apparent human infection is not common, with only approximately five cases per million people annually in the USA, acute infection - known as listeriosis - has a high mortality rate of 20-30%.[ [68](javascript:void(0);), [69](javascript:void(0);), [70](javascript:void(0);), [71](javascript:void(0);)] In healthy individuals, ingestion of foods contaminated with Lm commonly causes an acute gastroenteritis. However, in neonates, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with iron overload states and those who have a suppression of their cellular immunity, Lm can cause life-threatening infections. As the correlates of resistance and immunity to infection with Lm are both the innate and adaptive cellular immune responses, it is not surprising that individuals receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids as treatment for cancer are susceptible to listeriosis.[ [71](javascript:void(0);)] Retrospective analysis by two major cancer centers revealed that the incidence and treatment of listeriosis in cancer patients was approximately tenfold higher than the rate observed in the general population.[ [72](javascript:void(0);), [73](javascript:void(0);)] Thus, a principal developmental challenge has been to develop Lm vaccine platforms that are sufficiently attenuated for clinical evaluation - including in patients with cancer - yet retain the immunologic potency of the wild-type organism. Essentially, five strategies have been taken to make Lm suitable as a vaccine platform, including: deletion of virulence genes affecting bacterial growth and cell-to-cell spread in vivo; aberrant expression of PrfA, the activator of Lm virulence genes; engineering of auxotroph mutant strains with limited capacity for intracellular growth; use of conditionally lethal mutants; and inactivation. While these Lm vaccine platform approaches are arranged in no particular order, notably, the first two examples have formed the basis for early-phase human clinical trials. Each of these strategies is summarized below and in [Table 2](javascript:showModal('T3');p ) . Deletion of Virulence Genes Of the five examples presented, development of live-attenuated vaccine platforms by deletion of virulence genes represents a 'tried-and-true' approach from the vaccinologist's handbook. The overall challenge of this approach is to remove the overt pathogenicity of an organism without significantly diminishing its immune potency. Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that actA deletion mutants (Lm actA) were attenuated 1000-fold - determined by the median lethal dose in mice - but retained the ability to elicit protective immunity in mice.[ [74](javascript:void(0);)] ActA mediates the polymerization of host cell actin at the pole of cytosolic bacterium resulting in motility, and invagination of neighboring cells through formation of cell protrusions known as listeriopods.[ [75](javascript:void(0);), [76](javascript:void(0);)] The safety of was enhanced by deletion of plcB (Lm actA/plcB), a gene encoding one of the two bacterial phospholipases C and required for release from the secondary vacuole.[ [77](javascript:void(0);)] Lm actA/plcB bacteria are absolutely deficient in cell-to-cell spread, and have a toxicity-immunogenicity profile that is similar to Lm actA-based vaccine strains. Notably, Lm actA/plcB has been evaluated in a human clinical study given via the oral route [Table 2](javascript:showModal('T4');p ) . attenuated in mouse virulence compared with wild-type Lm, the overall tissue tropism of both strains is probably not affected (particularly after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration), which may lead to toxicities that could impede clinical development. Lm encodes a multigene family of proteins known as internalins that contribute to the broad tropism of the bacterium by mediating invasion of particular cell types. For example, internalin B (InlB) mediates entry into host cells that express the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met).[ [75](javascript:void(0);), [78](javascript:void(0);)] We hypothesized that while infection of nonphagocytic cells, such as hepatocytes, contributed to Lm toxicity, the ability to infect these cells is not required for vaccine potency and is thus dispensable. The combined deletions of actA and inlB (Lm actA/inlB), largely blocked growth in hepatocytes, either by direct infection or through cell-to-cell spread from adjacently infected Kupffer cells.[ [62](javascript:void(0);)] While bacterial growth in the liver of mice given single intravenous injections of Lm actA or as wild-type Lm, Lm actA/inlB was rapidly cleared from the liver. Liver toxicity in mice as measured by serum liver function tests (LFTs), alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase significantly lower in with intravenous actA/inlB as compared with Lm actA or wild-type Lm. Furthermore, liver toxicity was minimal and not dose limiting in two toxicology studies conducted under good laboratory practices (GLPs) conditions performed in cynomolgus monkeys given escalating doses of Lm actA/inlB-based strains (Brockstedt et al., Unpublished Data). While Lm actA/inlB is only slightly more attenuated in mouse virulence as compared with Lm actA, the Lm actA strain may not be acceptable for clinical applications due to liver toxicity, particularly those using intravenous administration. The overall tolerability of various Lm-based immunotherapies in humans will be dose dependent and will need to be empirically determined. However, vaccine strains that have a broad therapeutic window, as defined by dose-limiting toxicities that are significantly greater than the dose required to elicit a desired response, will probably have the best utility. Significantly, Lm actA/inlB-based vaccines were shown to segregate immunogenicity from toxicity of wild-type Lm as this platform retained the potency of the fully virulent bacterium. The Lm actA/inlB vaccine strain has been the basis for two US FDA-approved Phase I clinical studies [Table 2](javascript:showModal('T5');p ) . Finally, although there are a number of other mutants that may conceptually have an appropriate balance of attenuation and potency, they have not been developed extensively and are not discussed here. Aberrant PrfA Expression Another approach to attenuate wild-type Lm pathogenicity was developed by Paterson and colleagues and utilizes aberrant expression of PrfA.[ [64](javascript:void(0);)] The potency of this vaccine platform has been evaluated extensively in preclinical studies.[ [79](javascript:void(0);)] PrfA is a transcription factor activated intracellularly that acts as a central virulence regulator, serving to enable what has been described as the 'Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' dichotomy of Lm growth in mammals or as a saprophyte.[ [80](javascript:void(0);)] are completely avirulent.[ [81](javascript:void(0);)] In wild-type Lm, PrfA is expressed upon infection of host cells and, in turn, induces expression of the prfA regulon including the hly and plcA genes encoding LLO and phospholipase C, respectively. Heterologous antigen expression is also typically driven by a PrfA-dependent promoter. The prfA gene is deleted from the bacterial chromosome in the vaccine platform utilized by Paterson, and is complemented by its placement on a pAM401-based multicopy plasmid, also encoding a designated heterologous antigen.[ [64](javascript:void(0);)] Plasmid maintenance and vaccine strain immunogenicity is selected for by the dependence on PrfA for intracellular growth and antigen expression. While placement of prfA on a plasmid reduces virulence in mice by 3-4 logs, all of the bacterial virulence determinants of wild-type Lm are maintained in the vaccine strain. Thus, the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of this vaccine strain are not completely understood. One probable mechanism responsible for the attenuation may be aberrant PrfA expression - either its level or temporal pattern of expression - due to placement of the prfA gene on a plasmid. In addition, maintenance of a multicopy plasmid in vivo may slow the bacterial doubling time, and as a result attenuate the organism relative to wild-type Lm. As the full genetic complement of wild-type Lm is retained, the strain has the conceptual possibility of reversion to wild-type, in the event of recombination of the plasmid with the host bacterial chromosome. A vaccine strain expressing human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E7 known as Lm-LLO-E7 has been shown to have potent therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing TC-1 tumors,[ [64](javascript:void(0);), [82](javascript:void(0);)] and has also been evaluated in an early-phase clinical study conducted by Advaxis outside the USA in women with advanced cervical cancer due to HPV16 [Table 2](javascript:showModal('T6');p ) . Continuing clinical evaluation of this strain, known as Lovaxin C, in women with advanced cervical dysplasia as a result of chronic HPV16 infection, is planned. Auxotroph Mutant Strains The development of vaccine platforms based on auxotroph mutant strains has been a well-used tool in the vaccinologist's toolbox to attenuate wild-type bacteria. Auxotrophic strains lack the capability to synthesize a required metabolic enzyme and must be exogenously supplied with the missing metabolite in order to survive. The aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway has been a common target to generate attenuated vaccines, and has been used to derive vaccine strains for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and for Shigella flexneri.[ [83](javascript:void(0);)] This approach was used by Goebel and who found that Lm aroA, aroB, or aroA/B mutants wild-type Lm.[ [84](javascript:void(0);), [85](javascript:void(0);)] However, the ability of Lm aro auxotrophes to elicit immunity against an encoded antigen was not tested. A unique approach for deriving a highly attenuated Lm vaccine strain was developed by Frankel, Portnoy and colleagues, and is based on deletion of two genes, dal and dat, which are required for biosynthesis of D-alanine, a component of peptioglycan and lipoteichoic acid.[ [86](javascript:void(0);)] The prototype vaccine strain, known as Lmdd, requires an exogenous supply of D-alanine for growth. Lmdd immunogenicity is dependent upon a minimal amount of bacterial growth in vivo, which is facilitated by coadministering D-alanine upon vaccination. Lmdd/Gag has been shown to be rapidly cleared in mice, induce long-lived protective immunity against wild-type Lm challenge, HIV Gag-specific cellular and humoral immunity in rhesus monkeys using a combined oral and intramuscular vaccination regimen.[ [90](javascript:void(0);)] Toward eventual testing in humans, a transient supply of D-alanine is not required for growth and immunogenicity of the recently described versions of the Lmdd vector. This breakthrough has been accomplished by using either isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible or recombinase-sensitive expression of the Bactillus subtilis dal which transiently complements the Lmdd conditionally lethal phenotype.[ [91](javascript:void(0);)] The vector has been further refined by reducing the expression of B. subtilis dal racemase to a level sufficient to only partially complement the Lm dal/dat mutation, by both truncating the upstream noncoding region and adding a ssR tag at the 3\u00b4 end of the racemase gene to target the expressed protein for degradation.[ [92](javascript:void(0);)] The modified vector is attenuated in mice by 4 logs compared with wild-type Lm, and was recently shown to elicit strong functional mucosal cellular immunity in the vagina of mice when used as a component of a heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimen with an adenovirus vector.[ [93](javascript:void(0);)] Although not described, the potential toxicity of the modified Lmdd vector could be reduced further by targeted deletion of particular bacterial virulence genes that are not required for vaccine immunogenicity. Suicidal Mutants and 'Bactofection' While Lm-based vaccines are being developed owing to their immunologic potency, the construction of recombinant strains that abundantly express and secrete a designated antigen can be problematic (discussed in detail later). As immune potency is directly related to efficiency of antigen expression and secretion, this represents a significant technical hurdle.[ [94](javascript:void(0);)] Furthermore, in contrast to viral vectors, antigens expressed by the bacterial prokaryotic machinery lack the post-translational modifications and/or structural conformation of particular class II T-cell epitopes as well as antibody epitopes. To address these challenges, Goebel and colleagues have developed means to utilize Lm as a vector to deliver plasmid DNA or mRNA into mammalian cells, thereby using the host cell for antigen expression.[ [95](javascript:void(0);)] In a clever engineering maneuver, the release of plasmid DNA or RNA into the cytoplasm of the infected cell is accomplished by expressing a bacteriophage lysin in the cytoplasm. This is temporally controlled by linking expression to the actA promoter, which is significantly upregulated in the host cell cytoplasm. Lm-mediated plasmid delivery - so-called 'bactofection' - has been shown to elicit CD8+ T cells specific for the antigen encoded by the plasmid DNA and slow the rate of tumor growth in vaccinated mice. To increase the efficiency of the suicidal Lm vectors, the system has been refined further by transcribing mRNA directly from the bacterial chromosome. Eukaryotic translation of the resulting RNA is assumed through insertion of an internal ribosome entry site at the 5\u00b4 end of the RNA.[ [96](javascript:void(0);)] High transcription levels of the cap-independent RNA and expression of its encoded antigen is accomplished by coexpression of the T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase. Unfortunately, both the suicidal Lm-mediated bactofection and RNA delivery platforms are far less potent than Lm vaccine strains directly encoding a designated antigen.[ [97](javascript:void(0);), [98](javascript:void(0);), [99](javascript:void(0);)] Although conceptually attractive, these vectors will require further development before advancement to the clinics. Inactivation While several approaches have been taken to attenuate wild-type Lm, each strategy is based on live bacteria. For particular applications, such as widespread immunization in a population with a significant level of endemic HIV infection, live vaccines may be unacceptable. Although killed vaccines have a desirable safety profile, a well-known dichotomy in the mouse listeriosis model is that only live strains of Lm prime potent T-cell memory that protects mice against bacterial challenge; vaccination with LLO-deleted Lm (Lm hly) or with heat-killed Lm does not elicit functional T cells or induce protective immunity.[ [34](javascript:void(0);), [35](javascript:void(0);), [36](javascript:void(0);)] However, two recent investigations that utilized alternative approaches to inactivate Lm showed that there can be exceptions to this dogma. In one approach, the immunologic potency of Lm that was inactivated by -irradiation (IRL) was investigated.[ [100](javascript:void(0);)] Mice vaccinated with IRL showed a small (1-2 logs) but significant decrease in tissue colony forming units (cfu) upon lethal challenge with wild-type Lm, leading the authors to conclude that cytosolic access was not necessary to induce protective immunity. However, as secondary expansion of CD8+ T cells was minimal following multiple immunizations, and the level of protection afforded was comparable with Lm hly, it would seem that in its present form IRL lacks sufficient potency for continued development in its current state. In an alternative approach, we developed a novel category of vaccines known as 'killed but metabolically active' (KBMA), which is based on Lm strains with defective nucleotide excision repair (NER) through deletion of uvrA and uvrB (Lm uvrAB). Together with uvrC, these genes encode the exinuclease complex, which initiates the NER pathway of DNA repair.[ [101](javascript:void(0);)] KBMA vaccines are exquisitely sensitive to photochemical inactivation by the combined treatment with psoralen, a DNA cross-linking reagent, and long-wave UV light. The overall level of DNA cross-linking is low enough that KBMA Lm vaccines can transiently express their gene products, allowing them to escape the phagolysosome and induce functional cellular immunity and protection against wild-type Lm and vaccinia virus challenge. KBMA vaccines have been constructed on the Lm actA/inlB background, meaning that any bacteria that escape photochemical inactivation during the manufacturing process will be attenuated. We demonstrated recently that the addition of PrfA* significantly enhances the potency of KBMA PrfA that result in the constitutive activation of PrfA-dependent genes are known collectively as peptide chain release factor (PrfA*) mutants. In addition to proteins required for Lm vaccine potency, such as LLO and PlcA, whose expression is PrfA dependent, expression of the encoded heterologous antigen is also typically PrfA dependent. We found that a prime-boost immunization regimen with KBMA PrfA* G155S vaccines elicited functional cellular immunity following intramuscular immunization that was comparable with live-attenuated Lm vaccines. KBMA Lm vaccines have a theoretically improved risk-to-benefit profile compared with live-attenuated vaccines that may improve the prospects for adoption and/or approval, particularly in prophylactic settings. The KBMA vaccine strategy has been extended to both Salmonella typhimurium[ [103](javascript:void(0);)] and Bacillus anthracis vaccines (Skoble et al., manuscript submitted). These two examples are illustrative of the potential broad application of the KBMA approach to other recombinant bacterial vaccine platforms or bacteria for which the neutralization determinants are unknown or incompletely characterized.
