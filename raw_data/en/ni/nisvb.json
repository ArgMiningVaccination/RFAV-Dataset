For the purpose of these rules, relative to the administration of deep sedation, general anesthesia, moderate sedation, minimal sedation, and nitrous oxide inhalation analgesia by licensed dentists, the following definitions shall apply: \" ACC \" means the anesthesia credentials committee of the board. \" ASA \" refers to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Patient Physical Status Classification System. Category I means normal healthy patients, and category II means patients with mild systemic disease. Category III means patients with severe systemic disease, and category IV means patients with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life. \" Boar d \" means the Iowa dental board established in Iowa Code section 147.14(1) \"d.\" \" Capnography \" means the monitoring of the concentration of exhaled carbon dioxide in order to assess physiologic status or determine the adequacy of ventilation during anesthesia. \" Curr ent ACLS or P ALS certification \" means current certification in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) or pediatric advanced life support (P ALS). Current certification means certification by an or ganization on an annual basis or , if that certifying or ganization requires certification on a less frequent basis, evidence that the individual has been properly certified for each year covered by the renewal period. The course for the purposes of certification must include a clinical component. \" DAANCE \" means the dental anesthesia assistant national certification examination as of fered by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Sur geons (AAOMS). \" Deep sedation \" means drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway , and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. \" Facility \" means any dental of fice or clinic where sedation is used in the practice of dentistry . The term \"facility\" does not include a hospital. \" General anesthesia \" means a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway , and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired. \" Licensed sedation pr ovider \" means a physician anesthesiologist currently licensed by the Iowa board of medicine or a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) currently licensed by the Iowa board of nursing. \" Minimal sedation \" means a minimally depressed level of consciousness produced by a pharmacological method that retains the patient' s ability to independently and continuously maintain an airway and respond normally to tactile stimulation and verbal command. Although cognitive function and coordination may be modestly impaired, ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaf fected. A patient whose only response reflex is withdrawal from repeated painful stimuli is not considered to be in a state of minimal sedation. \" Moderate sedation \" means a drug-induced depression of consciousness, either by enteral or parenteral means, during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway , and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. A patient whose only response reflex is withdrawal from a painful stimulus is not considered to be in a state of moderate sedation. \" Monitoring nitr ous oxide inhalation analgesia \" means continually observing the patient receiving nitrous oxide and recognizing and notifying the dentist of any adverse reactions or complications. Ch 29, p. 2 Dental Board[650] IAC 1 1/6/19 \" MRD \" means the manufacturer ' s maximum recommended dose of a drug as printed in FDA-approved labeling. \" Nitr ous oxide inhalation analgesia \" refers to the administration by inhalation of a combination of nitrous oxide and oxygen producing an altered level of consciousness that retains the patient' s ability to independently and continuously maintain an airway and respond appropriately to physical stimulation or verbal command. \" Patient monitor \" means a dental assistant, dental hygienist, nurse or dentist whose primary responsibility is to continuously monitor a patient receiving moderate sedation, deep sedation or general anesthesia until the patient meets the criteria to be dischar ged to the recovery area. \" Pediatric \" means patients aged 12 or under . \" Permit holder \" means an Iowa licensed dentist who has been issued a moderate sedation or general anesthesia permit by the board. \" T ime-oriented anesthesia r ecor d \" means documentation at appropriate time intervals of drugs, doses and physiologic data obtained during patient monitoring.

Develop a written health program for DHCP that includes policies, procedures, and guidelinesfor education and training; immunizations; exposure prevention and derma- titis and latex hypersensitivity; and maintenance of records, data management, and confidential-ity (IB) ( 5,16-18,22). 2. Establish referral arrangements with qualified health-care professionals to ensure prompt andappropriate provision of preventive services, occupationally related medical services, and postexposure management with medical follow-up (IB, IC) (5,13,19,22). B. Education and T raining 1. Provide DHCP 1) on initial employment, 2) when new tasks or procedures affect the employee's occupational exposure, and 3) at a minimum, annually, with education and train-ing regarding occupational exposure to poten- tially infectious agents and infection-control procedures/protocols appropriate for and spe-cific to their assigned duties (IB, IC) (5,11,13,14,16,19,22 ). 2. Provide educational information appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level,literacy, and language of DHCP (IB, IC) ( 5,13). C. Immunization Programs 1. Develop a written comprehensive policy regard- ing immunizing DHCP , including a list of all required and recommended immunizations (IB) (5,17,18). 2. Refer DHCP to a prearranged qualified health- care professional or to their own health-care pro-fessional to receive all appropriate immunizationsbased on the latest recommendations as well as their medical history and risk for occupational exposure (IB) ( 5,17). D. Exposure Prevention and Postexposure Manage- comprehensive postexposure follow-up program (IB, IC) (5,13,14,19 ). a. Include policies and procedures for prompt reporting, evaluation, counseling, treatment,and medical follow-up of occupational exposures. b. Establish mechanisms for referral to a quali- fied health-care professional for medicalevaluation and follow-up. c. Conduct a baseline TST, preferably by using a two-step test, for all DHCP whomight have contact with persons with sus-pected or confirmed infectious TB, regard- less of the risk classification of the setting (IB) ( 20). E. Medical Conditions, Work-Related Illness, and Work Restrictions1. Develop and have readily available to all DHCP comprehensive written policies regarding work restriction and exclusion that include a statement of authority defining who can implement suchpolicies (IB) (5,22 ). 2. Develop policies for work restriction and exclu- sion that encourage DHCP to seek appropriatepreventive and curative care and report their illnesses, medical conditions, or tr eatments that can render them more susceptible to opportu- nistic infection or exposures; do not penalize DHCP with loss of wages, benefits, or job sta- tus (IB) ( 5,22). IDB Manual Page 5140 MMWR December 19, 2003 3. Develop policies and procedures for evaluation, diagnosis, and management of DHCP with sus- pected or known occupational contact dermati- tis (IB) (32 ). 4. Seek definitive diagnosis by a qualified health- care professional for any DHCP with suspectedlatex allergy to carefully determine its specificetiology and appropriate treatment as well as work restrictions and accommodations (IB) ( 32). F . Records Maintenance, Data Management, and Confidentiality1. Establish and maintain confidential medical records (e.g., immunization records and docu- mentation of tests received as a result of occupa- tional exposure) for all DHCP (IB, IC) (5,13 ). 2. Ensure that the practice complies with all appli- cable federal, state, and local laws regardingmedical recordkeeping and confidentiality (IC) (13,34). II. Preventing Transmission of Bloodborne Pathogens A. HBV Vaccination 1. Offer the HBV vaccination series to all DHCP with potential occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material (IA, IC) (2,13,14,19). 2. Always follow U.S. Public Health Service/CDC recommendations for hepatitis B vaccination,serologic testing, follow-up, and booster dosing(IA, IC) T est DHCP for anti-HBs 1-2 completion of the 3-dose vaccination series (IA,IC) ( 14,19). 4. DHCP should complete a second 3-dose vac- cine series or be evaluated to determine if theyare HBsAg-positive if no antibody response occurs to the primary vaccine series (IA, IC) (14,19). 5. Retest for anti-HBs at the completion of the sec- ond vaccine series. If no response to the second3-dose series occurs, nonresponders should betested for HBsAg (IC) ( 14,19). 6. Counsel nonresponders to vaccination who are HBsAg-negative regarding their susceptibility toHBV infection and precautions to take (IA, IC) (14,19). 7. Provide employees appropriate education regard- ing the risks of HBV transmission and the avail-ability of the vaccine. Employees who declinethe vaccination should sign a declination form to be kept on file with the employer (IC) ( 13). B. Preventing Exposures to Blood and OPIM 1. General recommendations a. Use standard precautions (OSHA's blood- borne pathogen standard retains the termuniversal precautions) for all patient encoun-ters (IA, IC) ( 11,13,19,53 ). b. Consider sharp items (e.g., needles, scalers, burs, lab knives, and wires) that are contami-nated with patient blood and saliva as potentially infective and establish engineer- ing controls and work practices to preventinjuries (IB, IC) ( 6,13,113). c. Implement a written, comprehensive pro- gram designed to minimize and manageDHCP exposures to blood and body fluids (IB, IC). ( 13,14,19,97). 2. Engineering and work-practice controls a. Identify, evaluate, and select devices with engineered safety features at least annually and as they become available on the market(e.g., safer anesthetic syringes, blunt suture needle, retractable scalpel, or IV systems) (IC) (13,97,110-112). b. Place used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items inappropriate puncture-resistant containerslocated as close as feasible to the area in which the items are used (IA, IC) ( 2,7,13,19,113, 115). c. Do not recap used needles by using both hands or any other technique that involves directing the point of a needle toward anypart of the body. Do not bend, break, or remove needles before disposal (IA, IC) (2,7,8,13,97,113 ). d. Use either a one-handed scoop technique or a mechanical device designed for holding the needle cap when recapping needles (e.g.,between multiple injections and before removing from a aspirating syringe) (IA, IC) ( 2,7,8,13,14,113 ). 3. a. after percu- taneous, mucous membrane, or nonintactskin exposur e to blood or other potentially infectious material (IA, IC) ( 13,14,19 ). IDB Manual Page 52Vol. 52 / RR-17 Recommendations and Reports 41 III. Hand Hygiene A. General Considerations 1. Perform hand hygiene with either a nonantimicrobial or antimicrobial soap and water when hands are visibly dirty or contami- nated with blood or other potentially infectious material. If hands are not visibly soiled, an alco-hol-based hand rub can also be used. Follow the manufacturer's instructions (IA) ( 123). 2. Indications for hand hygiene include a. when hands are visibly soiled (IA, IC);b. after barehanded touching of inanimate objects likely to be contaminated by blood, saliva, or respiratory secretions (IA, IC); c. before and after treating each patient (IB);d. before donning gloves (IB); ande. immediately after removing gloves (IB, IC) (7-9,11,13,113,120-123,125,126,138 ). 3. For oral surgical procedures, perform surgical hand antisepsis before donning sterile surgeon's gloves. Follow the manufacturer's instructions by using either an antimicrobial soap and water, orsoap and water followed by drying hands and application of an alcohol-based surgical hand- scrub product with persistent activity (IB) ( 121- 123,127-133,144,145 ). 4. Store liquid hand-care products in either dispos- able closed containers or closed containers thatcan be washed and dried before refilling. Do not add soap or lotion to (i.e., top off) a partially empty dispenser (IA) ( 9,120,122,149,150 ). B. Special Considerations for Hand Hygiene and Glove Use1. Use hand lotions to prevent skin dryness associ- ated with handwashing (IA) (153,154). 2. Consider the compatibility of lotion and anti- septic products and the effect of petroleum orother oil emollients on the integrity of gloves during product selection and glove use (IB) (2,14,122,155). 3. Keep fingernails short with smooth, filed edges to allow thorough cleaning and prevent glovetears (II) ( 122,123,156). 4. Do not wear artificial fingernails or extenders when having direct contact with patients at highrisk (e.g., those in intensive care units or operat-ing rooms) (IA) ( 123,157-160). 5. Use of artificial fingernails is usually not recom- mended (II) (157-160).6. Do not wear hand or nail jewelry if it makes donning gloves more difficult or compromises the fit and integrity of the glove (II) ( 123,142, 143). IV. PPE A. Masks, Protective Eyewear, and Face Shields 1. Wear a surgical mask and eye protection with solid side shields or a face shield to protectmucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth during procedures likely to generate splashingor spattering of blood or other body fluids (IB, IC) (1,2,7,8,11,13,137 ). 2. Change masks between patients or during patient treatment if the mask becomes wet (IB)(2). 3. Clean with soap and water, or if visibly soiled, clean and disinfect reusable facial protectiveequipment (e.g., clinician and patient protec- tive eyewear or face shields) between patients (II)(2). B. Protective Clothing 1. Wear protective clothing (e.g., reusable or dis- posable gown, laboratory coat, or uniform) that covers personal clothing and skin (e.g., forearms) likely to be soiled with blood, saliva, or OPIM(IB, IC) ( 7,8,11,13,137 ). 2. Change protective clothing if visibly soiled (134 ); change immediately or as soon as feasible if pen-etrated by blood or other potentially infectious fluids (IB, IC) (13 ). 3. Remove barrier protection, including gloves, mask, eyewear, and gown before departing workarea (e.g., dental patient care, instrument pro- cessing, or laborator y areas) (IC) ( 13). C. Gloves 1. Wear medical gloves when a potential exists for contacting blood, saliva, OPIM, or mucousmembranes (IB, IC) ( 1,2,7,8,13). 2. Wear a new pair of medical gloves for each patient, remove them promptly after use, and wash hands immediately to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environ- ments (IB) ( 1,7,8,123). 3. Remove gloves that are torn, cut, or punctured as soon as feasible and wash hands before regloving (IB, IC) ( 13,210,211). 4. Do not wash surgeon's or patient examination gloves before use or wash, disinfect, or sterilizegloves for reuse Manual Page 5342 MMWR December 19, 2003 5. Ensure that appropriate gloves in the correct size are readily accessible (IC) ( 13). 6. Use appropriate gloves (e.g., puncture- and chemical-resistant utility gloves) when cleaning instruments and performing housekeeping tasks involving contact with blood or OPIM (IB, IC) (7,13,15). 7. Consult with glove manufacturers regarding the chemical compatibility of glove material anddental materials used (II). D. Sterile Surgeon's Gloves and Double Gloving During Oral Surgical Procedures1. Wear sterile surgeon's gloves when performing oral surgical procedures (IB) ( 2,8,137). 2. No recommendation is offered regarding the effectiveness of wearing two pairs of gloves toprevent disease transmission during oral surgi- cal procedures. The majority of studies among HCP and DHCP have demonstrated a lower fre-quency of inner glove perforation and visible blood on the surgeon's hands when double gloves are worn; however, the effectiveness of wearingtwo pairs of gloves in preventing disease trans- mission has not been demonstrated (Unresolved issue). V. Contact Dermatitis and Latex Hypersensitivity A. General Recommendations 1. Educate DHCP regarding the signs, symptoms, and diagnoses of skin reactions associated with fre- quent hand hygiene and glove use (IB) ( 5,31,32 ). 2. Screen all patients for latex allergy (e.g., take health history and refer for medical consulta-tion when latex allergy is suspected) (IB) (32 ). 3. Ensure a latex-safe environment for patients and DHCP with latex allergy (IB) (32 ). 4. Have emergency treatment kits with latex-free products available at all times (II) ( 32). VI. Sterilization and Disinfection of Patient-Care Items A. General Recommendations 1. Use only FDA-cleared medical devices for ster- ilization and follow the manufacturer's instruc-tions for correct use (IB) ( 248). 2. Clean and heat-sterilize critical dental before each use 246,249,407 ). each use (IB) (2,249,260,407 ). 4. Allow packages to dry in the sterilizer before they are handled to avoid contamination (IB) ( 247).5. Use of heat-stable semicritical alternatives is ( 2). 6. Reprocess heat-sensitive critical and semi-criti- cal instruments by using FDA-cleared sterilant/ high-level disinfectants or an FDA-cleared low- temperature sterilization method (e.g., ethylene oxide). Follow manufacturer's instructions for useof chemical sterilants/high-level disinfectants (IB) ( 243). 7. Single-use disposable instruments are acceptable alternatives if they are used only once and dis-posed of correctly (IB, IC) ( 243,383). 8. Do not use liquid chemical sterilants/high-level disinfectants for environmental surface disinfec-tion or as holding solutions (IB, IC) ( 243,245 ). 9. Ensure that noncritical patient-care items are barrier-protected or cleaned, or if visibly soiled,cleaned and disinfected after each use with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant. If visiblycontaminated with blood, use an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with a tuberculocidal claim (i.e., intermediate level) (IB) ( 2,243,244). 10. Inform DHCP of all OSHA guidelines for exposure to chemical agents used for disinfec-tion and sterilization. Using this report, identifyareas and tasks that have potential for exposure (IC) ( 15). B.Instrument Processing Area 1. Designate a central processing area. Divide the instrument processing area, physically or, at a minimum, spatially, into distinct areas for1) receiving, cleaning, and decontamination; 2) preparation and packaging; 3) sterilization; and 4) storage. Do not store instruments in anarea where contaminated instruments are held or cleaned (II) ( 173,247,248 ). 2. T rain DHCP to employ work practices that pre- vent contamination of clean areas (II). C. Receiving, Cleaning, and Decontamination Work Area1. Minimize handling of loose contaminated instruments during transport to the instrumentprocessing area. Use work-practice controls (e.g.,carry instruments in a covered container) to minimize exposure potential (II). Clean all vis- ible blood and other contamination from den-tal instruments and devices before sterilization or disinfection procedures (IA) ( 243,249-252 ). 2. Use automated cleaning equipment (e.g., ultra- sonic cleaner or washer-disinfector) to remove IDB Manual Page 54Vol. 52 / RR-17 Recommendations and Reports 43 debris to improve cleaning effectiveness and decrease worker exposure to blood (IB) ( 2,253). 3. Use work-practice controls that minimize con- tact with sharp instruments if manual cleaningis necessary (e.g., long-handled brush) (IC) ( 14). 4. Wear puncture- and chemical-resistant/heavy- duty utility gloves for instrument cleaning anddecontamination procedures (IB) (7 ). 5. Wear appropriate PPE (e.g., mask, protective eyewear, and gown) when splashing or sprayingis anticipated during cleaning (IC) ( 13). D. Preparation and Packaging 1. Use an internal chemical indicator in each pack- age. If the internal indicator cannot be seen from outside the package, also use an external indica- tor (II) (243,254,257). 2. Use a container system or wrapping compatible with the type of sterilization process used andthat has received FDA clearance (IB) ( 243,247, 256). 3. Before sterilization of critical and semicritical instruments, inspect instruments for cleanliness,then wrap or place them in containers designed to maintain sterility during storage (e.g., cassettes and organizing trays) (IA) ( 2,247,255,256). E. Sterilization of Unwrapped Instruments 1. Clean and dry instruments before the unwrapped sterilization cycle (IB) ( 248). 2. Use mechanical and chemical indicators for each unwrapped sterilization cycle (i.e., place aninternal chemical indicator among the instru-ments or items to be sterilized) (IB) (243,258 ). 3. Allow unwrapped instruments to dry and cool in the sterilizer before they are handled to avoidcontamination and thermal injury (II) ( 260). 4. Semicritical instruments that will be used immediately or within a short time can be ster-ilized unwrapped on a tray or in a container sys- tem, provided that the instruments are handled aseptically during removal from the sterilizer andtransport to the point of use (II). 5. Critical instruments intended for immediate reuse can be sterilized unwrapped if the instru-ments are maintained sterile during removal from the sterilizer and transport to the point of use (e.g., transported in a sterile covered container)(IB) ( 258). 6. Do not sterilize implantable devices unwrapped (IB) ( 243,247 ).7. Do not store critical instruments unwrapped (IB) (248). F . Sterilization Monitoring 1. Use mechanical, chemical, and biological moni- tors according to the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the effectiveness of the sterilization process (IB) ( 248,278,279). 2. Monitor each load with mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, and pressure) and chemical indi-cators (II) (243,248 ). 3. Place a chemical indicator on the inside of each package. If the internal indicator is not visiblefrom the outside, also place an exterior chemi-cal indicator on the package (II) ( 243,254,257 ). 4. Place items/packages correctly and loosely into the sterilizer so as not to impede penetration ofthe sterilant (IB) ( 243). 5. Do not use instrument packs if mechanical or chemical indicators indicate inadequate process-ing (IB) ( 243,247,248 ). 6. Monitor sterilizers at least weekly by using a bio- logical indicator with a matching control (i.e.,biological indicator and control from same lot number) (IB) ( 2,9,243,247,278,279 ). 7. Use a biological indicator for every sterilizer load that contains an implantable device. Verifyresults before using implantable device, whenever possible (IB) ( 243,248 ). 8.The following are recommended in the case of a positive spore test:a. Remove the sterilizer from service and review sterilization procedures (e.g., work practices and use of mechanical and chemi-cal indicators) to determine whether opera-tor error could be responsible (II) ( 8). b. Retest the sterilizer by using biological, mechanical, and chemical indicators aftercorrecting any identified pr ocedural prob- lems (II). c . If the repeat spore test is negative, and mechanical and chemical indicators are within normal limits, put the sterilizer back in service (II) (9,243 ). 9. The following are recommended if the repeat spore test is positive:a. Do not use the sterilizer until it has been inspected or repaired or the exact reason for the positive test has been determined (II) (9,243). IDB Manual Page 5544 MMWR December 19, 2003 b. Recall, to the extent possible, and reprocess all items processed since the last negative spore test (II) ( 9,243,283 ). c. Before placing the sterilizer back in service, rechallenge the sterilizer with biologicalindicator tests in three consecutive empty chamber sterilization cycles after the causeof the sterilizer failure has been determined and corrected (II) ( 9,243,283 ). 10. Maintain sterilization records (i.e., mechanical, chemical, and biological) in compliance withstate and local regulations (IB) ( 243). G. Storage Area for Sterilized Items and Clean Dental Supplies1. Implement practices on the basis of date- or event-related shelf-life for storage of wrapped, sterilized instruments and devices (IB) ( 243, 284). 2. Even for event-related packaging, at a minimum, place the date of sterilization, and if multiple sterilizers are used in the facility, the sterilizer used, on the outside of the packaging materialto facilitate the retrieval of processed items in the event of a sterilization failure (IB) ( 243,247 ). 3. Examine wrapped packages of sterilized instru- ments before opening them to ensure the bar-rier wrap has not been compromised during storage (II) ( 243,284 ). 4. Reclean, repack, and resterilize any instrument package that has been compromised (II). 5. Store sterile items and dental supplies in cov- ered or closed cabinets, if possible (II) ( 285). VII. Environmental Infection Control A. General Recommendations 1. Follow the manufacturers' instructions for cor- rect use of products (IB, IC) ( 243-245 ). 2. Do not use liquid chemical sterilants/high-level disinfectants for disinfection of environmentalsurfaces (clinical contact or housekeeping) (IB,IC) ( 243-245 ). 3. Use PPE, as appropriate, when cleaning and dis- infecting environmental surfaces. Such equip-ment might include gloves (e.g., puncture- and chemical-resistant utility), protective clothing (e.g., gown, jacket, or lab coat), and protectiveeyewear/face shield, and mask (IC) ( 13,15). B. Clinical Contact Surfaces 1. Use surface barriers to protect clinical contact surfaces, particularly those that are difficult toclean (e.g., switches on dental chairs) and changesurface barriers between patients (II) ( 1,2,260, 288). 2. Clean and disinfect clinical contact surfaces that are not barrier-protected, by using an EPA- registered hospital disinfectant with a low- (i.e., HIV and HBV label claims) to intermediate-level(i.e., tuberculocidal claim) activity after each patient. Use an intermediate-level disinfectant if visibly contaminated with blood (IB)(2,243,244 ). C. Housekeeping Surfaces 1. Clean housekeeping surfaces (e.g., floors, walls, and sinks) with a detergent and water or an EPA- registered hospital disinfectant/detergent on a routine basis, depending on the nature of thesurface and type and degree of contamination, and as appropriate, based on the location in the facility, and when visibly soiled (IB) ( 243,244 ). 2. Clean mops and cloths after use and allow to dry before reuse; or use single-use, disposablemop heads or cloths (II) fresh cleaning or EPA-registered disin- fecting solutions daily and as instructed by themanufacturer. (II) ( 243,244 ). 4. Clean walls, blinds, and window curtains in patient-care areas when they are visibly dusty orsoiled (II) ( 9,244). D. Spills of Blood and Body Substances 1.Clean spills of blood or OPIM and decontami- nate surface with an EPA-registered hospital dis-infectant with low- (i.e., HBV and HIV label claims) to intermediate-level (i.e., tuberculocidal claim) activity, depending on size of spill andsurface porosity (IB, IC) ( 13,113). E. Carpet and Cloth Furnishings 1. Av oid using carpeting and cloth-upholster ed furnishings in dental operatories, laboratories, and instrument processing areas (II) ( 9,293- 295). F . Regulated Medical Waste 1. General Recommendations a. Develop a medical waste management pro- gram. Disposal of regulated medical wastemust follow federal, state, and local regula- tions (IC) ( 13,301). b. Ensure that DHCP who handle and dispose of regulated medical waste are trained inappropriate handling and disposal methods IDB Manual Page 56Vol. 52 / RR-17 Recommendations and Reports 45 and informed of the possible health and safety hazards (IC) ( 13). 2. Management of Regulated Medical Waste in Dental Health-Care Facilitiesa. Use a color-coded or labeled container that prevents leakage (e.g., biohazard bag) to con-tain nonsharp regulated medical waste (IC)(13). b. Place sharp items (e.g., needles, scalpel blades, orthodontic bands, broken metalinstruments, and burs) in an appropriate sharps container (e.g., puncture resistant, color-coded, and leakproof). Close containerimmediately before removal or replacement to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling, storage, transport, or ship-ping (IC) (2,8,13,113,115). c. Pour blood, suctioned fluids or other liquid waste carefully into a drain connected to asanitary sewer system, if local sewage dis- charge requirements are met and the state has declared this an acceptable method ofdisposal. Wear appropriate PPE while per- forming this task (IC) ( 7,9,13). VIII. Dental Unit Waterlines, Biofilm, and Water Quality A. General Recommendations 1. Use water that meets EPA regulatory standards for drinking water (i.e., <500 CFU/mL of het- erotrophic water bacteria) water (IB, IC) ( 341,342 ). 2. Consult with the dental unit manufacturer for appropriate methods and equipment to main-tain the recommended quality of dental water (II) ( 339). 3. Follow recommendations for monitoring water quality provided by the manufacturer of the unitor waterline treatment product (II). 4. Discharge water and air for a minimum of 20- 30 seconds after each patient, from any deviceconnected to the dental water system that entersthe patient's mouth handpieces, ultrasonic scalers, and air/water syringes) (II) ( 2,311,344). 5. Consult with the dental unit manufacturer on the need for periodic maintenance ofantiretraction mechanisms (IB) (2,311 ). B. Boil-Water Advisories 1. The following apply while a boil-water advisory is in effect: a. Do not deliver water from the public water system to the patient through the dentaloperative unit, ultrasonic scaler, or otherdental equipment that uses the public water system (IB, IC) (341,342,346,349,350). b. Do not use water from the public water sys- tem for dental treatment, patient rinsing, orhandwashing (IB, IC) ( 341,342,346,349, 350). c. For handwashing, use antimicrobial- containing products that do not require water for use (e.g., alcohol-based hand rubs).If hands are visibly contaminated, use bottled water, if available, and soap for handwashing or an antiseptic towelette (IB, IC) ( 13,122). 2. The following apply when the boil-water advisory is cancelled:a. Follow guidance given by the local water utility regarding adequate flushing of water- lines. If no guidance is provided, flush den- tal waterlines and faucets for 1-5 351,352 ). b. Disinfect dental waterlines as recommended by the dental unit manufacturer (II). IX. Special Considerations A. Dental Handpieces and Other Devices Attached to Air and Waterlines 1. Clean and heat-sterilize handpieces and other intraoral instruments that can be removed from the air and waterlines of dental units between patients (IB, IC) ( 2,246,275,356,357,360,407 ). 2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions clean- ing, lubrication, and sterilization of handpiecesand other intraoral instruments that can be removed from the air and waterlines of dentalunits (IB) ( 361-363). 3. Do not surface-disinfect, rilants, or ethylene oxide on handpieces andother intraoral instruments that can be removed from the air and waterlines of dental units (IC) (2,246,250,275). 4. Do not advise patients to close their lips tightly around the tip of the saliva ejector to evacuateoral fluids (II) (364-366). B. Dental Radiology 1. Wear gloves when exposing radiographs and handling contaminated film packets. Use otherPPE (e.g., protective eyewear, mask, and gown) as appropriate if spattering of blood or other body fluids is likely (IA, IC) ( 11,13). IDB Manual Page 5746 MMWR December 19, 2003 2. Use heat-tolerant or disposable intraoral devices whenever possible (e.g., film-holding and posi- tioning devices). Clean and heat-sterilize heat- between patients. At aminimum, high-level sensitive devices, ( 243). 3. T ransport and handle exposed radiographs in an aseptic manner to prevent contamination ofdeveloping equipment (II). 4. The following apply for digital radiography sensors:a. Use FDA-cleared barriers (IB) or high-level disin- fect, between patients, barrier-protectedsemicritical items. If the item cannot toler-ate these procedures then, at a minimum, protect with an FDA-cleared barrier and clean and disinfect with an EPA-registeredhospital disinfectant with intermediate-level (i.e., tuberculocidal claim) activity, between patients. Consult with the manufacturer formethods of disinfection and sterilization of digital radiology sensors and for protection of associated computer hardware (IB) ( 243). C. Aseptic Technique for Parenteral Medications 1. Do not administer medication from a syringe to multiple patients, even if the needle on thesyringe is changed (IA) ( 378). 2. Use single-dose vials for parenteral medications when possible (II) ( 376,377 ). 3. Do not combine the leftover contents of single- use vials for later use (IA) ( 376,377 ). 4. The following apply if multidose vials are used: a. Cleanse the access diaphragm with 70% alcohol before inserting a device into the vial(IA) ( 380,381 ). b. Use a sterile device to access a multiple-dose vial and avoid touching the access diaphragm.Both the needle and syringe used to accessthe multidose vial should be sterile. Do not reuse a syringe even if the needle is changed (IA) ( 380,381 ). c. Keep multidose vials away from the imme- diate patient treatment area to prevent inad-vertent contamination by spray or spatter(II). d. Discard the multidose vial if sterility is com- promised (IA) (380,381 ).5. Use fluid infusion and administration sets (i.e., IV bags, tubings and connections) for one patient only and dispose of appropriately (IB) (378). D. Single-Use (Disposable) Devices 1. Use single-use devices for one patient only and dispose of them appropriately (IC) ( 383). E. Preprocedural Mouth Rinses 1. No recommendation is offered regarding use of preprocedural antimicrobial mouth rinses toprevent clinical infections among DHCP or pa- tients. Although studies have demonstrated that a antimicrobial rinse (e.g.,chlorhexidine gluconate, essential oils, or povi- done-iodine) can reduce the level of oral micro- organisms in aerosols and spatter generatedduring routine dental procedures and can decrease the number of microorganisms intro- duced in the patient's bloodstream during inva-sive dental procedures ( 391-399 ), the scientific evidence is inconclusive that using these rinsesprevents clinical infections among DHCP orpatients (see discussion, Preprocedural Mouth Rinses) (Unresolved issue). F . Oral Surgical Procedures 1. The following apply when performing oral sur- gical procedures: a. Perform surgical hand antisepsis by using an antimicrobial product (e.g., antimicrobial soap and water, or soap and water followed by alcohol-based hand scrub with persistentactivity) before donning sterile surgeon's gloves ). c. or water as a cool- ant/irrigatant when performing oral surgi- cal procedures. Use devices specifically designed for deliv ering sterile irrigating flu- ids (IB) (2,121 ). G. Handling of Biopsy Specimens 1. During transport, place biopsy specimens in a sturdy, leakproof container labeled with the bio- hazard symbol (IC) ( 2,13,14). 2. If a biopsy specimen container is visibly con- taminated, clean and disinfect the outside of a IDB Manual Page 58Vol. 52 / RR-17 Recommendations and Reports 47 container or place it in an impervious bag labeled with the biohazard symbol, (IC) ( 2,13). H. Handling of Extracted Teeth 1. Dispose of extracted teeth as regulated medical waste unless returned to the patient (IC) ( 13,14 ). 2. Do not dispose of extracted teeth containing amalgam in regulated medical waste intendedfor incineration (II). 3. Clean and place extracted teeth in a leakproof container, labeled with a biohazard symbol, andmaintain hydration for transport to educational institutions or a dental laboratory (IC) ( 13,14). 4. Heat-sterilize teeth that do not contain amal- gam before they are used for educational pur-poses (IB) ( 403,405,406 ). I. Dental Laboratory 1. Use PPE when handling items received in the laboratory until they have been decontaminated (IA, IC) ( 2,7,11,13,113 ). 2. Before they are handled in the laboratory, clean, disinfect, and rinse all dental prostheses andprosthodontic materials (e.g., impressions, biteregistrations, occlusal rims, and extracted teeth) by using an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant having at least an intermediate-level (i.e., tuber-culocidal claim) activity (IB) ( 2,249,252,407 ). 3. Consult with manufacturers regarding the sta- bility of specific materials (e.g., impressionmaterials) relative to disinfection procedures (II). 4. Include specific information regarding disinfec- tion techniques used (e.g., solution used andduration), when laboratory cases are sent off- site and on their return (II) ( 2,407,409). 5. Clean and heat-sterilize heat-tolerant items used in the mouth (e.g., metal impression trays andface-bow forks) (IB) ( 2,407). 6. Follow manufacturers' instructions for cleaning and sterilizing or disinfecting items that becomecontaminated but do not normally contact the patient (e.g., burs, polishing points, rag wheels,articulators, case pans, and lathes). If manufac- turer instructions are unavailable, clean and heat- sterilize heat-tolerant items or clean and disinfectwith an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant with low- (HIV, HBV effectiveness claim) to inter- mediate-level (tuberculocidal claim) activity,depending on the degree of contamination (II). J. Laser/Electrosurgery Plumes/Surgical Smoke1. No recommendation is offered regarding prac- tices to reduce DHCP exposure to laser plumes/ surgical smoke when using lasers in dental prac- tice. Practices to reduce HCP exposure to laserplumes/surgical smoke have been suggested, including use of a) standard precautions (e.g., high-filtration surgical masks and possibly fullface shields) ( 437); b) central room suction units with in-line filters to collect particulate matterfrom minimal plumes; and c) dedicatedmechanical smoke exhaust systems with a high- efficiency filter to remove substantial amounts of laser-plume particles. The effect of the expo-sure (e.g., disease transmission or adverse respi- ratory effects) on DHCP from dental applications of lasers has not been adequatelyevaluated (see previous discussion, Laser/ Electrosurgery Plumes or Surgical Smoke) (Unresolved issue). K.Mycobacterium tuberculosis 1. General Recommendations a. Educate all DHCP regarding the recogni- tion of signs, symptoms, and transmissionof TB (IB) (20,21). b. Conduct a baseline TST, preferably by using a two-step test, for all DHCP whomight have contact with persons with sus- pected or confirmed active TB, regardless ofthe risk classification of the setting (IB) ( 20). c. Assess each patient for a history of TB as well as symptoms indicative of TB and documenton the medical history form (IB) ( 20,21 ). d. Follow CDC recommendations for 1) maintaining, and implementinga written TB infection-control plan; 2) man- aging a patient with suspected or active TB; 3) completing a community risk-assessmentto guide employee TSTs and follow-up; and 4) managing DHCP with TB disease (IB) (2,21). 2. The following apply for patients known or sus- pected to have active TB:a. Evaluate the patient away from other patients and DHCP . When not being evaluated, the patient should wear a surgical mask or be instructed to co ver mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing (IB) ( 20,21 ). b. Defer elective dental noninfectious (IB) ( 20,21). IDB Manual Page 5948 MMWR December 19, 2003 c. Refer patients requiring urgent dental treat- ment to a previously identified facility with TB engineering controls and a respiratory protection program (IB) ( 20,21). L. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and Other Prion Diseases1. No recommendation is offered regarding use of special precautions in addition to standard pre- cautions when treating known CJD or vCJD patients. Potential infectivity of oral tissues inCJD or vCJD patients is an unresolved issue. Scientific data indicate the risk, if any, of spo- radic CJD transmission during dental and oralsurgical procedures is low to nil. Until additional information exists regarding the transmissibility of CJD or vCJD during dental procedures, spe-cial precautions in addition to standard precau- tions might be indicated when treating known CJD or vCJD patients; a list of such precau-tions is provided for consideration without rec- ommendation (see Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and Other Prion Diseases) (Unresolved issue). M. Program Evaluation 1. Establish routine evaluation of the infection- control program, including evaluation of per-formance indicators, at an established frequency (II) ( 470-471).

IDB Manual Page 60BEFORE THE IOWA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH _____________________________________________________________________ PPE SHORTAGE ORDER _____________________________________________________________________ Pursuant to the authority contained in Iowa Code se ctions 135.142 and 135.144(3) , the Iowa Department of Public Health (Department) hereby issues the following Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Shortage O rder (Order) : Definitions : The following def initions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcem ent of this Order : \"Health care provider\" means a person who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by the laws of the state of Iowa or Gubernatorial Proclamations of Disaster Emergency issued on or after March 9, 2020, to administer health care services or treatment . \"Hospital\" means a facility as defined in Iowa Code section 135B.1(3). \"Health care facility\" means a facility as defined in Iowa Code section 135C .1(7) \"Personal protective equipment \" or \"PPE\" includes face shields, goggles, facemasks, respirators, gowns, aprons, coveralls, or other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness. Public Health Disaster Declared : The Governor of the State of Io wa issued a proclamation of public health disaster emergency on Ma rch 17, 2020 , in response to the COVID -19 global pandemic. The pandemic h as resulted in a statewide , regional , and national shortage of PPE. The Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention has issued guidance for optimizing PPE supply on the grounds that \"PPE shortages are currently posing a tremendous challenge to the U.S. healthcare system because of the COVID -19 pandemic. \" The Department is therefore authorized to control, restrict, and regulate by rationing and using quotas, prohibitions of shipments, allocation, or other means the use, sale, dispensing, distribution, or transportation of PPE. Individuals, Facilities, and other Entities Covered by this Order : All Iowa health care provi ders, hospitals, health care facilities, c linics, local public health agencies, medical and response organizations , and any other person or facility utilizing PPE in the care or treatment of a patient or resident are covered by this Order . Conditions o f Order : You shall cooperate with the Iowa Department of Public Health and local boards of health or health departments to assess and monitor the supply of PPE and to ensure the utilization of PPE in accordance with this Order. You shall immediately inf orm all staff of the conditions of this Order and you shall prominently post this Order in locations where PPE is utilized. Due to the current shortage of PPE in the State of Iowa, you are hereby ordered to immediately comply with the following directives : 1. Decrease Demand . You shall immediately decrease demand for PPE by taking each of the following steps : a. Maximize use of engineering controls, such as barriers and maintained ventilation systems, and administrative controls, such as altering work practices to minimize patient contacts . b. Comply with the ban on nonessential medical and dental services issued in the Proclamation of Disaster Emergency on March 26, 2020, and all subsequent extensions . c. Cancel all other elective and non -urgent proc edures and appointments which utilize PPE. d. Reserve PPE for health care providers and replace PPE normally used for source control with other barrier precautions . e. Maximize the use of telemedicine. 2. Implement Contingency Capacity Strategies . If, following completion of all steps in paragraph 1, the demand for PPE at your facility continues to exceed the supply, you shall comply with the following directives: Facemasks : Implement extended use of facemasks. Extended use of facemasks is th e practice of wearing the same facemask for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing the facemask between patient encounters. The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe th rough. Health care providers must take care not to touch their facemask. If they touch or adjust their facemask they must immediately perform hand hygiene. Health care providers should leave the patient care area if they need to remove the facemask. Restrict facemasks to use by health care providers, rather than patients for source control. Gowns : Shift gown use towards washable cloth isolation gowns . Consider the use of coveralls. Use expired gowns beyond the manufacturer -designated shelf life for training. Use gown or coveralls conforming to international standards. Eye protection : Shift eye protection supplies from disposable to re -useable devices, including goggles and reusable face shields. Implement extended use of eye protection. Extend ed use of eye protection is the practice of wearing the same eye protection for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing eye protection between patient encounters. Extended use of eye protection can be applied t o disposable and reusable devices. Eye protection should be removed and reprocessed if it becomes visibly soiled or difficult to see through. Eye protection should be discarded if damaged. HCP must take care not to touch their eye protection . If they touc h or adjust their eye protection they must immediately perform hand hygiene. HCP should leave the patient care area if they need to remove the eye protection . N95 Respirators : Decrease length of stay for medically stable patients with COVID -19. Tempor arily suspend annual fit testing. Use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer -designated shelf life for training and fit testing . Extend use of N95 respirators. Extended use refers to the practice of wearing the same N95 respirator for repeated close co ntact encounters with several different patients, without removing the respirator between patient encounters. 3. Implement Crisis Capacity Strategies . If, following completion of all steps in paragraphs 1 and 2, the demand for PPE at your facility continues to exceed the supply, you shall comply with the following directives : Facemasks : Use facemask s beyo nd the manufacturer -designated shelf life during patient care activities. Implement limited re -use of facemasks. Limited re -use of facemasks is the practice of using the same facemask by one health care provider for multiple encounters with different patients by removing it after each encounter. As it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for COVID -19, care should be taken to ensure that health care providers do not touch outer surfaces of the mask during care, and that mask removal and replacement be done in a careful and deliberate manner. The facemask should be removed and discarded if soiled, damaged, or hard t o breathe through. Not all facemasks can be re -used. o Facemasks that fasten to the provider via ties may not be able to be undone without tearing and should be considered only for extended use, rather than re -use. o Facemasks with elastic ear hooks may be more suitable for re -use. o The health care provider should leave the patient care area if they need to remove the facemask. Facemasks should be carefully folded so that the outer surface is held inward and against itself to reduce contact with the outer su rface during storage. The folded mask can be stored between uses in a clean sealable paper bag or breathable container. Prioritize facemasks for selected activities such as the provision of essential surgeries and procedures; during care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated; during activities where prolonged face -to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable; and for performing aerosol generating procedures, if respirators are no longer available. If no com mercially manufactured facemask is available and no other facemasks are available , consider if alternative approaches such as homemade facemasks used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (extend ing to the chin or below) and sides of the face will reduce the risk of health care provider exposur e and are safe for patient care . These homemade cloth face masks are not considered PPE since their ability to protect against COVID -19 has not yet been studied. Gowns : Extended use of is olation gown s, including the use of isolation gowns (disposable or cloth) such that the same gown is worn by the same health care provider when interacting with more than one patient known to be infected with the same infectious disease when these patients are housed in the same location. If the gown becomes visibly soiled, it must be removed and discarded. Re-use of cloth isolation gowns . Prioritize gowns for selected activities such as during care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, w hich typically includes aerosol generating procedures , and during high -contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for the transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of healthcare providers. If no commercially manufactured gown is avai lable, consider if alternative approaches such as homemade gowns will reduce the risk of health care provider exposure and are safe for patient care. If utilizing a homemade gown for patient care, you shall comply with the following guidelines of the Depa rtment: \"Use of Homemade Gowns for Patient Care when Commercially -produced Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is Unavailable.\" Eye protection : Use eye protection devices beyond the manufacturer -designated shelf life during patient care activities. Prioritize eye protection for selected activities such as during care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, which typically includes aerosol generating procedures, and during activities where prolonged face -to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable. Consider using safety glasses such as trauma glasses that have extensions to cover the sides of the eyes. Consider excluding health care providers at higher risk for severe illness from COVID - 19 from contact with known or suspected COVID -19 patients. Consider designating convalescent health care providers for provision of care to known or suspected COVID -19 patients. N95 Respirators : Use respirators beyond the manufacturer -designated shelf life for health care delivery. Use respirators approved under standards used in other countries that are similar to NIOSH -approved respirators. Limited re -use of N95 respirators. Re -use refers to the practice of using the same N95 respirator by one health care provider for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it after each encounter. Use of additional respirators beyond the manufacturer -designated shelf life for healthcare delivery that have not been evaluated by NIOSH. Prioritize the use of N95 respirators by activity type. Extend the use of N95 respirators by decontaminating. According to the CDC, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and moist heat are the most promising decontamination methods. If N -95 decontaminatio n is considered, these methods do not appear to break down filtration or compromise the mask; however, many of these methods can only be used for limited times. Healthcare providers should take the following measures prior to using a decontaminated N -95: Clean hands with soap and water or an alcohol -based hand sanitizer before and after touching or adjusting the N -95. Avoid touching the inside of the N -95. Use a pair of clean (non -sterile) gloves when donning and performing a user seal check. Visuall y inspect the N -95 to determine if its integrity has been compromised. Check that components such as the straps, nose bridge, and nose foam material did not degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit, and seal. If the integrity of any part of the N -95 is compromised, or if a successful user seal check cannot be performed, discard the N -95 and try another N -95. Users should perform a user seal check immediately after they don each N -95 and should not use an N -95 on which they cannot perform a succes sful user seal check. Immunities . Iowa law contains immunity provisions protecting persons , corporations, and other legal entities, and employees and agents of such persons, corporations, and other legal entities who provide medical care or assistance in good faith under the direction of the Department of Public Health during a public health disaster . Iowa Code \u00a7 135.147. A health care provider, hospital, health care facilit y, and any other person , corporation, or other legal entity or employee of all such entities acting in compliance with this Order , or other guidance issued by the Iowa Department of Public Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention related to optimizing PPE supply, in good faith is acting at the request of and un der the direction of the Iowa Department of Public Health for purposes of the immunity provisions of Iowa Code section 135.147. Violation of Order: This Order may be enforced pursuant to Iowa Code section 135.38 and by professional licensing boards. Effective date : This order shall be effective immediately on April 9, 2020, and shall continue so long as the state of public health disaster emergency remains in effect unless sooner terminated or modified by subsequent order of the Department or proclama tion of the Governor. Executed by: ____________________________________ __________ Director or Medical Director Date Iowa Department of Public Health 4/9/2020 Lori Brown, RDH, MSE Des Moines Area Community College 2006 S Ankeny Blvd. Ankeny, IA 50021 Friday, April 10, 2020 Jill Stuec ker, Executive Director Mary Kelly, Dental Hygiene Committee Chair Iowa Dental Board 400 SW 8th Street, Suite D Des Moines, IA 50309 Dear Ms. Stuecker and Ms. Kelly , At last Friday's meeting of the Iowa Dental Board, I was a little surprised that the dental hygiene students in the 2020 graduating class at the six schools of Dental Hygiene across our state were not considered in the discussio n regarding alternatives to the patient -based clinical boards that must be taken in order to obtain a dental license or a dental hygiene license in Iowa. It was referenced that there was discussion and input from all the Dental Hygiene p rogram directors, as Ms. Kelly was thanked for working with us. Yet, when I sent a comm ent via the chat option on the remote meeting site, it was somewhat brushed off. I do understand, as it was a busy time and an important discussion. There are about sixty -five or so, Dental Hygiene students who were on track to graduate next month, many of whom have secured positions already. Another cohort of students are planning to graduate in the fall. Because of the COVID -19 shut down all dental clinics, these students have not been able to finish their clinical hours, thus, will not graduate on time. Program directors are seeking ways to finish the spring semester online, but there are no substitutes available at this time for the patient - based examinations th at have been required by the Dental Board in the past. At the Board meeting last Friday, April 3, it was decided that the senior dental students at the University of Iowa be offered an aven ue for licensure without taking patient -based examinations. I am wondering if the dental hygiene students will be allowed to do the same. Both are licensed dental professionals. If a man nequin perio dontal skills test is available , allow dental hygiene students to take that exam. I would like to ask the Dental Board t o consider that the Dental Hygiene students who, as part of their educational program which is regulated by the American Dental Association's Committee on Dental Education, are required to complete over 750 clinical hours in addition to their didactic cour sework. They see patients of a variety of ages, periodontal conditions, physical conditions, and other patient management issues. They have successfully completed evaluations for clinical procedures as part of this coursework at a competency rate of at le ast 80%, which is higher than what is required for passing a clinical examination provided by various third party testing services. Dental Hygiene students from all over the country and the American Dental Hygienists' Association are campaigning to eliminate the necessity of patient based exams for this class and I am requesting that you will consider doing the same. I am receiving correspondence from dentists requesting me to allow students to graduate and get licensed so they can get to work when the COVID - 19 crisis is over. Knowing that is not my decision to make, I am referring them to the Iowa Dental Board, of course, with their concerns. I would like to request a waiver to the rule that requires students to complete this one -time exam that s erves to \"confirm\" competency. There is no way to keep patients, clinicians, or examiners safe during this pandemic. It is not fair to keep students waiting to begin their careers due to circumstances beyond anyone's control and in a situation that has ne ver happened before! They must still graduate from an accredited educational program, pass a national board examination, background checks, and the state Jurisprudence exam. Additionally, even after being licensed, the candidates will still be working un der the general supervision of a dentist. I believe we need to recognize the competency of these students and all they have accomplished. Thank you for considering my thoughts. I know that I am not alone in my concerns. Most sincerely, Lori Brown, RDH, MSE Dental Programs Director Des Moines Area Community College 2006 S.

Dental hygiene student: Consider adding a personal message in the box provided and share how the pandemic has impacted your education and plans for the future. Dental hygiene educator: Consider adding a personal message in the box provided and share how your program and the lives of your students have been affected. Licensed dental hygienist: Consider adding a personal message in the box provided and share support for this cadre of students who are graduating from accredited dental hygiene programs and are ready and able to immediately contribute to the health care team. Subject : Dental Hygiene Licensure and COVID19 Body of Message : Due to the COVID19 crisis, dental hygienists and their patients face unprecedented circumstances. For dental hygiene students, this includes their inability to complete the initial licensure process. This is in part due to the requirements for candidates for dental hygiene licensure to be examined by performing specific procedures on a patient. Please know that other health professions outside of oral health are not required to demonstrate their clinical skills on a patient to be licensed to practice. We ask that initial licensure requirements be waived for 2020 dental hygiene graduates and that graduates from CODAaccredited dental hygiene education programs be issued a license upon graduation in 2020. Now more than ever, health care professional licensure should proceed without delay so these qualified oral health care providers can join the workforce in this time of dire need. April 9, 2020 The Honorable Larry Hogan Chair National Governors Association 444 North Capitol Street Suite 267 Washington, D.C. 20001 Dear Governor Hogan: The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) is The Voice of Dental Education. ADEA members include all 68 U.S. dental schools, over 1,000 allied and advanced dental education programs, over 60 corporations and more than 20,000 individuals. As the sole national organization representing academic dentistry, we ask you to en courage governors to suspend or modify existing state -level examination restrictions that prevent graduating dentists, dental hygienists and other oral health professionals from serving their communities during this pandemic crisis. It is vital for governo rs to remember that oral health is essential to overall health, as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers are often first detected in oral care. All states require candidates for initial licensure in dentistry and dental hygiene to pass an examinati on demonstrating clinical ability before they can be licensed. In many states, this exam must be administered by one of several testing agencies that require treatments to be demonstrated on live patients and evaluated. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, these live patient clinical examinations have been suspended throughout the country, preventing graduating students from earning licenses to enter the workforce and provide needed dental care in their communities. Several states accept alternative licensure path ways, such as postgraduate education, structured decision -making assessments or a portfolio, that do not rely on patients as test subjects. Forcing graduates to wait for patient - based examinations not only deprives qualified individuals of the ability to earn a living in their chosen profession, but also limits patients in their options for dental treatment. Without suspension of or modification to clinical exam requirement rules imposed by the state boards of dentistry, the country could face a further shortage of oral health professionals when the COVID -19 pandemic has subsided. Each year, the licensure of g raduating dentists and allied dental providers is necessary to maintain an adequate number of professionals who can provide care, as new dentists and allied dental professionals replace providers who retire. Furthermore, as most states have restricted dent al treatment to emergency procedures only, it is likely that this policy, while necessary for preventing the spread of COVID -19, will create a backlog of patients needing treatment. The Honorable Larry Hogan April 9, 2020 Page 2 This backlog could potentially overwhelm dental offices and community -based dental clinics. Without modification to licensing rules, this will result in delayed care for individuals, the continuation of undiagnosed oral diseases, and pain for individuals suffering from tooth decay. Licensure restrictions will also impact ou r armed forces, as many dental and allied dental graduates join the military and provide care to our troops. Without becoming licensed, recent graduates will not be able to serve patients in their military posts. This will result in delayed care for troops who need dental care. ADEA applauds Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana and Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona for their leadership on this issue. We believe the policies they have created are examples of a way forward for other states. In Proclamation Number 38 JBE 2020, Gov. Edwards temporarily suspended the requirement that clinical licensing exams include procedures performed on human subjects. In Proclamation Number 41 JBE 2020, Gov. Edwards permitted the Louisiana State Board of Dentistry to issue licenses b ased on a 2020 graduation from a Louisiana -based, Commission on Dental Accreditation -accredited dental or allied dental program. In Arizona, Gov. Ducey issued Executive Order 20200 -17, which requires the Arizona State Board of Dental Examiners, and other s tate boards that issue licenses, to issue provisional licenses to applicants who meet all requirements but are unable to take examinations due to testing center closures and unavailability of electronic or remote testing options. These are temporary measur es that will not necessarily continue when the pandemic is over. While the inability of graduating dental and allied dental students to obtain licensure in a timely manner has the potential to prevent them from joining the work force, the harm to patients and our health care system may be even greater. If governors do not act, it will exacerbate the shortage of oral health care providers. It is for these reasons that we urge all governors to suspend or modify state laws that prevent qualified dental and al lied dental graduates from becoming licensed professionals. Sincerely, Karen P. West, D.M.D., M.P.H. President and CEO IAC 1 1/6/19 Dental Board[650] Ch 29, p. 3 29.4 (2) Record keeping.
