The primary goal of administering hepatitis B vaccine at birth is to protect babies from chronic HBV infection Approximately 25% of infants with perinatal HBV infection will die prematurely as a result of complications of cirrhosis or liver cancer 18 19 Effectiveness of Hepatitis B Vaccine Starting at Birth Post -exposure prophylaxis of infants born to infected women is 85 -95% effective when started within 12 hours of birth -post -exposure prophylaxis: hepatitis B vaccine + hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) at birth, completion of hepatitis B vaccine series, post -vaccination testing for response at 9 -12 months of age* Hepatitis B vaccination starting at birth even without HBIG will prevent transmission of the infection in 70 -95% of infants born to chronically infected women *Or 1 -2 months after the final dose of the HepB vaccine series if completion of the series is delayed. MMWR 2015:64:1118 -20 20 The Opportunity To Prevent Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection Hospitals have an opportunity to protect the future health of infants born in their facilities -each year in the U.S., an estimated 25,000 infants are born to mothers who are infected with HBV, and not all of their infants receive post -exposure prophylaxis -some infants are first exposed shortly after birth to HBV by household members or caretakers who have chronic HBV infection Most infants can be protected if hospitals routinely provide a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to all newborn infants 2 0 Smith EA. Pediatrics 2012;129:609 -616; MMWR 2005;57(RR -8):1-20 21 The Problem Many infants in the United States are not receiving the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine -In 2014 only 72% of U.S. infants received hepatitis B vaccine within 3 days of birth -States' coverage rates varied between 48% and 88% (81% in MO) There is room for improvement in protecting newborn infants in every state 2014 National Immunization Survey. MMWR 2015;64:897 -904 22 Why Should All Newborns Receive a Birth Dose of Hepatitis B Vaccine Prevents mother -to-infant transmission: Prevents 70 -95% of infection among infants born to HBsAg -positive women Prevents household transmission: Protects infants from infected family members and other caregivers Protects when medical errors occur: Provides a safety net to prevent perinatal HBV infection when medical errors occur 23 Perinatal Hepatitis B Management Errors Ordering the wrong hepatitis B screening test Misinterpreting or mistranscribing the hepatitis B test results Failing to communicate the HBsAg test results to or within the hospital Not giving hepatitis B vaccine to infants born to mothers of unknown HBsAg status within 12 hours of birth Not giving prophylaxis to an infant even when the mother 's HBsAg -positive status is documented 24 All birthing hospitals should Implement policies and procedures to administer the recommended universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, ensuring that every newborn infant receives hepatitis B vaccine at birth, or no later than hospital discharge.

- - 4 weeks 8 weeks* Usual Interval --- 1 month 5 months *third dose must be separated from first dose by at least 16 weeks 27 Interruption of the Hepatitis B Vaccine Series It is not necessary to restart the series or add doses if the hepatitis B vaccine series is interrupted, regardless of the interval since the last dose MMWR 2013;62(RR -10):1 -19 28 Adults at Risk for HBV Sexual exposure -sex partners of HBsAg -positive persons -sexually active persons not in a long -term, mutually monogamous relationship* -persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease -men who have sex with men *persons with more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months 29 Adults at Risk for HBV Infection Percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood -current or recent IDU -household contacts of HBsAg -positive persons -residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons -healthcare and public safety workers with risk for exposure to blood or blood -contaminated body fluids -persons with end -stage renal disease -persons with diabetes mellitus MMWR 2006;55(RR -16):6 -8 30 Adults at Risk for HBV Infection Others groups -international travelers to regions with high or intermediate levels (HBsAg prevalence of 2% or higher) of endemic HBV infection -persons with HIV infection MMWR 2006;55(RR -16):6 -8 31 Prevaccination Serologic Testing Not indicated before routine vaccination of infants, children, and most adolescents and adults Recommended for -all persons born in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and other regions with HBsAg prevalence of 2% or higher -household, sex, and needle -sharing contacts of HBsAg -positive persons -men who have sex with men -injection drug users 32 Postvaccination Serologic Testing Not routinely recommended following vaccination of infants, children, adolescents, or most adults Recommended for: -chronic hemodialysis patients -other immunocompromised persons of HBsAg+ persons -infants born to HBsAg+ women -healthcare personnel 33 Hepatitis B Evidence of Immunity for Healthcare Personnel (HCP) Written documentation of a properly spaced 3 dose series of hepatitis B vaccine, and Confirmation of immunity (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti -HBs] >10 mIU/mL) 1 to 2 months after the third dose CDC recommends that HCP have both documentation of vaccination and a positive anti -HBs HCP lacking documentation of vaccination should be considered unvaccinated MMWR 2013;62(RR -10):1 -19 34 The \"New\" Hepatitis B Serology Issue: HCP Vaccinated as Infants or Adolescents Routine hepatitis B vaccination of infants was first recommended in 1991 Catch -up vaccination of adolescents recommended in 1995 Vaccination coverage among 19 -35 month -old children first exceeded 90% in 2000 The oldest cohorts vaccinated as infants are now in their early 20s Routine serologic testing of infants is not recommended (except if mother is HBsAg positive) MMWR 2013;62(RR -10):1 -19 35 Hepatitis B Vaccination 95% of healthy infants will achieve seroprotection against hepatitis B 1 to 2 months after a complete 3 -dose series By 18 years after vaccination approximately 84% of persons vaccinated at younger than 1 year of age will not have detectable anti Vaccine and HCP Management of HCP who have written documentation of a complete series of hepatitis B vaccine doses in the past who were not tested for antibody response following the vaccination series and who now test negative for anti -HBs -administer 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine then test for anti -HBs 1 to 2 months later -if positive (anti -HBs >10 mIU/mL) the person is immune and nothing else needs to be done MMWR 2013;62(RR -10):1 -19 39 Management of Nonresponse to Hepatitis B Vaccine For persons who remain seronegative after the \"booster\" dose -complete a second series of three doses (i.e., 2 more doses) -use the usual schedule of 0, 1 and 6 months -may use a compressed schedule (0, 1, 4 months) -retest for anti -HBs 1 to 2 months after completing the second series MMWR 2013;62(RR -10):1 -19 40 Hepatitis B Revaccination 47% of 3 -dose series recipients without protective antibody levels after a primary vaccination series develop vaccine -induced seroprotection after one additional dose of hepatitis B vaccine 69% of initial nonresponders will develop seroprotection after 3 revaccination doses Am J Prev Med 1998;15:1 -8 41 Persistent Nonresponse to Hepatitis B Vaccine Less than 5% of vaccinees do not develop anti-HBs after 6 valid doses May be nonresponder or \"hyporesponder\" ACIP does not recommend revaccination with more than 3 doses (i.e., more than 6 total doses) Check HBsAg and anti -HBc status if not already done If exposed, treat Serologic Testing HCP who have written documentation of a complete 3 (or more) hepatitis B vaccine series AND subsequent postvaccination anti -HBs level of 10 mIU/mL or higher are considered to be immune Immunocompetent persons have long - term protection against HBV infection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti -HBs levels MMWR 2013;62(RR -10):1 -19 44 Resources General Recommendations -2):1-61 Immunization of Healthcare Workers.
