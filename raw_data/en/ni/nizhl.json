We offer multidisciplinary, compassionate care where experts from a variety of disciplines come together collaboratively to ensure the best possible treatment options for cancer patients at NorthShore Evanston, Glenbrook and Highland Park Hospitals. Since its founding, Kellogg Cancer Center has treated more than 50,000 patients, and the Center's survival rates compare favorably with national benchmarks. Data reflecting survival by stage for various tumor sites is included throughout this report. In 2010, NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center received a three-year accreditation with commendation from the Commission on Cancer, which demonstrates our commitment to the highest standards. NorthShore continues to invest significant resources into Kellogg Cancer Center; a new and expanded center will open at Glenbrook Hospital in early 2012, and the space at Highland Park Hospital was nearly doubled this year. These additions represent our ongoing responsiveness to community needs as we care for an increasing number of patients and complement our new Evanston Hospital Kellogg Cancer Center, which was completed last year. We value the input and support of NorthShore's Oncology Patient Advisory Board as well as feedback from the community at large. The oncology Guided Patient Support (GPS) program, initiated in 2010 with philanthropic support from The Auxiliary of NorthShore at Evanston and Glenbrook Hospitals, provides nurse navigators for newly diagnosed cancer patients and continues to be a source of heightened patient satisfaction. In addition to helping patients navigate each phase of their care, the innovative GPS program provides financial advocates who can assist patients with everything from insurance questions to securing financial aid, and provides additional nutrition and psychosocial support staff. Our care truly focuses on the entire individual as our team includes experts in integrative medicine, nutrition, psychosocial oncology and cancer survivorship. A robust clinical research program\u2014 anchored by our National Cancer Institute-funded Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP), one of the nation's oldest\u2014also supports patient care at NorthShore. Our patients have access to a broad array of active clinical trials and poten- tially life-saving new treatments. NorthShore's new cutting-edge Center for Clinical and Research Informatics (CCRI) will advance research initiatives in cancer and further lever-age data from our advanced Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system to improve outcomes. A strong academic component runs through Kellogg Cancer Center as our teaching affiliation with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine continues to flourish. Attending physicians hold academic appoint-ments at the University, and medical students, residents and fellows undergo training at our hospitals. Physician-scientists at NorthShore Dr. Bruce E.

NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center The collaborative practice model at Kellogg Cancer Center focuses on each individual's needs, offering a full array of expert services, including: Advanced radiology Clinical trials Nurse navigators Rehabilitation programs Integrative medicine practices Cancer survivorship program Living in the Future (LIFE) Patient and community education Patient and family support groups Community resource referrals Spiritual care Nutrition counseling Crisis intervention and emotional support Genetic counseling Cancer registry2 NorthShore University HealthSystemThoracic Cancer Conferences NorthShore Evanston Hospital Kellogg G868, Tuesdays, noon NorthShore Highland Park Hospital VideocastThoracic Oncology: Personally Tailored Therapy Experienced specialists from medical and radiation oncology, thoracic surgery, radiology, pulmonary medicine, pathology, pharmacy and other disciplines come together to provide each patient with the most advanced, individualized care. The team also is supported by healthcare professionals in nutrition, integrative medicine and psychosocial oncology, all of whom share the TOP mission to prevent, expertly diagnose, treat and manage lung cancer and esophageal, pleural, mediastinal and chest wall tumors. Co-directed by Thomas Hensing, MD, and John Howington, MD, both of whom hold academic appointments at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, TOP offers the latest in advanced care options, including personally tailored therapy based on the specific molecular characteristics of tumors. Genetic profiles of tumors are studied to ensure the most successful treatment protocols. NorthShore's sophisticated pathology team provides up-to-date technology and expertise, ensuring that a high percentage of tests and novel diagnostics are completed in house, so patients receive the quickest results and can begin life-saving treatment as soon as possible. Dr. Hensing chairs the Lung Oncology Group in Chicago (LOGIC), and other team members are active in local and national organizations, reflecting a shared commitment to advocacy and improved outcomes for lung cancer patients. The TOP team meets weekly to discuss individual patient cases, bring- ing collective expertise to development of personalized treatment plans. In recent years the approach to treating lung cancer has evolved rapidly as the biology of the tumor characterizes the disease and can thereby be used to predict the best plan of attack\u2014often a multimodal strategy with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and cutting-edge medications. In addition to Dr. Hensing, medical oncologists Alla Gimelfarb, MD, and Theresa Law, MD, are active team members and receive referrals for an increasing number of patients from throughout the region as the program's reputation for genotyping and access to clinical trials grows. With emphasis on early diagnosis, more early-stage cancers are found and treated with minimally invasive surgery to remove tumors before they spread. Dr. Howington's expertise in this area includes performing video- assisted thoracoscopic surgery or VATS lobectomy, a procedure done with a small incision under the arm, as opposed to the traditional method which requires cutting the chest open and spreading the ribs. This advanced procedure means quicker recovery, less pain, less chance of complications and overall less trauma to the body. Ki Wan Kim, MD, joined the Division of Thoracic Surgery this year after completing fellowship training at the University of Michigan. Dr. Kim performs VATS/thoracoscopic lobectomy and also brings additional experience in managing esophageal cancer. We now have the capability to perform minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer patients. Pulmonary disease specialist Stacy Raviv, MD, joined the TOP team recently and brings additional experience in endobronchial ultrasound. This advanced diagnostic procedure is used to provide more accurate diagnosis and staging information, revealing areas of the lung and chest wall that traditionally could be seen only with more invasive surgical procedures. 02 04 06 08 0 100 02 04 3 Year 2 Year 1 Year 0 YearNorthShor e National Cancer Database (NCDB) 16.3 13.5 18.2 15.9 21.3 19.5 27.6 26.1 46.0 42.9 100.0 100.05 Year 4 Year 3 Year 2 Year 1 Year 0 Year 08 0 1005 Year 4 Year 3 Year 2 Year 1 Year 0 Year02 04 06 08 0 1005 Year 4 Year 3 Year 2 Year 1 Year 0 Year 02 04 06 08 0 1005 Year 4 Year 3 Year 2 Year 1 Year 0 YearBreast Lung ProstateColon Lymphoma58.3 Observed Survival Cases diagnosed 1998-2002Dedicated to advancing care and outcomes for patients with lung cancer and other thoracic malignancies, NorthShore's Thoracic Oncology 2011 NCDB, Commission on Cancer, Survival Reportsn NorthShore n National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) Total number of Report 3Joan SzaboA nonsmoking, healthy mother of a teenage daughter, Joan Szabo never thought lung cancer was even a remote possibility when she began experiencing back pain about four years ago. \"I work out a lot, I had run a half marathon and I thought maybe I pinched a nerve in my back,\" Szabo said. She didn't have a cough, and she didn't have trouble breathing. So for quite some time she believed she had a back problem. Shocked barely begins to describe her feeling when tumors were detected and a biopsy of her lung lining revealed cancer. \"I've never smoked, I've never even been around smokers,\" the 58-year-old Szabo said. In fact, she had so many small nodules on her lungs, Szabo said, that NorthShore thoracic surgeon John Howington, MD, told her they initially thought it could have been a fungus. Szabo sought treatment with NorthShore oncologist Thomas Hensing, MD, who immediately sent tissue samples out for tests to determine the specific genetic mutation causing Szabo's cancer. \"Traditionally, with a cancer diagnosis, we looked at where did it start, in what organ? And we looked under a microscope to determine what type of cancer it was. Now we are looking at the genetics of the tumor type to learn what drives it to grow so we can specifically target the molecu- lar abnormality driving the problem,\" Dr. Hensing explained. \"Tailoring the treatment to the specific tumor biology is a real paradigm shift in cancer treatment,\" he added. That shift has meant the world to Szabo, who for almost three years has been receiving treatment based on the specific biomarkers of her tumor strain and is doing remarkably well. \"I feel better now than I did five years ago,\" said Szabo, who is back to exercising and running the occasional race. The likelihood of successful treatment without this kind of targeted therapy was much lower, said Dr. Hensing. Actively involved in clinical trials and research for improved treatment options, Dr. Hensing is optimistic that this biologically driven approach to diagnosis and personalized care will make a real difference in the battle against lung cancer. Szabo sees Dr. Hensing every six weeks and has a scan every 12 weeks. Aside from some annoying side effects related to the medicine, she is going strong and planning for her annual summer trip to Europe with her daughter who is now a sophomore in college. In addition to visiting two new countries each year, they make a distinctly American pilgrimage every summer\u2014heading to two new major league ballparks. She has high praise for her team of NorthShore physi- cians, including Dr. Hensing, internist Scott Cienkus, MD, and dermatologist Sarah Kasprowicz, MD, who has worked with Dr. Hensing to help treat some of the side effects. While Szabo is grateful for her care at Kellogg Cancer Center, in general she said she spends as little time as possible even thinking about her cancer. \"I feel very healthy, and I take even better care of myself now than I ever did,\" Szabo said. \"I try to live my life the way I always have.\" Biomarkers Drive Successful TherapyEarly Detection The National Lung Screening Trial, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, made headlines this year as results of the study, which looked at CT screening versus traditional X-ray for those at high risk of developing lung cancer, showed a dramatic 20 percent reduction in lung cancer deaths. Ahead of the curve, NorthShore has actively participated in the International Early Lung Cancer Action Project (I-ELCAP) for 10 years, exploring the use of low-dose CT scans to detect lung cancer at a curable stage in asymptomatic smokers. Daniel Ray, MD, principal investigator for I-ELCAP at NorthShore, has long been an impassioned advocate for screening high-risk patients and with the scientific evidence to support this tool has helped broaden awareness and access of these CT scans for appropriate patients. Smokers and those with a history of smoking, especially those between 55 and 75 years old, are encouraged to talk with their physicians and consider a CT scan, which is available at a reduced cost at all NorthShore hospitals and three outpatient centers at Old Orchard, Vernon Hills and Northbrook Court. continued on page 4 >>4 NorthShore University HealthSystem020406080100020406080100 LUNG NCDB Stat s Lung Cancer Observed Survival by Stage Comparison of NCDB to NorthShore Data Cases diagnosed 1998-2002 *Insufficient cases to display survival year for Stage 0.

Robust Research Initiative NorthShore has a robust research program in thoracic oncology with a particular emphasis on drug development and novel therapeutics. Translational research studies looking at ways to predict how patients will do with specific treatments based on biomarkers are under way and leverage NorthShore's substantial tumor bank and pathology capabilities. Our collaboration with the University of Chicago means that Kellogg Cancer Center patients have access to an increasingly wide array of clinical trials offered at NorthShore hospitals and the University of Chicago Medical Center. Many new oral chemotherapy agents are now available, and more are in the pipeline. NorthShore physicians work hand in hand with colleagues at the University of Chicago to ensure seamless care for patients.

Tobacco use is most obviously linked to lung cancer, but additionally is known to contribute signifi- cantly to the risk for many other cancers, including head and neck, pancreatic, bladder, kidney, stomach and uterine.While there is significant evidence that continued tobacco use after the diagnosis of cancer decreases survival, reduces treatment efficacy, and increases treatment toxicity and the risk for recurrence, many cancer patients continue to smoke after diagnosis. In an effort to help cancer patients and their families successfully tackle the battle against tobacco addiction, Kellogg Cancer Center implemented a comprehensive smoking cessation program in 2011. Oncology pharmacist Shannon Gavin completed intensive training at Mayo Clinic to become a certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist and helped develop the program for Kellogg, which utilizes NorthShore's advanced Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system to document patient information and collect data for ongoing research. Clinical practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence recommend using the time of cancer diagnosis as a \"teachable moment\" for tobacco cessation. The combi-nation of support from a trained professional and the use of tobacco cessation medications increases the chances of quitting successfully.Oncology pharmacist Shannon Gavin Our program is innovative in that it is integrated into the care provided at Kellogg Cancer Center, is pharmacist-driven and addresses both the behavioral and physiological compo- nents. The specially trained oncology pharmacists' role has grown from drug dispensing to education and management of a chronic disease. Although it is too early to document long-term results, the new tobacco cessation program is showing promising results and clearly supports the mission of the Kellogg Cancer Center to provide the highest level of care possible while supporting continued research and prevention efforts. A collaborative team of breast specialists, including surgeons, oncologists, radiation therapists, radiologists and nurses, is joined with critical support from psychosocial oncology, integrative medicine, nutrition and more to provide individually tailored, advanced care to each patient. New cases come before our team of experts at weekly multidisciplinary breast conferences, ensuring that personalized treatment plans reflect the best thinking and collective experience from a range of leading physicians. Patients with breast cancer make up the largest percentage of Kellogg Cancer Center patients, and NorthShore's program was the first in the Chicago region to be accredited by the American College of Surgeons' National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers. This year, the team welcomed breast-focused medical oncologist Teresa Law, MD, who sees patients at both the Evanston and Highland Park Hospital Kellogg Cancer Centers.

A new and enhanced breast center was opened at Highland Park Hospital in September, designed in keeping with our commitment to patients' comfort. Early detection is a major element of NorthShore's program, which features same-day screening mammogram appointments, fast-track scheduling for diagnostic procedures and appointments with breast surgeons. As a leader in diagnostic imaging, NorthShore patients benefit from the latest technology, including digital mammogram, ultrasound and MRI, as well as the added expertise from sub-specialized radiologists who interpret all images. Our nurse navigator provides another level of service and assistance to newly diagnosed patients, helping them with everything from coordinating care issues to accessing support services and financial counseling. The breast nurse navigator also attends tumor board conferences and has regular interaction with key physicians. NorthShore's breast program offers a lymphedema treatment program with dedicated physical and occupational therapists. Leaders in nipple-sparing mastectomies, NorthShore surgeons David J. Winchester, MD, and Michael Howard, MD, who specializes in plastic and reconstructive procedures, are pioneers in this complicated procedure. Research Priorities A dedicated team of physician scientists is focused on research related to preven-tion, detection and improved treatment for breast cancer, and this research is a critical component of our program. Katharine Yao, MD, Director of the Breast Surgical Program, and Dr. Winchester are co-investigators for multiple studies of surgical outcomes in breast cancer, and the National Cancer Data Base, a joint project of the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons, has selected NorthShore as a breast alpha site. Drs. Yao and Winchester along with faculty in the Department of Health Studies at the University of Chicago are looking at radiation and surgical treatment trends in breast care using the National Cancer Data Base. Using the same database, NorthShore plastic and reconstructive surgeon Mark Sisco, MD, recently presented a poster of \"exceptional merit\" at the American College of Surgeons meeting looking at reconstruction rates. NorthShore has been a member of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Community Clinical Oncology Program since its inception in 1983. The program coordinates a broad range of clinical trials exploring emerging treatment options and new drug therapies. Clinical trials offered by our team ensure that our patients have access to the latest promising treatments. Among the many clinical trials currently offered are: UC 09-056-B: Investigation of Genetic Determinants of Capecitabine Toxicity The purpose of this study is to find out if genes have a role in certain side effects experienced while taking capecitabine. NSABP B-46-I/USOR07132: A Phase III Clinical Trial Comparing the Combination of TC Plus Bevacizumab to TC Alone and to TAC for Women with Node-Positive or High-Risk Node-Negative, HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer The purpose of this study is to learn if adding an investigational drug to two different combinations of standard chemotherapy drugs will decrease the chance of breast cancer returning in patients with early stage HER-2 negative breast cancer.

She couldn't foresee those adjustments including breast cancer. Not yet 40 and with no family history of breast cancer, Bassett had never had a mammogram when she made an appointment after finding the lump in her breast. A biopsy confirmed she had early-stage breast cancer and she met her surgeon, Katharine Yao, MD, Director of NorthShore's Breast Surgical Program. \"Dr. Yao is an expert and very personable,\" Bassett said. \"She gave me a lot of confidence.\" Dr. Yao told Bassett that NorthShore had implemented the treatment approach confirmed by the groundbreaking American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z011 Clinical Trial. For early-stage breast cancer patients like Bassett, who require a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy, the new protocol spares lymph node tissue and minimizes painful, potentially harmful side effects. Following her surgery, Bassett saw oncologist Douglas Merkel, MD, who managed her chemotherapy treatment. \"He's a brilliant man,\" she said. Along with nurse Diane Nechi-Fragassi, they encouraged her through the treatment. \"The care is so integrated,\" she said. \"They made chemotherapy tolerable.\" Sometimes the best treatment for patients goes beyond traditional medi- cal care. Caregivers collaborate so that patients can access programs that enhance their medical treatment. \"I leveraged every service I could possibly lever-age,\" Bassett said. This included acupuncture through NorthShore's Integrative Medicine Program and counseling through the Psychosocial Program, which provides services to help patients manage emotional and practical needs. She is now enrolled in the Living in the Future (LIFE) Cancer Survivorship Program to help her adapt and focus on her future health and well-being. NCIC MA.32: A Randomized Phase III Trial of Metformin Versus Placebo on Recurrence and Survival in Early Stage Breast Cancer This study is looking at whether Metformin, a drug that is commonly used to treat diabetes, can decrease or affect the ability of breast cancer cells to grow and whether Metformin will work with other therapy to keep cancer from recurring. CZOL446E2352: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Stratified, Multi-Center, 2-ARM Trial of the Continued Efficacy and Safety of Zometa in Patients with Documented Bone Metastases from Breast Cancer The purpose of this study is to find out whether a drug known as Zometa continues to decrease skeletal-related events (like broken bones) after the initial nine doses. CRAD001W2301: A Randomized Phase III, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multicenter Trial of Everolimus in Combination and Vinorelbine, in Pretreated Women with HER2/neu Over-Expressing Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer This study aims to find out if the drug everolimus, when combined with the FDA- approved medications trastuzumab and vinorelbine, is safe and has beneficial effects in people who have HER2/neu over-expressing breast cancer that is locally advanced or has spread to additional sites. LPT112515: A Randomized Phase III, Open-Label Study of Lapatinib plus Trastuzumab Versus Trastuzumab as Continued HER2 Suppression Therapy after Completion of First- or Second-Line Trastuzumab plus Chemotherapy in Subjects with HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the drug lapatinib when used in combination with the drug trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

A robust translational research program backs our clinical efforts as our collabor- ative group is committed to research aimed at prevention, early detection and better treatment for women's cancers. Led by Gustavo Rodriguez, MD, the Matthews Family Chair of Gynecologic Oncology Research, the Division of Gynecologic Oncology provides a growing number of patients multidisciplinary care that features the combined talents of gynecological oncologists, geneticists, radiologists, radiation oncologists and pathologists. important support services including psychosocial oncology, integrative medicine and nutrition. The division's clinical trials and translational research program is led by Jean Hurteau, MD, and the minimally invasive program is directed by Carolyn Kirschner, MD. Gynecology Cancer Conference NorthShore Evanston Hospital Kellogg Room G868, Thursdays, 7 a.m. EH10-244: Peritumoral Fat as a Promoter of Invasive Breast Carcinoma The purpose of this study is to evaluate fat tissues around breast cancers and in nonaffected breast tissue. Through the study, we hope to gain understanding of how fat tissues may promote breast cancer progression. EH09-139: Prospective Observational Trial of Breast MRI in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancers The purpose of this study is to look at surgical outcomes and quality of life in patients undergoing preoperative breast MRI. A new summer research internship in breast cancer and clinical trial research was added this year, made possible through philanthropic support, providing an opportunity for undergraduate students to participate and learn about clinical and translational research at NorthShore. The breast program continues to benefit from our academic affiliation with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. NorthShore is starting an MRI project for high-risk breast lesions that is a joint effort between researchers at NorthShore and the University of Chicago. In addition, Dr. Yao is working with researchers at the University of Chicago looking at the role of microRNAs in breast cancer progression, which was recently funded by a breast and ovarian research grant from The Auxiliary of NorthShore at Evanston and Glenbrook Hospitals. We are grateful for ongoing philanthropic support, which is critical to our mis- sion to offer the highest level of care and continue innovative research aimed at pre- vention, early detection and optimal treatment. A generous donation from the Karen Dove Cabral Foundation will enable Kellogg Cancer Center to provide much-needed support services to young mothers with breast cancer by helping fund certain costs such as noncovered medical expenses and child care fees while undergoing treat-ment. A generous donation from the Modestus Bauer Foundation supports an annual symposium between NorthShore and the University of Chicago to discuss important papers presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. For more information, call the Department of Surgery at (847) 570-1700 or Medical Oncology at (847) 570-2112.2011 Oncology Annual Report 9 A leader in minimally invasive surgical approaches, NorthShore offers patients the benefits of the most sophisticated technology and technique. The robotic sur- gery program has been significantly expanded to include surgery for endometrial cancers. The majority of proce-dures are now done robotically, benefiting patients with shorter hospital stays, less pain and quicker recoveries. A new fellowship program established with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and co-directed by Dr. Hurteau debuted this year and reflects our growing ongoing collaboration with our academic partner. The NorthShore gynecology program was recog- nized this year in U.S. News & World Report as one of the top gynecology programs in the nation. Groundbreaking Research Innovative research at the division is supported by major federal grants, The Auxiliary of NorthShore at Evanston and Glenbrook Hospitals, Bears Care (the charitable bene- ficiary of the Chicago Bears) and a host of generous donors, many of whom are patients and their families. Dr. Rodriguez and his research team are focused on ovarian cancer prevention strategies, as the best hope for decreasing ovarian cancer mortality in the future likely lies in prevention. In recent years they have uncovered a major biological mechanism underlying the ovarian cancer preventive effects of estrogen-progestin oral con-traceptive pills (OCP). Ongoing research is focused on progestins and progesterone and vitamin D's synergistic effects as chemopreventive agents for ovarian cancer. Dr. Rodriguez and his colleagues are widely published and recognized for this promising work. He continues to hold a leadership position with the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) and serves as lead investigator on protocol 214, a national clinical trial studying whether certain hormones play a role in the prevention of ovarian cancer. NorthShore's extensive clinical trial program ensures that patients have access to emerging therapies and the latest discoveries. Dr. Hurteau is the principal investigator on several exciting studies related to chemotherapy and drug treatments designed to answer fundamental questions about the best treatment for ovarian cancer. These studies include: GOG 0252: A Phase III Trial of Bevacizumab with IV Versus IP Chemotherapy in Ovarian, Fallopian Tube and Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma The study compares three different combinations of chemotherapy with or without the addition of an investigational drug known as bevacizumab. GOG 0262: A Randomized Phase III Trial of Every-3-Weeks Paclitaxel Versus Dose Dense Weekly Paclitaxel in Combination with Carboplatin with or with-out Concurrent and Consolidation Bevacizumab (NSC #704865, IND #7921) in the Treatment of Primary Stage III or IV Epithelial Ovarian, Peritoneal or Fallopian Tube Cancer The study compares the good and/or bad effects of the current standard treatment for ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer with those of investigational treatments.

Dr. Gustavo Rodriguez10 NorthShore University HealthSystemThanks to a $5 million philanthropic gift from John and Carol Walter, prostate cancer care at NorthShore will be delivered through the new John and Carol Walter Center for Urologic Health. Co-directed by Charles Brendler, MD, the Ronald L. Chez Family and Richard Melman Family Chair of Prostate Cancer, and Michael McGuire, MD, Urology Division Chief, the Center is focused on personalized care for prostate cancer patients, as well as men and women with urologic cancers and other diseases. Patients will benefit from not only leading urologists, radiation oncologists and medical oncologists, but also essential support services focused on nutritional and integrative medicine, sexual health, genetic counseling and psychosocial issues. The remarkable generosity and vision of John and Carol Walter have inspired a matching gift of $5 million from Donald and Joan Rappeport to further support the urologic health programs that will be housed in the Walter Center for Urologic Health. These two truly transformational gifts will enable us to launch a compre- hensive set of clinical and research initiatives that will directly benefit both our current and future urologic patients. The team welcomed several important new members in the last year, includ- ing Jeffrey Albaugh, PhD, an advanced practice nurse with a doctorate in sexual health and 20 years of experience caring for men and women with sexual health concerns; Kristian Novakovic, MD, a fellowship-trained urologic oncologist with special interests in both kidney and prostate cancer; and Sangtae Park, MD, a fellowship-trained minimally invasive surgeon with expertise in both single-port laparoscopic and natural orifice surgery. The NorthShore urology program was recognized this year in U.S. News & World Report as one of the top urology programs in the nation. Active Surveillance NorthShore has the only Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prostate cancer active surveillance clinical trial in the region. More than 150 patients have been screened to date and more than 100 are currently enrolled in the study, which was initiated in 2009. Dr. Brendler recently became Co-Chairman of the National Cancer Institute Specialized Program of Research Excellence (NCI SPORE) Active Surveillance Working Group, and NorthShore recently became the coordinating center for all 15 active surveillance programs across North America. Active surveillance presentations have been made at several regional and national meetings as interest grows and evidence mounts that it is a safe approach. Men enrolled in the trial are followed very closely with a physical exam as well as blood and urine tests every six months, and undergo surveillance prostate biopsies every two years. For the vast majority of patients, it is very safe to be followed closely for a number of years without treatment, which all too often leaves men with some side effects, usually affecting sexual or urinary health. The active surveillance trial at NorthShore follows men closely, and recommends and initiates effective treatment when indicated so that no man progresses to incurable prostate cancer. Additionally, men in the trial receive care from a dedicated team of health professionals providing psychosocial, nutritional and lifestyle guidance to help them optimize their chances of successful outcome. Research is an integral part of the prostate cancer program. NorthShore has the only IRB-approved clinical trial in the region examining quality of life and the Prostate Cancer: Improving Outcomes NorthShore's comprehensive prostate cancer program continues to offer the most advanced, collaborative care composed of a broad range of specialists and researchers dedicated to patients and improved outcomes for this highly curable disease.

The principal investigator of this study is David Victorson, PhD. NorthShore is also the top recruiting site in the United States and sixth overall internationally in the IMPACT study, an international clinical trial investigating the impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations on prostate cancer risk and progression in men with a family history of BRCA1 or BRCA2 positive breast cancer. A collaborative team of clinicians and scientists is involved in promising studies designed to develop better diagnostic and treatment options for pros- tate cancer. Susan Crawford, MD, Director of Urologic Research, was recently named Scientific Director of the NorthShore Center for Molecular Medicine, which is led by Janardan Khandekar, MD. Dr. Crawford was awarded a grant from the Prostate Cancer Foundation to investigate the role of periprostatic fat in prostate cancer progression in an effort to further understand the relation-ship of obesity to cancer risk and progression. Dr. Crawford is also leading an exciting initiative related to the use of neural stem cells embedded in a bio adhesive derived from marine mollusks to eradi-cate residual cancer cells following surgical removal of a cancer. Karen Kaul, MD, PhD, and colleagues are involved in sophisticated molecular diagnostic investigations related to new biomarkers such as urinary PCA3 to both diagnose and determine prognosis in prostate cancer. Through philanthropic and corporate funding, NorthShore has recently acquired a mass spectrometer and will be using this sophisticated technology in combination with our existing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectros-copy equipment to analyze biological samples in order to develop metabolic profiles, or \"fingerprints,\" that in the future will allow us to predict prognosis and guide therapy on an individual basis. Our metabolomics facility will be an integral component of the new NorthShore Center for Molecular Medicine and will be the only one of its kind in the region and one of only a few such facilities in the United States. For more information, call (847) 657-5730. Led by Interim Director Peter Hulick, MD, the Center offers thorough clinical consultations, serving all types of cancer patients and those at risk for familial cancers, while working collaboratively with referring physicians and families to make the best possible decisions for individual care. Using the most advanced technology and latest knowledge in the field, the Center's team helps patients with a wide range of familial cancer syndromes, including BRCA1/2, Li-Fraumeni, Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Gorlin syndrome and Cowden syndrome. The genetics team will help make personalized screening recommendations such as breast MRI versus mammogram or frequency of colonoscopy screenings even when a specific familiar cancer syndrome cannot be delineated through genetic testing. NorthShore has instituted routine screening of all colon and uterine cancers for Lynch syndrome, using microsatellite instability (MSI) testing, which follows the latest recommendation from the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) working group.Medical Genetics: Advanced Technology With one of the most active programs in the country, NorthShore's Center for Medical Genetics is a leader in both patient care and national and international research efforts. continued on page 12 >>Source: 2011 NCDB, Commission on Cancer, Survival Reportsn NorthShore n National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) of colorectal and pancreaticobiliary cancer treatment, NorthShore also provides care for all GI-related cancers. Our collaborative approach ensures outstanding care for even rare and more complicated cases. We offer multidisciplinary clinics at both Evanston and Glenbrook Hospitals where patients can see experts from GI, medical oncology and surgery all at one location. Our Kellogg Cancer Center team includes important support from psychosocial oncology, integrative medicine, specially trained pharmacists, nurses, nutritionists and more who provide comprehensive and seamless care. Leaders in minimally invasive surgical techniques, NorthShore surgeons perform laparoscopic procedures on most patients. We are one of only a few centers in the Chicago area using minimally invasive approaches to manage pancreas and liver resections. Our experienced surgeons continue to push the boundaries of innovative technology including robotic surgery and scarless, or transanal and transoral, procedures. Interventional Radiology now offers a full menu of therapeutic interventions, including embolization of tumor vasculature, radiofrequency ablation and Yttrium-90 perfusion. These are minimally invasive and either supple- ment current multimodality approaches or replace older, more invasive therapies. Focus on Prevention Our program emphasizes prevention and early detection and offers a high-risk colorectal cancer clinic for patients who have a family history or other risk factors for the disease.

GI Cancer Conferences NorthShore Evanston Hospital Kellogg Room G868, Fridays, 7 a.m. NorthShore Highland Park Hospital Videocast, Meeting Room 1B A leader in an international prostate cancer screening, NorthShore is involved in the IMPACT (Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted Screening in BRACA1/2 mutation carriers and controls) study for men at high risk. Men ages 40 to 69 with a known BRCA1/2 mutation or known mutation in their family are part of the IMPACT study, which looks at PSA screen- ing effectiveness for the high-risk group. NorthShore's Center for Medical Genetics is one of four centers in the United States currently enrolling men in the study and has the highest enrollment of any of the US sites. Preliminary results indicate that men at high risk due to predisposing genes may benefit from earlier screening. Concerns about over diagnosis of prostate cancer in men at average risk may not pertain to men at genetic risk, whose cancers tend to be more aggressive. Committed to raising awareness and community education related to medical genetic issues, the Center hosted a Previvor event this year offering free breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment. (Previvor is a survivor of a genetic predisposition to cancer.) The Center's research efforts continue to grow as collaboration increases within a variety of NorthShore departments and with academic affiliation partners at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine.

Although he sensed something was wrong, his eventual diagnosis of Stage IV colon cancer in March 2011 came \"out of left field.\" But Phillips, 41, put his trust\u2014and faith in God\u2014in the physicians and staff at NorthShore's Kellogg Cancer Center. After a battery of tests confirmed his cancer diagnosis, he started chemotherapy two weeks later at Highland Park Hospital under the supervision of medical oncologist Matthew Adess, MD. \"When Dr. Adess told me that I had Stage IV colon cancer, my response was, 'OK, Doc\u2014what's next?'\" Phillips said. \"I stand strong in my faith, so between God and Dr. Adess, I knew I would be OK.\" Phillips has multiple work-life priorities: a wife and three sons, a career as a technical support manager at a software manufacturer and serving as associate minister at his church. Jeffrey Phillips directed by Laura K. Bianchi, MD, counsels women about their individual risk and offers personalized risk-reduction strategies, including lifestyle modifica-tions. The Center also features enhanced prescreening education with a GI nurse to ease anxiety about colonoscopies. Female gastroenterology special- ists are available to further eliminate barriers for women resistant to screening. Innovative research is a key component of our GI program. Hemant Roy, MD, who has been recognized as a national leader in colon cancer research, directs the Women's GI Cancer Risk and Prevention Center's research initia- tives and supports the entire GI program. Dr. Roy's research focuses on the prevention of colorectal cancer through developing novel early detection and chemoprevention strategies. He was invited this year to serve as a member of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Cancer Biomarkers Study Section, Center for Scientific Review. We participate in an array of clinical trials, ensuring that our patients have access to the latest therapies and novel treatment options. Our collaboration with our academic partner, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, significantly strengthens our research efforts and gives our patients even greater access to the latest cutting-edge trials. Advanced Therapeutic Endoscopy Mick Meiselman, MD, FASGE, AGAF, new Chief of Advanced Therapeutic Endoscopy at NorthShore, is developing an innovatieve program for Barrett's and advanced esophageal disease, as well as pancreaticobiliary tract condi- tions. Sophisticated technology plays an increasingly critical role in diagnosing and treating benign and malignant tumors in the liver and GI tract. Confocal laser endomicroscopy, an outpatient procedure, allows physicians to monitor changes in the esophagus with real-time, high-resolution images, elim-inating the need for invasive biopsies and allowing for early diagnosis of Barrett's. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses a high-frequency alternate current to remove or treat the precancerous tissue in the esophagus with a safe, incision- less procedure, eradicating cancer before it develops. Endoscopic ultrasound is an incredibly valuable tool with an ever-increasing number of uses, including early diagnosis and staging of many cancers.

A series of sus-picious, but inconclusive tests led him to the Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon, Georgia, where a thumb-sized tumor at the base of his tongue was ultimately diagnosed as Stage IV oropharyngeal cancer. Having served multiple combat tours, including stints in Southeast Asia, Iraq and Somalia, the 49-year-old career soldier was in good heath and a self-described tough guy. But hearing the words \"you have cancer\" initially left him anguished and thinking of his 23-year-old daughter. \"When you get the C word, it's devastating. What flashed through my mind was, 'I've deployed five times and been through three wars and CSM David DavisI'm going to die of cancer?'\" said CSM Davis. Immediately exploring his best options for treatment, CSM Davis was ready to fight, and luckily found NorthShore oncologist Bruce Brockstein, MD, a nationally recognized expert in head and neck cancers, who is on the frontline of advanced protocols for aggressive cancers like the one CSM Davis had. Three weeks after diagnosis, CSM Davis began a diffi- cult and intensive course of chemotherapy and radiation based on the specific nature of his cancer, which Dr. Brockstein determined was related to the HPV virus. Undergoing six months of intensive therapy took a toll on CSM Davis who lost 40 pounds and suffered through painful side effects, including a throat so sore it \"felt like swallowing shards of glass or hot lava.\" Trained never to quit, CSM Davis endured and won the battle. \"He made it through very rough treatment and to date all of his tests are excellent,\" Dr. Brockstein said. \"There is no sign of recurrence, and he is functioning at an extremely high level both personally and professionally.\" CSM Davis now serves as the Division CSM, 807th Medical Command headquartered at Fort Douglas, Utah. As the senior enlisted advisor to the commanding general, Davis coordinates command and control initiatives and training for an 11,500 strong medical command. Both CSM Davis and Dr. Brockstein cited the impor- tance of the team approach to care, with a collaborative group of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, speech and swallowing therapists, nutritionists and other caregivers contributing to a successful recovery. \"I feel great. I'm 99 percent back to where I was before my cancer diagnosis,\" said CSM Davis. \"Dr. Brockstein is tremendous, but it was really a team effort\u2014 the same way we operate in the military.

The team strives to offer patients the highest chance of cure with the lowest toxicities, including nonsurgical or minimal surgery options whenever possible. A full range of specialized tertiary care is available, including intraoral endo- scopic laser surgery, IMRT and stereotactic radiosurgery. The head and neck group members are active in a variety of national research, education and advocacy initiatives, including contributions to and editorship of the influential UpToDate online textbook. NorthShore sponsors a head and neck support group, affiliated with SPOHNC (Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer), which meets regularly, provides current information through lectures and offers consistent support for patients and caregivers.2011 Oncology Annual Report 19Psychosocial Oncology Program The Kellogg Cancer Center's Psychosocial Oncology Program consists of clinical psychologist Tina Gremore, PhD, and social workers Katie Durbin, LCSW. The psychosocial team works together to address a variety of needs of patients and families, including practical issues to emotional matters such as hopes and fears. A comprehensive psychosocial distress screening program was implemented this year. The goal of this program is to identify clinical levels of distress among patients at crucial periods during their treatments. As clinical levels of distress are identified by the medical team, patients are contacted by a member of the psychosocial team for further assessment of distress and referral as needed. Over the past year, psychosocial support availability has increased through the support of the Guided Patient System (GPS) program, funded by The Auxiliary of NorthShore at Evanston and Glenbrook Hospitals. The program also provides monthly group support for caregivers, head and neck cancer patients and their caregivers, and breast cancer patients and hosts a bimonthly stress reduction/meditation group. Cancer Survivorship Program The first community cancer survivorship program in Illinois, NorthShore's Living in the Future (LIFE) program is directed by Carol A. Rosenberg, MD, and continues to serve a growing group of patients. NorthShore's LIFE program establishes survivorship as a distinct phase of care in the cancer care continu- um, a best practice model for healthcare. All of LIFE's services are available at no cost to those in NorthShore's cancer program. The LIFE program addresses with coordinated and compassionate care the potential long-term and late effects of cancer and its treatment on survivors' physical and psychosocial well-being. The cornerstone of the LIFE program is the personalized Risk Adapted Visit where a customized Survivorship Care Plan is developed by our survivorship experts. The plan summarizes all the modali-ties of cancer treatment and provides recommendations for a healthy post- treatment lifestyle. In LIFE's monthly Myra Rubenstein Weis (MRW) Survivor 101 educational workshops, major topics important to cancer survivors such as a lifestyle, self- esteem and sexual intimacy, cognitive changes, genetics, and insurance and employability are addressed. In these popular and award-winning seminars, the latest medical evidence to improve the longevity and quality of life for cancer survivors is discussed by leading experts in the survivorship field. In LIFE's Eat to Beat Malignancy, Walk Away from Cancer seminar, cancer survivors learn that engaging in one hour of robust walking a day will afford them a 50 percent lower risk of cancer progression or recurrence than their sedentary counter - parts. The LIFE program is grateful for support from the Myra Rubenstein Weis Health Resource Center. Dr. Rosenberg and LIFE Clinical Coordinator Carol Flanagan, RN, MSN, OCN, are frequent keynote speakers at support and advocacy group meetings throughout the region. The LIFE program continues to receive both regional and national recognition for its unique programming and survivorship care planning and was most recently designated as a model community survivorship program by the Volunteer Hospital Association (VHA). Dr. Tina Gremore20 NorthShore University HealthSystemGuided Patient Support (GPS) Program Developed with initial funding from The Auxiliary of NorthShore at Evanston and Glenbrook Hospitals and with guidance from NorthShore's Oncology Patient Advisory Board, the GPS program provides Kellogg Cancer Center patients access to multiple services dedicated to total patient care. The GPS program acts as an umbrella for the following critical programs: nurse navigators, patient financial advocacy, psychosocial oncology support and nutrition counseling. Nurse navigators meet with newly diagnosed breast, lung and GI cancer patients and help throughout the cancer journey assisting with coordinating care, decision making, accessing financial counseling and arranging for additional support from nutrition, integrative medicine and more. Nurse navigators also attend weekly tumor board meetings and interact regularly with key physicians. Integrative Medicine A growing number of oncology patients are accessing integrative medicine services at Kellogg Cancer Center and reaping the benefits of treatments designed to both ease the physical and emotional burdens of cancer and nurture the body's healthy functions and wellness during conventional cancer treatments. Led by Medical Director Leslie Mendoza Temple, MD, NorthShore's Integrative Medicine Program is among the most well-established programs in the country and is a member of the national Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine. Our integrative medicine physicians and practitioners work collaboratively with oncolo-gists, and all caregivers are connected through NorthShore's Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, ensuring seamless communication. Traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and integrative bodywork safely complement conventional cancer care and have been shown to help reduce fatigue, nausea, pain, weight loss and neuropathy. These therapies may also help reduce stress and anxiety. Integrative medicine services\u2014including traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture, massage therapy and bodywork\u2014are now available at Kellogg Cancer Centers at both Evanston and Highland Park Hospitals. Laser acupuncture is also available to treat patients who may not be able to tolerate traditional acupuncture due to lymphedema or fear of needles. Thanks to a new funding partnership with the Karen Dove Cabral Foundation, young mothers with breast cancer being treated at the Center are eligible for financial support for integrative medicine treatments. The Integrative Medicine Benefit Concert Fund is also available to assist cancer patients who cannot afford out-of-pocket expenses. For more information, call (847) 657-3540.

Of those, 3,220 cases (87 percent) were analytic. By definition, analytic cases are those patients newly diagnosed with malignant neoplasm and/or have received all or part of their first course of treatment at one of our hospitals. The remaining 481 cases (13 percent) were non-analytic. Non-analytic cases are patients initially diagnosed and treated at another facility, who now are receiving treatment for progression or recurrence of their disease at NorthShore. Details by site are provided in Table 1. Class of Case 2010 Class of Case divides cases into two groups, analytic cases (Class 00-22) and non-analytic cases (Class 30-49). Class 00-14, which account for 2,722 cases, were those malignancies diagnosed at one of our four hospitals. Once diagnosed with cancer, 2582 (95 percent) of our patients remained at NorthShore for their treatment. Class 20-22, totaling 498 cases, were diagnosed elsewhere and referred here for treatment. Class 30-38, a total of 481 cases, were diagnosed and treated elsewhere and referred here for treatment of a recurrence or progression of disease. Overall Top Five NorthShore Sites Breast cancer continues to be our top site, representing a striking 24 percent of the total analytic cases seen at NorthShore. The next most frequent cancers seen were: lung (9 percent), prostate (7 percent), and colon and lymphoma (each, 5 percent). These top five sites represent 50 percent of all newly diagnosed cases. Distribution by AJCC Stage for the Top Five Sites Seen at NorthShore Cancer diagnoses are classified into four of five stages depending on the site. Each stage represents how far the tumor has spread from the organ or site of origin, where an increasing value represents more tumor involvement or extension. Eighty-nine percent of our breast cancers were diagnosed at an early stage (Stages 0, I and II), reflecting the national (82 percent) trend toward early detection. Thirty-four percent of our lung cancers (national 27 percent), 83 percent of our prostate cancers (national 80 percent), 60 percent of our colon cancers (national 49 percent) and 49 percent of our lymphomas (national 36 percent) were also diagnosed with early stage disease. In each of the top sites seen at NorthShore, detection at an early stage was significantly higher or equal to that seen nationally. National data supplied by the 2011 NCDB, Commission on Cancer, ACoS Benchmark Reports (2008 data), the latest year available. Data for NorthShore is from diagnosis year 2010. See Table 2. Overall Five-Year Survival for Top Five Sites Stage at diagnosis also predicts the patient's survival rate or the percentage of people who will survive for five years after the cancer diagnosis. Survival calculations allow for the fact that some cancer patients die of other causes. Based on cases diagnosed in 1998-2002 and submitted to the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), overall survival rates at NorthShore for the top five sites compare favorably to those seen nationally. For breast cancer, our overall five-year survival rate is 89 percent (national 85 percent). Longer or equivalent overall survival rates are seen for the remaining top four sites as well. For lung, 16 percent (national 14 percent); for prostate, 88 percent (national 86 percent); for colon, 58 percent (national 54 percent) and for lymphoma, 61 percent for NorthShore (national 60 percent).
