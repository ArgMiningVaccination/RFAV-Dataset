COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated This product is conditional approval. Please read the instructions carefully and use under the guidance of a physician Drug Name Common Name: Vero Trade Name: COVILO English Inactivated is made from the SARS-CoV-2, 19nCoV-CDC-Tan-HB02 strain which is inoculated on the Vero cells for culturing, harvesting, -propiolactone-inactivation, concentration and purification, then followed by adsorption with aluminium hydroxide adjuvant to form the liquid vaccine. The vaccine is free of antibiotics and preservatives. Active Sodium chloride, Sodium dihydrogen phosphate Appearance The product is a semi-transparent suspension with slight white color, which could be layered due to precipitation, and the precipitation can be easily dispersed by shaking. Therapeutic Indication This product is for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals from 18 to 59 years of age. The vaccine efficacy of this product for adults in 18-59-year-old cohort have been shown based on the interim report of the international Phase clinical trial, in which, the proportion of older adults (60 years old) was low (2.01%). Pharmacodynamic Properties The antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 can be produced after vaccination, to prevent the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. This product is conditionally approved based on the results of protective efficacy reported in interim analysis of the international Phase clinical trial. The present experience with the vaccine from a Phase I/II trial up to 90 days post last - 2 - vaccination and the second interim data in approximately 30,000 healthy adults aged 18 years and older in UAE. Presentation Each non-auto disable pre-filled syringe/vial contains 0.5mL of product for each administration, each dose contains 3.9-10.4 units of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen and 0.3-0.6 mg/mL aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. Immunization Regimen and Dosage Two dose regimen at an interval of 21~28 days, each dose is 0.5mL. The recommended administration is through intramuscular route, the injection into a muscle will be preferably performed in the upper part of the arm. The need for booster immunization with this product has not been determined. Adverse Reactions The safety of this product is evaluated through the China and international clinical trials. The China Phase / clinical trials are randomized, double-blinded and placebo parallel controlled to preliminarily evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this product for adults 18 years and older. The international Phase clinical trial is an international multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled to evaluate the protective efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of this product.

The concomitant clinical trials on this vaccine in combination with other vaccines have not yet been conducted, therefore no data regarding the interaction between this vaccine with other vaccines are available. 2. Combination use with other drugs: Combination use with immunosuppressive drugs, such as immunosuppressive agents, chemotherapy drugs, anti-metabolic drugs, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, corticosteroids, etc. may reduce the body's immune response to this product. If any vaccines or drugs are being taken or recently taken, please inform the physician in time to avoid drug interaction. Clinical Trials The Phase clinical trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo parallel controlled design and it was conducted in the United Arab Emirates (Abu Dhabi, Sharjah), Kingdom of Bahrain, and many other countries/regions. At least 45,000 healthy subjects aged 18 years and above were randomized to receive candidate vaccine 1 (this product), candidate vaccine 2 or placebo with two-dose regimen (0, 21 (+7) days) to evaluate the vaccine efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. The primary study hypothesis was that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of the vaccine efficacy (VE) calculated from 14 days after of the 2nd immunization of this product was greater than 30% in healthy individuals aged 18 years and above. The interim analysis results of the international Phase clinical trials are as following. The primary endpoint of the Phase clinical trial is the incidence of COVID-19 case calculated from 14 days after 2 doses, and the calculation method for vaccine efficacy based on person-year incidence is the main analysis method for vaccine efficacy. During the interim analysis, all effective endpoint cases (114 cases) of infection during the monitoring period were confirmed by the Endpoint Assessment Committee (EAC). The interim analysis data showed that following the two-dose vaccination regimen with 21 (+7) days apart, the vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 was 78.89% (95%CI: 65.79%~86.97%) from 14 days after full-course vaccination, which achieved the hypothesis of the vaccine efficacy for second interim analysis. The median duration of participants follow-up at the time of data lock was 112 days. StorageStore and transport in a refrigerated (2-8) condition, protect from light. Do not freeze. - 6 - The Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVM) are on the label of Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd. The colour dot which appears on the label of the vial is a VVM. This is a time-temperature sensitive dot that provides an indication of the cumulative heat to which the vial has been exposed. It warns the end user when exposure to heat is likely to have degraded the vaccine beyond an acceptable level. The interpretation of the VVM is simple. Focus on the central square. Its colour will change progressively. As long as the colour of this square is lighter than the colour of the ring, then the vaccine can be used. As soon as the colour of the central square is the same colour as the ring or of a darker colour than the ring, then the vial should be discarded. As indicated in the VVM graphic above.
