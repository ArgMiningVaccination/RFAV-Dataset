Some posts have received thousands of views and likes. The posts all include a video claiming to show the chemical reaction between mercury and aluminium. The video snippet is from a 2021 YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVkpQKRgHvU) by [Home Science](https://www.youtube.com/@Home-Science), and does show this chemical reaction. But it has nothing to do with vaccines or their ingredients, as Associated Press News explains in their fact-check [here](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-vaccines-aluminum-mercury-reaction-video-681937422484). So what about the claim that mercury and aluminium, used as additives in some vaccines, are toxic when injected? We looked into it. Aluminium used as a vaccine adjuvant - and widely in everyday life When manufacturers develop a vaccine, they often add ingredients that help strengthen the immune system's response to the vaccine, making the vaccine work better. These ingredients are called [adjuvants](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html). [Aluminium salts](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#Aluminium-an-adjuvant) have been used in vaccines for over 70 years, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html) to the [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC). Originally used in tetanus and diphtheria vaccines, they are often also [used](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum) in vaccines for hepatitis A and B, some influenza vaccines, and pneumococcal vaccines, among [others](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html#:~:text=they%20are%20approved.-,Several%20different%20adjuvants%20are%20used%20in%20U.S.%20vaccines.,-Several%20different%20adjuvants). Although it may sound alarming for aluminium to be in a vaccine, it is actually all around us in everyday life too. [According](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.754) to the [European Food Safety Authority](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en), aluminium is produced by and used for \"water treatment, papermaking, fire retardant, fillers, food additives, colours and pharmaceuticals\". Small amounts of aluminium are in \"almost all\" food and drinking water, [according](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#Aluminium-an-adjuvant) to the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). Some foods, such as baked goods and particular vegetables, have [higher levels](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.754) than other foods. When the body absorbs this aluminium, it is [flushed out](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.754) of the body via the kidneys. High doses of aluminium, just like high doses of most substances, can cause health problems, [according](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=190&toxid=34) to the US government's [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/). For [example](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=190&toxid=34), workers who are exposed to large amounts of aluminium dust can develop respiratory problems, and people with kidney disease store more aluminium in their bodies, which can lead to bone or brain diseases. Historically, some [research](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/risk-factors-and-prevention/metals-and-dementia#:~:text=and%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease.-,Aluminium,-In%201965%2C%20researchers) suggested there may be a link between high levels of aluminium and Alzheimer's disease, but there is [not enough evidence](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/risk-factors-and-prevention/metals-and-dementia#:~:text=and%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease.-,Aluminium,-In%201965%2C%20researchers) to support this idea. Some other [studies](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=190&toxid=34) suggested that the aluminium in vaccines could be linked to autism spectrum disorders. But these studies were [found](https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/adjuvants#cms) to be \"seriously flawed\" by the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/)'s Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety](https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/). And [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22001122/) into aluminium-containing infant vaccines suggests that being exposed in this way carries \"extremely low risk\", even for babies. Since they first started being used in vaccines in the [1930s](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html#:~:text=Adjuvants%20have%20been%20used%20safely,for%20more%20than%2070%20years.), aluminium salts have not been a cause for concern among medical professionals. The amounts used are considered too small to be dangerous, and they aren't easily absorbed by the body, the CDC [confirms](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html#:~:text=Top%20of%20Page-,Aluminum,-Aluminum%2Dcontaining%20adjuvants). Mercury-containing vaccines - different forms of mercury with different effects Another adjuvant that historically was often used in vaccines is [thimerosal](https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/standards-and-specifications/vaccines-quality/thiomersal). This ingredient contains ethylmercury, a form of mercury, which prevents harmful bacteria growing in vaccines, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html) to the CDC. Given that mercury is [known](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23401210/) to be a toxic chemical, some people may be concerned about getting vaccines with an ingredient that contains mercury. High levels of [one type of mercury](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23401210/) have been linked with [cognitive impairments](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health#:~:text=Mercury%20and%20health-,Mercury%20and%20health,-31%20March%202017) and [brain damage](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health#:~:text=Mercury%20and%20health-,Mercury%20and%20health,-31%20March%202017). These impairments looked similar to those shown by children with disorders on the autism spectrum, which led to [worries](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/80308/media_aimee-2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) that mercury-containing vaccines were a [cause](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/80308/media_aimee-2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) of autism spectrum disorders, despite no evidence showing this. Before research was done, it was assumed that both forms of mercury were similarly toxic. As a precaution, thimerosal was [removed](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#Thiomersal-also-called-thimerosal-in-the-US-a-preservative) from most vaccines, \"in line with the global goal of reducing environmental exposure to mercury from all sources\", [according](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#Thiomersal-also-called-thimerosal-in-the-US-a-preservative) to the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). But there is now lots of data showing that the two forms are very [different](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html), the CDC says. While methylmercury [builds up](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23401210/) in the body and can be very dangerous in high doses, ethylmercury is [cleared](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23401210/) from the body quickly, even in young infants. Since the concerns about methylmercury were first raised, and the controversy around vaccines and autism, a lot of [research](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/thimerosal) has been done to make sure that ethylmercury in vaccines was not causing any harm. In the early 2000s, a scientific [review](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10997/immunization-safety-review-vaccines-and-autism) by the Institute of Medicine (now the [National Academy of Medicine](https://nam.edu/about-the-nam/#:~:text=Founded%20in%201970%20as%20the,Academies)%20in%20the%20United%20States.)) found that all the evidence showed [no causal link](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10997/immunization-safety-review-vaccines-and-autism) between thimerosal vaccines and autism. Since then, the CDC has done [numerous studies](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html) and come to the same conclusion: vaccines containing thimerosal do not cause autism. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/standards-and-specifications/vaccines-quality/thiomersal) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html) agree that the ingredient is not dangerous in other ways either. One [side effect](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/3/2/320) of vaccines that contain adjuvants is they can cause more minor swelling, pain and redness at the injection site, compared with vaccines that do not contain adjuvants. They can also cause more fever, chills and body aches. But this does not mean they are toxic. \"Vaccines containing adjuvants are tested for safety ... and they are continuously monitored by the CDC and FDA once they are approved,\" the CDC [said](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html#:~:text=Adjuvants%20have%20been%20used%20safely%20in%20vaccines%20for%20decades.). There is no reason to worry that aluminium and mercury in vaccines will react in your body like they do in the video posted on social media.
