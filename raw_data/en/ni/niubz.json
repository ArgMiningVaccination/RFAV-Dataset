Education 2013-2015 NHMRC Early Career Fellow (=NIH K01), University of Sydney, Australia 2012-2013 Postdoctoral Research Fellow, University of Sydney, Australia 2011-2012 Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Monash University, Australia 2007-2011 PhD in Pharmacy, Monash University, Australia 2004-2008 MSc in Pharmacy, National University of Singapore, Singapore 1997-2001 BEng in Pharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, China Research Our research focuses on: (1) particle engineering for innovative pharmaceutical manufacturing of solid dosage forms; (2) advanced characterization of pharmaceutical solids; (3) novel formulation design for pulmonary drug delivery systems. (1) Innovation is in great demand for pharmaceutical manufacturing aiming to improve the production efficiency of traditional small-molecule pharmaceutical products and to design suitable formulation for new biopharmaceutical entities. Our research is to apply novel particle engineering techniques such as spray drying and dry coating to design efficient manufacture process for solid dosage forms of both small- and large-molecule pharmaceuticals. (2) Characterization of solid surface properties is critical to ensure the manufacturability, stability and formulation performance of pharmaceutical solid dosage forms. Our research has developed an advanced surface characterization platform to achieve fundamental understanding in the impact of material surface properties on the formulation performance, including effect of surface composition on stability of amorphous solid dispersions and influence of surface properties on aerosol performance of dry powder inhalers. (3) Inhalation products become popular for treatment of pulmonary diseases because they can deliver the therapeutics directly to the site of diseases with potentially minimized systemic side effects and maximized treatment efficacy. Dr Zhou's research is to design smart inhalation formulations for improved treatment of critical pulmonary diseases such as lung infection.
