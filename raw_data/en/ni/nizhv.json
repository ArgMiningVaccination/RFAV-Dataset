'Healing'may be conceived as a shift toward the latter pole of thiscontinuum. The extremes of human deprivation 4and the crucible of terminal illness5,6teach us that in even the direst circumstances, peace is possible. It is possible to die healed.What are the variables that influence healing? What is ourrole as care providers? What is the relevance of these issues to our personal sense of wellbeing? Two t eachers Let me introduce you to two of my teachers about suffering. Chip was 30 when I carried out his surgery for metastatic disease from his germinal testicular cancer. With postoperativechemotherapy and now negative serum tumour markers, we hoped that he was cured. Over the ensuing months, however, hisdisease progressed. Gracious, outgoing, a world-class athlete onour national ski team, Chip had always been a winner. He wasengaged to be married, but now he was dying. All involved weredevastated. Just days before the end, he married his fianc\u00e9e andsaid goodbye to each of us. In our conversation, he commented,'You know Bal, this last year has been the best year of my life'.He confided that the source of this sense of quality time hadbeen a journey inward that was characterised by peace and asense of growth he had not previously known. Physicalmagnificence had given way to devastating weakness andcachexia, yet suffering had been transcended. Mrs C, born in Eastern Europe and now a widow in her seventies, had been admitted to the palliative care unit forcontrol of refractory pain related to her metastatic breastcarcinoma. Everything suggested nociceptive pain that shouldhave been easy to control, but our interventions failed. Alienatedfrom her daughter, her only family member, Mrs C lookedanguished. 'When were you last well?', I asked. 'Do 'No', I responded, 'I mean in yourself.' Withouthesitation she erupted, 'Doctor, I have never been well a day inmy life'. 'Really? Well, if we are body, mind and spirit, where do you think the problem has been?' With great feeling she answered, 'I have been sick in mind and spirit every day of mylife'. She then recounted her tale, a life filled with dead ends andbroken dreams. Her anguish persisted until death, a byproduct,perhaps, of her well-established life script as much as the cancerthat ended her suffering.Two patients, one dying without suffering, at the age of 30, after a life spent in celebration and opening to others; theother dying with great suffering in her eighth decade,following a hard journey spent in closing to life and to others. What are the determinants of such a variation in suffering? Determinants of suffering Quality of life (QoL) and a sense of being healthy do not correlate with physical wellbeing. One may suffer terribly in the absence of physical symptoms;conversely, severe physical decline and pain may be presentwithout anguish or suffering. In a qualitative studyinvolving cancer patients aware of their diagnosis, Kagawa-Singer found that one-third of the participants consideredthemselves to be 'fairly healthy'; and two-thirds 'very healthy', including 12 who died during the study. Theircommon coping objective was the maintenance of self-integrity. 7Similarly, Cassileth et al found that persons with malignant melanoma had levels of emotional wellbeingequal to those found in the general population. 8In another study, persons paralysed following trauma had similar life satisfaction to the general population.9 Eric Cassell has noted that suffering is personal and subjective. It may arise in any domain of personhood; itoccurs with a threat to personal integrity and ends when thethreat has passed, or integrity is otherwise restored. 10He states, 'Our intactness as persons, our coherence and integrity, come not from intactness of the body but from thewholeness of the web of relationships with self and others'. 11 Our lives are shaped by 'necessary losses'.12What other core issues create the existential 'background noise' thathelps to define our view of, and response to life? Yalomsuggests that there are four: death (our impending existential obliteration - always a day closer today than yesterday);isolation (the unbridgeable gap between self and others - 'Only I can experience my birth, my life, my death'); freedom (the unnerving absence of external structure - the retirementsyndrome of the workaholic); and meaning (the dilemma of meaning-seeking creatures living in a cosmos that ispotentially without positive, ameliorating meaning). 13 Frankl suggests that the fundamental human quest is not for prestige, fame or fortune. Nor is it the sexual drive.Instead, he asserts, it is the search for meaning. Hisexperience in Nazi concentration camps taught him thatwe may find meaning in five domains: things created or accomplished; things left as a legacy; things believed in;things loved; and finally, the experience of suffering itself. These sources of personal meaning may lead totranscendence of suffering through identification withsomething greater and more enduring than the self. 14Existential suffering and the determinants of healing Balfour M Mount , Eric M Flanders Professor of Palliative Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, CanadaPlenary Lectures OF PALLIATIVE CARE, 2003; 10(2) SUPPLEMENTSignificance of the spiritual domain For cancer patients, the existential or spiritual domain is an important determinant of QoL throughout the diseasetrajectory. In the palliative phase of the disease it is moreimportant than physical symptoms, physical wellbeing,psychological wellbeing and support - the other factorsmonitored by the McGill Quality of Life instrument(MQoL). 15,16Furthermore, it is responsive to competent palliative care, showing an improvement within one weekof end-of-life admission to palliative care units. 17In persons who are HIV positive, the existential domain is onlyimportant when the CD4 T-cell count drops below 100(that is, with AIDS), but then, it is the most importantcontributor to QoL. 18 An increasing body of research suggests that quality of life and a broad range of health-related outcomes correlatewith religious adherence. Koenig and colleagues haverecently published a comprehensive, systematic analysis of 1,200 studies and 400 research reviews examining the relationship between religion and health 19and a further volume examining the involvement of psychoneuro- immunology in this relationship.20The latter documents current understanding of the hard-wired connectionbetween the immune and neuroendocrine systems, as wellas other aspects of the central nervous system. Chronicexposure to stressors impedes immune functioning. Thereare, it would seem, several mechanisms at play in thefavourable impact of religious adherence on health. Theyinclude: modification of behaviours that influence healthrisk (cigarette smoking, diet, sexual practices, alcoholintake, drug abuse, enhanced social support); alteredhealthcare utilisation (likelihood of earlier diagnosis,greater treatment compliance, closer monitoring); biological mechanisms (impact of changes in stress,perceived support and psychological functioning onneuroendocrine, immune and cardiovascular systems). The basis for a mind-body connection is now clearly understood; the implications, becoming clearer. A study byBower et al showing an association between meaning and mortality is thought-provoking. 21Forty HIV-seropositive men who had recently experienced an AIDS-relatedbereavement completed interviews to assess their use ofcognitive processing and their discovery of meaning inbereavement. They also provided blood samples during atwo- to three-year follow-up. As predicted, men whoengaged in cognitive processing were more likely to findenhanced meaning. Furthermore, men who found meaningshowed less rapid decline in CD4 T-cell levels and lowerrates of AIDS-related mortality (all p < 0.05), independent ofhealth status at baseline, healthy behaviours and otherpotential confounds. These results suggest that the discoveryof meaning may be linked to positive immunological andhealth outcomes. There is a problem with the vocabulary of spirituality in our pluralistic society. 22We would distinguish between 'spirituality' and 'religion',23and agree with Palmer who said, 'We need to shake off the narrow notion that\"spiritual\" questions are always about angels or ethers, ormust include the word God. Spiritual questions are the kindthat (our patients) and we ask every day of our lives as we yearn to connect with the largeness of life: \"Does my life have meaning does one maintainhope?\" \"What about death?\"' 24To be human is necessarily to be spiritual, whether the person is religious or not. Spirituality is relational in its expression. It is expressed in one's relationships at three levels - to the self (in theindividuation of Jung); 25to others (at a quantum level we are one with the cosmos in a state of undivided wholeness;26at a psychic level we share with others the collective unconscious;25at the transpersonal level a potential for 'I- thou' relating);27and to ultimate meaning however conceived (often experienced as a paradox of transcendenceand immanence) - God, the More (that which is nameless,yet the ground of existence), and the cosmos. Spiritual/existential distress must be a primary concern for palliative care physicians and all others on the caregiving team. Not only is it a significant determinant of subjective wellbeing (QoL) and one's place on the total pain/integrity dialectic, it is also a reason for cancer patients ending theirlives. 28-30Moreover, patients who are depressed or are experiencing existential meaninglessness may have a lowerpain threshold, 31,32thus feel more pain and require interventions beyond simply adjusting the opioid dose. A model of the psyche A metaphoric schema of the psyche that considers twocomponents - the surface mind and the deep mind - may clarify the dynamics involved in healing. 33,34According to this model, the surface mind is characterised by conscious, literal, rational, linear patterns of thought. It is the homeof the ego, the organising aspect of psyche that one recognises as self. The ego needs to feel in control; it fears the unknown and when faced by a threat reacts defensively with grasping, closing, striving, competing,wishing and denying. The deep mind , however, is characterised by intuitive, imaginal, unconscious, metaphoric thought. It is therepository of memories, the collective and personal unconscious, the unresolved psychic baggage of childhood,and that aspect of the psyche that may be experienced as an'internal other' and was referred to as the Selfby Carl Jung. 35The Self is conceived as that archetypal aspect of the psyche that holds the personal potential for wholeness. It isviewed by some as being immortal and continuous withthe More. It is involved in healing; noted in all wisdom traditions, and rendered conscious (in collaboration withthe ego) in the process of individuation. For PW Martin, it is the Deep Center. 36Martin notes that all wisdom traditions identify this inherent potential of thepsyche. He notes that in Christian parlance, it is the'Kingdom 'the mysterious pass', 'the primal opening'(Taoist). The Deep Center may be conceived asexercising its healing potential through opening, accepting,slowing, centering, trusting, hoping and letting go. Plenary Lectures 12/3/03 12:47 Page 4142 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE, 2003; 10(2) SUPPLEMENTThe dynamics of healing Kearney has differentiated between care that is Hippocratic (the caregiver acts as an external agent, doing to, prescribingfor, or acting on, and represents an external locus of control), and care that is Asklepian (the caregiver accompanies and 'prepares a space for' healing to occur, a process dependanton an internal locus of control in the sufferer). 34Wisdom traditions, clinical experience and qualitative research37 suggest that healing depends on an adaptational responseshift involving enriched meaning born through healingconnections. The caregiver-healer performs an Asklepianfunction in supporting a secure environment and sense ofsafety (the patient's paradoxical comment, 'I never wouldhave thought that it would be safe to die here'). Healingoccurs in the present tense, in the now. 38,39It is fostered by a loosening of the ego's need to control ('learning to fall').40It is as if the Deep Center says to the ego, 'You take one steptowards me and I'll take five towards you'. The healer negates the intrinsic power differential between caregiver and sufferer; recognises his or her own personalneeds and, with humility, is open to an empathic interactionin the tradition of the wounded healer. 34The healing relationship is an archetypal connection characterised by mutual openness involving a parallel process in which eachbrings out in the other 'exactly what is most in need ofattention and what we are often most unwilling or unable toacknowledge or honour within ourselves'. 41 The healer engages in active listening (plain language, figurative speech, non-verbal communication) and asks, 'Who is she?' (the sufferer); 'Who am I?' 'What is themeaning of her illness - for her, for her family, for me?' Thehealer recalls that, 'Care in how it is given can reach themost hidden places'; 42that healing interventions are those that support the discovery of meaning and connectedness, whether or not that is consciously intended. Healing is encouraged by acceptance - not a passive giving up, but an active integration of reality. ('So that is the waymy cookie crumbled. Now what can I do with it?') It is foster ed by hope . Hope is not the same as wishing. Hope is a perspective on reality, a point of view (the glass half full,rather than half empty). It reflects a degree of inner peace.Hope is a child of the human spirit. It arises from anexperience of personal meaning. Wishing , however, arises from a sense of need, dissatisfaction and unrest. It reflects asense of incompleteness. Hope is the product of adversitytranscended, wishing of adversity denied. Hope is linked toacceptance, the transcendent alternative to denial and theconscious attitude that accompanies integration. Once weaccept our givens, we are free to assume an attitude to them;to exercise our options; and to take responsibility for ourselves. While it is true that we may be unwitting healersthrough our natural compassion, in general, we are more likely to be effective as healers if we are consciously on thespiritual path and seeking self-knowledge, thus making ourown inner life needs a priority. We cannot be all things to all people - use a team. We stand on the brink of the third epoch of healthcare, the epoch of Whole Person Medicine. The interdependence of body, mind and spirit calls us to look beyond the biologyof disease to the broader landscape that underlies humansuffering. While continuing to probe the genome and strivefor longer life for those under our care, the path Saundershas set leads us to re-examine ancient questions that pertain to healing, wholeness and the true meaning of health . The dying have much to teach us in this regard if we have eyes tosee and ears to hear. Our clinical laboratory at their bedside iswell placed to shed new light on the connections between psychoneuro-immunology, meaning, neurotheology and thehealing potential that is the human birthright. The challengeand the opportunity are ours. References 1. Reading A. Illness and disease. Med Clin North Am 1977; 61(4): 703-710. 2. Cassell EJ. The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine.
