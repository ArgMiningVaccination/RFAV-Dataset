Our chiropractors believe the true purpose of their care is not merely to relieve pain, but to resolve the root cause of discomfort, and to rehabilitate patients to full functionality. They work closely with each patient to develop an individualized treatment program, using a wide range of analytical and testing tools designed to pinpoint the source of your discomfort. Listening is the first step: you'll have time to carefully explain the nature of your problem and receive a thorough examination and evaluation.

As appropriate, your treatment plan may include therapeutic bodywork, one-on-one tailored functional rehabilitation and a host of other options to help you reach the goal of full, pain-free functionality. In addition to expert treatment, you'll also receive recommendations for exercises and self-care you can utilize to maintain your renewed good health.
