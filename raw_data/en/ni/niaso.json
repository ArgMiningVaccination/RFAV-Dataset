Instead of giving yourself a hard time about feeling this way, remind yourself that these symptoms are a sign that your mind and body are in need of a simple rejuvenation. When we're relaxed and stress-free, we are able to restore our natural ability to heal which, in turn, enables us to fight off health-related issues. Not only does this positive energy aid our health, but it also manifests itself as confidence and outward harmony in dealing with everyday events. Energetic Bodywork, previously known as Energywork for Bodyworkers, is a hands-on body/mind therapy that addresses healing on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels. It helps clear any mental or physical roadblocks you may be experiencing. These disruptions in your \"life force energy\" can lead to critical emotional or health problems if left untended. Whether this imbalance is caused by an emotional situation, physical trauma, or negative thoughts and feelings (worry, doubt, anger, anxiety), energy healing treatments help relieve these emotions by reducing stress and promoting relaxation. This triggers the body's natural healing abilities and improves and maintains your overall health. The healing benefits from this type of treatment can be dramatic, but are often quite subtle and tend to show up later - after the healing session is long over. Often the \"results\" happen at the level that will provide the most profound benefits. For example, the main benefit of a healing session might come in the form of an insight or change in attitude that results in a change of behavior that leads to a long-lasting improvement in physical health, emotional health, and/or quality of life. In our Energetic Bodywork course, students learn how physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual blockages can affect the human energy field. Discussions include how the 'health' of this field relates to the potential for disease within the body. Students will also learn energetic grounding techniques and discover their unique way of receiving information energetically. Through a deeper understanding of the emotional and spiritual aspects of healing, the student greatly enhances their perception skills often differentiating themselves from less sensitive body-workers. The skills learned in Energetic Bodywork enable our students to create better health and balance for their clients as well as themselves.
