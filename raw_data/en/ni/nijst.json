Stones occur in the urinary tract and can cause pain, infection, and even kidney failure. Kidney stones are most often composed of calcium crystals (about 3/4ths of cases) and magnesium (struvite), [uric acid](https://humanizingmedicine.com/index.php/article-directory/28-humanizing-medical-science/30-coffee-fioricet-chocolate-the-silver-lining-of-gout), and cystine are the other less common stone types. Conventionally, kidney stones are treated mechanically by breaking them up, removing them, and re-routing urine that cause us to think of urologists as a type of very specialized plumber.
