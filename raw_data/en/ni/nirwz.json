She also performs hospital care activities at University Hospital of Tor Vergata, Rome (PTV)-Clinical Biochemistry section. Born on the 15th of June 1968, she currently lives in Rome and is married with two children. In 1991 she graduated (cum laudae) in Biological Science at the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\" in collaboration with CNR, elaborating a thesis entitled \"Distribution of Nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor and acetyl choline transferase enzyme (ChAT) levels in the central nervous system of stressed rodents\" (supervisors: Prof. Rita Levi Montalcini and Prof. Luigi Aloe). In 1993 she qualified as Clinical Biologist at University of Rome \"La Sapienza\". In 1993 to 1994 she received a scholarship from Italian Space Agency (ASI) to carry out studies on the alterations of the concentrations of some bio-elements in the brain and muscles of rats subjected to simulated hypo-gravity. In 1995 she obtained a permanent position as a Researcher at Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine (ex Med 26-Neurology). From 1995 to 2006 she was a Biologist at the Divisional Service of Neuromuscular Diseases (Santo Eugenio-University Hospital, Rome), studying morphological analysis of neurons and muscle biopsies (applying and validating immunoenzymatic and immunocytochemical techniques). In 1995 she obtained a grant (ITA-USA CNR-grant-short term mobility) as visiting researcher at the College of Medicine, Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA, to conduct research in order to characterize neurons of the basal ganglia of rats, by ultrastructural analysis (using immunocytochemical and histochemical techniques). In 1999 she received a grant (ITA-UK CNR-grant-short term mobility) as visiting researcher at the Medical Research Council, Anatomical Neuropharmacological Unit, Department of Pharmacology, Oxford, UK, working on a project in neuroscience of neuronal nitric oxide/cGMP pathway in rodent brain\". In 2007 she obtained a permanent position as Director Biologist at the Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry, Department of Experimental Medicine University Hospital of Tor Vergata (PTV), Rome (BIO12-E05/E3). She is currently responsible on the validation of medical lab examinations, such as biochemical exams, at the urgency, autoimmunity, protein, hematological and allergology sections. From 2013 to 2017 she was a visiting Researcher (collaboration ITA-FRA), and worked with the where she worked on a project regarding the neurogenesis in animal models of Alzheimer Disease. In 2017 she obtained a Doctoral Degree (PhD) in \"Applied Medical and Surgical Sciences, Clinical Nutrition\" (in collaboration with the University of Tor Vergata and the University of Marseille), presenting a thesis entitled: \"Vitamin D and Alzheimer's disease effects of supplementation/depletion on neurogenesis, amyloid plaques and cognition\" (supervisors: Prof A. De Lorenzo, and Prof. F. Feron). From 1995 to 2007 she carries teaching activity in neurosciences fields: Neuroanatomy and neurobiology (course for neurophysiopathology technicians), From 2007-today, she carries teaching activity in Biochemistry: Clinical Biochemistry and Medical Laboratory practices (to medical students- Faculty of Medicine), Human Clinical Biochemistry (Master's degree course in Medical Biotechnology), Biochemical monitoring of rehabilitation (Master's degree course in Science and Techniques of Motor Activity), Pathophysiological Diagnostics (Undergraduate course for Orthopedic Technicians), Clinical Biochemistry (Specialization Course in Clinical Pathology for Biologist and Medical Doctors). Starting form 1993 she contributed to several research projects concerning studies on Neurosciences, Neurobiology and Biochemistry. In the recent years, her research activity has been focused mainly on the study of biochemical markers in neurodegenerative diseases as well as cytokines and vitamins in autoimmune diseases and the evaluation of cytokine and inflammatory markers in Covid. She is a member of several national and international scientific organizations and societies: Italian Association of Neuropathology, Italian Association of Electron Microscopy, SIMEL, Italian Association, Laboratory Medicine, SiBioc Italian Association, Laboratory Medicine, SIES Italian society of hematology. She is the author of several publications in national and international scientific journals and has given several oral presentations at national and international congresses, conventions and meetings.
