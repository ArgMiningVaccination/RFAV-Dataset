[[5]](#cite_note-7) The site particularly \" [Big Pharma](/wiki/Big_Pharma)\". [[9]](#cite_note-BPH-11) If there's an alternative medicine or alternative medical treatment out there, you can guarantee that NaturalNews has one article singing its praises to the sky and one more bashing the stupid [\"skeptics\"](/wiki/Scare_quotes). A lot of the website's growth is due to its exposure on [[note 3]](#cite_note-12) until it was banned (not for any of its content, mind you, but because it was violating Facebook's policy on spamming). [[10]](#cite_note-13) Reviewing NaturalNews' [vast ecosystem of websites](/wiki/List_of_websites_owned_by_Mike_Adams) shows that Adams has way too much money and spare time and wants to attract both [left-wing](/wiki/Left-wing) [moonbats](/wiki/Moonbat) interested in a \"natural\" lifestyle and [right-wing](/wiki/Right-wing) [wingnuts](/wiki/Wingnut) interested in [guns](/wiki/Guns) and [survivalism](/wiki/Survivalism). Reading through Adams' discourse on a non-NaturalNews affiliated [goldbug](/wiki/Goldbug) forum shows that Adams's personal allegiances are mainly with the latter, [[1]](#cite_note-goldsilver-1) which taken in totality indicates some level of disingenuousness since he's grifting both ends but only sympathizes with one end enough to speak frankly. On [Wikipedia](/wiki/Wikipedia), NaturalNews is not merely a deprecated source, never to be used for anything (\"There is a near-unanimous consensus that the site repeatedly publishes false or fabricated information, including a large number of conspiracy theories.\"), [[11]](#cite_note-14) but is actually on the spam blacklist. [[12]](#cite_note-15) In short: if you cite NaturalNews on any matter whatsoever, [you are almost certainly wrong](/wiki/Scopie%27s_Law), as this website is so bad, so unreliable, and so dead-faced wrong that [even other quacks think it's a quack site](/wiki/Rejected_by_their_own_kind), [[13]](#cite_note-healthwyze-16) a feat of stupid that truly takes talent. Personal and corporate[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] By his own account, Adams was \"the son of a Pfizer contractor and a clinical trial tester for some of America's biggest pharmaceutical companies.\" [[14]](#cite_note-about-17) According to Adams, he \"was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a disease brought on by poor diet and severe lack of exercise.\" [[14]](#cite_note-about-17) Rather than blame himself for not listening to [evidence-based medicine](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine) that one should eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise, he instead blamed evidence-based medicine and began his lucrative career of peddling [snake oil](/wiki/Snake_oil). Prior to his diabetes diagnosis, Adams founded Arial Software in 1993, which he sold in interest in by 2007. [[15]](#cite_note-18) [[16]](#cite_note-19) The company had been characterized as [marketing](/wiki/Marketing) [spamware](/wiki/Spam) in the guise of advising spammers as to create marketing emails that did not look like spam. [[17]](#cite_note-20) He is married to Sheh Lio Adams, [[18]](#cite_note-21) an [acupuncture](/wiki/Acupuncture) and [traditional Chinese - Inc.

[[52]](#cite_note-55) NaturalNews blames the pharmaceutical industry for all vaguely [drug](/wiki/Drug)-linked [celebrity](/wiki/Celebrity) deaths rather than looking at any surrounding factors. [[53]](#cite_note-56) [[54]](#cite_note-57) [[55]](#cite_note-58) [[56]](#cite_note-59) The response to any alternative medicine claim, however, is blind acceptance, whether the topic at hand is argued that \"detoxing\" after vaccination will let you avoid their bad effects: [[66]](#cite_note-69) If you're being forced to take a vaccine against your will (by a [totalitarian]medical regime like [California]), are there things you can do to protect yourself from vaccine toxins? [...] The key to surviving this assault on your body is to eliminate these chemicals quickly. In this video filmed at our Consumer Wellness Center Laboratories, I reveal nutritional strategies for accelerating your body's natural detox so that you can safely survive a vaccine assault that's forced upon you by a coercive, fascist medical regime. Yet surely this would mean that he would be OK with compulsory vaccination if the government just handed out free detox afterward. Conspiracy theories[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] NaturalNews also features many Big Pharma conspiracy theories, [[9]](#cite_note-BPH-11) [[67]](#cite_note-70) [[68]](#cite_note-71) believing that there is no depth Big Pharma will not sink to, no [lie too big for them to tell](/wiki/Big_Lie), in order to poison Americans and [cover up](/wiki/Cover_up) their \" [junk science](/wiki/Junk_science).\" [[69]](#cite_note-72) Adams claims that the pharmaceutical industry is creating [HIV](/wiki/HIV) vaccines with the sole purpose of creating as many HIV positive people as possible to sell anti-retroviral drugs to at a huge profit. [[70]](#cite_note-73) Mammographic screening creates [cancer](/wiki/Cancer), which is then expensively treated for big profit. [[71]](#cite_note-74) [[72]](#cite_note-75) [[73]](#cite_note-76) claim that [Bill Gates](/wiki/Bill_Gates) and [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft) are in the process of developing weaponized, ethnically-targeted influenza [viruses](/wiki/Virus) as part of a sinister [eugenics](/wiki/Eugenics) plot. [[78]](#cite_note-81) No, really. Adams also manages to misinterpret attempts to develop reversible forms of [male contraceptives](/wiki/Birth_control) as deliberate attempts to [permanently sterilize minorities](/wiki/Genocide_conspiracy). [[79]](#cite_note-82) His reaction to Angelina Jolie's preventive double mastectomy due to having the BRCA1 gene mutation was predictable: the quoted 87% probability that she would come down with breast cancer was irrelevant, since diet and lifestyle changes can magically suppress BRCA1 expression. And of course, oncologists are cast as the quacks here, not fine, upstanding people like Adams. [[80]](#cite_note-83) [[81]](#cite_note-84) The site has also claimed that \"the UK government is run by criminal pedophiles who rely on [Muslim](/wiki/Muslim) pedo networks to provide a steady supply of nine and ten-year-old little girls and boys\". Because that's the only possible reason they'd try and stop [Tommy Robinson](/wiki/Tommy_Robinson) from promoting hate and disrupting criminal trials. [[82]](#cite_note-85) Other woo[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Adams' love for fusion](/wiki/Cold_fusion) and so-called [free energy](/wiki/Free_energy_(pseudoscience)) ideas and devices like the [Energy Catalyzer](/wiki/Energy_Catalyzer) are presented on his website with the same enthusiasm as the latest alternative medicine fad. [[83]](#cite_note-86) [[84]](#cite_note-87) He collects news about reliable sources. Curiously, he supports [Ron Paul](/wiki/Ron_Paul), a real medical doctor and not a practitioner of woo (in the field of medicine); this may be because Paul supports \" [health freedom](/wiki/Health_freedom)\", [[92]](#cite_note-95) despite Adams simultaneously supporting [health care reform](/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act) health care system. [[93]](#cite_note-96) NaturalNews advances a [hard green](/wiki/Hard_green) position, even though the site also promotes [global warming denialism](/wiki/Global_warming_denialism). [[94]](#cite_note-97) To top it off, Adams promotes conspiracy theories about [gun control](/wiki/Gun_control). [[95]](#cite_note-98) He thinks [Scientology](/wiki/Scientology) is treated unfairly [[96]](#cite_note-99) [[97]](#cite_note-100) because of attempts by anti-religious [bigots](/wiki/Bigot) and (you guessed it) [Big Pharma](/wiki/Big_Pharma) to oppress their belief system in order to protect their profits. As well as Sandy Hook, Adams has also issued his informed opinion of the 2012 [Aurora shooting](/wiki/Aurora_shooting), declaring that they were \"obviously\" staged, or perhaps that the killer James Holmes was involved in \"experimental\" [neuroscience](/wiki/Neuroscience) that got out of hand. [[98]](#cite_note-101) (Or maybe both at once? Who knows with this guy?) Furthermore, he says the [2013 Boston bombings](/wiki/2013_Boston_bombings) were a [false flag operation](/wiki/False_flag_operation) by \"private military contractors\". [[99]](#cite_note-102) In 2014, Adams wrote several articles where he tried to prove that the Malaysian airplane disaster in March 2014 was a government cover-up, and that the plane was secretly made into a \"stealth weapon\", possibly carrying [nuclear weapons](/wiki/Nuclear_weapons). He also stated that he believed that the people behind the cover-up could go as far as to \"secretly sink some aircraft debris in the Indian Ocean so they can \"find it\".\" Even though he believed the passengers might have survived, he stated that \"world governments are rolling out their 'official' stories, there is no question in my mind that they will do anything to support those official stories, even if it means discarding the lives of all the passengers.\" [[100]](#cite_note-103) The site also tends to predict that any sizable storm heralds the collapse of the economy and the end of civilization. [[101]](#cite_note-104) [[102]](#cite_note-105) Also, \"conventional [physics](/wiki/Physics)\" is a conspiracy of the same sort as conventional medicine. [[103]](#cite_note-106) Also [transphobia](/wiki/Transphobia), even though [transgender](/wiki/Transgender) people are trying to change the pigeonhole that conventional medicine assigned them at birth. [[104]](#cite_note-107) Additionally, they promote the conspiracy theory that the [Coronavirus](/wiki/Coronavirus) was created in a laboratory in Wuhan, China. [[105]](#cite_note-108) The site claims that [microwaves cause infertility](/wiki/Radiophobia), [[106]](#cite_note-109) and it promoted a quack detoxification process in light of the [Fukushima](/wiki/Fukushima) nuclear disaster. [[107]](#cite_note-110) Unsurprisingly, the site hates [5G](/wiki/5G) and claims that it is an assault weapon ment to destroy humanity. [[108]](#cite_note-111) Birtherism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] In 2011, NaturalNews embraced birth certificate was fake: [[87]](#cite_note-birth-90) [...] it's so fake that the whole thing has become an IQ test for figuring out how many people can be so easily fooled by a fake. If I turned in a document like this as part of an effort to get a home loan, for example, and I assembled it layer by layer with obvious cutting and pasting of numbers from multiple sources in order to fake my reported income levels, I would be guilty of a felony crime. At the very least, I would be laughed out of the room. \"Are you kidding me? This is your best attempt at falsifying an income statement?\" they would say. Even a high school kid with a scanner and Photoshop knows how to make a more convincing forgery than this. Adams took this as the ideal opportunity for a piece of truly biting social commentary about the fakeness of modern [American](/wiki/American) life: Couples are now artificially fertilized (fake conception!), and when their children are born, they feed them fake milk (infant formula). They grow up on fake sweeteners and fake (artificial) colors. In school, they're taught fake U.S. history so that they have fake ideas of how the world really works. When they're old enough, they get to participate in faked voting schemes where the winners are already determined. And thanks to the internet, we live in a world of fake friends, fake emotions and fake sex. Football games are played on fake grass, and today's \"reality\" TV shows are all faked, too. Professional wrestling is fake (but MMA isn't), and most of the news consumed by the masses is entirely fabricated. Even the science behind most of modern medicine is faked, fabricated or twisted around in order to get the results the drug companies want to see. And oh yeah, the [drugs]are faked, too, especially the [antidepressants]which appear to work only because of the [placebo effect]\u2014 which is real, even though it only exists in the mind. For the most part, we are fake people living in a fake world engaged in fake interactions. So why shouldn't we have a fake President with a fake birth certificate to top it all off? I don't know what the problem is here with the obviously fake birth certificate. Of course it's a fake. But isn't that what we vote for when we vote for any president? After all, presidential election campaigns are all about making fake promises uttered with fake smiles as part of faked speeches that are actually written by somebody else and read on the teleprompter. [[87]] Between 2011 and 2014, Adams decided that having this post up was rather damaging. But if he just deleted it or at least took a shred of responsibility for it, that would also be embarrassing. Instead, the post was updated with a totally believable explanation of why he was a birther and now isn't: [[87]](#cite_note-birth-90) [[109]](#cite_note-112) The article which originally appeared here has been removed because it is no longer aligned with the science-based investigative mission of Natural News. In late 2013 / early 2014, Mike Adams (the Health Ranger), editor of Natural News, transitioned from outspoken activist to environmental scientist. He now runs the Natural News Forensic Food Lab, conducting world-class food science research and publishing scientific papers on food contaminants and nutritional analytics. Through scientific investigation powered by university-level analytical instrumentation, Adams found that, much like the majority of the population, he had been suffering over the past several years from chronic exposure to cumulative toxic elements found in the food supply, including in many organics and \"superfoods.\" His findings \u2014 as well as breakthrough discoveries about food toxicology, protective food nutrients and the cognitive influences of food contaminants \u2014 are being published at NaturalNews.com. Notably, Adams found that exposure to toxic elements in foods altered his mindset, outlook on life and degree of happiness in the world. \"I now know that much of my outlook on the world was being negatively shaped by toxic elements found not just in everyday foods, but also in some [superfoods]and [dietary supplements],\" Adams now explains. That is: the consumption of evil toxin-filled foods \u2014 as ascertained by \"university-level analytical instrumentation\" \u2014 caused Adams to become so delirious and susceptible to strange beliefs that he believed that President Obama's birth certificate was fake. Unfortunately, it seems that some toxic metals remain in Adams, since all of the other articles on NaturalNews continue to show the mind-altering symptoms. Creative endeavors[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] \"Cartoons\"[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] One of the more ridiculous features of NaturalNews are Adams' cartoons, which are even less entertaining than [Mallard Fillmore](/wiki/Mallard_Fillmore) or [The Far Left Side](/wiki/The_Far_Left_Side). [[110]](#cite_note-113) These ran until 2011, and were usually followed by paragraph after paragraph of Adams having to explain the cartoon to an audience who otherwise wouldn't find them funny, let alone care. Thankfully, he didn't do much of the actual [art](/wiki/Art), which was mostly having been handled by Dan Berger of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fame, unfortunately. [[111]](#cite_note-114) \"Music\"[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] More ridiculous still is the \" [Music](/wiki/Music)\" section on NaturalNews, where Adams posts hip-hop videos and songs he wrote about the alternative quackery of the day. Most of the so-called \"music\" is cheap-sounding [hip-hop](/wiki/Hip-hop) injected with terrible [vaccines](/wiki/Vaccine) and [antidepressants](/wiki/Antidepressant) are. [[112]](#cite_note-115) Just like his cartoons, his hip-hop postings are also followed by paragraphs of his own [self-aggrandizement](/wiki/Delusions_of_grandeur) and boring explanations of his works for those (read: most) who didn't care to listen to the actual song. As far as poetry is concerned, Adams' creativity is unbounded. [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] [GoodGopher](/wiki/GoodGopher) GoodGopher is a search engine produced by Adams that blocks out reality-based information \"propaganda\". Enter any topic of skeptical (not just alt-med) interest and it will return the very finest crank information available. Legal threats[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)] Adams has threatened legal action against one of his many critics, Jon Entine (who, of course, published the threat in full): [[115]](#cite_note-KeithKloor-118) As you are now well aware, you are about to be named in a personal lawsuit which will cite the extensive body of your defamation and [cyber bullying]efforts, all of which have been archived and time stamped for court evidence. You can count on this lawsuit requiring considerable resources of your time and money for the foreseeable future. You are no doubt also aware that I have many friends in law enforcement and that we are simultaneously pursuing an effort to have you arrested and charged with cyber bullying crimes. I honestly cannot say for sure whether such an effort will be successful, but it is one of the areas we are actively pursuing against you. ... I do not know if you are are [rational]person, but if you are, then I invite you to discuss a private settlement agreement with me which would allow us both to focus our efforts elsewhere. Entine was neither intimidated nor impressed: [[116]](#cite_note-119) If Adams is true to his claim that he's a new man, committed to serving science, he may have no choice but to sue himself for defamation. ... Will Adams sue himself for libeling himself? After all, if his goal is to put anti-science purveyors out of business \u2014 and those who he claims present \"blatantly fictional, distorted or wildly exaggerated\" anti-science information\u2014why not go after the person who many scientists and journalists contend is the most egregious perpetrator of \"cyber bullying\" and \"harassment.\" [...] Yes, science needs you, Mike. Please, send yourself a libel threat letter. Let's shut that quack down. Twitter silliness[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] In 2010, Adams was nominated in the Shorty Awards, basically a popularity contest for [Joseph Mercola](/wiki/Joseph_Mercola). [Skeptics](/wiki/Skeptic) decided to vote up Rachel Dunlop, a skeptical doctor from [Australia](/wiki/Australia), [[117]](#cite_note-120) [[118]](#cite_note-121) getting her to the top of the health charts. Adams and Mercola started pouting went vote-canvassing; hundreds of their supporters turned up, created new accounts, and were promptly disqualified, as only existing accounts were allowed to vote. When Dunlop won, Adams was most upset and responded with [a list of what \"skeptics\" believe](/wiki/Straw_man): [[119]](#cite_note-122) [[120]](#cite_note-123) [[121]](#cite_note-124) Skeptics believe that many six-month-old infants need antidepressant drugs. In fact, they believe that people of all ages can be safely given an unlimited number of drugs all at the same time: Antidepressants, cholesterol drugs, blood pressure drugs, diabetes drugs, anti-anxiety drugs, sleeping drugs and more -- simultaneously! Skeptics believe that the human body has no ability to defend itself against invading microorganism and that the only things that can save people from viral infections are vaccines. Email spam[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] Adams sells software to evade spam blockers through his company Arial Software. [[note 4]](#cite_note-125) Does Adams admit responsibility for spam? No, he prefers to [blame those who buy spammed products](/wiki/Blaming_the_victim), rather than the spammers actually sending the stuff. [[note 5]](#cite_note-126) Adams claims to hate spam, [[122]](#cite_note-127) [[123]](#cite_note-128) yet he tacitly admits that he himself is a spammer. [[124]](#cite_note-129) Confirming Adams' duplicitousness, [NaturalNews and its allied sites](/wiki/List_of_websites_owned_by_Mike_Adams) were banned from both Wikipedia and Facebook for spamming, and in the case of Facebook, for using troll farms from [North Macedonia](/wiki/North_Macedonia) and the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines) to spam. [[125]](#cite_note-130) Audio and video[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)] Adams also owns NaturalNews Radio and NaturalNews TV, the same stuff via streaming and video, in case Mike's flock ever wanted more of his sage wisdom. The star of his 2017 movie \" [Biosludged\"](https://vimeo.com/202413146#t=2m9s) is human excrement. In 2018, however, YouTube took down his entire Health Ranger channel. [[126]](#cite_note-131) Brighteon[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)] Adams created an alternative to [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube) originally called REAL.video, but later renamed it Brighteon in October 2018 to accompany the opening of his new food and supplement store BrighteonStore. He created this site in response to \" [censorship](/wiki/Censorship)\" on YouTube, especially that of his good friend [Alex Jones](/wiki/Alex_Jones), whose livestreams moved to this site after his ban. The site mostly has conservative channels. Conspiracy theories thrive on this site as well. Survivalism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)] [Survivalism](/wiki/Survivalism) In 2011, Adams gave some advice about survivalism and buying [shitloads of guns](/wiki/Gun_nut) to his fellow [paranoids](/wiki/Paranoid) on a [goldbug](/wiki/Goldbug) forum, warning that the bogus [2012 apocalypse](/wiki/2012_apocalypse) was around the corner. [[1]](#cite_note-goldsilver-1) More recently, Adams has been branching out into survivalism and fearmongering about a potential technological or economic collapse of the United States, including founding or partnering with several specialized news sites devoted to those topics, such as Collapse.News in August 2015, [[127]](#cite_note-132) Bugout.News in November 2015, [[128]](#cite_note-133) and so on. This has absolutely nothing to do with Adams being the founder and owner of the online store RangerGear.com, [[129]](#cite_note-134) your source for \"Quality, affordable prepping and survival gear of the highest possible quality [sic] personally tested by the Health Ranger\" since November 2015. Nothing at all.Do You Believe That? Hoggwatch[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)] Adams created a [webshite](/wiki/Webshite) to push negative (and false) stories about David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 [Parkland shooting](/wiki/Parkland_shooting). [[130]](#cite_note-135) Temporary removal from Google[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=19)] Around February 23, 2017, NaturalNews.com was removed from all Google search results, [[131]](#cite_note-136) likely due to a sneaky redirect (for instance, the link in the mobile version in search results does not direct to the same address as the link in the desktop version). Predictably, Mike Adams flipped the table, shrieked, pulled his hair, and accused Google as a bully, a pusher of hate speech, censor-happy, insane, hucksters for [Big Pharma](/wiki/Big_Pharma), killers (because they censor quackery cancer cures), a danger to humanity, and whatever else one can imagine and expect from someone like Mike Adams. [[132]](#cite_note-137) It's strange how he reacted this way, since he had, after all, created his own goddamn search engine because he distrusted \"mainstream\" search engines. Sadly, NaturalNews.com has since been listed again in Google search results. [[133]](#cite_note-138) Anti-tech giant campaign[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)] NaturalNews gets an estimated 1.4 million visitors per month. [[4]](#cite_note-glp-6) Regardless, Adams, claiming to be censored, launched a vicious personal attack on tech giant CEOs \u2014 Jack Dorsey (Twitter), Mark Zuckerberg ( [Apple](/wiki/Apple)), \u2014 using [Nazi analogies](/wiki/Nazi_analogies), and creating a wanted poster the six of them on it. [[134]](#cite_note-139) [[135]](#cite_note-140) RationalWiki[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)] Some user comments underneath the site's articles speak rather unfavorably of [RationalWiki](/wiki/RationalWiki). However, their blog article on \"Making Healthier Decisions\" was kind enough to reference our [list of cognitive biases](/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). [[136]](#cite_note-141) Their article crying about censorship describes this site as a \"vaccine propagandist\" website. [[137]](#cite_note-142) Fake news empire[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=NaturalNews&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)] On October 14th, 2021, tech news website Ars Technica published an article about Robert Willis, a man who helped an unnamed media organization that \"hawked supplements and alternative cures\" build an elaborate network of fake news websites that Willis believes played a key role in [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump)'s election. [[138]](#cite_note-143) A few days later, Willis admitted that the media organization in question was NaturalNews. [[139]](#cite_note-144) truthseeker's search engine of truth.
