Our minds often have negative thought patterns which create stress and anxiety, affect our level of peace, and make it difficult for us to focus in our meditations. Developing a sense of gratitude can not only improve our physical and mental health, but also allow us to sit for our meditations with more peace and serenity. Attend this webinar to explore how our minds and lives are positively impacted by gratitude, how such a positive attitude can improve our meditations, and why making meditation a priority in our lives will result in even greater success in our meditation practice.
