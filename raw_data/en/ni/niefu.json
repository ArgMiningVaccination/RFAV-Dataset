This ancient form of medicine is based on the philosophy that an imbalance of vital energies in the body can cause illness. Our vets in Rock Hill can use acupuncture to help improve blood flow, increasing oxygenation in tissues. Dr. Kandace Koukoutsis, DVM, is certified in Veterinary Acupuncture and is passionate about helping pets heal from various painful conditions. Acupuncture therapy can often be used in conjunction with medical treatments for effective pain management. Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into an animal's body at precise points called meridians, where the blood vessels converge with the nerves. The needles help guide vital energy along these meridians, supporting the nervous system and promoting circulation while enhancing the body's healing abilities. Our vets often recommend the use of acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine for a number of issues, including: Medical treatments such as chemotherapy can feel very uncomfortable for your pet. They will often be combined with acupuncture in an effort to relieve some discomfort, helping your cat or dog to fight their illness. Acupuncture can often be used for injury rehabilitation. Conditions such as arthritis, nerve injuries and hip dysplasia also tend to respond well to acupuncture. Acupuncture treatment can help encourage increased circulation, which can help hot spots, granulomas and allergic dermatitis. It can also improve healing and reduce pain, leading to less itching and subsequent over-grooming. Acupuncture may stimulate digestive secretions, which helps to promote healthy digestive activity. Conditions such as diarrhea or nausea may benefit from increased blood flow. The immune-calming and anti-inflammatory capabilities of acupuncture treatment can improve asthma, allergies and other conditions. Acupuncture for pets provides a number of benefits, including: Catawba Animal Clinic is welcoming new patients! Our experienced vets are passionate about the health of Rock Hill companion animals.
