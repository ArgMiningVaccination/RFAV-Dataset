Technical standards may include possessing or acquiring skills or behaviors to complete performance-based tasks. Com - pletion of these tasks may be required for program completion. Learning Outcomes Assessment As part of its continuing effort to maintain quality academic programs and to provide strong support services, all DACC programs have established student learning outcomes. DACC / NMSU routinely conducts learning out-comes assessment activities at the classroom, program, and college levels through activities such as general education assessment projects, exit ex - ams, exit interviews, and standardized tests. Students may be required to participate in one or more of these activities. Assessment plans and reports are published on the DACC Assessment of Student Learning website. DACC Graduation and Retention Rates Under the Student Right to Know and Campus Security Act of 1990, Public Law 101-542, DACC is required to calculate (using a prescribed formula) and disclose graduation rates for all rst-time, full-time, degree-seeking stu - dents who enrolled at DACC in Summer and Fall 2008. This cohort consists of 814 students. The number of graduates who earned either a certicate or an associate degree by Spring 2011 was 95. The three-year, Student-Right-to-Know graduation rate was 11.7 percent. Rates for previous cohorts after three years are as follows: 2007 cohort \u2014 13.3% 2004 cohort \u2014 5.7% 2006 cohort \u2014 8.4% 2003 cohort \u2014 9.6% 2005 cohort \u2014 6.1% 2002 cohort \u2014 9.4% The retention rate for rst-time, full-time DACC admitted students from Fall 2010 to Spring 2011 was 80.3 percent. The retention rate for these students from Fall 2010 to Fall 2011 was 61.4 percent. Student Special Care Policy To ensure the safety and well-being of our students, DACC / NMSU may, on occasion, require that students receive a particular type of care or treatment (e.g., emergency medical attention, live-in attendants, or vaccinations) as a condition of continued enrollment or eligibility to reside in university-operated housing. When this care or treatment is required by the cognizant DACC / NMSU administrator, the student will be obligated to assume any nancial responsibility associated with the treatment. Furthermore, DACC / NMSU may, on occasion, contact a student's parents, legal guardian, or spouse in cases of extreme emergency, or where a pos - sibility of imminent harm exists. Such action will be taken only when, in the judgment of the appropriate ofcial, the best interests of the student and the institution will be served. When practical, DACC / NMSU will notify the student in writing of the institution's intention to undertake the steps authorized by this policy. This decision may be appealed by the student to the DACC vice president for student services (VPSS) within 24 hours of notication. The appeal should be in writing and should state clearly the reason why the student objects to the proposed action. The VPSS will review the facts in the case and convey the decision to all parties within 48 hours. The VPSS's decision shall be nal.The Intent of this Catalog This publication focuses primarily on academic matters. Candidates for de - grees and certicates may elect to fulll requirements as outlined in the catalog in effect at the date of initial enrollment (provided the catalog is not more than six years old) or any subsequent catalog in effect during their dates of registration at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College. Readers should be aware of the following: The DACC Catalog is not a complete statement of all procedures, poli- cies, rules, and regulations that might apply to a student in all circum- stances. It may be necessary to consult other documents, such as the DACC Student Handbook, as well. DACC reserves the right to change at any time and without notice any item contained in this publication, including program offerings and content, course offerings and descriptions, procedures, policies, and regulations. A Note About Occupational-Education Courses Students planning to pursue a bachelor's degree at New Mexico State Uni-versity after completing their studies at DACC need to be aware that not all occupational-education courses taken at DACC can be used to satisfy degree requirements at NMSU. The number of DACC credits that may be counted toward a bachelor's degree depends on the major selected and any agreements providing for the acceptance of occupational-education courses. Programs already having such agreements are called \"articulated\" pro - grams, and are listed on page 29. It is best for students to consult advisors at both DACC and NMSU early in their associate degree program to insure that the maximum number of credits will apply toward the bachelor's degree program selected. Nondiscrimination It is the policy of Do\u00f1a Ana Community College not to discriminate on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in employment or other college-administered programs. This policy is in compliance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246 as amended by 11375 and section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and subsequent revisions. Disability Statement. Do\u00f1a Ana Community College is strongly com - mitted to providing education to all citizens of Do\u00f1a Ana County. The college's faculty and staff are dedicated to the goal of providing equal ac - cess to individuals with disabilities and to the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. The ongoing effort to reduce and remove physical and attitudinal barriers is designed to assist individuals with dis-abilities to enjoy the college's facilities, programs, and services to the full - est extent. We are dedicated to developing an educational environment free of discrimination. Policy of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability. Do\u00f1a Ana Commu-nity College does not discriminate on the basis of disability in the admission or access to, or treatment or employment in, its programs or activities. The ADA coordinator for DACC, located in rooms DAMA 117D and DASR 104A (tel. 575-527-7545), has been designated to oversee compliance with the nondiscrimination requirements contained in Section 35.107 of the De - partment of Justice Regulations.

In 1971, the boards of education of the Gads - den, Hatch, and Las Cruces school districts requested that New Mexico State Uni versity establish a branch community college located on its campus in Las Cruces to offer postsecondary vocational-technical education in Do\u00f1a Ana County. The NMSU Board of Regents approved the request in 1972, and the voters in Do\u00f1a Ana County approved an operational mill levy in May 1973. The institution became an official entity on July 1, 1973. It began of - fering vocational training programs on September 4, 1973, as the Do\u00f1a Ana County Occupational Education Br anch of New Mexico State University.

Institutional Accreditation Do\u00f1a Ana Community College is accredited independently of New Mexico State Uni versity by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Individual Program Accreditations, Approvals, and Certifications The individual programs that follow are listed with the organizations that either accredit or certify them. Associate Degree in Nursing Program Approval: New Mexico Board of Nursing Automotive Technology Program Accreditation: National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation (NATEF) Business Management Program Accreditation: Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs Dental Assistant Program and Dental Hygiene Program Accreditation: Commission on Dental Accreditation Developmental Studies Program Certification: National Association for Developmental Education (NADE) Diagnostic Medical Sonography Program and Emergency Medical Services Program Accreditation: Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs Drafting and Design Technologies Program Certification: American Drafting and Design Association Fire Science Program Accreditation: International Fire Service Accreditation of Congress Radiologic Technology Program Accreditation: Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology Respiratory Therapy Program Accreditation: Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care Achieving the Dream Participation and Leader College status DACC became an Achieving the Dream community college in fall 2005, gaining Leader College status in 2009. Leader College status was renewed in 2013 for three years. (http://www.achievingthedream.org/) Admissions Do\u00f1a Ana Community College pro vides educational opportunities for those who seek to advance in the workforce or to prepare for further study at a higher level. The community college endorses the open-door admission About the Community College2013-2014 Catalog 7 concept and will admit\u2014to the limit of its physical and financial resourc - es\u2014new, first-time students who wish to attend and who have a high school diploma or its equi valent. High school diplomas must be from an accredited high school. Diplomas from accredited, on-line high schools, however, are subject to strict review and may not in all cases be judged valid for the pur - pose of enrolling at DACC. Assessment and C oMPAss Placement Unless applicants have taken the ACT or SAT within the last 12 months, they will be required to take the COMPASS assessment, which covers basic academic skills. Transfer students who have taken math and English courses at another institution may be exempted from taking the COMPASS. Academic assessment and placement improves one's chances for success in college courses. The COMPASS is not used to select students; rather, it ensures students will be placed in classes best suited to their preparation and ability. These may include credit ESL courses, if English is not their first language. If deficiencies in basic academic skills are indicated, an individu - alized educational plan can be developed by an advisor to help the student acquire these skills. T here is no charge for a first-time COMPASS assessment, except under the following circumstances: 1) when a student chooses to re-take the COM - PASS, and 2) when a student takes the COMPASS at DACC for the purpose of con veying the results to an entity outside of the NMSU system. For more information call (575) 527-7569. orientation Students who have never attended college before must schedule an appoint-ment for a First-Year Student Orientation, which is designed to provide new students with information they will need to make a successful start at D ACC. Students learn about the steps to getting started in college, the majors and career programs offered at DACC, the principles of effective academic plan - ning, and the many services and resources designed to enhance educational success. F ailure to complete an orientation will result in a \"hold\" on the student's account, such that (s)he will be unable to register for courses. Ap-pointments for orientations can be made in person in DASR 107 on the East Mesa Campus or b y calling (575) 527-7710.

Non-degree Admission IMPORTANT: Students enrolling under non-degree status are ineligible for financial aid, student employment, veterans benefits, and participation in intercollegiate athletics and student government. Furthermore, courses taken while one is enrolled under non-degree status may not be used to meet NMSU requirements for regular admission. Non-degree admission is designed to meet the needs of mature, part-time students who do not wish to pursue a degree. Transcripts from previous institutions (including high school) and/or results of college entrance exams may be required to assure readiness for univer - sity-level courses. Non-degree students are subject to the same regulations as regular students. They may not transfer more than 30 credits that were taken while in this status to any degree program. Admission requirements include a non-degree application and a nonre- fundable $20 application fee.8 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College Changing from Non-degree to Degree- s eeking s tatus A non-degree student in good academic standing with a GPA of 2.0 or better may apply for a change of status from non-degree status to regular (degree-seeking) status. Requirements for regular admission must be met, including submitting official high school transcripts as well as official college tran - scripts from all previously attended institutions of higher education. The sta-tus will be effective on or before the census date of the semester in which all official transcripts are received. If all official transcripts are received after the census date of the current semester, the change of status will take effect in the next immediate term. Dual Credit Program The Dual Credit Program (DCP) is designed to give high school juniors and seniors an opportunity to attend Do\u00f1a Ana Community College classes prior to high school graduation. Qualified students who are enrolled in a school district that has a Dual Credit Master Agreement with DACC may take college-level, career-technical courses that will simultaneously count toward high school graduation and toward a certificate or associate degree at DACC. To complete a certificate or associate degree from DACC, they will have to attend additional semesters or sessions following high school gradu - ation and pay DACC tuition and fees. While DCP participants do not pay for tuition or text books, they do pay for their own supplies, protective apparel, and tool sets, when needed. They also may be responsible for certain course fees and other fees where applicable. Students should apply for DCP opportunities with their high school coun - selor. To be considered, they must meet the criteria agreed upon by their sc hool district and DACC. For further information, contact the appropriate high school counselor or the DACC Dual Credit Office at 528-7256. High school students not enrolled in a school district that has a Dual Credit Master Agreement with DACC may be eligible for enrollment as an Early Admission student. Early Admission students are responsible for all costs related to enrollment. NOTE: Not all DACC courses taken through the DCP are transferable to other colleges and universities. Early Admission for High school and Adult Basic Education s tudents It is possible for a current junior or senior high school student to be admitted to DACC, provided the following criteria have been met: 1. Written permission has been obtained from the high sc hool principal/ counselor and the parents. 2. T he student's cumulative grade-point average is at least 3.0. 3. The student has obtained the established minimum scores on the ACT/ SAT assessment, or passed two out of three sections of the COMPASS assessment.

High school stu - dents must provide the following documents: written permission from the high sc hool counselor or principal/counselor, written permission from par - ents, an official high school transcript sent directly to DACC, and a complete D ACC / NMSU admissions application.

Transcripts must be received prior to the date of registration. Admission status at the time of readmission will normally be determined by previous DACC academic standing. How - ever, academic performance at other institutions attended during the appli - cant's absence from DACC may be taken into consideration in determining the student' s academic admission status. special Admissions requirements There are eight programs at DACC with special admissions requirements: Dental Assistant Dental Hygiene Diagnostic Medical Sonogr aphy Dual Credit (concurrent enrollment) Emergenc y Medical Services-Paramedic (associate degree progr am) Radiologic T echnology Respir atory Therapy In addition to fulfilling the general requirements for admission to the community college, individuals seeking admission to these programs must also fulfill certain special admissions requirements. Since these pro - grams generally have limited enrollment, completion of the admissions requirements for a specific progr am does not guarantee acceptance into the program. Acceptance may be competitive, based on individual aca - demic performance in previous coursework and other criteria. Specific information regarding the application procedure for a specific progr am may be obtained from the department offering that program. Students must reapply to special admissions programs each time they wish to be considered for acceptance. For example, a student who has fulfilled all the special admissions requirements, yet was not admitted because of space limitations, will not automatically be considered for a subsequent semester; (s)he must reapply. Similarly, one who may have been accepted during a particular semester, but failed to accept an offer to enroll, must also reapply in order to be considered again. standards for Program Participation Some programs may require technical standards for admissions and/or continued program participation. Technical standards may include possess- ing or acquiring skills or behaviors to complete performance-based tasks. Completion of these tasks may be required for program completion. See individual program descriptions for further information. Security Background Checks. Certain programs of study require that stu - dents complete and pass a security background check in order to par -2013-2014 Catalog 9 ticipate. Past criminal violations may prevent a student from completing his/her degree and from being hired after graduating. Those programs requiring a security background check disclose this fact in their program description sections found in this catalog. The University Transition Program Students who have applied for admission to NMSU, but do not qualify for regular admission to the university, may enroll in the University Tran - sition Program (UTP) at DACC. This program is designed for students who need to strengthen academic skills, and will provide a good founda - tion for university-level work. NMSU applicants whose ACT composite score or high school grade average is below that required for NMSU regular or provisional admission will be enrolled in the University Transi - tion Program. Completion of 24 credits of coursework at DACC with a grade-point average of 2.0 or higher is needed to become a student at the NMSU Las Cruces campus. Each student will fol low an individualized study plan that typically includes study skills courses, Developmental Studies courses, and/or general education courses. Academic Advising and Registration Procedures Academic advising at DACC is an ongoing, shared partnership between a student and an advisor that focuses on enabling the student to identify, plan and achieve academic goals aligned with his or her career and life aspira - tions. Moreover, it is part of the educational process that aims to assist stu - dents to become active and effective agents of their own learning. In the academic advising process, students and advisors work together to\u2014 Develop an awareness of values, interests, abilities, skills and potential Identify academic and career goals and options Choose an academic program Strategically plan out steps toward graduation, or the completion of an academic goal Identify effective academic study skills and habits Learn how to solve problems that impede progress toward an academic goal Identify appropriate campus resources Learn how to use the my.NMSU.edu account and STAR Degree Audit Select courses Register for classes Targeted student-learning outcomes underlying the DACC academic advis - ing process include critical thought, self appraisal, decision making, healthy independence, responsibility, and respect for self and others. These out-comes are the ideal product of quality academic advising. Structure of DACC Academic Advising Students declared into a specic major or academic program are advised by a professional division academic advisor in that program's academic di - vision and/or a DACC faculty advisor in that academic program. Students may visit or call the Academic Advising Center, DASR 103, 528-7272 for more details. Students who are not declared into a specic major, or who are in transi- tion between programs, are advised through the Academic Advising Center, which serves as a central resource for the following categories of students: Transitional students, including those in the University Transition Pro- gram and other unclassied students who choose DACC as a place to begin their college career Students with a major in Criminal Justice, Law Enforcement, Correc- tions, Early Childhood Education, Education, Fire Science, and Fire Investigations Degree-seeking students pursuing the Associate Degree in General Studies Undecided students Non-degree-seeking students When to Seek Academic Advising NEW STUDENTS will meet with an academic advisor and register for classes after attending a rst-year student orientation. TRANSFER AND READMITTED STUDENTS should make an appointment to see an academic advisor once their DACC admission is complete. CONTINUING STUDENTS should plan ahead and meet with their academic advisor every semester, well in advance of continuing-student registration. Registering for Classes After academic advising is completed, students have the option to register for classes either online or in person. REGISTERING ONLINE. After being admitted and receiving academic advis - ing, eligible students may register for classes on the Web at my.NMSU.edu. For additional information, refer to the current Schedule of Classes. Upon completing online registration, students may either print out the reg - istration document themselves or ask for it at the DACC Registration Ofce on the East Mesa Campus (DASR 101H), at any other DACC location, or at the NMSU Registrar's Ofce. REGISTERING IN PERSON. Students must obtain a course-request card from their academic advisor, complete the card and have the advisor sign it, and then submit the card to the DACC Registration Ofce in DASR 101H on the East Mesa Campus, to the NMSU Registrar's Ofce, or to a registration ofce at any other DACC location. In some cases, the student must obtain the instructor and/or department head signature of the course request card before submitting it to a registration ofce. Once registered, students should obtain their registra - tion document, which is available at the DACC Registration Ofce or at any other location where one may register. The registration document includes a student's ofcial class schedule, along with related nancial in formation. The Web registration system will not accept requests for the S/U grading op - tion unless the course is offered exclusively on an S/U basis. Likewise, the system will not accept requests for the \"audit\" grading option. To request S/U or audit grading for courses, students will need to see their academic advisor. 10 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College Students need to use their NMSU user ID and password to access Web registra - tion through the my.NMSU.edu website. In the event that a student forgets his/ her pass word, the system will allow the student to reset it online, provided (s) he answers a security question correctly. If attempts to do so fail, the student must consult with the ICT help desk in room 140 of the NMSU Computer Center (646-1840). rEGISTE rING FO r COU OThEr NMSU CAMPUSES . Students may reg- ister for courses at another campus in the NMSU system if the course is not offered at their home campus, or if the course is full at their home campus. In the case of all other courses, open enrollment into all classes on all cam - puses will begin two weeks before classes begin for the semester, provided seats are a vailable and students meet prerequisites. Terms and Conditions of Course registration Students must complete registration for all courses prior to the first day of class to avoid incurring late fees. Students who subsequently decide not to attend, and have not officially withdrawn from DACC / NMSU, will earn fail- ing grades while remaining financially liable. When students ha ve a previous balance, their courses for the current term may be canceled if they have not made the appropriate arrangements to pay the debt owed. See the Schedule of Classes for payment deadlines. Additionally, students will be dropped from courses for which they do not meet prerequisites, including courses in a sequence that require a grade of C or better to proceed to the next course in that sequence. Academic sanctions Students placed on academic warning, probation, or suspension during the end-of-term grading process will be mailed a notification. Students placed on suspension will have any courses in which they may be registered for future se - mesters canceled, and applicable refunds will be made by the Business Office. Changes in registration: Adding and Dropping Courses Registration changes may be processed only in accordance with university regulations and with appropriate signatures. If a student decides to stop at-tending a course, it is the responsibility of the student to initiate official withdr awal from the course and to obtain all necessary signatures on the add/drop form. Failure to do so could result in failing grades. Add/drop forms may be obtained from the student's academic advisor or the Registration Office. Completed forms must be submitted to the staff in the Registration Office. Courses may not be added or dropped after the cutoff date indicated in the official academic calendar. The amount of refund a student is eligible to receive decreases the longer the student waits to drop a course. (See refund dates in the current Schedule of Classes.) ADDING A COU r SE . The deadline for adding courses during a given term is listed in the corresponding Schedule of Classes. Students desiring to add a course to their current registration schedule should do so in consultation with their academic advisor. If the desired course is still open, the student may add it online through his/her my.nmsu.edu account. If the course is closed, the student will need the instructor and department chair's permission and signature on an add/drop form. Once the add/drop form has been completed and all necessary signatures have been obtained, the student takes the completed form to the Registration Office for processing. The Registration Office will provide the student with a revised registration schedule, which the student should review immediately to ensure there are no inaccuracies. Any errors found in the class codes, class title, room/building numbers or credits should be reported immediately. DrOPPING A COU r SE . The process for dropping a course is similar to the pro - cess for adding a course. The student must consult with the academic advisor and drop the course by the deadline either online through his/her my.nmsu. edu account, or with an add/drop form with all required signatures. When a student officially drops a course, the W grade is assigned as follows:1. No gr ade is assigned during the end of the cancelation period. 2. A gr ade of W is recorded when a course is dropped between the last day to cancel and the midpoint of the semester. A student may not withdraw from courses after this deadline, unless the student officially withdraws entirely from DACC / NMSU. 3. Officially withdr awing completely from DACC / NMSU is equivalent to dropping all classes, and therefore a grade of W will be recorded for all classes attempted. The deadline for withdrawing completely is listed in the current Schedule of Classes. NOTES: (1) A student found to be insufficiently prepared for a particular course may be transferred to a more elementary course in the same subject area, provided that (a) the instructor of the more elementary course has given his/her consent, and (b) the transfer is completed before the last day to officially withdraw from an individual course. Commonly referred to as a \"drop-back,\" this type of transfer is usually, but not always, employed in cases of sequenced courses such as mathematics, English, or foreign languages. (2) Financial aid or other third-party funding sources should be consulted when enrollment changes occur. Anyone attending under the Vet- erans Educational Assistance Program should notify the Veterans Office in D ASR 107 on the East Mesa Campus when dropping or adding courses, as such changes could cause a reduction in the benefits received. Full Withdrawal from DACC / NMsU Full withdrawal from DACC or any other NMSU campus terminates enroll-ment in all courses and effects a full withdrawal from the entire NMSU system. It is an official procedure requiring signed appro vals as indicated on the withdrawal form; it cannot be completed on line. All such withdrawals will be noted on the student's transcript. It is the student's responsibility to initiate full withdrawal from the university and to obtain the necessary signatures. Students who leave without follow - ing the official procedure are graded appropriately by the instructor. DACC students enrolled at any NMSU campus may process their withdrawal either at the Registration Office on one of the DACC campuses or at the NMSU Registrar's Office, located in the Educational Services Building on the Las Cruces Campus. Applicable dates are published in the official academic calendar for all regular sessions. Medical Withdrawal A medical withdrawal applies to a student who becomes seriously ill, in - jured, or hospitalized and is therefore unable to complete the academic term for w hich he or she is enrolled. Those seeking a medical withdrawal should contact the NMSU Registrar's Office directly to initiate the process. Administrative Withdrawal In the event that a student has stopped attending class without formally withdrawing, the instructor reserves the right to remove the student from the class by means of an administrative withdrawal. Military Withdrawal Veteran students attending DACC who are called up for active duty and need to withdraw from all classes must contact the following offices: 1) DACC V ETErANS PrOGrAMS. Students will provide a copy of their or - ders to the DACC Veterans' Office in DASR 107 on the East Mesa Cam - pus (tel. 575-528-7081). To assist in reporting accurate information to the VA Regional Office, students should also provide documentation stating the last day of class attendance. 2) NMSU O FFICE OF T h E rEGIST r A r. Students also will present their orders to the NMSU Office of the Registrar (tel. 575-646-3411). They will re- ceive a military withdrawal from classes and a full refund of tuition and fees for the semester in w hich they are called to active duty.2013-2014 Catalog 11 Students who still have their receipts for textbooks purchased during the semester in which they are called to active duty will be given a full refund for these textbook purchases when they present their orders. Tuition and Fees The prices, rates, and fees that appear in this catalog for the 2013-2014 academic year were accurate at the time of publication. They are subject to change at any time and without notice. Application Fee A one-time $20 application fee and a completed application must be sub - mitted to DACC. The fee, which is not refundable, is required of students who have not previously enrolled at New Mexico State University or one of its community colleges. Tuition and Mandatory Fees Tuition rates, including mandatory fees, at DACC for academic year 2013-2014 are as follows: $65 per credit, or $780 per semester, for in-district stu - dents (residents of Do\u00f1a Ana County); $78 per credit, or $936 per semester, for out-of-district students (residents of other counties within New Mexico); and $207 per credit, or $2,484 per semester, for nonresident (out-of-state and international) students. However, when nonresidents enroll in a sum - mer session, or when they enroll in six credits or fewer during a regular term, they pay the in-state (but out-of-district) rate. At NMSU, tuition with mandatory fees for academic year 2013-2014 is as follows: $252.70 per credit, or $3,020.40 per semester, for residents; and $794.50 per credit, or $9,534.00 per semester, for nonresidents (out-of-state and international students). However, when nonresidents enroll in six cred - its or fewer during a given term, they pay the in-state rate. International students pay the same tuition and mandatory fees that non - residents pay.Per-semester costs for tuition and mandatory fees are calculated by mul - tiplying the number of credits by the applicable per-credit rate. Students taking between 12 and 18 credits are charged for only 12, provided that all credits are taken exclusively at DACC. Then, beginning with the 19th credit hour, the per-credit charge is again imposed. DACC and NMSU tuition and mandatory fees are calculated independently of each other. Resident, Nonresident Status Resident or nonresident status shall be determined according to the uniform denition set forth by the New Mexico Higher Education Department. The NMSU Registrar's Ofce administers residency. Out-of-district information is available at the DACC Ofce of Admissions in DASR 107 on the East Mesa Campus. Members of the Armed Forces, as well as their spouses and minor children, who are not otherwise entitled to claim residency are eligible for tuition payment at the resident student rates upon presentation of certication from their commanding ofcer of assignment to active duty within New Mexico. Certication is required at the time of initial registration. All enrolled members of the Navajo Tribe who reside on the Navajo Reser - vation, as certied by the Navajo Department of Higher Education, will be assessed in-state, out-of-district tuition rates at all times. Other Fees\u2014Resident and Nonresident Graduation Fee: Associate Degree $25 Graduation Fee: Certicate Programs $10 International Student Admission Fee $50 Payment of Charges By enrolling in classes at DACC/NMSU, a student makes a nancial com - mitment to pay the tuition and fee charges associated with that enrollment. The enrollment action constitutes a nancial obligation between the student and NMSU and all proceeds of this agreement will be used for education purposes and constitutes an education loan pursuant to 11 U.S.C 523(a) (8). Terms and Conditions of Course Registration are posted on the NMSU website and available in each term's registration guide. Payments can be made by mail, web or telephone, as well as in person. Cash, checks, money orders and all major credit cards are accepted. Those preferring to pay in person may do so at the DACC Cashiers Ofce (DASR 102B) on the East Mesa Campus or on the NMSU Las Cruces Campus at the University Accounts Receivable Ofce. Payments are also accepted in person at the Las Cruces Central, Gadsden, and Sunland Park campuses. Students may pay in full, enter into a payment plan, or provide proof of a third-party payment agreement. Students who do not pay in full or make third party payment arrangements within ve business days of the start of the term will be placed automatically on the payment plan and will be assessed the $20 fee for this service. Fall and Spring term balances are set up with four equal installments due within each term. Summer term balances are set up with two equal install - ments due within the term. Any nancial aid received will be applied to - ward balances owed. DACC / NMSU reserves the right to deny the payment plan to any student who has a poor credit rating or who has been negligent in making payments to the institution for previous debts. NOTE: Workshops, institutes, and noncredit courses are treated as complete - ly separate sessions. Check the Community Education program announce-ments for the specic noncredit course fees and registration instructions. Late Registration and Late Payment Penalty A late registration fee of $25 is imposed if registration has not been com - pleted before the late-registration period begins. Registering late also could cause a student to be placed automatically on the payment plan, resulting in an additional $20 fee. Delinquent and Prior-Term Balances DACC / NMSU reserves the right to cancel the registration of any student who fails to pay, when due, any indebtedness to the institution. Academic credits, transcripts, and diplomas will be withheld until all nan - cial obligations are paid. Dishonored Checks/Credit Cards DACC / NMSU charges a penalty on all dishonored cash instruments. Per - sonal checks will not be accepted from students who have had a previously dishonored check. Tuition Adjustments, Refunds, and Forfeitures Any student ofcially dropping or withdrawing from a course or courses during a term may receive a tuition/fee refund or adjustment as outlined in the current class schedule. No refunds or adjustments will be made on classes of less than ve weeks' duration. Non-attendance does not consti - tute an ofcial course drop or withdrawal. All charges due to DACC / NMSU must be paid before refunds or adjustments will be permitted. In cases of academic or disciplinary suspension, eligibility for tuition re- funds and adjustments will depend on the conditions of the suspension and will be entirely at the option of the institution. Should unforeseen circum - stances beyond the reasonable control of Do\u00f1a Ana Community College or New Mexico State University result in curtailing classes, closing residence facilities, or otherwise withdrawing services that are a normal function of the institution, refunds of any nature will be at the discretion of the college/university administration. Residence hall rentals and dining hall charges may be refunded in accor - dance with schedules adopted by these departments.12 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College TABLE: Costs of Certicates of Completion The chart below discloses what one may expect to pay for each of the cer - ticate programs listed, provided that only the minimum number of credits required for graduation is taken.

One- third of the total price of the toolboxes or tool kits is due at the time the tools are issued. The remaining toolbox/kit balance must be paid by the end of the semester in two equal installments, usually spaced two months apart. Fail-ure to pay the balance will result in exclusion from registration the follow - ing semester. Down payment and subsequent payments for toolboxes/kits must be made at the DACC Cashiers Ofce in DASR 102B on the East Mesa Campus. Students are responsible for full payment even if they withdraw from the community college. Return of toolboxes/kits will not constitute payment, as used tools cannot be reissued. Call the appropriate academic division for current costs. (Division telephone numbers appear on page 5.) Students in the Building Construction Technology Program will need to pur - chase steel-toed boots (approx. $75) and a set of hand tools (approx. $75).

The DACC Snack Bar operates stores on the Las Cruces Central and East Mesa campuses.Financial Aid As an open-door institution, DACC is committed to providing equal educa - tional opportunities to students regardless of personal, economic, or social conditions. This commitment means helping students overcome nancial barriers in getting the education they seek. Each year, DACC provides aid to many students who would otherwise be unable to attend the college because of lack of funds. The college, in conjunction with the NMSU Financial Aid Ofce, offers an extensive array of grants, scholarships, and loans. Grants are awarded on the basis of nancial need only, while scholarships may be awarded according to academic ability, as well as nancial need. Applicants desiring nancial assistance should apply rst for federal or state aid programs. Applications for state and federal aid are evaluated by the Financial Aid Ofce on the basis of published policies and procedures. Ap - plicants are encouraged to apply by submitting a Free Application for Fed - eral Student Aid (FAFSA) by March 1 of each year in order to allow sufcient time for aid to be awarded for the fall semester. All students must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue receiving aid. Eligibility Eligibility for most nancial aid is based on an analysis of the parents' and/or student's ability to pay the cost of a school year. Ability to pay is deter - mined through the application process. Most nancial aid programs have the following eligibility requirements: Only those who are U.S. citizens, or are eligible noncitizens with a valid Social Security number will be considered. Applicants must have a high school diploma or a GED, or must have passed an independently administered test approved by the U.S. De - partment of Education (Ability-to-Benet). Applicants should be enrolled at least half time (six hours) and be seeking a certicate or a degree for most federal aid programs and scholarships. Students enrolled less than half time must visit with Financial Aid staff. Applicants must be in good academic standing and maintain satisfac - tory academic progress. Applicants who are required to register with Selective Service must indicate that they have done so. Applicants must verify that they do not owe a refund on a federal grant and that they are not in default on a federal student loan. Need must be clearly established for need-based nancial assistance. No applicants will be denied nancial assistance on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation. SATISFACTORY A CADEMIC PROGRESS POLICY. Students receiving nancial aid are expected to achieve a degree within a reasonable length of time. Eli - gibility for nancial aid may be terminated if satisfactory academic progress is not demonstrated. Action by the student will be required for nancial aid to be reconsidered. TIME FRAME. Most undergraduate students seeking their rst associate de - gree have a maximum of 99 credits to receive their degree. All attempted credits are included in the limits, even if nancial aid was not received while taking those credits. This would include credits transferred in from other schools. Student who have fewer than the maximum credits allowed when the term begins will be certied for aid for the term, if they are meet - ing other SAP requirements. GPA REQUIREMENT. Undergraduate students receiving nancial aid must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 to remain in good standing. CREDIT HOURS PROGRESSION. Credit hour progression will require a stu- dent to complete a minimum of 70 percent of all attempted hours with pass - ing grades. Summer hours and transfer hours will also be included in this 14 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College calculation. Only courses receiving grades of A, B, C, D, and S will count as completed courses. Courses with all other grades, including I (incomplete), RR, W, U, and F, will not count toward progress (and may or may not be funded by financial aid). rETAINING ELIGIBILIT y FOr FINANCIAL AID. All Students must continue to meet the requirements for eligibility that were necessary for them to receive an offer of assistance. This includes being admitted and completing courses in a degree program. Students cannot owe any refunds or be in default on previously received financial aid. All other criteria as defined by the rules and regulations of the institution, New Mexico State University-Do\u00f1a Ana Community College, and the federal government must be met. Application Procedure DACC uses the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Contact the Fi-nancial Aid Office, DASR 109, for assistance in completing this form. The F AFSA can be completed online at www.fafsa.gov. Applications should be submitted by March 1. sources of Financial Aid GrANTS . The foundation for financial aid is the Federal Pell Grant, available to undergraduate students with documented financial need. The student may be eligible to receive other types of aid, including a Federal Supple - mental Educational Opportunity Grant or Leveraging Education Assistance P artnership Program (LEAP) Grant. These grants are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to undergraduate students who show exceptional financial need. Typically, all three types of grants do not have to be repaid. LOANS . Loans are available to students with or without financial need. Federal Perkins Loans are long-term, low-interest loans that must be repaid according to federal guidelines. Repayment begins nine months after gradu - ation or after enrollment drops below six credits. Subsidized and unsubsidized F ederal Stafford Loans are long-term loans available to undergraduate students. Students receiving a subsidized or un- subsidized Federal Stafford loan or a Perkins loan must complete a debt-management session and master promissory note before DACC / NMSU will issue a check. In addition, students must complete an exit interview upon graduation or withdrawal from DACC / NMSU. Repa yment of a Stafford loan begins six months after graduation or six months after enrollment drops be- low six credits. The interest rate is variable but will not exceed 8.25 percent. More information will be a vailable at the time the loan is made. WOrk-S TUDy Pr OG r AMS . The Federal Work-Study Program provides em - ployment opportunities for selected undergraduate students. The New Mexico Work-Study Program also provides employment opportunities for students; however, only state residents are eligible to participate. For more information on the U.S. Dept. of Education student aid programs, look on the Internet at http://studentaid.ed.gov/students/publications/stu-dent_guide/index.html (for financial aid) or http://dacc.nmsu.edu/fa/. AW A r DS. All financial aid awards are based on information provided by the student and parents, availability of funds, and eligibility requirements. Any award may be revised based on changes in enrollment, cost of attendance, family contribution, or failure to meet satisfactory academic progress. Withdrawals or reductions in enrollment may affect an award or any future awards. Financial aid and scholarships may not pay for courses in which an I or RR grade is received, or for audited courses. Visit with the Financial Aid Office for specific disbursement requirements. Mini-session courses will be considered for payment only if registration has been completed by the last date to add a course in August or January. SChOLArShIPS. All Scholarships are contingent upon availability of funds. Individual scholarship criteria are subject to change. Students are encour - aged to apply online at http://scholarships.nmsu.edu. The online applica-tion will be available in early November and is due by March 1. Only one application is necessary to be considered for most scholarships. State Sc holarships. The New Mexico Legislative Lottery Scholarship helps pay tuition expenses for New Mexico high school graduates (or GED recipients) who plan to attend an eligible New Mexico public college or university.

To be eligible to take an overload, the student must have a cumulative grade-point average for the two preceding semesters of 2.5 or above with no grade less than C. A one-credit course in physical activity does not affect the calculation for determining an overload. Freshmen will not be permitted to assume an overload. Satisfactory Progress A full-time student is making satisfactory progress when the cumulative number of credits earned at DACC / NMSU, divided by the number of se - mesters attended, equals at least 12. Part-time students must earn a propor - tional number of credits in the same time period for purposes of nancial aid. In the case of new freshmen, this denition will not be applied until the beginning of the third semester of enrollment; however, for all other stu - dents, it will apply after one semester of enrollment. All students at the end of their second academic year must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Grading System Grades and credits can be accessed over the Web, but students must have an active my.NMSU.edu account in order to do so. Grade reports may be ordered via Web, but will not be automatically mailed to students. When ordered, grades will be mailed to an address chosen by the student. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the Ofce of the Registrar with the address to which grades should be mailed. At the request of the student, the instructor will provide information on progress in the course prior to the last day to drop a course. The DACC/NMSU system of grading is expressed in letters, which carry grade points used in calculating the cumulative grade-point average: Letter Grade Grade Points per Unit of Credit (\"NC\" = Not computed) A+, A For excellent work 4.0 A- For excellent work 3.7 B+ For above-average work 3.3 B For above-average work 3.0 B- For above-average work 2.7 C+ For average work 2.3 C, C- For average work 2.0 D+, D , D- For below-average work 1.0 F For failing work 0 N Grade not submitted NC W For withdrawal NC CR Credit authorized, but no letter grade given NC IP In progress (currently enrolled; course has not ended) NC RR Substantial progress in skill-development course NC S Satisfactory work (normally equivalent to a C or higher) NC U Unsatisfactory work NC I Incomplete NC AU Audit NCIn computing the overall grade-point average, the total of credits in which the grades of A (or A+ or A-), B (or B+ or B-), C (or C+ or C-), D, or F have been assigned is divided into the total number of grade points earned. Courses for which only credit (CR) but no letter grade is given and courses in which an S is earned may be counted toward graduation, but are not computed in the grade-point average. An S grade is normally equivalent to a grade of C or higher. REPEATING A COURSE. A student may repeat a course in which a D or F grade has been earned. A computable grade (excluding I, W, RR, AU, CR, S, or U) in a repeated course may be substituted in the calculation of the grade-point average, though the original grade also remains on the tran - script. The rst occurrence with a C or better grade will count in earned/passed hours. Future attempts will not count in earned/passed hours. If a student repeats a course eligible for grade substitution in which the student has earned a D and then fails the course, the second grade of F will not be substituted for the original grade. Neither credits nor grade points may be earned by repeating a course for which a grade of C or higher has already been received. Repeat option ap - plies only to eligible courses that were completed prior to the time a student was awarded a degree at DACC / NMSU. RR GRADE. The RR grade applies only to designated skill-development (CCDE, CCDL, and CCDM) courses and indicates the student has made sub- stantial progress toward completing the requirements of the course. It carries neither penalty nor credit. The student must re-register and successfully com - plete the course in order to earn credit. The grade of RR may be received only once in any given course, and it remains on the student's transcript. S/U OPTION. Students with 28 credits at DACC / NMSU under traditional grading, with an overall average of 2.5 or better, may exercise the S/U op - tion. The following limitations apply: 1. No more than 7 credits per semester or 4 credits per summer session. 2. Not to exceed a total of 21 semester credits. These limitations do not apply to honors courses or courses ofcially des - ignated S/U. Each course under this option must be requested during registration. The course must be taken outside the major. If the student changes majors, the new major department may require a traditional grade for a course previously passed with an S grade. The traditional grade change is made by the instructor or by a course challenge if the original instructor is no longer with the college. Eligibility for S/U grading must be reestablished after adjusted credit has been approved. Non-degree students who do not meet the above require - ments may take courses under the S/U option. However, these courses may not be applied toward an undergraduate degree at NMSU. Each college of the university may designate courses in which the grading will be a basis of S or U for all students enrolled in the courses. Credits in such courses are not included in the 21-credit limitation. INCOMPLETE GRADE. The grade of I (incomplete) is given for passable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control. The following regulations apply to removing or changing an I grade. 1. Instructors may assign I grades only if the student is unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond the student's control that de - velop after the last day to withdraw from the course. Examples of appro - priate circumstances include documented illness, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, and similar circumstances. Job related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for assign - ing an I grade. In no case is an I grade to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F, U, or RR grades for marginal or failing work. Academic Regulations2013-2014 Catalog 23 2. To assign an I grade, the instructor must complete the I Grade In - formation Form and have the form delivered to the course dean, together with the instructor's grade sheets for the semester. The instructor will state in writing on the I-Grade Information Form the steps necessary to complete the remaining course work or the instructor may indicate that the student will be required to re-enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the I grade will not be removed). The student will sign this document or the course dean will send a copy of the document to the student's official permanent address as recorded in the Registrar's Office. 3. T he student is entitled to have the I grade removed from the student's transcript only if the student completes the remaining course work as specified on the I-Grade Information Form, in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. The work must be completed within 12 months after the I grade is assigned and prior to the student's graduation, or within a shorter period of time if specified by the instructor on the I-Grade Information Form. If the student fails to complete the course work, the instructor may change the I grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F, or U) provided that the instructor stated that this would occur on the I-Grade Information Form. 4. I gr ades can be removed from the student's transcript by the instructor only during the 12-month period following assignment of the I grade or prior to the student's graduation, whichever comes first. To remove an I grade, the instructor must complete a Change of Grade Form and file the form with the Registrar. The instructor may assign whatever grade is appropriate for the entire course. This may include grades of D, F, or U. An I grade not changed by the assigning instructor within 12 months and prior to graduation shall remain an I grade thereafter. 5. A student ma y re-enroll and receive credit for any course for which an I grade was previously received, but retaking the course will not result in a removal of the I grade from the student's transcript. The effect of removing an I grade on a student's academic standing (academic warning, probation, or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is officially recorded on the student's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade replacing the I is included in the grade-point average calculation that establishes the student's academic standing. If the transaction is re - corded after the student begins another semester, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based upon its inclusion with gr ades for the semester in which the student is enrolled. AUDIT OPTION . A regularly enrolled student may register for any course pri - or to the last day of registration as an auditor without credit with the consent of the instructor , provided the facilities are not required for regular students. The fee is the same as for credit courses. Audit courses are not considered in determining the maximum load except for students on probation. A student may not change from credit to audit after the last day to register, but instead may withdraw and continue to attend class with instructor permission. Adjusted Credit option The adjusted credit option allows students who obtain a low grade-point average (less than 2.0 cumulative) during their first few semesters to get a fresh start. This option may be used only once and is not reversible. All courses carrying a grade of S, CR, C, or better earned prior to the grading period in which the student requests the adjusted credit option (including transfer courses) are included as adjusted credit. All allowable credits are designated on the permanent academic record as \"adjusted credit\" and are omitted from the calculations of the cumulative grade-point average. A fee of $10 is required for the submission of an adjusted credit option ap - plication. Application forms are available in the DACC Academic Advising Center , DASR 103. Students applying for this option must: 1. not hold a baccalaureate degree2. be currently enrolled as a degree-seeking/nondegree undergr aduate student 3. ha ve a cumulative grade-point average of less than 2.0 at DACC/ NMSU 4. ha ve successfully accumulated fewer than 60 transfer plus DACC/ NMSU credits 5. exer cise the option only during the fall or spring semester before the last day to withdraw from DACC/NMSU. 6. pass an additional 30 gr aded credits before they may be awarded an associate's degree. Other courses taken during the period of credit adjustment are not calculat - ed in the cumulative grade-point average. The repeat rule for courses starts anew for students w ho have taken the adjusted credit option. Credits covered by this option are shown on the transcript with an appropri - ate notation, and all coursework attempted is shown. In no circumstances will a transcript of this record be issued that does not include all courses attempted at this university. Probationary status and eligibility for on-campus employment is not affect- ed by the exercise of the adjusted credit option. Students are eligible for uni versity honors if the criteria for university honors are met for all courses taken at DACC/NMSU after the period of adjusted credit. Transfer Credits Credits from accredited postsecondary institutions are automatically evalu - ated after official transcripts are received by the DACC Admissions Office. A tr ansfer student may, on the basis of an evaluation of her/his transcripts, receive credit for courses taken at other postsecondary institutions in which a grade of D or higher was received. However, D grades at DACC / NMSU will not satisfy basic academic competency (basic skills) in English and mathematics. Additionally, individual programs may choose to only ac - cept courses graded C or higher in their programs. Grades earned in courses taken at other institutions are not included in the calculation of the D ACC / NMSU GPA. Coursework from non-accredited institutions may be evaluated only after the student has completed 12 credits at DACC with a minimum GPA of 2.0. DACC has an established process for evaluating coursework completed at international institutions, non-accredited institutions/training academies, and through high school articulation agreements. The student should initiate the request for evaluation of this coursework with the academic department chair or program director. If approved by the division dean and vice presi-dent for academic affairs, coursework can be applied toward certificate or associate degree completion. Credit for Prior Learning or Military Experience Academic credit may be granted through the COLL 185 course for substan - tial previous training in the student's major area of study. Experience gained in the military can also be ev aluated for course credit. Contact Academic Advising (528-7272) for more information. Credit by Challenging Courses Any enrolled student with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0, currently attend - ing classes, may, with permission of the appropriate division or department, c hallenge by examination any undergraduate course in which credit has not been previously earned except an independent study, research or reading course, or any foreign language course that precedes the final course in the lower division sequence. The manner of administering the examination and granting permission shall be determined by the division or department in which the course is being challenged.24 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College Students may not enroll in a single course, challenge it by examination, and drop it during the drop/add period, unless they enroll in an additional course. In exceptional cases in which a student demonstrates outstanding ability in a course in which (s)he is already registered, (s)he may be permit - ted to challenge the course. A student desiring to apply for special examination ma y obtain the neces - sary forms from the NMSU Office of the Registrar. The fee for challenging a course is the same as the appro ved tuition rate. A grade of C or better is required for credit and will be recorded on the stu- dent's record as CR. Courses may not be challenged under the S/U option. T he special examination privilege is based on the principle that the student, exclusively, has the responsibility for preparing for a special examination. Credit by College-Level Examination Program Prior to or during a student's enrollment at DACC, credits toward general education requirements may be earned through the College-Level Examina - tion Program (CLEP) of the College Entrance Examination Board. CLEP is a national progr am of credit by examination that offers the opportunity to earn credits for college-level achievement regardless of how or where the course content was learned. Earned CLEP credit will be treated as transfer credit without a grade, will count toward graduation, and may be used in fulfilling specific curriculum requirements. A current copy of the NMSU CLEP policy, as well as test schedule informa - tion, is available at the Testing Services office in DASR 105 on the DACC East Mesa Campus (tel. 575-528-7295). short Courses Short courses are available during the academic year. See the current Class Schedule for special registration times and deadlines for payment. In order to register for a short course, a student must be eligible to attend DACC / NMSU. Please note that enrollment in short courses is prohibited if total credit hours would exceed 18 in a fall or spring semester or if they exceed 7 in a summer session. Definition of a Prerequisite A prerequisite is an enforceable entry requirement for a particular course. Recognition for Academic Achievement Crimson scholars Program Outstanding students who meet the criteria listed in this section may have the designation of \"Crimson Scholar\" placed on their transcripts and may be recognized at commencement with special regalia and a notation in the program. Students who complete two semesters as Crimson Scholars and are eligible for a third semester will receive a lapel pin at an awards ceremony. Crimson Scholars are entitled to early registration and special library privileges. To qualify for the Crimson Scholar program, students must be degree- seeking undergraduates enrolled for three or more credits per semester at DACC / NMSU. Those who qualify will be automatically notified by letter during the semester in which they become eligible. Criteria vary according to class standing as follows: NEW FrEShMAN (those having 27 credits or less) with an ACT composite score of 26 or better or an ACT score of 24 or better, and a 3.75 high school GPA are eligible. Such students must maintain a 3.3 minimum cumulative GPA to continue in the program until they complete 28 graded credits. CONTINUING FrEShMAN are not eligible for the program until they have completed 12 or more credits at DACC / NMSU with a 3.5 minimum GP A. SOPhOMO rES, jUNIO rS, AND SENIO r S (those having 28 or more credits) must have a 3.5 minimum cumulative GPA to be eligible and must maintain that minimum GPA to continue in the program.TrANSFE r STUDENTS must have a 3.5 minimum cumulative GPA for 12 cred - its at their previous institution(s) to be eligible, and must maintain at least a 3.5 cumulati ve GPA to continue in the program. Transfer students who do not have a 3.5 minimum cumulative GPA at their previous institution(s) must complete 12 or more credits at DACC / NMSU to establish eligibility and must maintain at least a 3.5 cumulative GPA to continue in the pro- gram. Currently enrolled Crimson Scholars whose cumulative GPA drops below 3.5 or the minimum 3 credits per semester will be dropped from the pro - gram.Additional information is a vailable from the office of the vice president for student services, whose office is located in DASR 106B.* NO TE: Courses taken on an S/U or on an audit basis, as well as those for which an I was received, are not counted. Dean's List Following the close of the semester, the college will publish a list of students who have achieved honor standing in grades for the previous semester. To be eligible, a student must have been enrolled in 12 or more semester cred- its with a computable grade in each. The top 15 percent of eligible students in the college will be named to the Dean' s List. Meritorious Graduate The designation Meritorious Graduate is awarded to the top 15 percent of the students receiving associate degrees within each college in any one academic year; the students must have completed 45 or more credits with computable grades at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College. Attendance and student Performance Students are expected to regularly attend all classes for which they are reg - istered. Valid reasons for missing classes do not relieve the student of mak-ing up the work missed nor the responsibility of seeing the instructor about making up an y missed work. Specific class attendance requirements are determined by the instructor of the course. Students making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are representing DACC during college-sponsored events (e.g., sponsored student-organization functions, educational field trips, and conferences). Authorized absences do not relieve the student of his or her class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring faculty or staff advisor. When the number of absences hinders a student's progress in a course, the instructor may initiate a statement of the student's excessive absences includ - ing a recommendation of retention or expulsion from the class. Based on the recommendation of the instructor and with the concurrence of the course di vision dean and the vice president for academic affairs (VPAA) a student will be dropped for persistent absences or for persistent failure to complete assignments. Similarly, a student may also be dropped from a class for engag- ing in behavior that interferes with the educational environment of the class. An y student who has been dropped from a class shall have the right to appeal that decision through the Student Academic Grievance Policy. Only enrolled students for credit or for audit are permitted to attend classes. A student who has officially withdrawn from a course may continue to at - tend the course with the permission of the instructor for the remainder of the semester . Students not enrolled may visit classes only with the permission of the instructor. veter ans Attendance and s atisfactory Progress The Veterans Administration (V.A.) requires all veterans attending under Veterans Educational Assistance Benefits to make satisfactory progress and systematic advancement toward an educational objective, or be liable for overpayments from the V.A. Satisfactory progress and regular class atten - dance are expected of such students.2013-2014 Catalog 25 If a veteran receiving benefits is suspended for academic reasons, benefits are terminated and will be restored only after readmission to DACC / NMSU. If the community college has liability claims filed against it as a result of a v eteran failing to meet compliance requirements of the Veterans Administra - tion, the university will not release any academic records on the veteran until suc h time as the veteran has reimbursed the federal government for funds drawn in violation of those requirements. A student receiving V.A. benefits who is pursuing an associate degree or cer - tificate through a program offered by DACC should adhere to the curriculum of that progr am. Failure to do so will result in the student's being certified for less than full-time status or becoming liable for an overpayment. Academic Misconduct Students at DACC are expected to observe and maintain the highest aca - demic, ethical, and professional standards of conduct. Any student found guilty of academic misconduct shall be subject to disciplinary action. Aca- demic misconduct includes, but is not limited to the following actions: 1. Cheating or kno wingly assisting another student in an act of cheating or other forms of academic dishonesty; 2. Plagiarism, w hich includes, but is not necessarily limited to, submitting examinations, themes, reports, drawings, laboratory notes, undocu- mented quotations, computer-processed materials, or other material as one' s own work when such work has been prepared by another person or copied from another person; 3. Unauthorized possession of examinations, reserv e library materials, or laboratory materials; 4. Unauthorized changing of grades on an examination, in an instructor's grade book, or on a grade report; or unauthorized access to academic computer records; 5. Nondisclosure or misrepresentation in filling out applications or other uni versity records in, or for, academic departments or colleges. Academic Appeals Board The community college has an academic appeals board, consisting of three faculty members and two students appointed by the vice president for aca - demic affairs. Any student who believes that (s)he has been unjustly treated b y a faculty member within the academic process may request a hearing before the academic appeals board. The steps and procedures for the stu - dent to follow appear under the heading, \"Special Grievance Policy,\" in the D ACC Student Handbook. Academic standing Please see the section on incomplete (I) grades to determine the effect that removing I grades may have academic standing. AC ADEMIC WA r NING , Pr OBATION AND S USPENSION . When students do not maintain adequate academic standing, they begin a progression from Aca - demic Warning to Academic Probation I and II, and finally to Academic Suspension. Eac h stage imposes more structure and restrictions on the stu - dent in order to help the student return to normal academic standing. Thus, the intent is not to punish, but to help the student enjo y academic success. Since some of the restrictions imposed limit the number of credit hours that can be taken, students on Probation or Suspension may be subject to loss of financial aid. It is the responsibility of the student to determine what impact a particular change in academic standing could have on financial aid. Notification to students of Academic Warning, Academic Probation, or Academic Suspension appears on the student's grade report at the end of each grading period. AC ADEMIC WA r NING . Issued only once, an Academic Warning is received when a student's cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 while the student is in good academic standing. The vice president of Student Services will send the student a letter detailing the consequences that will accrue should the cumulative grade point-average remain below 2.0 at the conclusion of the following semester. While under Academic Warning, the student will be required to enter into a contract with their academic advisor that has the approval of the depart - ment chair. The contract may require the student to do any of the following: Repeat a course in an effort to sharply increase the GP A. Enroll in a 3-hour special study skills/time management course specifi - cally designed for those on Academic Warning for the first time, or an equi valent course approved by the vice president of Student Services. T ake only courses related to the student's major, except for the special skills/time management course. Obtain tutoring help. See an academic counselor on a specified time sc hedule. Register for fewer credit hours if there are extenuating cir cumstances, such as work commitments. Other requirements may be included in the contract, as well. The vice president of student services may place the student on Academic Probation I should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. If, at the end of the first semester on Academic Warning, the student has a semester GPA greater than 2.0 but the cumulative GPA remains below 2.0, the student will remain on Academic Warning. If the cumulative GPA is raised to at least 2.0 by the end of the semester, the student is returned to regular status. If both the semester GPA and the cumulative GPA remain below 2.0 at the end of the semester on Academic Warning, the student is placed on Academic Probation I. SUMME r COUrSES. A student may use summer classes to try to get warning or probationary status removed. Under no circumstances may a student on Academic Warning or Academic Probation be allowed to register for an overload. Academic warning status is continued if the student withdraws from the university. Probation or suspension status applies to all subsequent enroll - ments. AC ADEMIC Pr OBATION . The two stages in Academic Probation are de - scribed as follows: AC AD e MIC P RO bAt ION I. As explained earlier, if the student's semester GPA remains below 2.0 while on Academic Warning, the student is moved from Academic Warning to Academic Probation I. Under Academic Probation I the following conditions apply: 1. T he student cannot enroll in more than 13 hours of coursework dur - ing the semester. Note: Students who fall below 12 credits in any one semester may jeopardize their financial aid. In such an event, students should contact their division dean as soon as possible to try to imple - ment corrective measures. 2. T he student and the advisor will enter into a contract (which may take the form of an individualized education plan) having the approval of the vice president of Student Services. Should the student fail to ad - here to the stipulations of this contract, the vice president of Student Services ma y place the student on Academic Probation II or Academic Suspension. 3. If the student w ho is on Academic Probation is receiving educational benefits from the Veterans Administration, he or she must obtain coun - seling from the Office of Veterans Programs. The student must maintain a semester GPA equal to or greater than 2.0 until the cumulative GPA reaches 2.0, at which time the student goes back to reg - ular status. During this period, the student remains on Academic Probation I. NOTE: Transfer students. Students (admitted under special provisions) whose transcripts indicate less than a 2.0 GPA are admitted on Academic Probation I. 26 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College AC AD e MIC P RO bAt ION II. If, however, the student fails to maintain a semes - ter GPA of at least 2.0 while on Academic Probation I, the student will be placed on Academic Probation II. Students who are already on Academic Probation II will remain in that status as long as the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0. The following stipulations apply to those on Academic Proba-tion II: 1. The student cannot enroll in more than 7 hours of coursework during the semester. 2. The student and the advisor will enter into a contract approved by the vice president of Student Services that places further stipulations on Academic Probation II. The vice president of student services may place the student on Academic Suspension should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. The student must maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher until the cu - mulative GPA reaches a 2.0, at which time the student is placed on regular status. A student unable to maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher while under Academic Probation II will be placed on Academic Suspension. CONTINUING IN PrOBATIONA ry STATUS . Students may continue to enroll while on Academic Probation I or II provided they maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher. They are continued on that same level of Academic Pro - bation if they withdraw from the university while on Academic Probation. rEMOVAL OF AC ADEMIC Pr OBATION . Such academic standing is removed when the cumulative GPA is raised to 2.0 or higher, with the following ex - ceptions: (1) a transfer student may not remove probation by summer work alone; (2) if an I grade is removed after the student has enrolled, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based on its inclusion with grades for the term for which the student is enrolled; (3) exercise of the Adjusted Credit Option does not change academic status until subsequent grades are earned. AC ADEMIC S USPENSION . When a student does not achieve a semester 2.0 GPA or higher, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 while under Aca - demic Probation II, the student is placed on Academic Suspension. Students are not allowed to take NMSU courses while on suspension but must sit out a minimum of one semester and then petition the vice president of Student Services to be removed from Academic Suspension. At this time, the suspen - sion status will be evaluated for possible removal. Should the suspension be lifted, the student is placed on Academic Probation II until such time that the cumulative GPA equals or exceeds a 2.0. At the discretion of the vice president of Student Affairs, the student will enter into a contract approved by the vice president of Student Services and the student's division dean, which sets stipulations for removal from suspension. Failure to adhere to the contract will return the student to Academic Suspension. Under certain conditions, a student may be re-admitted to NMSU with pro- visional regular status while under Academic Suspension when satisfactory progress has been demonstr ated at another college or university (see the NMSU Undergraduate Catalog). Credits earned at another university or col - lege while under Academic Suspension from NMSU or another university or college, will be accepted at NMSU only after the student demonstr ates satisfactory progress over a period of two semesters after being re-admitted or admitted to NMSU. Acceptance of transfer credits that count toward de - gree requirements is still governed by the rules established by the student's respecti ve college or campus. EFFECT OF SUMME r ATTEND ANCE . Students suspended at the close of the spring semester may have their Academic Suspension rescinded if they attend any of the following summer sessions at NMSU or one of its com - munity colleges. Such attendance must raise the cumulative GPA to 2.0 or better . A certification of eligibility to attend summer sessions at NMSU after a spring semester Academic Suspension is available to the suspended student who wishes to attend summer sessions at other institutions.Disciplinary Probation and suspension DACC / NMSU expects all students to conduct themselv es as responsible citizens on campus and in the community. Repeated misconduct and major violations will cause the student to be subject to immediate suspension or expulsion from DACC / NMSU. The general rules and regulations applicable to students are in the \"Student Code of Conduct\" contained in the Student Handbook. Privacy rights The following information has been designated as directory information and is subject to release to the public under the Buckley Amendment (PL 98-380), The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974: student's name, address, E-mail address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, classification, participation in officially recognized ac - tivities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and a wards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. Other information regarding disclosure of student data is posted in the DACC Student Services area in compliance with the Act. Requests for with - holding directory information must be filed in writing with the NMSU Reg - istrar's Office by the third Friday of class. social security Numbers in student records Social security numbers are collected from prospective and current stu - dents who wish to be employed on campus or apply for financial aid. Such students are required b y law to provide their social security number for administrative use. Further, the university is mandated by federal tax regula - tions to provide tuition and fee payment information to the student and the Internal Revenue Service, so that applicable educational tax credits may be computed. The social security number will be necessary to submit this tax reporting. The social security number is a confidential record and is main - tained as such by the university in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Pri vacy Act (FERPA). Graduation Requirements The ultimate responsibility for planning an academic program in compli-ance with university, college, and departmental/program requirements rests with the student. Students planning to gr aduate must clear all of their accounts with the DACC Cashiers Office. Delinquent accounts due to outstanding balances for tools, books, and personal materials should be cleared in the community college's Cashiers Office, located in DASR 102B . Graduation with Honors The requirements for designation as a Crimson Scholar Graduate are listed on page 24 in the section titled, \"Recognition for Academic Achievement.\" The designation Meritorious Graduate is awarded to the top 15 percent of the students receiving associate degrees within each college in any one academic year provided 45 or more credits have been completed at NMSU or DACC. To Graduate with a Certificate Students must successfully complete the total program as outlined in the course catalog and have a GPA of 2.0 or greater. Any incomplete grade must be made up before the student is awarded the certificate. A certificate fee of $10 is to be paid at the DACC Cashier's Office, located in DASR 102B . To Graduate with an Associate Degree To earn an associate degree, students must complete a minimum of 66 se - mester credits and have an average of two grade points per credit in all courses taken at NMSU or an y of its community colleges (individual pro- grams may have other GPA requirements). However, English 111G, Rhetoric 2013-2014 Catalog 27 and Composition, and basic skills courses in mathematics must be com - pleted with a grade of C or better. The last 15 credit hours must be taken through the NMSU system, w hich includes DACC. Filing Notice of Degree Candidacy Students are required to file an application for a certificate or associate de - gree and pay the graduation fee for each degree sought. This fee ($10 for a certificate; $25 for an associate degree) must be paid b y the end of the semester or session in which the candidate anticipates completing degree requirements. These fees may be paid at the DACC Cashiers Office, located in DASR 102B . If degree requirements are not completed during the semes- ter or session for which the student paid the fee, the student must reapply and pa y any additional fees that may apply. Students can apply for their associate degree through their myNMSU ac - count. Certificate applications are available on the DACC website.

Developmental studies Mission and value s tatement Our mission is to provide general education and developmental instruction designed to meet individual educational goals and foster lifelong learning. By providing rigorous curriculum through interdisciplinary instruction that honors and recognizes the academic and workforce needs of our diverse community of lifelong learners, the General Studies Division Is student-centered, and Encour ages students to become risk-taking and self-motivated learners. Developmental/College studies Courses The Developmental Education courses at DACC are certified through the National Association of Developmental Education (NADE). Our develop - mental courses ascribe to the NADE's philosophy: Helping under-prepared students prepare, prepared students advance, and advanced student excel (NADE 2001-2006). Developmental courses are designed to help students acquire the skills and attitudes necessary for college success. Developmental Studies includes English, math, reading, language, and study skills. They are identified by an \"N\" that appears after the course number. De - velopmental Studies courses are included on the transcript and will be cal - culated in the academic grade point average, but do not count toward a degree. On the other hand, College Studies courses do carry academic credit and are designed to help students acquire the attitudes and str ategies necessary for college success. Students' placement in developmental studies courses will be determined by one or more of the following instruments: ACT assessment, ACT-COM -PASS, and locally developed tests. Students must achieve a C or better in courses with \"CCD-\" prefixes to continue with the next course. Course Descriptions Course descriptions appear near the end of this catalog and are listed by course prefix (the letters appearing before a course number). The various prefixes represent different areas of study as shown: CCDE: Dev elopmental English CCDL: Dev elopmental Language elopmental Mathematics CCD r : Dev elopmental Reading COLL: College Studies General Education Courses General Education at NMSU provides all students with a broad founda - tion and common framework upon which to develop knowledge and skills, social consciousness and respect for self and others; thus enabling them to function responsibly and effecti vely now and in the future. General education courses taught at DACC are lower-division, university-level courses that are the same as those taught at NMSU. They are identified by the \"G\" that appears after the course number. In addition to meeting DACC graduation requirements, they may also be used to meet require - ments for bachelor's degree programs at NMSU. D ACC students are given priority in enrollment for general education cours - es taught at the Central and East Mesa campuses. The priority enrollment period ends tw o weeks prior to the beginning of each semester or summer session. NMSU students may enroll in these courses after the priority enroll - ment period has ended.General Studies Course Offerings Developmental Studies, College Studies, and General Education Courses28 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College The following core matrix of approved courses are guaranteed to transfer and meet general education requirements at any New Mexico college or university.

These are made up of an agreed-upon number of hours and courses. When discipline module courses are taken in addition to the 35-hour general education core, the total number of hours in a transfer module are approximately 64. student responsibility New Mexico's colleges and universities have collaborated to produce guides to assist students who plan to transfer before completing a program of study. Course modules are designed to help students select courses carefully so that they may transfer with little or no loss of credit. However, planning for effective transfer with maximum efficiency is ultimately the student's responsibility. Responsible transfer planning includes early and regular con - sultation with the intended degree-granting institution to assure that all pre-tr ansfer course work will meet the requirement of the desired degree. Complaint Procedure for Transfer Credit Appeal All New Mexico public postsecondary institutions are required to establish policies and practices for receiving and resolving complaints from students or from other complainants regarding the transfer of course work from other public institutions in the state.

Dental assistants are people who like helping others, enjoy working closely with patients and other members of the dental team, and like working with their hands. In fact, assistants frequently are relied on as the dentist's \"other set of hands.\" There is no lack of variety in the types of tasks that dental assistants per - form. They prepare equipment, materials, and instruments for patient care; perform sterilization and disinfection procedures; provide patients with instructions for dental procedures; create temporary crowns; provide cor - onal polishing and placement of sealants; take impressions of teeth; create study casts (molds); take and review patient medical histories; expose and develop radiographs; and perform a variety of other duties. They may also be responsible for administrative tasks, such as billing, patient verica - tion, scheduling of various types of treatment appointments, and material inventory. Assistants may work in a general-practice ofce where a dentist provides multiple types of treatment, including restorative/operative work (llings), prosthetics (crowns, bridges, and dentures), and perhaps some surgery. They may want to specialize for work in periodontics, oral and maxillofacial sur - gery, pedodontics, or orthodontics. In the state of New Mexico, dental assistants can become certied to per - form the following expanded duties: radiology (taking x-rays), coronal pol - ishing (polishing of teeth and removal of stains), fluoride treatments (the act of placing fluoride on a patient's teeth), and sealant placement (used to prevent decay). These certications are obtained through the State Dental Board and are a portion of the Dental Assisting National Board Certication Exam. The Dental Assistant program at DACC is nationally accredited by the American Dental Association, Commission on Dental Program Accredita - tion. It is also recognized by the New Mexico State Board of Dentistry as a continuing-education provider. Required Skills and Abilities Students will need to demonstrate good oral expression (speech clarity) and written comprehension in English, critical thinking skills, near vision, and physical stamina (e.g., the ability to stand for long periods of time), as well as the ability to manipulate dental/medical equipment, move/lift patients and equipment up to 50 pounds without assistance, and perform patient care procedures with manual dexterity. Program Admission Special Requirements The Dental Assistant program is a limited-entry, special-application pro - gram. When a candidate is considered for acceptance into the program, the following factors are taken into account: High school and/or college transcripts and GPA Proof of residence Copy of current healthcare provider CPR card and immunizations Completion of ENGL 111G and computer literacy course\u2014required prior to applying (completion of other general education and related requirements also considered) Completion of program application (submitted before deadline)Course fees In addition to tuition, a course fee of $175 is charged for DAS 115.

Sonographers function as members of the healthcare team by providing and evaluating high quality images that aid physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of their patients. Sonographers are highly motivated, independent, critical thinkers who enjoy one-on-one patient interaction. Employment opportunities are available in a variety of settings, such as hos - pitals, physicians' ofces, and veterinarian practices. There are also oppor - tunities in sales, education, management, research, marketing, and product development. Because job prospects in the Las Cruces-El Paso area oc - casionally are limited, it may be necessary to conduct a wider job search. Training involves a combination of academic courses and a clinical in - ternship in the ultrasound department of area hospitals and clinics where students will gain hands-on training under the supervision of registered diagnostic medical sonographers and will work alongside physicians and other health-care professionals. Coursework covers abdominal and OB-Gyn and more. Infection control and emergency management are also important functions. In New Mexico and other states, dental hygienists may be certi - ed to provide local anesthesia. Dental hygienists enjoy working with people, have good manual dexterity and enjoy working with their hands. They possess the maturity and criti - cal thinking skills to provide current, quality, professional care. They have strong interpersonal skills to motivate and educate patients of all ages. Den - tal hygienists are lifelong learners and are dedicated to continuing educa - tion, enhancing the profession and practicing ethical decision-making and behavior. Dental hygienists are generally well paid and are highly thought of as profes - sionals in their communities. The profession is one of the fastest growing oc - cupations in the country and is expected to grow much faster than average for all occupations through 2014. The number of people seeking preventive dental hygiene care, the expansion of an older population who retain their teeth, and a trend in group practices that stress effective and productive use of ofce personnel, will provide increasing opportunities for employment. Graduation from this program qualies students to take national and state examinations to become a licensed dental hygienist anywhere in the United States and there are international employment opportunities for dental hy-gienists educated in the U.S. Students wishing to pursue a Bachelor's degree should consult with an advi - sor regarding transferability of courses in the prerequisite list as well as the dental hygiene curriculum. Required Skills and Abilities Students will need to demonstrate good oral expression (speech clarity) and written comprehension in English, critical thinking skills, near vision, and physical stamina (e.g., the ability to sit for long periods of time and move about freely), as well as the ability to manipulate dental/medical equipment, move/lift equipment up to 30 pounds without assistance, and perform pa-tient care procedures with manual precision. Program Admission Special Requirements This is a limited entry program. Criteria for selection are available from the program director. Successful candidates generally have a GPA of 3.0 of higher. Student faculty ratio in the clinical setting is 1-to-5 thus allowing for individualized instruction.

These elds include Architecture, Architectural Technology, Civil/Survey Technology and Mechanical Drafting/Solid Modeling. Excellent job and salary opportunities are available nationwide for Draft - ers/CAD specialists, technicians, architects, and engineers. With its rapid growth, southern New Mexico also has strong employment possibilities for graduates of the Drafting and Design Technologies Program. Students with previous related training and/or formal education may quickly qualify for more advanced positions, such as construction inspector or supervisor, con - tractor, or senior drafter. Within the Drafting and Design Technologies Program are four courses of study leading to associate of applied science degrees. These allow students to tailor their studies to their own interests and career aspirations. Architectural Technology: Architectural 2D and 3D drafting, residen-tial design, construction estimating, construction technology, archi-tectural rendering and animation, green building (LEED), and Building Information Modeling (BIM) Civil/Survey Technology: Civil engineering drafting, surveying funda-mentals, roadway construction drafting, land development drafting, and GIS training Mechanical Drafting and Solid Modeling: Mechanical drafting, machine/manufacturing fundamentals, basic mechanical design, parametric solid modeling, and animation Pre-Architecture: Architectural theory and drawing; design studio/ culture; architectural history; computer applications; introduction to construction principles and construction documents; presentation techniques In addition to the associate degrees, the program also offers certicates of completion specializing in ve areas: Architectural Technology, Civil/Survey Technology, Drafting and Graphics, Mechanical Drafting/Solid Modeling, and Geographical Information Systems. While pursuing this program, whether taking classes or working in a co-op position, students will be required to perform the same job duties and be able to meet the same physical requirements that they will as a graduate in the eld. Courses, as well as careers, in Drafting and Design Technologies will require a person to be able to work at computers, communicate ver - bally and in writing, and participate in an online environment. Future students who are still in high school are encouraged to take courses in mathematics, science, English, and drafting. Furthermore, Dual credit op - portunities are available for high school students who wish to earn college credit while still in high school. These credits may apply to their high school credit requirements as well as the DACC Drafting and Design Technologies requirements. (For more information, refer to the section titled, \"Dual Credit Program,\" within this catalog.) Pre-Architecture Program Overview Students planning to pursue a professional career in architecture may nd it more convenient and economically advantageous to begin their studies closer to home. The DACC Pre-Architecture program, which culminates in an associate of applied science degree, consists roughly of the rst two years of a standard, bachelor's degree curriculum in architecture. Currently, the most popular transfer universities for DACC Pre-Architecture students are the University of New Mexico and Texas Tech University. Both offer in-state tuition rates and have signed articulation agreements with DACC providing for the smooth and efcient transfer of credits. Acceptance into a transfer university's architecture program is not automatic nor is it guaranteed. Students must follow the regular application proce-dures of the chosen university. Nor can DACC guarantee placement into a transfer university's architecture program at any particular level, for such matters are totally dependent on how the university may evaluate transcripts, portfolios and other required materials against its own acceptance criteria. For example, in order to be accepted at UNM, a nal grade of B- or better is required in ARCT 101 and 104, and a nal grade of C or better is required in all other courses in the DACC Pre-Architecture curriculum. Potential architecture students should contact the Pre-Architecture advisor at DACC for assistance with course scheduling and transfer procedures (tel. 575-528-7310). Credit Transfer to Bachelor's Degrees in Engineering Technology at NMSU The Architectural Technology, Civil/Survey Technology, and Mechanical Drafting and Solid Modeling associate degree programs include optional tracks of study that allow students to earn credits that may be transferable into one of the engineering technology programs offered by NMSU. These optional tracks of study allow students to maximize the number of credits applicable to an NMSU Engineering Technology program, while also mak - ing it possible to earn an associate degree for immediate employment in a drafting related eld. Students should contact a Drafting and Design Tech-nologies program advisor for the most current information and requirements related to these credit transfer opportunities. 48 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College Additional Program Information Students receive training from highly qualied faculty in modern classrooms and drafting and design laboratories equipped with the latest in computers, peripheral equipment, and professional software.

People's lives often depend on the quick reaction and competent care of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. Emergency medical services (EMS) professionals may work at any of four different levels: rst responder, EMT-basic, EMT-intermediate, and para-medic. Upon successful completion of training, students are eligible for employment in many types of emergency medical systems nationwide\u2014in re departments, municipal services, private ambulance services, federal services, industry, hospital emergency departments, and hospital-based am - bulance systems. The demand for EMS professionals is increasing. DACC offers all levels of EMS education, as well as an opportunity to earn an associate of applied science degree at the paramedic level. Successful completion of an EMS program will allow for certication/licensure testing at the state and national level. At each EMS program level, students gain additional knowledge and skills to enable them to function in the clinical and eld settings with nurses, physicians, and other healthcare professionals. In classes, students learn about anatomy and physiology, the pathophysiology of diseases, traumatic injuries, pharmacology, and cardiac care. Students acquire skills through laboratory practice, clinical experience in hospitals, and eld experience with ambulance services throughout the state. Students may be scheduled at a variety of clinical and eld sites which include areas outside Las Cruces. Program Accreditation The Emergency Medical Services Program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (www.caahep.org) upon the recommendation of the Committee on Accreditation of Educa - tional Programs for the Emergency Medical Services Profession (CoAEMSP). Com mission on Accreditation To contact CoAEMSP of Allied Health Education 4101 W. Green Oaks Blvd., Programs Suite 305-599 1361 Ana Community College In addition, the program is approved by the New Mexico Ofce of Health Emergency Management. Required Skills and Abilities All EMS programs require that the student be able to\u2014 lift, carry and balance up to 125 pounds (250 pounds with assistance) carry out emergency and non-emergency patient care, including, light extrication (i.e., be able to assume a variety of postural positions and be capable of physical maneuvers ranging from crawling, kneeling, squatting, twisting, turning, and bending, to climbing stairs and lad-ders) withstand varied environmental conditions such as extreme heat, cold, and moisture.

Fire investigators must be ana - lytical, as well as knowledgeable in criminal investigations, the rule of law, and arrest, search and seizure. They usually rely on scientic principles and research in an analysis of re remains to determine the cause and origin of the re. Investigators work to determine whether the re was deliberately set and what contributed to its subsequent growth. These ndings can become an integral part of a criminal investigation that may require legal action to be taken against the responsible party. Fire investigation ndings can also be used in the evaluation of existing re codes and development of legislation to prevent and reduce the loss of life and property due to re. The re investigations program provides the re student with a basic foundation in re science and law enforcement to actively seek a career in the eld of re investigations. NOTE: All courses in this program may be applied toward a Bachelor of Applied Studies or Bachelor of Individualized Studies degree at NMSU. This program does not certify the student as a re investigator, but promotes pro - fessional development to help reduce the loss of life and property from re. Students seeking re investigator certication should consult the various professional associations granting certication. Required Skills and Abilities Physical Abilities This program requires that the student be able to\u2014 lift, carry and balance up to 125 pounds (250 pounds with assistance) assume a variety of postural positions and be capable of physical ma- neuvers ranging from crawling, kneeling, squatting, twisting, turning, and bending, to climbing stairs and ladders) withstand varied environmental conditions such as extreme heat, cold, and moisture. Technology Competencies In an effort to assist students with adequate preparation for their coursework at DACC, technology competencies have been identied and established. These competencies are in effect for all courses taken in the Fire Investiga - tions program. Students must possess the following minimum competencies.

Instead, it focuses on theory, investigation, prevention, and management. Students wishing to enter the re service may benet from the general background provided and may receive F ireghter I certication through the New Mexico Fireghters Training Academy in Socorro, N.M. Every year, re and other emergencies take thousands of lives and destroy property worth billions of dollars. Fireghters help protect the public against these dangers. They are frequently the rst emergency personnel at the scene of a trafc accident or medical emergency and may be called upon to put out a re, treat injuries, or perform other vital functions. Fireghters work in a wide variety of settings, including urban and suburban areas, airports, chemical plants and other industrial sites, and such rural areas as wildlands and forests. When wildland res break out, crews of re - ghters are brought in to suppress the res with heavy equipment and hand tools. In addition, smoke jumpers parachute into inaccessible areas. Others who have been trained for the control, prevention, and cleanup of hazard-ous materials incidents work in hazardous materials units. Between alarms, reghters clean and maintain equipment, conduct prac - tice drills and re inspections, and participate in physical tness activities. They also prepare written reports on re incidents and review re science literature to keep abreast of technological developments and changing ad - ministrative practices and policies. Most re departments have a re prevention division, usually headed by a re marshal and staffed by re inspectors. Workers in this division conduct inspections of structures to prevent re and ensure re code compliance. These reghters also work with developers and planners to check and ap - prove plans for new buildings. Fire prevention personnel often speak on these subjects in schools and before public assemblies and civic organizations. Employment of reghters is expected to grow about as fast as the aver - age for all occupations, as re departments continue to compete with other public safety providers for funding. According to the United States Fire Ad - ministration, nearly 70 percent of re companies are staffed by volunteer reghters. Most job growth will occur as volunteer re-ghting positions are converted to paid positions. In addition to job growth, openings are ex - pected to result from the need to replace reghters who retire, stop work - ing for other reasons, or transfer to other occupations. Do\u00f1a Ana Community College provides training for reghting personnel through its Fire Science Technology program, which is accredited by the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress. This program provides classroom instruction leading to an associate of applied science degree in re science technology or a certicate of completion in reghting. It is suited to those who are new to the eld, as well as seasoned reghters: Career and volunteer reghters and NMSU student reghters will improve their job performance and prepare for higher level positions in the re protection elds. Students who wish to enter the eld of re protection will benet from the basic foundations provided in the technical courses as well as general education courses. NOTE: An articulation agreement exists with the New Mexico Fireghters Training Academy that makes it possible to receive college credit for experi - ence and IFSAC certication. All courses in this program may be applied toward a Bachelor of Applied Studies or Bachelor of Individualized Studies degree at NMSU.2013-2014 Catalog 61 Medical Clearances and Background Checks The basic reghter course requires the student to submit a medical clear - ance physical and a background check. NOTE: A criminal history may prohibit graduates from being hired or certi - ed by agencies. Students are encouraged to check with the prospective agency and identify that agency's specic requirements prior to enrolling in this program.

Every new home, hospital, university building, shopping mall, or ofce complex requires installation mechanics, service technicians, operating en - gineers, maintenance foremen, and trained crews to keep complex environ - mental systems operating efciently. The heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration industry is one of the coun - try's most stable. The supply of qualied, trained people has not kept pace with the demand, and new opportunities are constantly developing. The de - mand for trained HVACR graduates is also increasing due to Environmental Protection Agency requirements that refrigerants be handled by a certied technician. Technicians knowledgeable in heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration are also needed in defense, space exploration, and manufacturing. Because climate control is important wherever microprocessors are used in manu - facturing or scientic research, skilled technicians are in demand in these elds. Many experienced technicians own and manage their own busi - nesses. The Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration program at DACC uses training facilities equipped with the most modern test equip - ment and tools available. As a student, you will learn to\u2014 service, repair, and maintain heating, air conditioning, and refrigera-tion systems; read and interpret technical drawings, schematics, and symbols to di - agnose and troubleshoot problems in a system; evaluate, diagnose, and service various mechanical and electrical con-trols; apply the mathematics related to the heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration trade; handle customer relations, shop management procedures, and record keeping relative to the trade; properly use special tools and testing equipment; and become certied in Section 608, EPA certication. A unique cooperative training program is offered during the nal semester to provide students with eld experiences. Working side by side with jour - neymen technicians, students are offered an opportunity to practice and rene their new skills. After the rst semester, full-time heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration students must purchase a personal set of technician's tools (approximate cost, $850). The tool set includes the basic tools that most employers require on the job. Part-time students will purchase only those tools required by the specic course(s) in which they are enrolled. Students will also provide their own medical/accident insurance. They need to be in good physical condition and possess the ability and desire to work with their minds and hands. The curriculum is competency and performance based and uses multimedia classroom instruction and hands-on laboratory exercises. Classroom and laboratory hours are listed in the Schedule of Classes. All heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration students are eligible to join SkillsUSA. Membership provides students an opportunity to develop their leadership skills and to become procient in public speaking and parlia - mentary procedure. SkillsUSA also offers students a chance to demonstrate their occupational skills. Skill competitions are conducted each year in New Mexico for all postsecondary students. Whether taking classes or working on a job site, students enrolled in this program will be required to perform the same job duties and be able to meet the same physical requirements that they will as a graduate in the eld. Depending where they nd employment, graduates may be required to work in inclement weather, lift up to 50 pounds from the ground, have good eye-hand coordination, work safely around electrical hazards using the appropriate safety equipment, work safely using hand and power tools, ascend and descend stairs and ladders, and stand, squat, stoop, or kneel for long periods of time.

General studies are offered to students seeking employ - ment in connement facilities, institutional security, and other similar pro - grams. The student also is prepared to work in adult and juvenile correc - tional agencies at the local, state, and federal levels.Workers in the corrections eld are responsible for overseeing individuals who have been arrested and are awaiting trial or who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to serve time in a jail, reformatory, or penitentiary. The majority of ofcers are employed by local, county, state, and federal institutions. While the primary mission of corrections is protection of the public, many ofcers are involved in the treatment, education, and reintegration of of - fenders. These ofcers may nd employment as wardens, jail administrators, program coordinators and counselors, public information ofcers, correc-tional trainers, case managers, probation/parole ofcers, corrections of-cers, detention ofcers or other related careers.

Corrections/Law Enforcement with the Law Enforcement Option The Law Enforcement option emphasizes the law enforcement aspect of the criminal justice system. This degree offers the law enforcement student a general understanding of the police ofcer's multifaceted role in the United States. It also prepares the student with the basic foundations of police work for possible employment opportunities with local, state and federal govern - ments, and private industry. Most law enforcement ofcers are employed by the security industry and local, county, and state governments. They have duties that range from pro-viding security to controlling trafc to preventing and investigating crimes. They maintain order, enforce laws and ordinances, issue trafc summonses, investigate accidents, present evidence in court, serve legal documents for the court system, and apprehend, arrest and process prisoners. Career op - portunities include positions as private investigators, security ofcers, loss-prevention ofcers, police ofcers, sheriff and deputy ofcers, criminal investigators, game wardens, private detectives, and bailiffs. Many law enforcement agencies encourage the applicants to take postsec - ondary school training in law enforcement-related subjects. Many entry-level applicants for police jobs have completed some formal postsecondary educa - tion and a signicant number are college graduates. Knowledge of a foreign language is an asset in many federal agencies and urban departments. Additional information on professional requirements and qualications may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, at www.bls.gov.

The changing needs of information management in our society have sparked an increasing demand for the work of library and information specialists who can organize, man-age, and retrieve information from the vast storehouses that exist. While library and information centers retain their traditional study tables and shelves full of books, increasingly they are being transformed into com - puterized clearinghouses to accommodate the rapidly evolving information technology. Electronic catalogs, online databases, CD-ROM and DVD prod - ucts, the Internet and Web 2.0 tools provide almost unlimited access to the information people need for lifelong learning, and for both professional and recreational activities. Employment opportunities in libraries and throughout the rest of the informa - tion management eld are growing. Acquiring, organizing and preserving, and providing access to the vast wealth of materials that exist in increasingly automated environments are ongoing challenges. Those who have strong skills in these areas will nd themselves in great demand in the job market. Library Science Program graduates are prepared to work in a variety of set - tings and positions, including those found in public libraries and school or academic libraries. They may also choose from the wide spectrum of special library positions that are found in corporate, institutional, and government information centers.70 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College Additional information on career opportunities and salaries may be ob - tained from the Occupational Outlook Handbook, available online at http://www.bls.gov/oco.

Paralegals enjoy the intellectual challenge of assisting attorneys in nding legal solutions for their clients' problems. A precise description of the paralegal's role is found in the New Mexico Supreme Court's denition in the Rules Governing Paralegal Services (Rule 20-102A), which states that a paralegal is one who: 1 contracts with or is employed by an attorney, law rm, corporation, governmental agency or other entity; 2 performs substantive legal work under the supervision of a licensed attorney who assumes professional responsibility for the nal work product; and 3 meets one or more of the education, training or work experience qualications set forth in Rule 20-115 NMRA of these rules In these same Rules, the Court's examples of substantive legal work in-clude, \"case planning, development and management; legal research and analysis; interviewing clients; fact gathering and retrieving information; drafting legal documents; collecting, compiling, and utilizing technical information to make an independent decision and recommendation to the supervising attorney; and representing clients before a state or federal administrative agency if that representation is authorized by law\" (Rule 20-102B NMRA). The DACC Paralegal Studies program focuses on developing skills neces - sary to perform substantive legal work. Examples of courses leading to that end include Litigation, Legal Research and Writing, Legal Terminology, Virtual Law Ofce, Legal Ethics, and Torts. Through classroom instruction (including practical exercises and assignments), computer lab practice, and an internship/cooperative experience, students gain essential skills, as well as a broad background in many different areas of law. Graduates of the Paralegal Studies program are eligible to apply to take the national certication examination offered by the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA). Those who successfully complete this two-day exam are designated Certied Legal Assistants (CLA). The employment outlook for paralegals is good. Program graduates are employed with private rms, various courts, community legal services, state and federal governmental agencies (e.g., Human Services Depart - ments, public defenders, and district attorneys), as well as a variety of businesses.

Public health is an exciting area of practice which takes a population-based focus to health. Individuals in this eld interpret community data to determine health needs and intervention priorities. In addition to needs assessment, they work with community leaders to plan, implement, and evaluate com - munity health education interventions such as smoking cessation, chronic and infectious disease awareness campaigns, vaccination programs, and family planning and prenatal care initiatives. This program is ideal for those who like to work with the public, yet who also like to take the broader view of how to promote the health of communities and groups of citizens. The associate degree program fully articulates with the bachelor of com - munity health degree program offered at the main NMSU campus in the Department of Health Science, which also offers the master of public health in community health education at the graduate level.

Respiratory Therapy practitioners work side-by-side with physicians, and other healthcare professionals in the hospital setting. They set up oxygen, perform pulmonary function testing, set up and maintain ventilators, administer respira - tory drugs, and evaluate patient health status. Respiratory therapy is a rapidly growing, people-oriented profession. The demand for practitioners is increasing in New Mexico and throughout the United States. While most graduates continue to nd employment in hos - pitals, opportunities are opening up with medical equipment suppliers and agencies providing home health care to pulmonary patients. The Respiratory Therapy program at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College is a full-time program that leads to an associate of applied science degree. Through classroom instruction and laboratory practice, students develop the knowledge needed to care for patients. They acquire additional hands-on experience in the clinical setting at surrounding hospitals. The curriculum and clinical hour content is based on the National Standard Curriculum from the American Association of Respiratory Therapy (AARC) and the national accrediting body, the Commission on Accreditation for Re-spiratory Care (CoARC); www.coarc.com; 1228 Harwood 77 76021; telephone (817) 283-2835. The Respiratory Therapy Program is also accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care. The program is designed to prepare students to have mastered competency in assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the cardiopulmonary patient. Upon completion of the program graduates are eligible to sit for their national licensure certication and registry examinations. Required Skills and Abilities Students should be able to demonstrate good oral expression (speech clarity) and written comprehension, critical thinking skills, the ability to hear through a stethoscope or augmented listening device, and physical stamina (e.g., the ability to stand for long periods of time, manipulate respiratory therapy equip-ment, and move/lift patients and equipment up to 50 pounds, unassisted).

Graduates of this program have found work in New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, California, Vermont, New Hampshire, Iraq, and Puerto Rico. More than 400 graduates have begun careers in the water eld, working in such diverse areas as the semiconductor industry, the food pro - cessing industry, aerospace industry, electrical power industry, city water and wastewater departments, municipal or contract analytical laboratories, water reuse or recycling plants, metal plating companies, engineering con - sulting rms, and state planning ofces. While jobs are widely available, training programs like this one are rare. As the treatment of water becomes more technical, municipalities and indus - tries rely on training programs to ll their needs. Students in this program learn how to clean water to make it safe for drinking and how to purify water to a high quality for use in computer chip manufacturing, food pro - cessing, or steam generation. They will also learn how to treat wastewater so it can be safely returned to the environment or reclaimed for benecial use. Instruction also includes maintaining equipment such as pumps, mo - tors, valves, and chemical feeders; laboratory testing and analysis; water chemistry and microbiology; and some basics of supervising and managing a water utility, including budgets, preventive maintenance schemes, and billing. Various course assignments requiring laboratory data sheets, simple process control spreadsheets, and term papers enable students to sharpen their computer and writing skills. General studies in basic algebra, applied math, water chemistry and microbiology, speech, and technical writing round out the curriculum. Whether taking classes or working on a job site, students enrolled in this program will be required to perform the same job duties and be able to meet the same physical requirements that they will as graduates in the eld. De-pending where they nd employment, graduates may be required to work in inclement weather, lift up to 50 pounds from the ground, work safely around hazardous chemicals using appropriate safety equipment such as a self-contained breathing apparatus, work safely in conned spaces, ascend and descend stairs and ladders to reach equipment, work safely around heavy equipment, work safely and effectively on uneven surfaces, and stand for long periods of time on concrete floors. Some positions in the eld re-quire certication and the licensing agency may not provide special testing accommodations. Opportunities for students to gain new knowledge and skills in operations, maintenance, and laboratory areas are provided through classroom train-ing, hands-on laboratories, eld trips, guest lectures, and training on the program's own water and wastewater plants. Before graduating, students will spend a minimum of 180 hours at a coop- erative education site with a municipality or industry. Students have found co-ops at water and wastewater plants in Albuquerque, El Paso, Las Cruces, Socorro, Hobbs, Silver City, Mesilla, and Glorieta, and with industries such as Intel and Kurita America. Financial aid beyond loans, grants, work-study monies, and DACC schol - arships include ve private scholarships specically for Water Technology students: 1) Max Summerlot Memorial Scholarship, given to a water tech-nology student in his or her second year in the program; 2) Cynthia Hiers-Robinson Curent-Use Scholarship; 3) Jake Hands Memorial Scholarship; and 4) two scholarships presented by the New Mexico Water and Waste - water Association.

They are needed in energy exploration and production and are required in virtually every eld or industry that uses parts made of metal. Simply stated, welders are people who join metals such as steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, brass, bronze, copper, and nickel. Welding pro-cesses vary depending on the application. Extremely delicate and precise items, such as aerospace components and jewelry, may be welded using electron beams, lasers, and plasma, while huge structures for buildings and bridges are typically welded using submerged arc and flux core. Welding may take place in almost any setting: in a laboratory, out-of-doors, or even underwater, as in the case of offshore, oil-and-gas platform construction.According to the US Department of Labor, job prospects for welders are ex - cellent, with projected job growth in New Mexico estimated at 25.5 percent over the next six years, and 5 percent nationally through 2014, translating to 264,000 additional jobs. Increases in welder wages have kept pace with or exceeded those of other occupations since 2002. The DACC Welding Technology program is nationally accredited by the American Welding Society (AWS), and is taught by nationally qualied in - structors. Together, DACC welding instructors have more than 100 years of experience and more than 90 AWS/ASME national welder certications on ve welding processes. The program is competency and performance based, consisting of lectures and hands-on laboratory exercises. Students learn to weld steels, stainless steels, and aluminum alloy plate and pipe with ve welding processes. They also learn basic fabrication skills, oxy-fuel cutting, plasma cutting, and air-carbon arc cutting. The DACC Welding Technology Program is one of a handful of programs, nationwide, that has an orbital TIG unit that al - lows students to join tubing as small as one-quarter inch in diameter. Stu - dents are also exposed to heat treating of steel and its effects with the heat treat oven. Students are eligible to join SkillsUSA, an organization for high school and postsecondary students that promotes leadership and sponsors skills and leadership competitions at the state and national levels. In addition, stu-dents may become members of the American Welding Society (AWS) and participate in the activities of the new AWS El Paso Section. All students who complete the certicate or associate degree will graduate as certied welders in one or more welding processes on steel, stainless steel, and/or aluminum. (It is important to note that, although some local welding jobs may not currently require certication, nearly all welding jobs nationwide do require it.) Since the technical requirements for the certicate are the same as those for the associate degree, a student may complete the certicate program rst and then later apply all the credits earned in the certicate program toward the associate degree. This associate degree then may be applied in its entirety toward the bachelor of applied studies degree offered by NMSU. Alternatively, those planning to teach at the secondary level may apply up to 36 credits earned in the Welding Technology associate degree program toward a bachelor of science degree in Agricultural and Extension Education. To enter the Welding Technology program, a high school diploma or GED is required, along with good overall health, eyesight, and hand-eye coordina-tion. Students must purchase tools and personal safety equipment, usually costing about $1000. Whether taking classes or working on a job site, students enrolled in this program will be required to perform the same job duties and meet the same physical requirements that they will as a graduate in the eld. These require - ments include the ability to achieve performance qualications using a va - riety or processes while welding materials in different positions. Depending where they nd employment, graduates may be required to work in extreme temperatures, to lift and safely move 50 pounds, to have good eye-hand co - ordination, to work safely around compressed gasses and electrical equip - ment, to ascend and descend ladders, to work safely in conned spaces and awkward welding positions, and to tolerate a noisy working environment. Additional Graduation Requirements To receive either an associate degree or a certicate of completion, students are required to obtain a Career Readiness Certicate in the areas of Applied Math, Reading for Information, and Locating Information at the appropriate level for their respective degree option.

Dissent plays a vital part in the role of higher education. However, freedoms cannot be protected or exercised in an institution that lacks order and stability. Students enrolled at New Mexico State University, as well as at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College, have an obligation to uphold the laws of the larger community of which they are a part. The intent of this Code is to ensure that students of the New Mexico State University system neither lose their rights nor escape the responsibility of citizenship. While the activities covered by the laws of the larger community and those covered by NMSU's rules may overlap, it is important to note that the community's laws and NMSU's rules operate independently and therefore do not substitute for each other. NMSU-DACC may pursue enforcement of its own rules whether or not legal proceedings are underway or in prospect, and may use information from third party sources (such as law enforcement agencies and the courts) to determine whether NMSU rules have been broken. Membership in the NMSU-DACC community does not exempt anyone from local, state or federal laws, but rather imposes the additional obligation to abide by all of NMSU's regulations. It is the personal responsibility of every member of the campus community not only to protect his/her own rights, but to respect the rights of others, and to behave in a man - ner conducive to learning and/or living in an educational environment. Just as individuals within the community have a responsibility to adhere to a code of prescribed behavior, the institution assumes the obligation of clearly codifying and fairly enforcing the same. New Mexico State University upholds the belief that those who do not conform to established standards set forth in this Code of Conduct must be held accountable for their actions. Therefore, the purpose of the Code of Conduct is to inform the student body of the rules and regulations that are essential to the normal operation of the university system. 1.2 Denition of Student\u2014For the purpose of application of this Code of Conduct, \"student\" means any person enrolled in the New Mexico State University sys - tem and any person who resides in New Mexico State University on-campus housing facilities. Persons who are not ofcially enrolled for a particular term but who have a continuing relationship with NMSU-DACC are considered \"students.\" Students who violate the Code of Conduct can expect prompt and deliberate adjudication, whether or not they choose to be present, or remain at NMSU-DACC. Furthermore, if a decision has been made within the disciplin-ary process which impacts a person who is not currently enrolled, he/she still remains subject to the determination upon re-enrollment. 1.3 Student/Student Organization Rights and Responsibilities\u2014By enrolling at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College, a student accepts responsibility for compli-ance with all local, state and federal laws, and university regulations, while retaining the rights guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States. A student or student organization alleged to have engaged in any misconduct shall have the right of due process and appeal as delineated in this Code, and it is each student's/student organization's responsibility to represent themselves in this educational administrative process. This is not a criminal process, and NMSU-DACC is not bound by the rules of evidence normally used in cases brought before the State or Federal judicial systems. The standard of proof will be \"preponderance\" not \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" NMSU and DACC expect all students to show respect for the rights of others and for authority, to protect private and public property, to execute contractual obligations, and to take responsibility for their own actions and the actions of their guests. 1.4 Student Organizations\u2014A student organization, its ofcers, and its members may beheld collectively and individually responsible when violations of this Code, by those associated with the organization, occur and such violations are authorized, encouraged, directed, tolerated, supported by, or committed on behalf of the organization. 1.5 Programs with Special Admissions Requirements. (Dental Assistant, Dental Hygiene, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, EMS/Paramedic, Health Care As - sistant, Nursing, Radiologic Technology, and Respiratory Care)\u2014Students who have selected a program with special admissions requirements may be subject to background checks and additional regulations not included in the general regulations set forth in this Handbook. Such students should consult the handbook of their particular program.122 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College 2 ADMINIST r ATION OF DISCIPLINE The responsibility of administering the discipline system is delegated by the Presi - dent of Do\u00f1a Ana Community College to the Vice-President for Student Services for nonacademic discipline and to the Vice-President for Academic Affairs for academic discipline. In turn, these individuals may delegate authority to other groups or individuals for handling violations of the Student Code of Conduct. All activities shall be monitored by a central administrative authority to ensure fairness and consistency. All discipline sanctions imposed campus-wide will be reported to the Vice-President for Student Services for record-keeping purposes. Do\u00f1a Ana Community College attempts to handle discipline matters at the lowest possible level by recognizing a variety of Hearing Officers. Each Hearing Officer is a DACC Official who is an administrator, faculty member, or staff member such as a Department Chairperson or Professional Staff Member. Hearing Officers adjudicate cases when violations are alleged. The Hearing Officer is authorized to exercise active control over the proceedings in order to elicit relevant information, to avoid needless consumption of time, and to prevent the harassment or intimidation of witnesses. Disciplinary regulations at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College are set forth in writing in order to give students general notice of prohibited conduct. These rules and regula - tions should be read broadly and are not designed to define prohibited conduct in exhausti ve terms. It is recognized by New Mexico State University and Do\u00f1a Ana Community College that students are adults and are expected to obey the law and take personal responsibility for their conduct. A student is therefore subject to two sources of authority, civil/criminal authority and NMSU-DACC authority. Violation of any municipal ordinance, law or regulation of the State of New Mexico, or law or regulation of the United States which may cause harm or endangerment to self or others, or somehow compromises the educational mission of the College or Uni - versity, may result in disciplinary action. The College/University does not normally take disciplinary action for off-campus violations, but it retains the right to act in special cases. Disciplinary action imposed by NMSU-DACC may precede, and be in addition to, any penalty that might be imposed by an off-campus authority. When accused of a violation, the student has the right to review the evidence against him or her, but this does not necessarily mean the right to confront a witness. At - torneys will not be allowed to attend or participate in hearings. The procedures to be followed in matters of academic and nonacademic misconduct differ and are outlined in the following sections. In exceptional cases of academic misconduct, the \"Procedures for Dealing with Cases which May Result in Expulsion or Degree Revocation\" will be followed instead, and may be found in the Adminis-trative Policy and Procedures Manual, or may be obtained in the Office of the Vice President for Student Services. 3 A CADEMIC MISCONDUCT 3.1 P ersons and/or groups involved in Academic Discipline Cases 3.1.1 V ice-President for Academic Affairs\u2014When an academic violation oc - curs, the Vice President for Academic Affairs (or a designee) will dispose of any violations referred or appealed to the Dean' s Office. 3.1.2 Academic Appeals Board\u2014A student appeals board shall be established for each academic year as a standing committee consisting of three (3) fac - ulty members and two (2) students to be appointed by the Vice-President for Academic Affairs. In some cases, the Vice-President for Academic Affairs may convene the Academic Appeals Board and solicit its recommendation. 3.1.3 T he decision of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs is final and will be reported to all parties concerned within three (3) working days under the general process. 3.2 Academic Misconduct \u2014Any student found guilty of academic misconduct shall be subject to disciplinary action. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, the following actions: 3.2.1 Cheating or kno wingly assisting another student in committing an act of cheating or other forms of academic dishonesty;3.2.2 Plagiarism, w hich is using another person's work without acknowledg - ment and making it appear to be one's own. Any ideas, words, pictures, or other sour ce material must be acknowledged in a citation that gives credit to the source. This is true even if the source be another student's work, unpublished documents, oral statements, or the Internet. Intentional and unintentional instances of plagiarism are considered instances of academic misconduct. It is the responsibility of the student submitting the work in question to know, understand, and comply with this policy.

Drug-Free Workplace, Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, and Drug-Free Workforce r ules STANDA rD S OF CONDUCT. Students of New Mexico State University and Do\u00f1a Ana Community College are considered a valuable asset, and their health and welfare are of serious concern. The University strives to maintain a safe and productive environ- ment free from the influence of illicit drugs and unlawful use of alcohol. As a recipient of feder al funds, the University is obligated to inform all students that the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol on its property or as part of any of its activities is prohibited, and is a violation of University policy. University property is defined as all lands and buildings under the control of the Board of Regents, New Mexico State University. Students who violate this prohibition will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment or expulsion from school. It is also a federal requirement and a University policy that, as a condition of employment, any student will notify his or her immediate supervisor within five (5) days after conviction of a criminal drug offense occurring in the workplace. hEALTh rISkS. Information outlining the risk of physical and/or psychological de - pendence on controlled substances and the effects of use, overdose, and withdrawal is a vailable online at www.drugabuse.gov, and from the Office of the Vice President for Student Services, Las Cruces Central Campus, rm. DAMA115. NMSU-DACC is required to inform students concerning these health risks. Alcohol is also a drug, and students need to be aware of the health risks involved in using alcohol. In large doses, alcohol can dull sensation and impair muscular coordination, memory and judgment. Taken in large quantities over a long period of time, alcohol can damage the liver and heart and can cause permanent brain damage. Dependence on alcohol can be psychological when the drinker uses alcohol to escape from stress. A pattern of repeated heavy drinking produces a condition in which the body needs alcohol to function, and can lead to physical dependence. 2013-2014 Student Handbook 127 EDUCATIONAL P rOGrAMS. NMSU-DACC actively encourages students to learn about the ph ysiological, psychological, social, and legal implications of alcohol and drug use and abuse. To facilitate the students' educational process, the University WAVE (Wellness, Alcohol, and Violence Education) program offers to students programs con - cerning these issues that are delivered to classes and student groups across campus as well as through weekly outreac h events. WAVE and the Student Health Center jointly sponsor National Alcohol Screening Day. Additionally WAVE frequently advertises in the Round Up and provides information for articles that are published through cam - pus media. WAVE and the Counseling Center also provide the BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening and Interv ention for College Students) program that assists individuals in examining their use, decisions, and consequences surrounding alcohol. A similar but abbreviated tool called E-CHUG is available on the WAVE website. WAVE is always interested in providing information across campus and can be reached at 646-2813. To ensure that students receive the best help and information, involved personnel are encouraged to participate in seminars, workshops, and conferences to learn the latest approaches to drug education and the newest information available regarding alcohol/drug use and abuse. Recognizing that the social environment changes rapidly, the University invites students to offer suggestions pertaining to their needs in the area of drug and alcohol education to the WAVE program coordinator. Discipline and Law Enforcement NMSU-DACC recognizes that many behaviors are restricted by state and federal laws. The basic premise of University discipline is to provide regulations for students in keeping with the laws of the State of New Mexico and the United States of America, as well as to maintain an environment maximally conducive to education. While the University does not normally take disciplinary action for off-campus violations, it retains the right to act in special cases. With reference to drug violations, an individual apprehended for drug abuse off-campus is subject to civil proceedings and is not usually addressed through the University discipline system unless the off-campus actions impact the campus com - munity. As a property owner, the University has the right to prohibit behaviors on that property that ma y not be restricted in other environments. This is especially relevant for housing regulations. Students who reside on University property, by doing so, consent to University housing regulations. As long as they reside in University housing, they are subject to University discipline. A. Amnesty . Any student drug user who, prior to apprehension, voluntarily directs a request for rehabilitation to any University official, including the University Police, will be referred to the proper rehabilitation agency or medical authorities. The case will be kept strictly confidential, and no disciplinary or criminal action will be taken as long as the student upholds the agreement for rehabilitation and refrains from any other possession or use of illegal substances on-campus. B. P enalties for Drug Violation 1. F irst offense for usage, possession, or accessory to a drug violation. a. If found guilty , or guilt is admitted (not relating to amnesty as defined above) for a violation of a law of the State of New Mexico or University regulation relating to one ounce or less of marijuana, the penalty may be as much as disciplinary probation or suspension. b. If found guilty, or guilt is admitted (not relating to amnesty as defined above) for violation of a law of the State of New Mexico or University regulation relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana (over one ounce), depres- sants, or other illegal drugs, the penalty may be as much as disciplinary suspension, dismissal, or expulsion. 2. If guilt is pro ven or admitted for selling, processing, delivering, compound - ing, or dispensing in any manner marijuana or any other dangerous narcotic, depressant, stimulant or hallucinogenic drugs, the student will be subject to penalties up to and including expulsion on the first offense. 3. A student w ho admits guilt, or is found guilty of a second drug offense, may be subject to penalties up to and including expulsion. 4. An y student who has been suspended or dismissed for drug violations, and has evidence of successful rehabilitation, may petition for readmission to the University upon recommendation from relevant psychological or psychiatric professionals. C. Exclusion from Campus. Students suspended, dismissed or expelled from the University for drug violations, or those convicted of drug violations off-campus who persist in returning onto campus, will be subject to such legal procedures as deemed necessary to bar such entry, when probable cause of further violations of University regulations can be shown.Firearms Policy It is unlawful and against university policy for anyone to carry a firearm on university premises except for: (1) a peace officer; (2) university security personnel; (3) student, instructor or other university -authorized personnel who are engaged in army, navy, marine corps or air force reserve officer training corps programs or a state-authorized hunter safety training program; (4) a person conducting or participating in a university-approved program, class or other activity involving the carrying of a firearm; or (5) a person older than nineteen years of age on university premises in a private automobile or other private means of conveyance, for lawful protection of the person's or another's person or property. As used in this policy, university premises means: (a) the buildings and grounds of a university, including playing fields and parking areas of a university, in or on which university or university -related activities are conducted; or (b) any other public buildings or grounds, including playing fields and parking areas that are not university property, in or on which university-related and sanctioned activities are performed. Whoever commits unlawful carrying of a firearm on university premises is guilty of a petty misdemeanor and may be subject to disciplinary action as appropriate. Prohibition of hazing and hostile Misconduct The University promotes a safe environment where students, faculty, staff and visitors may reside on campus, participate in university-sponsored activities and be members of organizations recognized by NMSU-DACC without compromising health, safety, or wellness. It is therefore the University's policy to prohibit any act or omission which constitutes hazing, bullying or other hostile misconduct, as well as retaliation against persons who report misconduct pursuant to this policy. In the event an allegation of hazing, bullying, hostile misconduct or retaliation is substantiated after objective investigation, appropriate corrective or disciplinary action will be taken to ensure that the offensive behavior does not recur. A. \"Hazing\" is an act committed by one or more individuals, on or off campus, where the following apply: 1. T he act was committed in connection with student or employee status or in connection with an initiation into, an affiliation with, or the maintenance of membership in, any organization. For the purpose of this policy, \"orga - nization\" means an intercollegiate or intramural athletic team; chartered student organization; or other association, order, society, corps, cooperative, club, department, unit, division or similar group that is officially affiliated with the University and whose membership consists primarily of enrolled students or employees of the University; and 2. T he act creates unreasonable risk of emotional or physical harm, or causes actual physical harm, mental duress or degradation, or interferes with a person's academic endeavors or progress, or work environment. B . \"Bullying\" is an act or omission that intimidates or mistreats a person, typically a person per ceived to be weak or vulnerable. C. \"Hostile Misconduct\" is an act or failure to act, w hich is sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent so as to interfere with or limit a person's ability to participate in academic opportunities or activities, or to work productively in the workplace. The hostile misconduct prohibited by this policy need not be based on any protected class, which is similarly prohibited by the University's anti-discrimination policies. D . Retaliation for purposes of this polic y is retribution in any form against a person who has in good faith: (a) opposed the misconduct prohibited by this policy; (b) filed a complaint of hazing, bullying or other hostile misconduct with their supervisor, the Office of Human Resource Services department or other appropri - ate office with jurisdiction; (c) assisted with or participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing related to enfor cement of this policy. Retaliation in and of itself, if substantiated by investigation, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. E. An act of hazing, bullying or other hostile misconduct ma y also constitute il - legal discrimination if it is based upon age, ancestry, color, mental or physical disability , gender, genetics, serious medical condition, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, spousal affiliation, or veteran status. In this event, it shall be reported to the Office of Institutional Equity for action under the University's anti-discrimination policies, which also prohibit retaliation. F . An act of hazing, bullying or other hostility ma y also constitute a hate crime under the laws of New Mexico, and shall be reported to the NMSU Police Department for potential criminal investigation and prosecution.128 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College G. It is a violation of this polic y even if the recipient of the misconduct consented to or acquiesced in the hazing, bullying or other hostile act or omission. H. Examples of hazing, bullying and other hostile misconduct ma y include, and are not limited to: 1. V erbal acts and name calling; graphic and written statements, which may include the use of cell phones or the internet; 2. T hreats of, or actual harm or humiliation; 3. Ph ysical abuse, such as whipping, beating, branding, pushing, shoving, or tackling, use of physical restraints, etc; 4. F orced physical activity, such as consumption of food, liquor or drugs, or sleep deprivation; 5. T heft and/or destruction of property under any circumstance; 6. Yelling, screaming, or calling members (prospective or actual) demeaning names, or restricting normal routine social interaction; 7. Engaging in beha vior that a reasonable, similarly situated, person would consider humiliating and or degrading to others; 8. F orcing, requiring or endorsing new members to violate university policies, organization/association bylaws, team rules and/or any local, state, or federal law. I. T his policy is not intended to prohibit the following conduct: 1. Customary public athletic ev ents, contests or competitions as sponsored by the University; 2. Acti vity or conduct that furthers the goals of NMSU educational curriculum, extracurricular program, military training program, or other official university function or program. J. Prev ention of hazing, bullying, hostile misconduct and retaliation is the re - sponsibility of every member of the university community. Each organization, association, athletic team, department, unit, di vision, as well as each individual, has the obligation to report incidents that are believed to be associated with hazing, bullying, hostile misconduct, or retaliation to the DACC Vice President for Student Services, the NMSU Office of Student Judicial Services, the NMSU Office of Institutional Equity, the NMSU Police Department, or other university supervisor or official independent from the offensive conduct. K. All alleged incidents of hazing, bullying and other non-discriminatory hostile misconduct or retaliation addressed b y this policy will be taken seriously, shall be investigated and when warranted, corrective or disciplinary action will be taken. 1. An objecti ve, confidential investigation will be conducted by the supervi - sor, in consultation with the Office of Human Resource Services, into each complaint recei ved. 2. T he actions or omissions subject of a complaint and substantiated by in - vestigation will be assessed based on the totality of the circumstances, and wi ll involve making a determination whether the alleged hostile misconduct was sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent such that a similarly situated reasonable person would be significantly and adversely impacted in his or her ability to benefit from the educational or work opportunities provided by the institution. 3. Substantiated violations will result in administr ative, civil and/or criminal sanctions to the offending employee, student or student organization. 4. One or more of the follo wing offices or processes may be involved in afford - ing relief to the person who has experienced the hazing, bullying, hostile misconduct or retaliation: the Emplo yee Assistance Program, Counseling Center, Employee Health Services, Student Health Center, the Office of Stu-dent Judicial Services, the administrative review process of the Department of Campus Activities, the Social Misconduct Review Board of the Department of Athletics, the Office of Housing and Residential Life, the appropriate supervisor in coordination with the Office of Human Resource Services in accordance with the applicable NMSU grievance and/or disciplinary process, as well as through the appropriate local, state, and/or federal law enforcement agencies. Mental health Policy The staff and faculty of NMSU-DACC are concerned about the health and well-being of students. Occasionally, students are confronted by illnesses that interfere with their academic progress. In such situations, withdrawal from NMSU-DACC may be in the best interest of all concerned. Guidelines for the administration of psychiatric withdraw - als under the Mental Health Policy are available in the office of the Vice President for Student Services, Las Cruces Centr al Campus, rm. DAMA-115. Campus Access \u2014 Prohibited and restricted rESTrICTED ACCESS P OLIC y: In order to establish an appropriate environment and preserve university property for educational purposes, the University reserves the right to restrict access to some of its lands and facilities. Academic spaces are generally used for educational purposes only, and buildings which serve as residences for students are restricted to students, their guests, and appropriate university employees. While some other university facilities and grounds are available to the general public, activities must be scheduled and authorized, and facilities/grounds must be used according to university rules and regulations. No individual(s), except for those contracted to reside on campus, shall temporarily or permanently remain overnight on the property of the Board of Regents, or dwell on the property of the board, including but not limited to, in motor vehicles, or in temporary or permanent structures, without the specific prior approval of the vice president for student services (or designee). Members of the campus community, as well as visitors, are expected to behave in ways that do not interfere with the rights of others to pursue an education and/or do not disrupt community living on campus. Behaviors of any individuals that interfere with, disrupt, impair, or obstruct the processes, procedures, or functions of the University are prohibited. Failure to comply with this policy could subject the individual to warning, probation, and removal from the campus, arrest, barring from the campus, or any other sanctions applicable under the Student Code of Conduct, university personnel policies, or state or federal laws. Actions taken under this policy will be initiated by the vice president for student services (or designee). Contested administrative actions may be appealed in writing to the president of Do\u00f1a Ana Community College within 3 working days after receipt of the decision made by the appropriate administrative officer. The decision of the president of the community college is final. Pr O h IBITED ACCESS P OLIC y: The following individuals may be prohibited from entering upon land or buildings owned or used by the board, its colleges, departments, community colleges, experiment stations, ranches, and all property owned or occupied by agencies supervised by the board: Persons charged with criminal acts against the board or students or employees during the pendency of such criminal charges. Persons found guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction of criminal acts against the board or students or employees. Any individual whose presence on the campus constitutes a clear and present danger to the persons, property, or peace of the board, or students, employees, or agents (contractors). Any individual whose presence on campus, given all attendant circumstances, could reasonably cause injury against the persons or property of the board or students or employees. Any student ordered withdrawn under the Medical/Psychiatric Withdrawal Policy (available in the Office of the Vice President for Student Services). In order to be prohibited from use of university lands and buildings, individuals must be notified in writing of the prohibition by the vice president for student services (or designee). Notice may be made personally or by certified mail. Individuals so notified shall be immediately barred subject to the right to request a hearing within 3 days of the service of the notification or within 6 days of the date of mailing the certified letter. Extension of time will be given to the next business day for any day that occurs on a weekend or a holiday as established by the University. Appeals shall be made by giving written notice to the Office of the president of Do\u00f1a Ana Community College of intent to appeal. Hearing on the appeal shall be within 7 days from the receipt of the notice of appeal. Neither the individual prohibited nor the NMSU/DACC shall be represented at the hearing by legal counsel. The hearing need not conform to the strict rules of legal evidence. In the event that the president of the community college reverses the prohibition, the individual shall be immediately entitled to enter upon university land or property. In the event that the president of the community college affirms the decision, the individual's prohibition shall continue. The decision of the president of Do\u00f1a Ana Community College is final. Under most circumstances, prohibitions under this policy will be for one year or less. When the prohibition is indefinite, the affected individual may petition for the removal of the prohibition after one calendar year by submitting a written request to the vice president for student services. With respect to individuals convicted of criminal acts against the University, its students, or employees, the one year shall commence at the time the individual is released from incarceration resulting from the conviction. Any violation of such prohibition may result in legal action by the board against the individual, including such criminal charges as may be appropriate under the circum - stances, including criminal trespass.2013-2014 Student Handbook 129 VA CATING U NIVE r SIT y B UILDINGS O r Pr OPE rT y. The University recognizes the importance of providing a venue where members of the community can freely and openly express their ideas. However, if an individual(s) and/or organization improp - erly or illegally occupies university buildings or property, the following statement will be read: \"You are violating university regulations and/or state laws concerning improper occupation of buildings or property. If you leave within the next 10 minutes, no further action will be taken. If you do not leave within 10 minutes, you may be arrested. If you are a student, you may also be subject to disciplinary action as outlined in the Student Code of Conduct.\" In the event a crime (other than the peaceful but illegal occupation of a building or property) has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur, action may be taken without regard to the above statement by the appropriate university officials in order to protect the safety, lives, and property of the university community. Sexual Misconduct Policy NMSU-DACC will not tolerate sexual misconduct of any kind as defined herein: Forced Sexual Contact\u2014Any harmful, insulting or non-consensual verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature with another person (including touching, fondling, exposure, disrobing, etc.) that is accomplished toward another without his/her consent including any such act accomplished by means of actual or implied force, threat, coercion, or helplessness. Forcing or intimidating a person to touch another's intimate parts shall also constitute sexual contact. Forced Sexual Penetration\u2014Intercourse (vaginal contact); or penetration with any object (including a finger), b y the use of force, threats, coercion, or by taking advantage of a victim's helplessness. A student charged with sexual misconduct, including acquaintance or date rape, can be prosecuted under New Mexico criminal statutes and disciplined under the Student Code of Conduct. Even if the law enforcement authorities choose not to prosecute, the University can pursue disciplinary action. A violation occurs when there is participation in any kind of sexual misconduct by a student individually or in concert with others. Since NMSU-DACC hopes to educate students in order to prevent violations, students should understand that: A. F orced sexual penetration or other unwanted forced sexual contact is defined as sexual misconduct whether the assailant is a stranger or an acquaintance of the victim. B . Alcohol and/or drug use, intoxication, or an y impairment of the accused, does not absolve responsibility for sexual misconduct. C. In situations w here the victim is incapable of giving consent, or is unable to resist sexual advances due to alcohol/drug use or other impairments, the ac - cused will be held responsible for sexual misconduct. D . F orce or coercion is defined as: 1 the use of ph ysical force or physical violence; or 2. the use of threats, including but not limited to physical threats, abduction, extortion or retaliation directed against the victim or another when the victim believes that there is an ability to execute such threats; or 3. the use of v erbal comments or nonverbal behaviors/gestures to intimidate the victim or another when the victim believes that there is a present ability to execute such threats. E. T hreat is defined as an expression of intention to hurt, destroy, or punish the victim or another. Where there is cause to believe that NMSU-DACC regulations prohibiting sexual misconduct have been violated, the University will initiate disciplinary action. Accusa - tions of sexual misconduct will be investigated by the vice president for student services according to the Code of Conduct. If evidence is a vailable to indicate that a student is guilty of sexual misconduct, or if guilt is admitted, the penalty for such misconduct may be as much as disciplinary suspension, dismissal or expulsion. Special Grievance Policies Student Academic Grievance Policy Procedure for Initiating Grievance Complaints: This procedure has been established to provide a method to resolve undergraduate student grievances at the lowest ad - ministrative level in a fair and expeditious manner. For the purpose of this procedure, griev ances are limited to alleged violations of university policy or procedures by NMSU-DACC or its employees, disputes with faculty and/or alleged unfair treatment. Usually this method is used to appeal a grade the student feels was not justified. Under no condition should these policies be used when the student has allegedly violated the University Code of Conduct or a contractual agreement, and at no hearing should either party have a lawyer. Any student who believes that he/she has been unjustly treated within the academic process may proceed as far as necessary in the steps detailed below. Should the alleged grievance not involve a faculty member or course, a student is to appeal directly to the department chair/program director or division dean in whose area the alleged grievance occurred. 1. Appeal to the faculty member . The student is to submit a written appeal to the faculty member within 30 days after the start of the grading period following the grading period in which the alleged grievance occurred. If the alleged grievance occurs during a summer grading period, the student is to submit an appeal no later than 30 days into the fall grading period following the summer grading period in which the alleged grievance occurred. The faculty member and the student are to discuss the problem. The faculty member will submit a written report outlining his or her decision to the student and division dean within ten working days of receipt of the student's written appeal. 2. Appeal to the department c hair or program director. If a decision satisfactory to the student cannot be reached, the student may submit a written appeal to the department chair/program director in which the course in question was taught. This is to be done within ten days of the receipt of the faculty member's written decision. The faculty member, the department chair/program director, and the student are to meet to discuss the problem. The department chair/program director will send a written response outlining his or her decision to the student and faculty member within ten days of this meeting. 3. Appeal to the division dean. If a satisfactory decision cannot be reached among the department chair/program director, the faculty member, and the student, the student or the faculty member may submit a written statement of appeal to the division dean. This is to be done within ten working days after the receipt of the written decision by the department chair/program director. The division dean may request a written recommendation from the College Academic Appeals Board. Should this be the case, the College Academic Appeals Board will conduct a hearing with the student and faculty member (not necessarily at the same time) to review the merits of the appeal. They may also ask for supporting evidence for or against the decision of the department chair/program director within five working days following the conclusion of their review process. The division dean may meet with the student, faculty member, and department chair/program director to discuss the appeal (not necessarily at the same time). The division dean will submit a written response outlining his or her decision to the student, faculty member, department chair/program director, and Vice President for Academic Affairs within ten days of the last meeting. 4. Appeals to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. The Vice President for Academic Affairs may, at his or her discretion, review the appeal upon the written request of the student or faculty member and render a final decision. An appeal to the Vice President for Academic Affairs is the last step in the appeals process, and the decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs cannot be appealed further. Should the Vice President for Academic Affairs not choose to review the appeal, the decision of the division dean is final. 5. Exceptions to the time inv olved. The division dean may waive the normal time frame for appeals for compelling reasons. Regardless of circumstances, academic appeals must be initiated with the course instructor within two years of the conclusion of the grading period in which the course was taken. 6. Enr ollment. A student need not be enrolled at NMSU-DACC to initiate an ap - peal. College Academic Appeals Board. The College Academic Appeals Board will be ap - pointed by the Vice President for Academic Affairs to hear student appeals. The appeals board will consist of three faculty members and tw o students. Maintenance of records. Instructors and/or departments shall keep records used to compute individual grades for two years after the completion of a course. If a grade has been appealed, these records shall be kept for at least two years after completion of the appeal. Academic divisions or departments may require that records be kept for longer periods. Student Nonacademic Grievance Policy Any student who believes that he/she has been treated unjustly in a nonacademic area, not involving a contractual agreement, can file a grievance as long as the Code of Con - duct has not been violated. The purpose of this policy is to allow the parties to resolve 130 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College grievances at the lowest administrative level in a fair and expeditious manner without the involvement of lawyers. A grievance must be filed no later than thirty (30) days following the time the alleged problem occurred. Failure of NMSU-DACC personnel to respond within ten (10) days, at any level in the procedure, will allow the student to proceed to the next step. The channel of appeal for nonacademic grievances shall be: 1. T he aggrieved student must first confer with the staff member involved in an attempt to resolve the problem. 2. Unresolved grievances shall be filed in writing by the student with the appropriate supervisor. The supervisor will conduct an inquiry and attempt to resolve the matter impartially and as quickly as possible. This step must be concluded within ten (10) days of the date the grievance was received. 3. If the griev ance is not resolved at Step 2, the student may forward a copy of the grievance and all relevant correspondence to the appropriate campus officer. The campus officer (or his/her designee) will conduct an investigation and attempt to resolve the issue. This process shall be concluded within ten (10) days of the date the grievance was received. 4 . If the issue is not resolved in Step 3, the student may appeal to the President of DACC. If warranted, the President will appoint a hearing panel consisting of a student, a faculty member, and a staff person from academic units not involved in the griev- ance. If a hearing panel is appointed, the parties involved in the grievance will be allo wed to submit written documentation concerning the problem, may be present at all hearing sessions, and will be given the opportunity to provide additional oral information on their behalf. Upon completion of the hearing(s), the panel will forward a written recommenda - tion to the President or his/her designee. This document should include findings of fact and the basis for the recommendation. The decision of the President or his/her designee is final. Grievance Procedures for Students with Disabilities Procedures are in place to provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. For further information, contact the NMSU Office of Institutional Equity Director, O'Loughlin House, telephone (575) 646-3635, TTY (575) 646-7802. Student Special Care Policy To ensure the safety and well-being of our students, NMSU-DACC may, on occasion, require that students receive a particular type of care or treatment (e.g., emergency medical attention, live-in attendants, or vaccinations) as a condition of continued enrollment or eligibility to reside in university-operated housing. When this care or treatment is required by the cognizant NMSU-DACC administrator, the student will be obligated to assume any financial responsibility associated with the treatment. Furthermore, NMSU-DACC may, on occasion, contact a student's parents, legal guard - ian, or spouse in cases of extreme emergency, or where a possibility of imminent harm exists. This will occur only when, in the judgment of the appropriate official, the best interests of the student and the institution will be served. When practical, NMSU-DACC will notify the student, in writing, of its intention to undertake the steps authorized by this policy. This decision may be appealed by the student to either the NMSU Vice President for Student Success or the DACC Vice President for Student Services within 24 hours of notification. The appeal should be in writing and clearly state the reasons why the student objects to the proposed action. The NMSU Vice President for Student Success and/or the DACC Vice President for Student Services will review the facts in the case and convey a decision to all parties within 48 hours. The decision of the NMSU Vice President for Student Success and/or DACC Vice President for Student Services shall be final.SECTION 3: Additional Policies and Procedures Children in the Workplace Students, staff, faculty, and administrators can expect to attend and teach class, or complete work or research in laboratories, libraries, offices, and other workplaces with a minimum of distractions or interruptions. Consequently, the following regulations have been established, and will be enforced by the appropriate dean or administra - tive supervisor, to ensure that an appropriate academic environment is maintained. 1. Children visiting campus must be closely supervised b y an adult at all times. 2. Children will be prohibited from entering dangerous settings suc h as labs and equipment rooms without the approval of the appropriate dean or administrative supervisor. 3. Children ma y not attend a class in session without the prior approval of the instruc - tor. Children under the care of the instructor may not attend class without the prior appro val of the immediate supervisor. 4. Children ma y, on rare occasions and with the approval of the supervisor, accom - pany a parent to the workplace. However, the expectation is that parents will make alternate arr angements for the care of their children during normal working hours. 5. Children taking part in progr ams and/or special events on campus are expected to abide by the rules and regulations established by the program or event sponsors. Family Educational rights and Privacy Act of 1974 New Mexico State University maintains academic, disciplinary, and other records pertaining to students in accordance with the specifications of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and amendments.

The Department of Campus Activities will be available for consultation regarding the public performance licensing procedures, but will not be responsible for ensuring that the student organization or university depart - ment has complied with the intent of the law and has secured the appropriate license.2013-2014 Student Handbook 131 In exercising the right of free expression, one must also accept the responsibility of following the laws related to the safety of people and property. If property damage or excessive littering occurs, or other unusual expenses are incurred by the University as a result of the event, event organizers may be held responsible for reasonable charges if deemed appropriate by the President or his/her designee. 1. P etitioning and the Distribution and Posting of Literature and Signs a. All liter ature distributed must contain identifying information, which may be either (1) the name of an NMSU-DACC sanctioned organization, or (2) the name and address (which may be an organization and e-mail address) of the unaffiliated entity or person or the telephone number of the unaffiliated entity or person for someone to contact in case of litter problems. b. Liter ature may be distributed hand-to-hand, through the use of tables, or by posting on designated bulletin boards and kiosks. c. Written materials ma y not be placed in non-approved locations. Written materials may not be placed on any part of a university building or structure without university permission. Posting on traffic signs, power poles, trees, and automobile windshields is not allowed. d. T ables are allowed as long as they do not unreasonably interfere with pedes - trian traffic. Materials may not be left on unattended tables. While scheduling of tables is not required in ad vance, those individuals who have previously scheduled a site through the Campus Activities Office or other appropriate university offices will take precedence. 2. Gr oup Speech Activities a. Group speech activities, including rallies, parades and demonstrations, that are advertised through public media including newspapers, radio, television, flyers, or electronic lists, may need to be coordinated through the NMSU Police Department (as described in 2b). b. An y individual, group, or organization sponsoring a group speech activity that is expected to draw more than 100 persons at one time and uses public media for advertising must notify the NMSU Police Department no less than 72 hours in advance of the activity, so that the NMSU Police Department can take ap - propriate actions to ensure the safety of the event and issue a permit as proof of prior notification. Activities expected to draw 500 or more participants, or require road closures or detours, must be scheduled two weeks in advance. c. An y individual, group, or organization planning a group speech activity is encouraged to contact the Campus Activities Office in advance so that activi - ties may be coordinated with appropriate university offices. This will allow for locations to be reserv ed or other concerns to be addressed, such as the use of sound amplification equipment. Contacting the Campus Activities Office is voluntary and does not constitute an approval process. 1) All sc heduling is done on a \"first come, first served\" basis. 2) Acti vities that are scheduled will receive priority in the use of space on campus. 3. Electr onic Sound Amplification a. T he use of electronic sound amplification equipment is authorized in the open lots to the east of the Pan American Center and Aggie Memorial Stadium, the Corbett Center Outdoor Stage, and the \"Aggie Pond\" area off Espina Street, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and from 7:00 a.m. to midnight on Friday and Saturday. b. Sound amplification equipment ma y be allowed at other times and in other locations if coordinated in advance through the Campus Activities Office. 4. Use of Chalk a . Chalk ma y be used on campus as long as it is restricted to concrete walkways. b. All c halk used must be of a temporary or removable nature. Permanent chalk, such as surveyor's chalk, may not be used under any circumstances. B. P olicy Enforcement. Any person violating this policy will be subject to: 1. Being asked to cease and desist or to relocate b y appropriate university employees acting within the scope of their duties. 2. Being ordered to lea ve the premises or property owned or controlled by the University, the police or a person in charge of the property. 3.

Violations by faculty or staff will be referred to the appropriate department or academic unit. 4. Arrest for violation of local, state, and/or feder al law(s). 5. Restriction of future use of, or access to, the NMSU campus.By la w, as well as by intent, the pre-recorded videocassettes and DVDs (referred to henceforth as \"Videos\") which are available in stores throughout the United States are for all purposes intended for \"home use only.\" Rentals or purchases of Videos do not carry with them licenses for non-home showings. Before you can legally engage in any non-home showings, you must have a separate license, which specifically authorizes such use. Any institution, organization, company or individual wishing to engage in non- home showings of Videos should be aware of the Copyright Act's provisions governing the showing of Videos. The Copyright Act grants to the copyright owner the exclusive right, among others, \"to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" (Section 106 - FCA) In summary, the Copyright Act mandates: T he rental or purchase of a Video does not carry with it the right \"to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" (Section 202 - FCA) V ideos may be shown without a license in the home to \"a normal circle of family and its social acquaintances\" (Section 101 - FCA) because such showings are not \"public.\" V ideos may also be shown without a license for non-profit educational purposes and in certain narrowly defined \"face-to-face teaching activities\" (Section 110.1 - FCA) because the law makes a specific, limited exception for such showings. (Sections 106 and 110(1) - FCA) Other sho wings of Videos are illegal unless they have been authorized by license. Even \"performances in 'semi public' places such as clubs, lodges, factories, summer camps and schools are 'public performances' subject to copyright control.\" (Senate Report No. 94-473, page 60; House Report No. 94-1476, page 64) Ins titutions, organizations, companies or individuals wishing to engage in non-home showings of Videos must secure licenses to do so\u2014regardless of whether an admis - sion or other fee is charged. This legal requirement applies equally to profit-making organizations and non-profit institutions (Senate Report No. 94-473, page 59; House Report No. 94-1476, page 62) Showings of Videos without licenses, when one is required, are infringements of the established copyright. If done \"willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain,\" they are a federal crime and subject to a $150,000 penalty per exhibition (Section 506 - FCA). In addition, even innocent or inadvertent infringers are subject to substantial civil damages ranging from $750 to $30,000 for each illegal showing and other penalties. (Sections 502-505 - FCA) Obtaining a Public Performance License Obtaining a public performance license is relatively easy and usually requires no more than a phone call. Fees are determined by such factors as the number of times a particular movie is going to be shown, how large the audience will be and so forth. While fees vary, they are generally inexpensive for smaller performances. Most licensing fees are based on a particular performance or set of performances for specified films The major firms that handle these licenses include: Swank Motion Pictures, Inc. Criterion Pictures http://www .swank.com http://www (MPLC) http://www.mplc.com(800) 462-8855 Freedom of Expression Policy New Mexico State University recognizes and promotes an intellectually open campus. The free exchange of ideas through written, spoken, and other forms of expression reflects its public land-grant heritage, support of diverse points of view, and commit - ment to excellence in education and research. A. Campus Use for Free Expression. Any outdoor area that is generally accessible to the public may be used by any individual or group for petitioning, distributing writ - ten material, handing out newspapers, or conducting speech acts. Prior approval is not necessary as long as the primary action is not to ad vertise or sell a commercial product. Activities must follow all applicable fire codes, local, state, and federal laws. Acti vities shall not: Unreasonably obstruct vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Block the entrances or exits to buildings and facilities. Permanently occupy land areas or permanently locate signs and posters. Erect permanent structures, shelters or camps. Unreasonably interfere with classes, university work, and scheduled events.132 Do\u00f1a Ana Community College circumstances (such as fire evacuation), or similar overt occurrences. Evidence of regulatory or statutory violations that exist in plain and open view of the entering staff members may be used in initiating disciplinary procedures. b. In instances w here immediate and compelling cause does not exist, written authorization from the individual in charge of the residential area or his supe-rior must be obtained prior to entry. Such authorization must show reasonable cause; i.e., there must exist a reason to believ e, other than mere suspicion, that violations of federal and state statutes or university regulations are occur - ring. If the occupant of the room/house/apartment is absent, a staff member of the residential area must be present during the entry . Evidence of regulatory or statutory violations that exist in plain and open view of the entering staff member may be used in initiating disciplinary procedures. c. P olice entrance shall be governed by the requirements of customary legal investigative practice. B. Pr ocedures for Administrative Search. Upon presentation of reasonable cause, the Director of Housing and Residential Life or his/her superior may issue written authorization for the search of a designated room/house/apartment and the contents thereof. The authorization stating the reason(s), cause(s), or condition(s) necessitat - ing the search shall be presented to the designated occupant(s) prior to the search. In execution of the sear ch, the Director of Housing and Residential Life or his/her designee, the Coordinator for Residential Communities or his/her designee and the occupant should be present; however, it is not imperative that the occupant be present. C. Appeal and Grie vance r edress 1. Entr y and Search Authorization Appeals. In cases where disciplinary procedures arise from evidence obtained on the basis of entry or search authorizations, the cause for, validity, or scope of the authorization may be challenged by the student-defendant and such challenge must be adjudicated by the University disciplinary system before any further action is taken. 2. Grie vance Allegations. In such case that a student believes his/her guaranteed rights have been violated by an act of entrance or search, he/she may present written allegation of this belief to the Vice President for Student Success who shall thereupon require an investigation of the allegation. Should this investigation demonstrate that a University employee has intentionally erred and violated a student's rights, this employee shall be subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination. Nondescrimination Policy The University is dedicated to providing equal employment and educational oppor - tunities to all persons without regard to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity , national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, spousal affiliation, or veteran status. The University strives to comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination laws, including: T itles VI and VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964 Age Discrimination in Emplo yment Act of 1975 Equal P ay Act of 1963 Pregnanc y Act of 1978 Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 V ietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974 Executi ve Order 11246 Executi ve Order 11141 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Ci vil Rights Act of 1991 New Mexico Human Rights Act This dedication extends to recruitment, hiring, promotion, compensation, training, benefits, separations, and to the availability and delivery of all educational, academic, and student welfare programs and services.

C. r eference to Other Policies Impacting Freedom of Expression. In the event that the terms of this policy conflict with other existing policies impacting freedom of expression in areas generally accessible to the public, the terms of this policy shall prevail. Fund raising/Sales and Solicitation Raising funds is a means for campus organizations to supplement their other resources in meeting the goals of their organization. In order to avoid conflicts, duplications, or violation of laws or regulations, it is necessary to establish guidelines to aid in coordinating such activities. Although the University supports organizational fund-raising efforts, it recognizes that the campus is not a market place to be exploited by opportune entrepreneurial projects. Fund raising is not the primary function of student organizations, and campus organizations do not have an implicit right to use the campus or the community for fund-raising activities. Fund raising through sales and solicitations, both on and off campus, are governed by University Sales and Solicitation Policies. Full text copies of these policies are available from the Campus Activities Office. The Director of Campus Activities is responsible for interpreting the Sales and Solicitation Policy. The Campus Activities Office is located in Corbett Center Student Union, room 235. Dining regulations Dining regulations are contained in the Dining Services contract, which each student agrees to when applying for dining services. Additional copies are available in the ID Card Office. Upon reasonable notice and for good cause the University reserves the right to terminate the Dining Agreement for failure of the student to abide thereby. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, failure to abide by the terms of the Dining Agreement, a change in student status (including academic or disciplin - ary suspension), or a failure to comply with the policies and regulations contained in the Campus Dining Services progr am brochure and/or official informational bulletins distributed by Campus Dining Services which are thereby incorporated into Dining Ser - vices Agreement. Dining regulations are enforced under the Student Code of Conduct. housing and residential Life Application Acceptance Policy The University reserves the right to refuse to give a housing assignment to any student. Examples of reasons for refusal include, but are not limited to, having a criminal history, behavioral problems which may, in the opinion of the University, negatively impact the group-living environment, previous eviction from campus housing, and a poor rental history. housing and residential Life regulations Housing regulations are contained in the Single Student Housing License Agreement, which each student agrees to when applying for housing services, as well as the \"Housing and Residential Life Handbook,\" which each student receives at move-in. Additional copies are available at the Housing Office and all residential area offices. Students living off campus are also subject to housing regulations when visiting resi - dential areas. Housing regulations are enforced through the Housing and Residential Life Office as well as through the Student Code of Conduct. Procedures for Entry and Search of University-Operated h ousing The University respects the student's desire for privacy within the realm of the group-living experience on state property and will make every effort to protect that privacy. Campus premises occupied by students and the personal possessions of students shall not be searched unless appropriate authorization has been obtained. Campus living quarters may be entered for the purposes and under the restrictions listed: A. Pr ocedures for Entry 1. Maintenance: Premises may be entered after knocking, to give attention to health, sanitation, maintenance, and safety requirements. 2. Inspections: Housing personnel and any other appropriate university official(s) or staff may enter any room/house/apartment for inspection purposes with appropri - ate written notice.

Questions related to the interpretation of this policy should be directed to the Of - fice of Campus Activities. Smoking Policy Accumulating evidence has shown environmental or second-hand tobacco smoke increases the risk of cancer and other health hazards for nonsmokers as well as smok-ers. NMSU has a vital interest in maintaining a healthy and safe environment for its students, faculty , staff and visitors while respecting individual choice. Consistent with these concerns and the New Mexico Clean Indoor Air Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7 24-16-1 through 11, the following policy has been established to restrict smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plant, and provide procedures for accommodating the preferences of both smokers and nonsmokers. Smoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all buildings (exceptions below) owned or leased by the University as well as within 25 feet of building entrances and exits, vehicles, and during some organized outdoor events on University property. SMO k E-F r EE A r EAS. Smoking is prohibited in or at: a ll enclosed buildings and facilities including classrooms, offices, food service venues, lavatories, and most residence halls (in accordance with Housing and Residential Life policies); within 25 feet of building entr ances and exits (when reasonable) and fresh air intake grills unless there is a specially designated smoking area partially or fully enclosed w alkways, corridors, elevators v ehicles owned, leased or rented by the University; and within 50 feet of an y area where flammable materials are handled or stored, or where other significant fire hazards may exist indoor athletic or other uni versity-sponsored or designated events No-smoking signs or the international no-smoking symbol will be posted at major entrances of all university buildings, except for those campus residences where smok - ing is permitted. SMO k ING PE r MITTED A r EAS. Smoking is permitted outdoors on university property except during organized events which have been designated as \"No Smoking\". Indi- viduals choosing to smoke outdoors must be 25 feet from doorways, open windows, enclosed walkways, and ventilation systems to prevent smoke from entering enclosed buildings and facilities, and to prevent public access from being denied to an individual with a respiratory medical condition. In accordance with Housing and Residential Life policies, smoking is permitted in those units which constitute private residences; when everyone in the shared residence is a smoker or at the discretion of each Family Housing unit. Fraternities and sororities will work toward an agreement, consistent with university policy in effect during the current school year. EDUCATION AND SE rVICES FO r SMO k E r S. In light of numerous adverse health effects associated with active smoking, and with exposure to second hand smoke, the University will provide educational services to faculty, staff, and students about the hazards of smoking and information and services on quitting smoking. In addition to consulting with their own health care providers, students, faculty, and staff may get assistance from the following university programs: Students may contact the NMSU Student Health Center for information and programs on quitting smoking. F aculty and staff may obtain assistance in smoking cessation through the Employee Health Center. COOPE r ATION AND COMPLIANCE. This policy relies on the mutual courtesy and cooperation of smokers and nonsmokers for its success. It is the responsibility of all members of the NMSU/DACC community to observe the provisions of this policy on smoking. Complaints or concerns or disputes regarding its implementation should be referred to the immediate supervisor for resolution. Environmental Health & Safety will assist in determining what distance or location is reasonable for the particular situa - tion. If a resolution cannot be reached, the matter will be referred by the supervisor to the appropriate Department Head, Director , Dean, or Vice President for mediation. Managers, Department Heads and Unit Directors are responsible for seeing that per - sons in their areas are informed and comply with this smoking policy.
