She was working as a typist in an advocate's office for almost 3 years. She first thought that it was because of her job and she went to her local doctor and she was given Vitamin B12 supplementation. She first felt a little better but then it soon it returned as soon as she stopped taking the supplement. To avoid too much intake of conventional medicine she consulted a homoeopath. After taking her detailed case study by the homoeopathic doctor, it was found that she also suffered from unexplained weight gain and irregularity in menses since a year. She was advised to do a blood test for thyroid hormones and was found to be suffering from hypothyroid. She was then prescribed homoeopathic medicine with some dietary advice and exercises to lose weight. Slowly and steadily her condition improved and on re-checking the thyroid hormones it was found to be within normal limits. Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroid Unexplained Weight gain, numbness and tingling in extremities, constipation, sluggishness, fatigue; lack of energy, dry skin, depression, increased sensitivity to cold, impaired memory, Hair thinning/ Hair loss, muscle aches and pains, heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods and slower heart rate are common signs and symptoms seen in a hypothyroid patient.

Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (thyroid gland enlarges and forms goitre), Thyroid destruction following secondary to radioactive surgery, Severe iodine deficiency and Stress are known to cause Hypothyroid. A routine blood test for thyroid hormones would confirm the diagnosis. Homoeopathy for Hypothyroid... Homoeopathy helps to produce thyroid hormone naturally by stimulating the immune system and helps in better functioning of the thyroid gland. Homoeopathic remedies work by stimulating the body's own healing capacity by encouraging the body to reactivate hormone secretions. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects.

Homoeopathy treats not only the physical complaints, but also targets the mind and gently restores mind-body equilibrium- thus it treats the patient as a whole. A complete recovery is possible in most cases with homoeopathy.
