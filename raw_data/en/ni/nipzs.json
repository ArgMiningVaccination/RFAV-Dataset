Building physician practices.Do Y our Patients Need Powerful Thyroid Support? Do your patients struggle with low body temperature and inefficient metabolism? Thyroid Px is the answer when your patients need extra thyroid support. Providing a dose of 12 mg iodine per serving, plus additional nutrients and herbs, Thyroid Px effectively supports essential T4- T3 conversion. This formula can help stabilize thyroid peroxidase immunoglobulins which are essential for normal thyroid activity. The powerful antioxidants selenium and zinc, as well as guggul, help neutralize free radicals that affect iodothryonine-5-monodeiodinase enzyme activity, which is involved in the conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone.

We are proud to be hosting the annual conference in AARM's beautiful home state of Vermont this year. Our conference theme, 2018 Trends in Nutrition, Pain Management, and Mind- Body Therapies intends to reach a wide range of interests and modalities within Restorative Medicine. I am grateful for the contributions from our excellent faculty this year, who represent a diverse mix of MDs, DOs, NDs, and herbalists, from both the US and Canada. One of our goals for 2018 is to further enhance the fun and positive energy generated by our annual conference! I hope you'll join our kava party on Saturday night, with live music, a cash bar, and dancing with the afro-funk band Sabouyouma. On Thursday, legendary herbalist Rosemary Gladstar is hosting a full day of herb farm tours, and shorter herb walks are being offered on Friday. For the foodies among us, there are a lot of exciting and delicious restaurants and pubs within walking distance of the hotel in downtown Burlington. For the conference lunches and breaks, healthy local organic foods from Vermont will be featured. We're also going greener and more high-tech this year by offering a conference management app to use on your phone or tablet. Everything you need to know about the conference is now available in one convenient location. The app allows you to pre-plan which lectures you want to attend. The conference evaluation can be completed on the app, which helps us reduce paper waste and allows us to generate your CME certificates more efficiently. For more information on the conference app, see page 7 of this booklet. Another green initiative is credited to Restorative Formulations, the platinum sponsor for the conference. Aware of the carbon dioxide emissions created by holding a conference of this size (through travel, hotels and food production), they contributed approximately $4000 to COTAP .org \u2014 Carbon Offsets To Alleviate Poverty. This money goes towards projects in India, Africa and Nicaragua to offset carbon emissions, by planting fruit trees, supporting farmers, and protecting forests. The conference also makes a donation to a local charity as part of a thank you gift to the speakers rather than presenting material gifts. This year, we contributed to the Vermont Food Bank, which distributes millions of pounds of food to Vermonters in need. The Restorative Medicine Conference continues to prioritize diversity and inclusion. My wish is that this fun and friendly gathering will help you better serve your patients, as well as help you grow your practice. I hope to see you next year in sunny San Diego, CA on September 12- 15, 2019! In Health, Micha\u00ebl Friedman, ND AARM Executive DirectorWelcome to the 16th Annual International Restorative Medicine Conference! This conference is dedicated to my cousins, Drew and Meredith, and to those who lost their battle with opioid addiction much too soon in their lives. I strongly believe that integrative medicine has the greatest potential to help solve the opioid crisis by offering effective alternatives to pain management. My hope is that this conference also serves to increase clinicians' awareness of patients who are at risk of addiction, and to guide them to the assistance that they need. Thank you to all of you who are carrying out this important mission. With peace and gratitude, Jen Palmer, ND AARM Communications and Education Director6Thank You To Our Conference Sponsors: Platinum Sponsor Gold Sponsor Silver Sponsors Conference Education PartnersBronze Sponsors Workshop Sponsor Vermont Association of Naturopathic Physicians 7The Association for the Advancement of Restorative Medicine (AARM) is a non-profit medical association which supports cross-disciplinary learning and collaboration in the use of herbal, nutritional, and hormone medicines. AARM's focus is on providing medical education about endocrine system disorders, with an emphasis on therapeutic approaches for treating hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal dysfunction, and dysglycemia, as well as male and female hormonal imbalances. We also provide protocols and scientific information to physicians for using Restorative Medicine to treat chronic diseases, including digestive, respiratory, nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases. AARM's education for healthcare professionals occurs through several channels. Each year, hundreds of physicians and other healthcare providers attend our conferences in the U.S. and Canada. Recordings of conference lectures are available on our website for those who prefer to learn remotely. AARM also publishes the peer-reviewed Journal of Restorative Medicine (JRM). Continuing medical education credits are available for many of our educational products.AARM certifies health care practitioners in specific Restorative Medicine therapies. For example, providers who attend the T3 certification courses at our conferences can take an online exam and become certified in T3 therapy. By providing education from leading experts, clinical research, and cutting-edge protocols, AARM is empowering physicians to more effectively treat their patients and build their practices through the use of herbal, nutritional, and natural hormone medicines. A one-year membership in AARM is only $49 and includes: Five CME credits for reading Journal of Restorative Medicine articles.

About AARM 8Certification in T3 Therapy is an elective option for AARM members and is an excellent means to help your patients and build your practice. Medical providers can obtain Certification in T3 Therapy by attending required classes scheduled during the preconference day for the Annual International Restorative Medicine Conference. This full day of seminars provides: Speakers who are experienced clinicians and experts in thyroid physiology Evidence-based review of low body temperature and associated symptoms Treatment protocols for optimizing thyroid health and body temperatures Protocols for Triiodothyronine (T3), botanicals, and nutritional medicines to support the thyroid system Written exam to earn certification at the end of the day Certification in T3 Therapy verifies that practitioners have completed the training and have passed an examination. Once certified, practitioners who are AARM members will be listed on a practitioner search tool. This opportunity allows practitioners to share contact information, clinic description, and website links to potential patients to help build their practice.Certification in T3 Therapy: Optimizing Body Temperature and Thyroid Function with Hormones, Botanicals and Nutrition The certification program, Optimizing Body Temperature and Thyroid Function with Hormones, Botanicals and Nutrition, features pioneering experts in managing thyroid disease and fatigue, led by Denis Wilson, MD and Michael Friedman, ND. The non-CME course (\"Dosing of Triiodothyronine T3\") is classified as such because Dr. Wilson discusses off-label usage of drugs that are not conventionally approved by the medical establishment. It is approved for CE credit for NDs. Certification Requirements To qualify for Certification in T3 Therapy you must meet the following requirements: Attend required lectures at the Restorative Medicine conference. Complete and pass the examination immediately after the course (recommended) or online within 4 weeks after the con- ference (email jen@restorativemedicine.com for online access).

The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is responsible for maintaining an appropriate level of thyroid hormones that the cells can use to provide for normal metabolism. Just as vital, recent research has uncovered thyroid signaling pathways that regulate the thyroid system on a cellular level. The ubiquitin proteasome system controls the level of deiodinase enzyme, thereby determining T4 to T3 conversion. All this crucial intracellular activity is not measured by thyroid blood tests. This might explain why some people have low body temperatures and symptoms of low thyroid function that may warrant the empirical use of T3. Presentation Goals and Objectives: 1. Describe the physiology of thyroid hormone pathways and body temperature 2. Name 3 intracellular signaling pathways that direct the conver - sion of T4 to T3 3. Understand the intracellular physiology of thyroid hormones 4. Explain when and why or why not T3 might be desirable as an empirical treatment 5. Understand the risks of T3 and the safety concerns of the American Thyroid Association regarding the use of T3 2:00-3:00 p.m. Botanical Medicines for Thyroid Disease 1 CME/ 1 CE Jillian Stansbury, ND This session will present current research on botanical medicines aimed at regulating thyroid function.

Dozens of large scale studies have clearly illustrated its role in bone health, heart health via calcification, cancer and diabetes. It acts as an \"activator\" or carboxylating agent to activate key vitamin K dependent proteins. Considering that the western population is sub-clinically deficient in vitamin K2, what impact is this having on our health? Additionally, we will discuss new discoveries in the function of vitamin K2 in the body by going beyond its well-known roles as a carboxylating vitamin in bone health and heart health. These new discoveries will further illustrate the dangers we face in the Western world- a population that is sub- clinically deficient in vitamin K2. 2:00-3:00 p.m. Think Hormones First: From Birth Trauma to Anti-Aging, A Lifetime of Hormone Balance 0 CME/ 1 CE 1 Pharmacology CE Carol Petersen, RPh We have, at long last, started to recognize that we can evaluate and support faltering hormone production as we age. However, diminished hormone production or disruption can occur throughout the lifetime. We haven't found the underlying causes because we haven't looked. Considering and evaluating hormone deficiencies and excesses should be as standard as performing blood chemistries, differentials, and lipids. This presentation is intended to explain the benefits of routine hormone evaluation, and offer insights for hormone interventions that may prevent years of patient suffering. Participants should be able to: Identify which hormone deficiencies cause pain. Understand why patients should be evaluated for hormone imbalances before being referred to psychiatry.

Dr. Pescatore will explain how the process of aging is accelerated when these three actions are disrupted. He will provide a review of a specific form of folic acid which helps overcome methylation flaws, and the supporting nutrients required to maintain an effective methylation cycle and how that interacts with telomere activity. He'll explain the factors which can impact mitochondrial functionality and steps for prevention. By supporting nutrition and diet, a three pronged approach can help slow the aging process. Goals and Objectives: 1. Review the function of mitochondria. 2. Examine the role of telomeres and DNA protection, and provide research which demonstrates how lack of telomerase activity can shorten DNA strands. 3. Review the nutrients utilized in the methylation cycle. 4. Provide research which identifies the optimal forms of nutri- ents to support methylation. 5. Examine the role of telomeres in the aging process. 1:30- 2:30 p.m. Adaptogens and Tonic Herbs 1 CME/ 1 CE Rosemary Gladstar Rosemary will discuss herbs used around the world that have earned a reputation for improving and maintaining energy, vitality, and health. She will review the clinical and animal research that supports the long history of use for these herbs and identifies their mechanism of action. The adaptogenic/tonic herbs are also the foundation of many health protocols for both acute and chronic disorders. Special considerations concerning those in their aging years will be addressed, including herbs for improving eyesight, digestion, bone health, and sexual wellbeing. Rosemary will share extraction methods, dosing and recipes for longevity and wellbeing. Goals and Objectives: 1. Review ten adaptogenic and tonic herbs- presenting clinical uses and supporting research. 2. Review the mechanisms of action for adaptogenic herbs based on scientific support. 3. Review the traditional and modern clinical applications of adaptogens and tonics in botanical medicine. 4. Understanding the differences and similarity between tonic botanicals and adaptogens. 5. Applications for adaptogens and tonics as food and medicine, including recipes and botanical formulas. 2:30- 3:30 p.m. Opiate Addiction: Pathophysiology Stansbury, ND There are at least 4 million opiate addicts in the US alone and at least 1.5 million Americans undergo treatment for heroin addiction annually. The success rate for treatment is just 2- 5%, and as a result, there are approximately 30-40,000 opiate- associated deaths per year in the US. The CDC reports that opiate sales, hospital admissions, and opiate overdose deaths have tripled in the last 30 years and now exceed motor vehicle deaths per year. Opiate drugs bind opiate receptors and activate the \"reward\" sensation, and unfortunately, can become top priority. As tolerance develops, the addict increases dosages and changes to increasingly dangerous forms of opioid drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. To effectively help the recovering addict, it's critical to address the underlying pathologies which led to the addiction. By supporting endogenous neurotransmitters, blocking opiate receptors, and supporting adrenal function, it is possible to help reduce some of the symptoms experienced during withdrawal. Goals and Objectives: 1. Review the pathophysiology of opiate addiction. 2. Understand the mechanisms of the opiate system. 3. Review the evidence based use of botanical medicine to lessen the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. 4. Review the botanical extracts which bind to opiate receptors. 5. Review the preparatory steps to take when helping an addict transition. 2:30- 3:30 p.m. Obesity Medicine for the Adolescent Patient 1 CME/ 1 CE Carol Penn, DO In this presentation, Dr. Penn will define pediatric obesity and provide insight on the epidemiology of pediatric obesity as it relates to the adolescent. She will help define pediatric weight loss goals in the adolescent population. The attendee will learn the stages of intervention when treating an adolescent child with obesity. Goals and Objectives: 1. Learn how to screen for adolescent obesity 2. Review the recommended exams and labs 3. Review the psycho-social implications of childhood obesity 4. Context for BMI charts in adolescent obesity 5. Review intervention approaches for obesity284:15- 5:15 p.m. 2018 Nutrition Updates: What' s Real, What' s Dubious? Part 2 Alan R. Gaby, MD (see description from Friday, 11:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.) Sunday September 30, 2018 8:00-10:00 a.m. Ketones as an Alternative Fuel for the Brain: Medium Chain Triglycerides and Ketogenic Diets 2 CME/2 CE Mary Newport, MD Ketones are an alternative fuel to glucose for the brain and the brain is capable of easily switching from burning glucose to ketones during fasting, starvation, with ketogenic diets, and use of medium chain triglycerides and exogenous ketone supplements. The classic ketogenic diet began use as a successful treatment for drug resistant childhood epilepsy in the early 1920s and is still in use today for that purpose and more recently to treat other conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, other neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The Paleo and Mediterranean diets are technically not ketogenic diets but can easily provide the foundation for a ketogenic diet. Alzheimer's is a type of diabetes of the brain, but the person does not necessarily have type 1 or 2 diabetes as well. While there is decreased glucose uptake in the areas of the brain affected by Alzheimer's, ketone uptake is normal in those same areas of the brain, therefore, a potential treatment is to provide ketones as an alternative fuel to the brain. A case report will be presented as an example of this approach, as well as series of caregiver reports. Small studies of the use of the ketogenic diet or ketogenic foods, such as MCT oil, have been reported with positive results for Alzheimer's and larger studies are in progress. Other strategies to increase ketone levels will be discussed including exercise, overnight and intermittent fasting, branched chain amino acids, caffeine and exogenous ketone supplements, such as ketone salts and ketone esters (will be presented generically). Differences between medium chain and longer chain triglycerides will be discussed, as well as the special properties of lauric acid. Common concerns will be addresses, such as whether this approach can be used for prevention of Alzheimer's, whether these approaches can cause ketoacidosis and whether the high fat content of the ketogenic diet is a problem. Goals and Objectives: 1. The participant will learn the history and evolution of the idea of ketones as an alternative fuel for the brain and other organs and application of the concept to Alzheimer's disease, includ- ing the use of medium chain triglycerides and ketone esters to increase ketone levels. 2. The participant will learn the connections between diabetes, excessive sugar intake, and dementia. 3. The participant will learn the similarities and differences between the classic ketogenic diet originally used for epilepsy, the modifications of the ketogenic diet, the Paleo diet and Mediterranean diet. 4. The participant will learn the potential applications of the concept of ketones as alternative fuel to the brain and other organs to other conditions such as Parkinson's, other neurode - generative diseases, diabetes and cancer. 5. The participant will learn additional strategies for increasing ketone levels, including overnight and intermittent fasting, exercise, caffeine, branched chain amino acids. And use of exogenous ketone supplements, such as ketone salts and ketone esters 6. The participant will learn the difference between ketosis and ketoacidosis. 10:30 a.m.- 12:30 p.m. Healing from Historical and Generational Trauma, Through Movement, Mindfulness and Spirituality 2 CME/2 CE Carol A. Penn, DO The first tenet of Osteopathic Medicine is that the body is a self- regulating unit, composed of mind, body, and spirit. Persons who are living with or who have inherited historical and generational trauma often hide in their bodies hurt, humiliation, fear, and shame. This manifests itself in a myriad of physical signs and symptoms ranging from obesity, depression, headaches, anxiety or may take on addictive qualities and show up as substance abuse, alcohol abuse, perhaps binging on sex, gambling and food. These conditions may be difficult to fully resolve without understanding their origin. This presentation reviews evidence- based approaches which help create a safe place to let these deep wounds be explored and released, using modalities such as meditation, deep breathing, and movement. Research shows that by addressing the deeper underlying causes of physical symptoms, it sets the stage for transformation and healing by connecting mind, body and spirit. We will also review the United Nations 17 Goals for Sustainable Development, which includes: addressing issues of education, growth, and inequality for persons with disabilities; peace and justice; and gender equality. Goals and Objectives: 1. Utilizing a variety of techniques combining wisdom, traditions and modern-day science, at the end of the session participants will have practical Monday morning take-aways to use imme - diately for their own self-care and to share with their patients, clients, and students. 2. Participants will better understand some of the underlying emotional causes for physical symptoms. 29Downloadable Proceedings Book and More You can access the digital versions of the program book, proceedings and other handouts provided by speakers here: restorativemedicine.org/VT2018 CME Certificates CME Certificates will be designated for the amount of credits indicated on your evaluation forms.
