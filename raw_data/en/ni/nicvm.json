It causes episodes of inflammation to various parts of the body. It can affect your joints, tendons, and skin. It can affect blood vessels. And it can affect organs, such as the kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain. It can cause rashes, fatigue, pain, and fever. The heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain are the organs most affected. Severe lupus can cause harm to organs and other serious problems. Lupus is a long-term (chronic) disease. It affects each person differently. The effects of the illness range from mild to severe. Symptoms of lupus may come and go. These are sometimes known as flare-ups, periods of remission, and relapse. Lupus has no known cure, but medicines may help manage symptoms. You can help manage lupus by living a healthy lifestyle and working with your healthcare provider. In children, lupus tends to get worse more quickly than in adults. Children may be affected in different ways, having mild to life-threatening symptoms. What causes lupus? Your body protects itself with the immune system. The immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These protect against bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. In some people, the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own cells. This leads to inflammation and tissue damage in the body. Experts think lupus may be caused by a mix of genes and other factors. The other factors may include being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis. Other factors, such as sunlight, stress, or hormones, may be part of the cause of lupus. Who is at risk for lupus? Lupus occurs most often in young women in their late teens and adult women younger than age 45. The female hormone estrogen is linked with lupus. Lupus also affects more African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians than whites. Lupus in children occurs most often in those age 15 and older. But it can happen in children or adults of any age. What are the symptoms of lupus? Lupus symptoms can appear in many parts of the body. Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each person. They may come and go. Some of the common symptoms of lupus are: - Anemia - Butterfly-shaped rash on the nose and cheeks of the face (malar rash) - Tiredness (fatigue) - Fever - Hair loss - Loss of appetite - Memory problems - Pale, blue, or red fingers triggered by cold, stress, or illness (Raynaud phenomenon) - Raised rash on the head, arms, chest, or back - Rashes caused by sunlight - Sores in the mouth or nose - Swollen glands - Swollen or painful joints (arthritis) - Weight loss The symptoms of lupus can look like other health problems. Make sure to see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. How is lupus diagnosed? Lupus may be hard to diagnose because many of the symptoms could be from other causes. The symptoms also develop slowly over time. To diagnose lupus, your healthcare provider will ask about your health history and your symptoms. Your healthcare provider may suspect you have lupus if you have 4 or more symptoms and no specific cause. You may have tests to help confirm the diagnosis. You may have blood tests, such as: - Antibody blood tests. These tests are done to look for certain kinds of antibodies in your blood. The main test for lupus is the antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test. Most people with lupus will have a positive ANA test result. Other tests check for other kinds of antibodies. - Complete blood count (CBC). This test checks for low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. - Complement test. This test is done to measure the level of complement. This is a group of proteins in the blood that help destroy foreign substances. Low levels of complement in the blood are often linked with lupus. - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate). This test looks at how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube. When swelling and inflammation are present, the blood's proteins clump together and become heavier than normal. They fall and settle faster at the bottom of the test tube. The faster the blood cells fall, the more severe the inflammation. - C-reactive protein (CRP). This protein shows up when inflammation is found in the body. ESR and CRP show similar amounts of inflammation. But in some cases, one will be high when the other is not. This test may be repeated to check your response to medicine. You may also have other tests, such as: - Urine tests. These look for blood or protein in the urine. The test can assess your kidney function. - Biopsies. A biopsy is when tiny pieces of tissue are taken from the body to be checked under a microscope. To look for signs of lupus, biopsies may be done of the skin and kidneys. The test looks for damage to these organs. - X-rays. This test uses a small amount of radiation to create images of organs, bones, and other tissues. How is lupus treated? There is no known cure for lupus, but treatment can help manage it.

It can treat fatigue, rashes, joint pain, and mouth sores. The medicine may also help prevent blood clots. - Corticosteroid medicines. These can help people when lupus affects the kidneys, lungs, heart, or nervous system. - Medicines that suppress the immune system. These can help treat severe symptoms of lupus that has attacked organs. - Other medicines. A type of medicine called a biologic may be an option.
