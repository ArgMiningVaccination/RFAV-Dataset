Using sacred aromatherapy aligns us with the vibration of the earth. We need to reconnect with the earth and sky, the way our ancestors lived. Celebrating the new moon helps us to remember we are an active part of the whole. By co-creating with the Moon and plants, we bring ourselves into a deeper communion with our souls. Join Sheridan Semple each month for a New Moon Ceremony and Teaching. Come learn about the New Moon, along with the current astrology and astronomy. Relish in the plant medicines (using our very own Wisdom of the Earth essential oils) that support the current sign of the Moon. Do ceremony to align yourself with each month's specific energies, co-creating with the Earth and Sky. - Aug 17 - Leo New Moon - Cultivating radiant self-love and soul directed creativity Sheridan Semple is a Alchemical Astrologer as well as a Spiritual Aromatherapy Teacher for Wisdom of the Earth essential oils.
