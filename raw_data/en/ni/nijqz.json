The hospital serves 1.7 million patients a year, and offers translation services in a hundred and fifty-three languages. The Colombians, Bangladeshis, Koreans, Belarussians, Burmese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Croatians, Mexicans, and other immigrants who live nearby use Elmhurst for their care, and their communities back home often know about the hospital as well. It is not unusual for the exotically sick to fly to LaGuardia or J.F.K. from overseas to check in to Elmhurst. Diseases rare enough to merit special-case-study attention in The New England Journal of Medicine are, at Elmhurst, relatively common. If a young Southeast Asian is brought to the emergency room one morning because he is suddenly unable to move, even a junior physician knows to list familial periodic paralysis\u2014an obscure disease that is considerably more common in the Philippines\u2014as a possible diagnosis. An ambitious pedagogue of medicine couldn't dream up a more diverse patient population for physicians-in-training. The hospital was started on Roosevelt Island (then known as Blackwell's Island), in the early nineteenth century, as a public institution that cared for prisoners and the poor; it went on to tend to soldiers in the Civil War and both World Wars. In 1950, the hospital, preparing for a postwar population boom in Queens, moved to Broadway between Seventy-seventh and Eightieth Streets, where it inhabits the kind of unremarkable complex of brick buildings in which filings for building-code exceptions might be processed. In the early nineteen-sixties, when the city could no longer afford to staff its public hospitals (of which Elmhurst is the second largest, after Bellevue), Elmhurst entered into an arrangement with Mount Sinai Hospital and School of Medicine, a private institution on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Today, most physicians practicing at Elmhurst are interns, residents, and faculty professors at Mount Sinai. Elmhurst gets inexpensive staff; Sinai gets a unique training center. \"It is pretty much universally residents' favorite place to rotate,\" Dr. David Muller, the dean for medical education at Mount Sinai, told me. If you want to learn not to be misled by the glittering chest X-ray of a Korean patient\u2014in Korean acupuncture, the tips of the needles break off and remain lodged under the skin\u2014go to Elmhurst. Doctors also like to train at Elmhurst because of Dr. Joseph Lieber, a diagnostician and clinical educator who has been at Elmhurst, working from 4 A.M. until late at night, almost every day for the past twenty-five years. Practicing medicine at Elmhurst entails a daunting workload\u2014at times, the hospital runs at a-hundred-and-forty-per-cent capacity\u2014and the pay is not competitive with that of a private hospital or office. Yet an unusual number of doctors who train at Elmhurst choose to return to work there full time; they invariably cite Lieber as one of their main reasons for returning. His office is cluttered with tchotchkes from all over the world\u2014a peaceful alpaca, a monkey in a toboggan, a miniature Taj Mahal\u2014but, when I asked him about his travels, he said, \"Maybe twice a month, I travel over to Sinai for teaching. Also, on Sundays, it's true, I tend to go home earlier.\" Lieber, who grew up in East New York, Brooklyn, has never left North America; the souvenirs are gifts from residents and patients. Ellena Linden, an Elmhurst physician who also did her training there, said, \"Dr. Lieber basically is Elmhurst. He's first in and last out. We all have his pager memorized, because we call him with every kind of question.\" Lieber is a kidney specialist (cardiologists are considered cowboys; renal doctors are considered nerds), but he covers general medical wards. As I shadowed him one day, he received two consult calls (one on dermatology, one on gynecology) while visiting a post-kidney-transplant patient\u2014a Dominican man who was trying to get his medications covered by Medicare. \"We cite Lieber as a final authority, regardless of medical specialty,\" Linden said. \"And, besides medicine, he also happens to know everything about military history, though that doesn't come up as often.\" I first met Lieber more than ten years ago, when I was a misguided and miserable medical student training at Elmhurst. Though a crowded public hospital with patients from all over the world is potentially a great place to learn, that is not a given. Initially, I focussed on the fact that Elmhurst had three varieties of security (corrections officers, hospital police, and N.Y.P.D. officers), an unrelenting paint scheme of beige and sickly green, and, in the basement, instead of a hospital cafeteria, an all-night McDonald's. (The McDonald's has since been replaced by an Au Bon Pain.) During overnight shifts, young doctors napped in geriatric restraint chairs or on stretchers borrowed from the emergency room. The patients were interesting, of course, but there were just so many of them, and they weren't all complex medical mysteries like the ones on \"House.\" I remember following around a patient in the E.R. who had acute alcohol intoxication, and who kept disrobing and trying to leave the hospital, naked and attached to his I.V. drip. During the anthrax scare, a woman came in complaining of shortness of breath and holding a Ziploc bag containing a powdered-sugar doughnut missing one bite. She was worried that the powder was anthrax. The attending physician carefully opened the Ziploc bag with his gloved hand, removed the doughnut, took a bite out of it, and said that it seemed fine to him. Another time, a Japanese woman who spoke no English came in with small flat red spots all over her body, the classic presentation of a highly lethal cancer of the platelets, which is what it proved to be. Amid the extraordinary bodily ruin and beeping hospital machinery, I felt as if I were moving through the world of Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil.\" I knew that I was learning something about life, but I did wonder, at times, if I was learning much about medicine. (Add to this the problem of my being in medical school for a very bad reason\u2014simple chronic failure to disappoint parental hopes.) Then I came under Dr. Lieber's tutelage, and cheerlessly fluorescent Elmhurst seemed suddenly transformed into the Athenaeum. Which is odd, because, in appearance, voice, and choice of digressions, Lieber resembles a nineteen-fifties Catskills comedian. Asked how he manages to work so many hours, he likes to quip that his wife doesn't want him at home. He is fifty-six years old, short, freckled, and plagued by allergies that leave his eyes red and irritated, and he wears what I know how to describe only as a little Hitler mustache. His mother was a schoolteacher, and his father ran a Kosher butcher shop. (\"But eventually meat went out of style,\" he says.) He calls his co-workers \"boss\" in the singular and \"troops\" in the plural, and there is something benignly martial about him. His office shelves display dozens of model tanks, many of them made by an enthusiast who works in the hospital's boiler room. Clinical medical education occurs throughout the cycle of a hospital day. As patient cases are discussed, the more senior physicians on a team ask questions for the benefit of the less experienced. This apprenticeship model is supplemented by topical lectures and discussions led by faculty and trainees: noon conferences, morbidity and mortality reports, detailed presentations of unusual cases. In theory, this teaching schedule and method is orderly. But a beeper is always going off. A phone is ringing. A tuberculosis patient who is supposed to be in isolation has wandered into the hallway and needs to be talked back into quarantine. The residents and interns are chronically short of sleep, the senior physicians are under pressure to be somewhere else, and each year of medical progress, with its new diagnostic tests and revised insurance paperwork, brings more data to sift through and less time in which to do so. Recently, I was with Lieber during morning report, when patient conditions from the previous night are shared with the incoming medical team. The dozen or so physicians listened to the overnight interns and resident, who told them about a twenty-four-year-old newlywed Indian woman who had been in the U.S. for five days and had developed unexplained joint pain; a morbidly obese woman admitted with chest pain; a sixty-four-year-old male polysubstance abuser with opioid withdrawal and aggression; a young man on crystal meth; a twenty-eight-year-old Mexican with encephalitis; a ninety-six-year-old man who had signed multiple do-not-resuscitate orders; and a Tibetan woman (who had been living in India) with XDR (extensively drug-resistant) tuberculosis and H.I.V. Morning report is usually quick, but Lieber, an incurable teacher, also discussed the unusual epidemiology of crystal meth and the cost-benefit analysis of whether to order a test for a rare marker of bone cancer, and told a memorable anecdote about well-intentioned soldiers who gave Hershey bars to concentration-camp survivors and unknowingly hastened deaths among the starving. The chocolate produced an insulin rush, precipitating a lethal set of metabolic disturbances known as \"re-feeding syndrome.\" \"We had learned from our mistakes by the time we went into Somalia under Clinton, in 1991,\" he said. \"At least, our mistakes about re-feeding.\" Shortly afterward, Lieber was stopped in the hall by a resident and an intern\u2014Dr. Samaan and Dr. Gandhi\u2014and two medical students. They wanted to discuss the I.V. antibiotics being given to the Tibetan patient with tuberculosis. The patient had just been transferred from a ward for the less acutely ill, because she was not improving. She was now in a negative-pressure isolation room (double doors and a ventilation system that keeps air from circulating out into the hallway); the physicians put on yellow gowns, blue gloves, and face masks before they went in to examine her. \"When we treat these tuberculoses, it's like we're going back to the nineteen-fifties,\" Lieber explained. \"We're stuck returning to antibiotics we abandoned decades ago, because of their side-effect profiles.\" The patient had been on the antibiotic cycloserine. Serious depression is a common side effect, and she had told her children that she just wanted to be left to die. Owing to her H.I.V. status, Lieber suggested different antibiotics, ones that cover a number of other infectious diseases. Much of what one really remembers from a medical residency happens in these in-between moments of the day. A few minutes later, near the elevator, a specialist in infectious disease stopped Lieber; he'd just seen the Tibetan woman's CT scan, which showed lesions in the basal ganglia. Lieber included the medical students: \"What do we worry about with basal-ganglia lesions?\" The bodily jeremiad now also included a likely toxoplasmosis infection to the brain. The field of medicine has advanced through measuring: weight, blood pressure, dosage, cost, days until discharge, years until death. American health has also benefitted tremendously from the abandonment of superstition\u2014nineteenth-century American physicians left infected wounds festering and undrained, because they believed in \"noble pus\"\u2014and the move toward evidence-based decision-making. But sometimes the medical field makes the mistake of valuing most what is most easily measured. Lieber attended public high school in Forest Hills and then went to Queens College. Afterward, he applied to seventy-two medical schools, and was accepted by none. \"It's an old story\u2014you have a defeat, you come back stronger,\" he told me. \"If you go through the cookie-cutter mold, do A, B, C, D, you, well\u2014what is the word\u2014you lose interest in being.\" Lieber ended up attending medical school at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guadalajara. Foreign medical schools don't command much respect in the United States. Gary Wisner, who is now an orthopedic surgeon in northern California, was a classmate of Lieber's in Guadalajara. \"To be honest, most of us were meatheads,\" he said. \"We knew why we were stuck in Guadalajara. But we were quickly, like, 'What is he doing here?' People float the word 'genius' too much, but, I'm telling you, he was a flaming genius. I went back to New York one time with him in large part because I was literally on a genetic investigation to find out where in the hell this kid was from.\" In Guadalajara, Lieber fell into the role of informal teacher. \"A lot of us owe our careers to him,\" Wisner said. \"If you were having trouble passing neuroanatomy, he was going to sit there alongside you for several all-nighters. He really saved us. When we would get down, Joe would tell us that there wasn't anything that could be taught at Harvard or Yale that we couldn't learn just as well in our little room in Guadalajara.\" \"Guadalajara was nice,\" Lieber told me. \"I had an apartment for fifty dollars a month, with maid service six days a week. I remember once when I was in a car accident down there, in my friend's VW Rabbit, no seat belt. I was hit by a truck. I lost five units of blood and had a ruptured spleen. So I missed an exam, but they were very kind, and they rescheduled it for me.\" After decades of practice as a diagnostician and an educator, Lieber is an associate professor at Mount Sinai, and is paid less than the majority of doctors in New York. In most fields, talent and professional standing do not coincide, but such inefficiencies of pay and recognition are symptomatic of the medical system's effective values. Eric Krieger, a cardiologist at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, who, like Dean Muller, trained and taught as a chief resident under Lieber, said, \"You can't advance professionally just by being an amazing clinician and teacher.\" Many of the physicians I spoke to agreed. \"Lieber's an absolutely incredible physician in a way that's now completely obsolete in the field of medicine,\" Krieger continued. \"And let me be clear what I mean by 'obsolete': that's a flaw in how medicine is evaluated and rewarded, not a flaw in what he does. He's the best diagnostician and teacher I've known.\" In the nineteenth century, the education of American doctors typically consisted of two sixteen-week semesters of lectures\u2014often the same lectures both semesters\u2014and no time in a hospital or a laboratory. The entrance requirement for medical schools was little more than the ability to pay the fees. In 1871, a Harvard medical-school professor was pressed to give students written examinations as a graduation requirement; he said that it would never work, because fewer than half his students could write. In \"Learning to Heal,\" a 1985 history of the medical-education system, Kenneth Ludmerer, examining the Civil War era, writes, \"Delusions of an erudite medical profession were shattered by the results of the written examinations of the military medical boards.\" They concluded that \"the typical physician expressed 'vague and confused' ideas in 'barbarous English' that was 'at defiance with all rules of grammar.' \" More than twice as many soldiers in the Civil War died from disease as from combat. (By the Second World War, less than one per cent of American soldier deaths were from disease.) When a Union surgeon general banned the use of two popular but toxic emetics, he was court-martialled for misconduct, and condemned by the American Medical Association. As Ludmerer notes, \"The training and skills of the average doctor were hopelessly inadequate, even based on existing standards of the day.\" After the Civil War, medical-school graduates who had the means began to go to Europe for postgraduate training, and especially to Germany, where medical schools were incorporated into universities and included experimental and clinical work, and where the scientific method was the norm. But physicians who returned to America hoping to find research and teaching jobs like those they had seen in Germany found instead only skepticism. Then, in 1909, the educator Abraham Flexner, commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, began visiting all hundred and fifty-five medical schools in the U.S. and Canada. Flexner, who later conceived of the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, found that some schools were not even offering the courses they claimed to teach. Many provided only classroom lessons, which, unconnected to clinical or laboratory experience, Flexner considered \"utterly worthless.\" After his report was issued, nearly half the medical schools in the country closed down. The German model completed its voyage across the Atlantic. Ludmerer told me, \"Flexner insisted on one type of medical school\u2014a university school, with full-time faculty and a research enterprise.\" Today's medical schools are supported primarily by two revenue streams: research and clinical care. Research brings in grants that fund the salaries of physicians, and clinical care brings in revenue as fees for service. This puts physicians under pressure to produce more research and to see more patients per hour, leaving teaching as a sort of loss leader. \"I really like to teach,\" Kaidi Fullerton, the medical director of the pediatric-emergency department of Inova Fairfax Hospital, in Virginia, said to me. \"But I also get paid based on how many patients I see in an hour. And that's also how the hospital gets paid. Having a student slows me down; I essentially have to spend money in order to teach. I do it, but it's a pure give.\" Teaching at medical schools pays poorly, when it pays at all. In recent years, a number of schools have tried to devote more financial resources to teaching\u2014including the Mayo Clinic, which started a program to add up to twenty per cent to faculty salaries\u2014but the problem is exacerbated by the fact that teaching rarely figures into promotions. In 2009, Johns Hopkins established the Institute for Excellence in Education, which offers a number of teaching awards and is pursuing the seemingly modest goal of tracking how much time physicians devote to teaching. However, physicians have been resistant to taking the time to do the documentation. When I asked Lieber why he thought that educators weren't much valued in medicine, he shrugged. \"Oh, people are always giving teachers a hard time,\" he said. \"Look at the way they write about the public-school teachers in the Post.\" I have never heard Lieber complain about any aspect of his work, not even paperwork. \"It's true that it's research that gets the kudos,\" he said. \"You have to love what you do.\" The word \"pedagogy\" comes from the Greek term for the slave who escorted a child to school. Yet, even as medical schools across the country have taken note of the problem, it remains difficult to develop great clinical education and to reward it financially. \"We're making progress in quantitative assessments of teaching,\" Jorie Colbert-Getz, the senior director of medical education at the University of Utah, told me. \"But we still aren't sure how to do the qualitative assessment. Should we use evaluations from students? Evaluations from peers?\" A medication's effect on blood pressure can be measured, but there's no sphygmomanometer for clinical teaching. \"We want our young physicians to become lifelong self-directed learners,\" Colbert-Getz said. \"That's what great teaching should lead to.\" Lieber would not likely attend seminars on teaching\u2014he has no time\u2014or keep track of the hours he devotes to teaching, or apply for an award that could then bulk up his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for promotion. He is a model only on the individual level. \"I always wanted to be like him,\" Tanya Page, a family practitioner in Portland, Oregon, who now works mostly with homeless youths and adults, told me. \"Dr. Lieber's work struck me as much more glamorous and exciting than the G.I. physician I worked with on my primary-care rotation, who scoped rich patients all day in a fancy Upper East Side office, and went home at 4 P.M., and wore a watch worth more than all my belongings.\" On Lieber's bookshelf, there are two photographs. One is of him with his wife and two daughters. The other is of a statue of a man on a horse, situated in a town square. \"That's General Zhukov,\" Lieber explained. A colleague had recently gone to Russia. \"Dr. Masci took that photo for me, because he knows Zhukov is one of my favorites.\" Zhukov was the greatest of Soviet generals and the hero of Stalingrad. After the war, Life wrote a hagiographic profile of Zhukov, crediting him with the use of underwater bridges, built just a foot or so below the surface of the water: tanks could cross the bridges, but enemy bombers flying overhead could not see them. It wasn't true, yet I found the idea analogous to the problem of developing good clinical education: it's difficult to see and thus difficult to target for rewards. But maybe it's more that teaching's being so difficult to see may be what best protects it. Shortly before teaching rounds at Elmhurst one afternoon, a young Indian woman named Anita, from the billing department, came into the medical team's tiny conference room asking \"for just five minutes of everyone's time,\" to give a presentation about \"clinically precise documentation.\" There were about fifteen doctors and doctors-in-training crowded into a five-by-ten-foot space, with four computers, and takeout menus for empanadas and Chinese food taped on the wall, along with a sign that read, \"If you put your belongings on the air conditioner, it will get hot and stinky in here.\" Anita began, \"Please don't write 'poorly controlled diabetes' in the patients' charts if, in fact, the diabetes is uncontrolled. Write 'uncontrolled,' because we can't bill for 'poorly controlled.' \" She passed out multicolored laminated note cards detailing how to document various conditions so that treatment could be properly accounted; these laminated cards were among the most luxurious items I saw at Elmhurst. \"If you write 'renal insufficiency,' \" Anita continued, \"it won't get coded, and then we won't get paid. You need to write 'C.K.D.' \"\u2014chronic kidney disease\u2014\"and you need to specify the stage.\" Again, she directed the doctors to the laminated cards for billably precise definitions of the stages. \"And this one is easy to forget. If your patient has a B.M.I. of thirty or over, please document 'obesity.' This is a medical condition, as you know. If they have a B.M.I. of over forty, please document 'morbid obesity.' This will really help us out. Thank you.\" Dr. Lieber thanked Anita. Then teaching rounds began. That day, two patients on the ward had elevated sodium levels, a condition known as hypernatremia. \"This comes up so often,\" Lieber said. \"The question is whether to treat, and with what.\" Imagine if a sunset were not obviously notable in any way and yet you had to teach people why the sunset looks the way it does: the refraction of light, the spectrum, the atmosphere. You were trying to show people how magnificent and illuminating and useful the concepts that explain sunsets are, but you had to do it without the beautiful prompt of the setting sun. Instead, the prompt is a number on a piece of paper and a tired and sick person lying in a bed complaining of something unrelated to his sodium level. That's why hypernatremia is an enormous teaching challenge\u2014it appears at first to be really boring. And yet learning about it is essential, because good medical care is more often about the everyday work of diagnosing and managing multiple familiar things than it is about feats of Holmesian deduction. \"Did anyone read about the case of the man who tried to commit suicide by drinking twenty jars of soy sauce?\" Lieber said. The students debated whether the man should have been rehydrated with normal saline solution or with something more diluted. \"What about the cases back in the nineteen-eighties, when the baby-food manufacturer accidentally put sodium instead of carbohydrates into a batch of the product?\" Lieber asked. How did those babies likely present to the hospital? What kind of treatment should they have received? He gently steered the conversation. The cases he brought up were extreme, but instructive, and though the conversation wandered among arcana, there were two practical points that Lieber wanted everyone to remember. Even I remember them: hypernatremic patients should almost always be rehydrated with the usual one-half-normal saline solution, even though it contains sodium; and this is mainly because hypernatremia will almost always be a case of dehydration, not of high sodium intake. And yet most of the cases discussed were of high intake; they were the rare exceptions rather than the bread-and-butter norms. Lieber's method for handling more information was to teach from the extremes, where the interest is obvious. It reminded me of the best English teacher I ever had, Dr. Elizabeth Ballard, of Norman High School, in Oklahoma, who, though she had us read the straightforwardly appealing novel \"Tom Jones\" on our own, knew that we had no kinship with Chaucer, and so had us read the tales aloud to each other, in nearly incomprehensible Middle English; the experience stayed in our heads decades later, as a memory of speaking strange. On another afternoon, during intern report, it was Lieber's diagnostic acumen that was on display. Hearing that someone is a great diagnostician is sort of like hearing that someone is really funny; it is not evident in every encounter. But the cases chosen for presentation at intern and resident reports are usually either complicated or obscure; only the presenter knows the case outcome, which lends a Poirot-like drama to events. The presenting intern or resident begins by saying something like \"I am a twenty-seven-year-old Pakistani female presenting to the emergency room complaining of dizziness.\" Such beginnings can go almost anywhere\u2014from minor flu to psychosis or cancer. The other interns and residents ask the presenter about her medical history, then move on to a physical exam, and, finally, to laboratory and imaging results. An invited attending physician, who also does not know the diagnostic outcome, tries to draw out teaching points. I had heard several stories of Lieber's extraordinary diagnostic exploits in that role. In one, a resident report had been scheduled to run an extra thirty minutes, because of the obscurity and mysteriousness of the case, which had remained a diagnostic puzzle for years. POEMS is a very rare syndrome that can look like a blood problem or a skin problem or a nervous-system problem, or like none or all of those, and can be lethal if undiagnosed. About five minutes into the presentation, Lieber had said, \"Oh, and we should put POEMS on the differential diagnosis, right?\" \"It was like watching a guy juggle fifty flaming torches on a unicycle,\" one physician said. \"A lot of people in medicine are smart enough, and know a lot of esoterica, but when they bring it up they're generally just wrong. Someone will come in with a rash and an attending physician will say, 'Oh, this could be arsenic poisoning,' and then bloviate for a while about it, and, of course, it's never actually arsenic poisoning. It's just a chance to show off. But if Lieber brings up something arcane it's because it's relevant.\" At another resident report, Lieber had called a case of MAGIC, a syndrome involving multiple inflammatory disorders that is so rare that it usually doesn't appear in textbooks. This day's intern report took place in another small, run-down conference room, where the phone kept ringing. Takeout Chinese food and Diet Coke cans crowded the table, and the window blinds were broken. The room was populated by a crowd of young doctors and Lieber, the attending physician. It begins simply: a young Asian woman doctor says, \"I am a thirty-two-year-old male presenting to the E.R., complaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea.\" This complaint is so common that it has probably happened even to you. We obtain a history of mild fevers and weight loss. We learn that the patient is originally from Colombia, that he came to the United States at eighteen, then lived in Spain, with a boyfriend, until about four years ago, when he came back, on his own, to New York. Lieber interjects, \"We should think, Is place going to tell us something in this case?\" Most of the doctors are probably running through a category list in their mind, thinking, Is this infectious? Is this endocrinal? They are thinking through the various systems of the body. One doctor mentions a type of cancer of the blood; another suggests MENS (multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome). Lieber encourages the questioning but adds, \"What is the key separating question, guys?\" He is pushing everyone to think of what fact will make certain diagnoses dramatically more likely, and the rest dramatically less. \"What is going to split the path of the differential diagnosis?\" We all suddenly recognize that the patient's H.I.V. status is crucial. This is when a sad novelistic inevitability, separate from lab tests, enters the room. The patient reports a negative test from four years earlier, when his relationship with the boyfriend ended. He reports that he has not been tested since, because he has been in a long-term monogamous relationship. His current boyfriend works on Wall Street. The patient works as a waiter at a high-end restaurant. The crowd of physicians is stuck. Or very into their Chinese food. The presenter who has been acting as the patient starts to seem again like a young Asian physician-in-training. \"Do you guys want to keep davening?\" Lieber says. \"Or shall we order labs and do a physical exam? And, remember, we're charging everything to your MasterCard, so think about what you really want to get.\" Lieber reminds the physicians not to forget about tuberculosis, which often appears in the guise of other diseases. It is known in medicine as the great mimic. The group thinks that tuberculosis is unlikely, but dutifully includes it in the accumulating differential diagnosis. Something endocrinal or a cancer seems more likely. Lots of other data are obtained: a small amount of blood in the stool, a slightly low potassium level, the sedimentation rate of the red blood cells\u2014on and on, a pileup of exams and labs. The data seem to push us backward rather than draw us toward a conclusion. \"Does anyone know what was seen in Spain in the early AIDS epidemic?\" Lieber asks. The question feels like an interesting but irrelevant digression. \"We see less and less of opportunistic infections these days, but in the early days of H.I.V., before antiretrovirals, we would see these opportunistic diseases that would pick up where people were from. In Spain, we would see histoplasmosis, though it's usually from where? . . . That's right, from the Ohio River Valley.\" Histoplasmosis generally appears to be a respiratory problem; it is caused by a fungus found mostly in caves and around bird and bat droppings. No one is taking histoplasmosis seriously in his differential. More lab tests come in. The patient turns out to be positive for H.I.V. A CT scan of the abdomen suggests Crohn's disease, which is not consistent with other things we know about the patient; however, a Crohn's-appearing CT is consistent with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis, we recall, is the great mimic. \"And what do they say about histoplasmosis?\" Lieber goads. Histoplasmosis is an even greater mimic. \"Everything that TB does, histo can do better.\" The patient doesn't have Crohn's, and he doesn't have TB. The room finds out thirty minutes later that he has histoplasmosis, which is also known by the distressingly resonant moniker of Darling's disease, after its discoverer, Samuel Taylor Darling. Lieber had said at the beginning, What role will place have in this case? After the report, the room comes back into view. Several of the physicians line up to ask Lieber questions. I notice the smell of takeout noodles. I'm suddenly tired; it feels like a hospital again. \"She did such a good job with that case,\" Dr. Lieber said to me of the presenting intern as we left, walking back to the ward he was covering. He didn't say what the rest of us were thinking: Lieber nailed it. He called each fork in the differential-diagnostic road exactly right, in an undemanding, haunting way. That haunting is, I think, why Lieber's teaching stays with a person, like a story that you understand enough but not quite everything about, and so it remains in your mind, to be turned over and re\u00ebxamined. On a recent afternoon, I asked Lieber how he thought things would likely go for the XDR-tuberculosis patient. \"To be honest, it doesn't look so good,\" he said. A young, very dark-skinned patient from a different ward was jogging lightly up and down the hall. His brain appeared to be herniating out of his skull and, indeed, it was, because he had had a portion of his skull removed, with the goal of safely accommodating brain swelling. \"It sounds surprising, I know, but that usually works out pretty well,\" Lieber said. The swelling goes down; the piece of skull bone, having been stored in the patient's thigh, is eventually returned to its proper location. It was ghastly and inspiring at the same time, like the defense of Stalingrad. The hero of Stalingrad, General Zhukov, was a great trainer of soldiers, but he was also notoriously brutal. A neurologist friend of mine, Jessica Robinson, of Mount Sinai, said, in confessing a difficulty of teaching, \"Sometimes it feels like Sartre's 'No Exit': you find yourself saying the same things over and over again; you have to remind yourself that it's a new group of students, that they're not just the same people renewing their ignorance to torture you.\" Teaching is like being a battle-hardened soldier placed again and again among the greens. As a student, I spent only about two months under the supervision of Dr. Lieber. A year later, I became an M.D., then immediately left the field of medicine. I took with me little more than an aversion to medical knowledge and a suspicious and fearful demeanor as a patient. The other day, I couldn't even remember the generic name for Tylenol, and I felt kind of happy about that. But I have always remembered Lieber, because we always remember our great teachers, and wonder how they did it, and at what cost. \"Really the most distinctive thing about Dr. Lieber,\" Dr. Linden said to me one day, \"is that he is always nice. It's a mystery how "}
