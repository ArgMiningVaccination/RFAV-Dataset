Discover the Weleda new-look Oral Care range", "sitename": "weleda.co.uk", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "The natural way to a healthy smile Discover our Oral Care range We have been making natural dental products since the early 1920s when our original toothpaste and mouthwash were first introduced - both of which are still going strong 100 years later! Today the Weleda oral care range includes five natural toothpastes and a natural mouthwash, developed with dentists, each with different flavours and benefits, and made with organic plant extracts that have been carefully selected for teeth and gums. In fact, the list of things not included in our range is equally, if not more, significant. The products contain no detergents, bleaches, foam boosters or optical brighteners. They are made without synthetic fragrances, colourants, flavourings, deodorants, sweetening agents, emulsifiers, disinfectants or triclosan, so the balance of natural flora in the mouth - or microbiome - is not disturbed. All ingredients are GM-free and the full range is NATRUE-certified genuinely natural. The range is also made without added fluoride, which is particularly popular in areas where water supplies contain added fluoride. Dentist [Fred Dartford](https://www.weleda.co.uk/magazine/natural-way-healthy-smile), who has specialised in holistic dentistry for over 15 years, appreciates the importance of maintaining a healthy microbiome in the mouth: \"Probably as many as 700 different bacteria live in the mouth, some good, some bad, but in harmony - it does not take much to upset the balance. Some toothpastes and mouthwashes can contain quite harsh ingredients that can do exactly this. Natural oral care products tend to avoid these harsh ingredients, therefore it makes sense to use them to help maintain that important balance of flora in the mouth. \"I dislike triclosan as an ingredient, which is a known irritant - a range of studies suggest potential harmful effects for human health, polluting the planet and possibly even contributing to antibiotic resistance. I also like to avoid sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), a foaming agent, as it may cause ulcers. Fluoride-free oral care products are useful in areas where water contains fluoride, and are particularly useful when children are learning not to swallow toothpaste. Of course, brushing is the most important factor, backed up with a good toothpaste.\" The brightly-coloured chunky toothpaste tubes, made from recyclable aluminium and lined with a special protective lacquer, are designed to sit nose-down for handy storage in the bathroom.
