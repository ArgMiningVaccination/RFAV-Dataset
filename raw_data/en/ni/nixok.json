We get it: The idea of avoiding medication and using seemingly simpler solutions to ease your symptoms sounds like a win-win. However, it's worth noting that \"natural\" doesn't mean much in the context of seasonal allergy treatment\u2014things like essential oils and honey are often seen as \"natural\" but can actually cause [allergic reactions](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/allergic-reactions) in some people. And drinking apple cider vinegar, which some people claim helps their allergies, won't do anything for your sniffling\u2014but it may hurt your stomach, according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exploring-the-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar/). Instead, you may want to think of the tips that we'll get into as home remedies for seasonal allergies and lifestyle changes you can try before you loop in your doctor for help. [Seasonal allergies](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/seasonal-allergies), which for many people start in the spring1, can be especially misery-inducing, but know that a few small changes can make a big difference when it comes to avoiding your personal triggers. Ahead, we break down how allergy symptoms can make you feel, the \"natural\" home remedies for seasonal allergies you can try, and when it's time to see a doc if you dread being around trees or grass. [What causes seasonal allergies?](#causes) | [Seasonal allergy symptoms](#symptoms) | [Natural remedies for seasonal allergies](#natural-remedies) | [Seasonal allergy medicine](#doctor) What causes seasonal allergies? Generally, your immune system tries to protect your body from getting sick by attacking potentially harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. But sometimes it mistakenly attacks substances that are typically not a significant threat to most people, such as food, pollen, or mold, according to the [American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology](https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/allergy,-asthma-immunology-glossary/allergic-reaction-defined) (AAAAI). When a person with allergies breathes in a trigger (an allergen), their immune system goes into overdrive trying to fight it off by producing antibodies. These antibodies signal your body to release histamines, chemicals that set off bodily responses designed to get rid of the allergen ASAP. \"The body tries to expel the allergen by sneezing or having a watery nose or [watery eyes](https://www.self.com/story/watery-eyes-causes). It may also try to prevent further invasion by having the nose get stuffy, so it's harder for anything else to get in,\" [Lara Gross, MD](https://www.texashealth.org/Providers/Affiliated/Dallas-Allergy--Asthma-Center/AllergyImmunology/lara-gross-md), an allergist and immunologist with [Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas](https://www.texashealth.org/Locations/Texas-Health-Dallas), tells SELF. Seasonal allergies may start in the spring, but your symptoms can vary depending on environmental factors\u2014like when the plants start blooming in your area\u2014and how much of a particular allergen you're exposed to, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/effects/allergen.htm). The biggest seasonal allergy triggers include: - Pollen, which can actually be a problem most of the year, is a powdery seed plant substance released into the air. Trees generally release pollen during the spring; grass typically releases pollen during late spring and summer, and ragweed produces pollen in the fall3. - Indoor mold spores, which can grow after heavy rain or when heat and humidity rise, typically during the spring, summer, and fall months. That said, mold can grow year-round, particularly if you're in spaces with water damage or poor ventilation. What are some common seasonal allergy symptoms? When your body is responding to an allergen, it lets you know. According to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/seasonal-allergies-at-a-glance#:~:text=People%20with%20seasonal%20allergies%20(also,nose%2C%20mouth%2C%20and%20throat.) (NCCIH), people with seasonal allergies may get slammed with symptoms such as: - Stuffy or runny nose and excess [mucus](https://www.self.com/story/yellow-mucus-meaning) - Itchy eyes, nose, mouth, or throat - Red, watery, and puffy eyes - Sneezing - Coughing - Fatigue Sometimes these symptoms can feel like a cold or [another respiratory infection like COVID-19](https://www.self.com/story/coronavirus-vs-allergies). If you're not quite sure what you're dealing with, pay close attention to other symptoms that might be surfacing. A cold or flu-like infection may also cause additional warning signs such as fever, chills, and body aches, [Ratika Gupta, MD](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/ratika-gupta-874655), an allergist and immunologist with [New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital](https://www.nyp.org/brooklyn?gclsrc=aw.ds&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=nyph_brooklyn&utm_id=nyph_brooklyn_ppc_brand&utm_content=brand&gclid=Cj0KCQiApL2QBhC8ARIsAGMm-KGKeJx7inxsL1Gs5Tv1V0HJN6XRRuan0JF2C4pYcRMQS8624zR_-lYaAmV8EALw_wcB), tells SELF. \"Allergies should not cause any of those things,\" Dr. Gupta says. What's more, seasonal allergy symptoms tend to last longer, according to the [National Library of Medicine](https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/what-triggers-seasonal-allergies) (NLM). If you're unsure about what's going on and you've had symptoms for longer than a week, scheduling an appointment with your doctor can help you figure out what's driving your discomfort. Do \"natural\" remedies for seasonal allergies work? If you have mild allergy symptoms\u2014meaning it feels like you have a slight cold but you're not 100% miserable\u2014then trying certain \"natural\" remedies for seasonal allergies at home may be worth a shot before you turn to allergy medications. Here are some common ones to consider: This is an important one! Understanding the cause of your symptoms plays a vital role in seasonal allergy management, according to [Beth Corn, MD](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/beth-e-corn), associate professor of medicine and clinical immunology at [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://www.mountsinai.org/). She recommends getting a skin allergy test if possible. There are numerous allergy tests, but the common skin prick test involves scratching or poking your skin with the various allergens and waiting to see if you develop a reaction, such as redness, according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/21495-allergy-testing). \"It takes a minute, and within 15 minutes you know what you are allergic to,\" Dr. Corn tells SELF. Once you have this information, you can do your best to minimize contact with your personal allergy triggers. To do this, keep your windows closed and, if it's too warm, use air conditioning to stay cool if you can. We know this is a bummer, but letting air in also invites allergens into your home\u2014which is exactly what you don't want. Be sure to also check your window sills and frames for condensation, which can contribute to mold growth. Of course it's impossible to avoid allergens completely, but you can filter them out of the air and reduce your exposure by using an [air purifier](https://www.self.com/story/air-purifier-buying-guide) that has high-efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter. A HEPA filter can remove about 99.7% of mold, dust, pollen, bacteria, and other irritating particles from the air, according to the [United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter-1). You may also want to consider using a dehumidifier in your home, which can help remove excess moisture from the air to decrease mold growth. These can be especially helpful in areas that are usually pretty damp, such as the bathroom or basement. Before making a purchase, you might want to talk to your doctor about specific models they recommend using to reduce allergy symptoms specifically. After running or spending other time outside, if you can, remove your shoes and avoid wearing them inside, Dr. Corn says. Allergens can cling to your shoes, and the less you can track inside, the better. The [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/in-depth/allergy/art-20049365) recommends vacuuming weekly with a vacuum cleaner that has a HEPA filter to help eliminate pollen or mold spores from your floors. Allergens can land in your hair, on your skin, and on your clothes while you're outdoors. When you come indoors, toss your clothes in the hamper and take a quick shower to wash any pollen off of your skin and hair. Similarly, avoid hanging your laundry outdoors. This may be an energy-efficient way to dry your clothes, but it's also one way to reintroduce pollen and other allergens onto your clean items. Dust mites are the most common trigger of year-round allergies and [allergic asthma](https://www.self.com/story/allergic-asthma-triggers), according to the [Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America](https://www.aafa.org/dust-mite-allergy/), but they especially thrive in humid environments, which can become worse from spring to fall. To help reduce your reaction to dust mites, wrap your pillows, mattress, and box spring with zippered, dust-proof covers. Additionally, change your sheets weekly (wash them in hot water if you can) and avoid sleeping with your pets if possible\u2014even if you're not allergic to your pet specifically. Animals can have dust, pollen, and other allergens on their fur\u2014which you don't exactly want in your bed. Pollen counts are typically highest in the morning, so you may want to wait until the afternoon to go for your run. If you have severe seasonal allergies, you may want to skip exercising outdoors and [try an indoor workout](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-at-home-workouts-bodyweight). You can typically find this information from your local weather forecast or by using an allergy tracker app, like [My Pollen Forecast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-pollen-forecast-allergies/id1244428929). And remember that staying inside is most helpful when you also keep your doors and windows closed as much as possible, Dr. Gross says. They don't just protect against COVID-19, people! In addition to blocking out potentially infectious respiratory droplets, protective face masks\u2014ideally a surgical mask or an N95 mask for max protection4\u2014can shield your nose and mouth from allergens. Consider wearing one when you're cleaning, which can kick up a lot of dust, or when you're outside for long periods of time. \"The proteins in raw fruit and vegetables are similar to the proteins in pollen. So if you're allergic to tree pollen, when you take a bite of apples, cherries, pears, among others, your body sees it as pollen,\" Dr. Corn explains. \"And then you get an itchy mouth and throat.\" Carrots, peanuts, almonds, and hazelnuts may also cause a reaction. However, if you cook these foods, \"the proteins come apart and your body doesn't recognize them as anything dangerous or bothersome,\" Dr. Corn adds. For a full list of potential food reactions, check out this chart from the [AAAAI](https://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/Media-Library-PDFs/Tools%20for%20the%20Public/Conditions%20Library/Library%20-%20Allergies/OAS-table_revised.pdf). Putting a saline solution into one nostril and letting it drain out the other nostril can help clear irritants like pollen out of your nasal passages, according to the [NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/tips/things-to-know-about-complementary-health-approaches-for-seasonal-allergy-relief). Dr. Gross suggests doing this as soon as you come inside after being outdoors to quickly clear out any allergens. But avoid using water straight from the tap: It can contain low levels of bacteria that, while safe to swallow, could cause a potential infection when poured into your nasal passages, per the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/rinsing-your-sinuses-neti-pots-safe). You can purchase either distilled bottled water or boil and cool (like, really cool) your tap water before using it for the saline solution. Make your own rinse by combining three teaspoons of iodide-free salt with one teaspoon of baking soda, and then using one teaspoon of that mixture with eight ounces of water, the [AAAAI](https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/saline-sinus-rinse-recipe) recommends. It's definitely not a cure-all but some evidence suggests that acupuncture might complement your other symptom management strategies, Dr. Gupta says. People with seasonal allergies who underwent acupuncture treatments experienced fewer nasal symptoms compared to those who didn't have acupuncture, according to a 2015 review of studies that included 2,365 people5. It's not clear exactly why, but the researchers theorize that acupuncture may help control the number of cytokines, which are inflammatory proteins, that are released during an allergic reaction6. When should you consider using seasonal allergy medicine? There's no cure for seasonal allergies (womp womp), but taking over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines2 can help when \"natural\" remedies for seasonal allergies aren't enough. If you're using allergy medications, it's often helpful to take them before your symptoms even start. Most people take medication when their seasonal allergies begin to cause trouble, but you can get a leg up on things by starting earlier, [Purvi Parikh, MD](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1629212592/purvi-s-parikh), an allergist and immunologist with [NYU Langone](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1629212592/purvi-s-parikh), who is allergic to grass pollen herself, tells SELF. Grass pollen starts becoming bothersome in springtime, so Dr. Parikh begins using allergy meds like antihistamines two weeks before the season starts. This helps her reduce symptoms or even avoid them altogether, she says. You can also try OTC nasal corticosteroids, which are sprayed or inhaled into the nose to help relieve your stuffy nose and irritation caused by allergies. It's important to talk to your doctor, preferably an allergist if you have access to one, before trying any other \"natural\" remedies for seasonal allergies, like herbs or supplements. For example, some people who are allergic to ragweed, daisies, and marigolds can also be allergic to chamomile tea, according to the [NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/chamomile#:~:text=Rare%20cases%20of%20anaphylaxis%20(a,chrysanthemums%2C%20marigolds%2C%20or%20daisies.), which could do more harm than good in that case. If the suggested home remedies for seasonal allergies and OTC drugstore medications don't help your symptoms, you may want to talk to your doctor about other seasonal allergy management strategies. There are more [targeted treatment options](https://www.self.com/story/allergic-reaction-treatment), such as immunotherapy in the form of allergy shots, that might bring you the greater relief you're hoping for.
