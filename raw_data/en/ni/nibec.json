The MWMP permits and inspects all medical waste offsite treatment facilities and medical waste transfer stations. In addition to the treatment methods specifically allowed in the MWMA, there are alternative medical waste treatment technologies approved for use in California. Additionally, the MWMP acts as the local enforcement agency in a number of local jurisdictions that elected to have the State implement the large quantity generator inspection program for medical waste management.
