Guemez-Gamboa, Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Neuroscience Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University Biography: Dr. Alicia Guemez-Gamboa earned her BS in Biology and her PhD in Biomedical Sciences from the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. She then completed postdoctoral training at the University of California, San Diego and at The Rockefeller University. Her research aimed to understand how neural circuits assemble during development and disease by uncovering fundamental means of neural differentiation, synaptic formation, cell death and their functional interaction. Dr. Guemez-Gamboa is currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Neuroscience at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Northwestern University. Dr. Guemez-Gamboa's laboratory is focused on investigating the molecular and cellular pathways that orchestrates neural circuit assembly dysfunction leads to neurodevelopmental disorders. She aims to uncover the mechanisms by which cell-surface recognition molecules and somatic mosaicism determine cellular identity to ensure proper neuronal connectivity by coupling human genetics, next generation sequencing, and disease modeling using animal and stem cells. Particularly, she uses induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients as well as CRISPR edited iPSC to generate neural progenitors, neurons, and forebrain organoids predisposed to neurodevelopmental disorders. Characterization of these models helps elucidating the mechanisms of disease of a variety of brain connectivity defects and lays the groundwork for the development of new therapeutic approaches and personalized medicine. Dr. Guemez-Gamboa is a 2022 Mentoring Institute for Neuroscience Diversity Scholars (MINDS) Fellow. Talk Title & Description: \"Cell-type Specific Alterations Underpinning PACS1 Neurodevelopmental Disorder: Uncovering Novel Therapy Avenues\" PACS1 syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities resulting from a de novo p.R203W variant in phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS1). PACS1 plays roles in the endosomal pathway and nucleus, but little is known about how this variant affects developing neurons and patients have few therapeutic options. Here, we used stem cellderived models to show that PACS1(+/R203W) neurons have impaired expression of genes enriched for synaptic signaling processes. We assessed the functional impact of this differential expression and find that PACS1(+/R203W) neurons have a striking prolongation of network burst duration resulting from an increased inter-spike interval. These results suggest that an aberrant regulation of ionic flux affecting spike frequency underlies the neurological phenotypes experienced by patients. This work is the first to investigate the impact of the PACS1 p.R203W variant on developing neural tissue, revealing electrophysiological mechanisms of disease and putative targets for pharmacological intervention. 7 Keynote Speaker Andr\u00e9 Fenton, Ph.D. Professor Neurobiology of Cognition Laboratory Director, Center for Neural Science and Neuroscience Institute New York University Langone Medical Center Biography: Dr. Andr\u00e9 Fenton is the PI of the Neurobiology of Cognition Laboratory at NYU.

The central aim of this current study was to determine whether there is a relationship between the immune system and the brain concentrations of Glx (Glutamate + Glutamine) in FM patients using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after an endotoxin-driven immune challenge. Twelve women with FM and 13 age-matched healthy controls completed the study. Participants underwent an MRI 1.5 hours before receiving 0.3ng/kg versus 0.4ng/kg endotoxin and 4 hours after. Glx was measured in 47 brain regions. We conducted a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time as the within-subjects factor (pre-LPS, post-LPS) and the study group as the between-subject factor (FM, healthy control); additionally, we looked at dosage as another between-subjects factor. A p< 0.05 was set as the statistical significance threshold for all analyses. We found significant time-by-group interactions in the right precentral gyrus, the right supplementary motor area, and the left anterior cingulate cortex. We found no significant time-by-dosage interactions. There were also signif - icant main effects of time in several regions. Before receiving LPS, FM patients reported lower Glx compared to healthy controls. After receiving LPS, we found no significant differences between groups. Lastly, we found several regions that significantly increase Glx pre- to post- LPS. These preliminary findings suggest that FM patients have increased Glx after receiving LPS. Increased Glx is be - lieved to be involved in common symptoms associated with FM. These findings warrant further study in a larger sample and look at separated Glu and Gln to see which is the catalyst for these changes. Presentation 2 Characterization of Conformally Coated Spinal Progenitor Cells Marin, B, BS 1, Gonzalez, G, BS 1, Al-Hanoosh, F, BS 1, Tomei, A, Ph.D. 1, Dumont, C, Ph.D. 1; 1Biomedical Engineering, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136. Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that disrupts autonomic, sensory, and motor function. Spinal progenitor cells (SPCs) can modulate the site into a more pro-regenerative milieu, but poor SPC survival due to inflammation can hamper transplant potential. Thin layered biomaterial encapsulation, termed conformal coating, is a technique that shields transplants from immune attack while allowing diffusion of nutrients and waste. Conformal coating reduces diffusion distances and minimizes transplant volume size compared to traditional encapsulations. Conformal coating has not been applied to SPCs as an SCI therapy, however, the objective of this study is to en - gineer a conformal coating capable of maintaining SPC survival and potency in inflammatory models. SPCs were expanded as neurospheres and encapsulated in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) capsule using a microfluidic platform. SPC viability, proliferation, SPC phenotype, and capsule integrity were evaluated over 14 days in vitro. Immunostain - ing and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate SPC outcomes. RNA was isolated from cell cultures to identify and quantify expression of specific marker proteins. Conformally coated neurospheres can be encapsulated without negatively impacting cell viability and sustained over a 2-week period. Future experiments will interrogate SPC secretory an - ti-inflammatory potential.16Presentation 3 A subpopulation of inhibitory neurons may regulate blood flow throughout brain states Fernanda Juarez Anaya, Catherine F. Ruff, Benjamin O. Brandeis, Sarah E. Ross, Alberto L. Vazquez Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neuronal activity vary across brain states. CBF increases during high gamma-band, re - lated to arousal, and during delta-band, related to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Inhibitory neurons, which are crucial for mediating brain states, are associated with the changes in CBF across brain states. However, whether the same populations of neurons regulate changes in CBF across brain states is unknown. Previous studies sug - gest that a subpopulation of somatostatin neurons that are depolarized by Tac1 (known as substance P), co-express (Tacr1) neuronal show Fos induction during NREM sleep, regulate CBF. Here, we characterize the activity of Tacr1 neurons across brain states and identify possible sources of Tac1 inputs to Tacr1 neurons. To measure changes in Tacr1 neuron activity during different brain states, we performed two-photon calcium imaging and pharmacological manipulations in Tacr1CreER mice expressing GCaMP, while simul - taneously measuring EEG and EMG. During periods of NREM sleep and following whisker stimulation, Tacr1 neuron activity increased. Administration of an antihistamine, which increases the probability of the animal sleeping, also increased Tacr1 neuron activity. Furthermore, to identify possible sources of Tac1 that could depolarize Tacr1 neurons, we used viral transfection mapping. This revealed that besides local projections of Tac1+ neurons, a population of Tac1+ neurons in the perirhinal cortex may be a source of Tac1. These results indicate that Tacr1 neuron activity varies across brain states and that the perirhinal cortex could be a source of Tac1 during NREM sleep. Presentation 4 Recovery of forearm and fine digit function after chronic spinal cord injury by simultaneous blockade of inhibito - ry matrix CSPG production and Daniel J.1,3,4,\u00a7, Silver, Jerry1,\u00a7 1Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. 2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK. 3Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Depart - ment of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Cleveland, Ohio. 4Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University, Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio. 5Wolfson Centre for Age-Re - lated Diseases, King's College London, London, UK. \u00a7 Denotes equal contribution Spinal cord injuries, for exists limited effective treatments, result in enduring paralysis and hypoesthesia due, in part, to the inhibitory microenvironment that develops and limits regeneration/sprouting, especially during chronic stag - es. Recently, we discovered that targeted enzymatic modulation of the inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) component the extracellular and perineuronal net (PNN) matrix via Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) rapidly restores robust respiratory function to the previously paralyzed hemi-diaphragm up to 1.5 years following a cervical level 2 hemi-transection. Importantly, ChABC treatment at cervical level 4 in this chronic model also elicited rapid improvements in gross upper arm function. In the present study, we sought to further optimize and elucidate the capacity for nerve sprouting/regeneration to restore crude as well as fine motor control of the forearm and digits at lengthy chronic stages post-injury. However, instead of using ChABC, we utilized a novel and more clinically relevant systemic combinatorial treatment strategy designed to both reduce and overcome inhibitory CSPGs simultaneous - ly and spatially extensively. Following a three-month upper cervical spinal hemi-lesion using adult female Sprague Dawley rats, we show that the combined treatment had a profound effect on functional recovery of the chronically paralyzed forelimb and paw, specifically during walking as well as precision movements of the digits. The regenera - tive and immune system related events that we describe deepen our basic understanding of the crucial role of CSPG mediated inhibition via the PTP receptor in constraining functional synaptic plasticity at lengthy time-points follow - ing SCI, hopefully leading to clinically relevant translational benefits.17Presentation 5 Ventral striatal dopamine encodes unique properties stimuli in mice L. Sof\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez1,2, Austen Fisher1, and J. Elliott Robinson1 1Rasopathy Program, Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medi - cal Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA 2Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is an evolutionarily conserved set of brain circuits that plays a role in at - tention, appetitive behavior, and reward processing. In this circuitry, ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain innervate targets ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dopaminergic signaling in the NAc has been widely studied for its role in behavioral reinforcement, reward prediction error encoding, and motivational salience. Less well characterized is the role of dopaminergic neurotrans - mission in the response to surprising or alerting sensory events. To address this, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight.2 and fiber photometry to explore the ability of striatal dopamine release in to encode the properties of salient visual stimuli in mice, such as threatening looming discs. We report that lateral NAc dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than visual stimulus threat lev - el. This encoding is highly sensitive, as lateral NAc dopamine could be evoked by light intensities that were imper - ceptible to human experimenters. We also found that light-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, robust despite previous exposure history, and involve multiple phototransduction pathways. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine system's ability to encode visual information in mice, potentially relevant to studies/pathologies involving light and downstream dopamine circuitry. Presentation 6 Nanopore long-read RNA sequencing reveals region-specific sex differences in wildtype mouse brain mRNA isoforms Emma F. Jones, Timothy C. Howton, Victoria L. Flanary, Brittany N. Lasseigne University of Alabama at Birmingham Introduction: The human brain has the most complex RNA splicing profile out of all tissues, and many neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with defects in alternative splicing (AS). AS is specific to a given biological condition, such as sex or brain region, similar to how diseases typically display a bias toward a condition. Unlike previous short-read technologies, long-read sequencing can capture full-length mRNA transcripts, essential for confi - dently determining the consequences of AS. Materials & Methods: We first extracted RNA from wildtype C57BL/6J mouse (n = 5 male and 5 female, age = 20 weeks) hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and cortex. We then prepared and librar - ies with the Oxford Nanopore GRIDion. We processed the resulting data with the nf-core nextflow nanoseq pipeline and performed differential transcript usage (DTU) analyses with IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR. Results: We identified significant region-specific transcript expression across all four mouse brain regions. Cerebel - lum had 438 genes with DTU, the most region-specific transcript expression across brain regions, followed by the striatum, cortex, and then hippocampus. We did not identify shared sex-specific DTU across all four brain regions but did identify 13 genes with sex-specfic DTU within brain regions. Interestingly, the striatum exhibited the most sex-specific splicing with 6 DTU genes, including Dhrs4. Finally, we determined 21 brain region-specific DTU genes that are known to be psychiatric disorder risk genes. Conclusion: Overall, with long-read RNA sequencing we identified different patterns of AS across wild-type mouse brain regions, including in genes known to be relevant to human disease.18Presentation 7 Diurnal Variation in Acetylcholine Modulation of Dopamine Dynamics Following Chronic Cocaine Intake Melody C. Iacino and Mark J. Ferris, Ph.D. Wake Forest University School of Medicine Despite decades of research into its neurobiological mechanisms, cocaine use disorder (CUD) remains a major worldwide health problem. One variable that is often overlooked in CUD research is cocaine-induced disruption of diurnal dopamine accumbens (NAc) core via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on DA terminals. Thus, ACh plays a critical role in motivated and reward-associated behaviors. Though the effect of chronic cocaine on DA signaling has been studied at single time points, cocaine-induced diurnal disruptions of DA release and their mechanisms have not been investigated. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry in a rodent model of cocaine self-administration following various access schedules [(Short continuous access (ShA), long continuous access (LgA), or intermittent access (IntA)] to test the hypothesis that diurnal variation and the CIN ACh influence on DA release will vary based on the pattern of cocaine availability. Consistent with the literature, we found that IntA resulted in cocaine intake that was comparable to ShA, but significantly less compared to LgA. Interestingly, IntA significantly increased DA release midway through the dark cycle while LgA increased DA release midway through the light cycle compared to other groups. Furthermore, the CIN ACh influence on DA release is greatest following IntA and LgA schedules versus ShA and relative to na\u00efve controls across time points. Understanding the influence of rhythms underlying NAc neurochemistry will provide a rationale for targeting these receptor systems as a mecha - nism for cocaine-induced disruptions. Presentation 8 Behavioral and neural analysis of global form sensitivity in developing macaques C. L. Rodr\u00edguez Deliz, Gerick M. Lee, Najib J. Majaj, J. Anthony Movshon and Lynne Kiorpes New York University Center for Neural Science Postnatal changes in shape discrimination cannot be entirely explained by maturation of the early visual pathway. We propose that development of extrastriate areas enables our ability to integrate lower-level contour information into global shape percepts. We studied neural signals in V1, V2, V4 and IT-areas known to respond selectively to textures, intermediate shapes and objects, respectively. It is unknown when selectivity for shapes emerges in early life, so we studied the development of form sensitivity in 4 macaques, ages 5 to 12 mo. We used radial frequency stimuli (RFS), circular targets whose radii are modulated sinusoidally. We tested monkeys' ability to discriminate RFS from circles as a function of the depth and frequency of modulation using a 4-alternative oddity task. Behavioral performance was best for higher radial frequencies and improved both longitudinally and cross-sectionally across our subjects. We placed 96-channel \"Utah\" arrays in V1/V2, V4 and IT, and recorded multi-unit neuronal responses to RFS from the same subjects during development. We used a maximum correlation coefficient classifier to measure neural decoding performance. V2, V4 and IT populations showed shape-selective responses even at the earliest ages tested. V4 and IT reliably signaled the presence of modulations near the behavioral threshold. Neural decoding was optimal for shorter time windows in older animals than in younger ones. However, we found no age-dependent differences in neural performance. Response changes in V4 and IT therefore do not account for the development of behavioral form sensitivity.19Presentation 9 Mechanosensory neurons responsible for dopaminergic activity and social-touch-like behaviors Rachel E. Frazer 1, Dr. Leah J. Elias2,3, Dr. Melanie Shaffler 2, Alexis A. Knight 1, Sarah Sorensen Ogata 1, Ziad Eltabakh 4 & Dr. Ishmail Abdus-Saboor 1. [1] Columbia University [2] University of Pennsylvania [3] Johns Hopkins University [4] LaGuardia High School. Social touch is known to elicit oxytocinergic and dopaminergic activity in the brain promoting stress relief, reward, and even analgesia. However, the molecular identity of the mechanosensory neurons responsible for transducing pleasurable touch and promoting bonding and social encounters has previously been unknown. Here, we aimed to determine if a candidate population of mechanosensory neurons that express mas-related g-coupled protein recep - tor B4 (Mrgprb4-lineage neurons) are necessary and sufficient for social-touch-like behaviors as well as activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) - areas important for determining reward. In order to test this, we used Cre-lox genetics to produce mice in which we could optogenetically activate these neurons (B4-ChR2) as well as mice that had these neurons ablated (B4- DTA) and recorded behavioral and neuronal responses to touch and Mrgprb4-lineage neuron stimulation. We found that mice with these neurons intact show normal sexual receptivity and release of dopamine into the NAc and that optogenetic activation of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons alone was sufficient to be rewarding shown by conditioned place preference and increased dopamine release. However, mice with these neurons ablated showed decreased sex - ual receptivity and decreased dopaminergic release during social encounters. Therefore, signaling between these neurons and the brain is necessary and sufficient for mediating social-touch-like behaviors. Additionally, because oxytocinergic signaling from the hypothalamus to the VTA is important for mediating social reward, we are currently delineating whether Mrgprb4-lineage neuron activation is necessary and sufficient for oxytocinergic activity. Presentation 10 Identification of Hippocampal Area CA2 in Hamster and Vole Brain Preston Siegler University of North Carolina (UNC)/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and mice (Mus muscu - lus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus), are commonly used in studies of social behavior, including social interaction, social memory, and aggression. The CA2 region of the hippocampus is a critical node that is known to play a key role in social memory and aggression in mice, likely owing to its high expression of oxytocin and vasopressin 1b receptors there. However, CA2 has yet to be characterized in hamsters and voles. In this study, we sought to determine wheth - er we could identify CA2 in vole and hamster. To do this, we stained free-floating tissue slices using primary antibod - ies raised against known markers of CA2 typically used in mice and rats and fluorescently labeled secondary anti - bodies. Imaging was performed on an epifluorescence microscope and images were processed using Fiji software. Here we report that immunofluorescent staining for CA2 markers in vole and hamster brains, like in mice and rats, reveals a population of neurons that includes both neurons receiving mossy fiber input and those without, extending just beyond the end of the stratum lucidum. Antibodies raised against RGS14, commonly used to label neurons in area CA2, stained this population of neurons and colocalized with immunostaining for two other CA2 markers, STEP and PCP4. These cells were located at the tail end of the mossy fiber projections, marked by the presence of calbin - din stain in all three species. In addition to staining the mossy fibers, antibodies raised against calbindin also labeled the superficial layer of CA1 pyramidal cells in mouse and hamster but not vole. However, a WFS1 stain marked CA1 neurons in all three species. These results demonstrate that CA2 can be distinguished within the hippocampus from neighboring CA1 and CA3 areas in voles and hamsters, which should facilitate the future study of CA2's role in social behavior in these species.20Presentation 11 Excitatory and inhibitory neurons produce distinct amyloid structures in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease Gabriella A. Perez, Rong Zhao, M. Danish Uddin, Jonathan C. Bean, Joanna L. Jankowsky Baylor College of Medicine Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain. Although plaques are diagnostic of AD, they can look qualitatively different between subjects and it is not known how these differences arise. Clinical symptoms also vary among patients, leading to the hypothesis that distinct plaque conformations contribute to clinical heterogeneity. To study this issue in the laborato - ry, plaque formation has been modeled in mice by overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP). All neurons express APP in the human cortex, however, many of the existing AD mouse models overexpress APP largely from excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons serve a different function in the brain and often do not express APP in many AD mouse models. We hypothesized that the neuronal source of APP may contribute to plaque and clinical diversity found in patients. To test this, we generated two mouse models expressing APP in either excitatory or inhibitory neu - rons. We used immunofluorescence and histological staining to examine plaque structure in the brains of our mice. Although both models produced amyloid plaques, their structures were completely different. Excitatory plaques stained for both amyloid peptide and thioflavin dye, which is a diagnostic standard for human AD. In contrast, the inhibitory model stained for amyloid peptide but lacked thioflavin staining. Our findings suggest that inhibitory and excitatory neurons produce distinct amyloid structures that may contribute to variation in AD pathology, presenta - tion, and progression. Presentation 12 Discrimination Hurts: A Sequential Mediation Examining Associations Between Discrimination, Stress, Sleep, Depression and Pain Joanna Hobson 1; Burel R. Goodin, PhD 1; Calia A. Morais, PhD 2 1Department of Psychology, College of Arts and Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA 2Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Bir - mingham; Birmingham, AL, USA People living with chronic pain (CP) experience stigma and discrimination in their daily lives due to their health con - dition. These experiences of stigma and discrimination can be harmful for their state of mind, health behav-iors (e.g. sleep) and could possibly exacerbate their CP condition. Studies have shown that experiences of dis-crimination can worsen stress in the brain and body, and lead to poor health related quality of life, especially for minoritized groups. However, few studies have elucidated the causal impact of discrimination on pain. We exam-ined this impact in 208 individuals with CP. Participants were recruited from the UAB pain clinic, and asked to complete the Everyday Dis - crimination scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form. Results show that there was a significant indirect effect of discrimination on pain severity through stress, depressive symptoms and insomnia symptoms with a point estimate of .009 and a 95% confidence interval of .003 to .018. Specifically, experiences of discrimination predicted greater perceived stress (t = 8.308, p = .000), greater perceived stress predicted greater symptoms of depression (t = 5.737, p = .000), greater depressive symptoms predicted greater symptoms of insomnia (t = 8.643, p = .000) and greater insomnia symptoms predicted greater pain severity (t = 4.082, p = .000). Similar results were shown for pain interfer - ence. These findings highlight a causal pathway of discrimination on pain severity, and serve as potential targets for treatment recommendations.21Presentation 13 Breast milk derived exosomes attenuate Lipopolysaccharide-induced activation via CD9 the Toll-like Receptor Complex Oluwatomi Akinduro 1, Thomas Van Groen 1, Quamarul Hassan 2, Brian Sims 1 1Department of Pediatrics/Division of Neonatology and Center of Glial Biology in Medicine at the University of Alabama School of Medicine, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama 35294; 2RNA Biology and Epigenetics Laboratory, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama 35233 Exosomes are nanosized vesicles (30-120 and implicated in numer-ous pathophysiological processes. Human breast milk is vital for neonatal immune system maturation and adap-tation, which may be due in part to its abundant supply of exosomes. Microglia are intrinsic mediators of the CNS immune response and may become pathogenic depending on the magnitude of environmental insults. In our previous work, we have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of human breast milk derived exosomes (HBMDE) in attenuating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation as evidenced by the suppression of CD40, an immune cell marker important in microglial activation, and associated proinflammatory markers such as p38, NFkB, and IL-1. In the current study, we look to elucidate the mechanism by which HBMDEs cause this effect. Exosomes carry and transport DNA, lipids, mRNA, microRNA, and proteins that may act as effectors in target cells. CD9 is a membrane bound tetraspanin protein well recognized as a specific biomarker for exosomes and for its role in cell signaling, motility, and growth. CD9 can inhibit the CD14 (TLR4 cofactor) interaction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is required for LPS to bind and activate microglia. Our preliminary data suggests that breast milk from some mothers has decreased expression of CD9 in its exosomes. This may translate as differential neuroprotective in to microglia and attenuating their activation. Our future investigations will elucidate the validity of this mechanism. Presentation 14 Sleep Deprivation Engages the Hypocretin/Orexin System to Regulate Reward Seeking Almeida Rojo AL, Heim B, Cai L, and Huang YH University of Pittsburgh Introduction: Sleep disruptions alter reward processing in the brain, but the mechanisms are not clearly understood. The hypocretin/orexin system presents a candidate mechanism in sleep deprivation (SD)-modulation of reward. Orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors (OX1R and OX2R) are differentially expressed in the brain with sexual dimorphism. Functionally, OXRs regulate sleep and wakefulness, promote arousal, and regulate reward seeking. Thus, we hy - pothesize that SD recruits the orexin system to modulate natural reward-seeking in a sex- and receptor subtype-de - pendent manner. Methods: Male and female mice were trained for sucrose self-administration (SA). Following acute SD for 6 hours (ZT0-6) by gentle-handling, mice received systemic administration of OX1R or OX2R antagonist prior to the SA test. Changes in c-Fos expression in reward circuitry were quantified 90 min from entering the SA chamber. To further understand c-Fos changes, fiber photometry was applied to measure neuronal activities in relation to orexin release following SD. Results: Following normal sleep, OX1R or OX2R signaling did not modulate sucrose SA in males or females. After SD in females, OX2R but not OX1R antagonism reduced sucrose SA; no reductions were observed in males. C-Fos quantifications suggested a trend of SD-induced, OX2R-modulated changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). On-going fiber photometry experiments in the NAc suggested that there were SD-induced changes in calcium and orexin activity. Conclusion: In female mice, SD preferentially engages OX2R signaling to increase sucrose reward seeking. This effect may be mediated by OX2Rs in the NAc and/or PVN. 22Presentation 15 A Low-Carbohydrate Diet to Reduce Self-Reported Pain in Non-Hispanic Black Women with Knee Osteoarthritis Asia M. Wiggins, Larissa J. Strath, Gray E. McPherson, & Robert E. Sorge University of Alabama at Birmingham Introduction: It has been well known that diet plays a role on chronic pain states and chronic pain diseases. There has also been an acknowledgement of potential sex differences in pain outcomes. However, the link between a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) on knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain in women has not been well-established. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact that a low carbohydrate diet has on chronic pain states and the quality of life of women living with knee OA. Materials & Methods: 14 chronic knee osteoarthritis female participants enrolled in a low carbohydrate dietary inter - vention for the course of 6 weeks. Baseline, 3-week, and 6-week measures of pain sensitivity, quality of life, dietary habits, and overall chronic pain, disability, and physical functioning was obtained using questionnaires, functional performance tasks, and pain sensitivity tests. Results: The LCD significantly reduced body weight. The LCD reduced pain severity and interference. The LCD reduced pain, stiffness, and functional impairment. The LCD improved function, energy, pain, general health, and health change. The LCD reduced pain intensity in the temporal summation and chair stand tasks and unpleasantness in the temporal summation task. Conclusion: The utilization of a low-carbohydrate diet for knee OA is a modifiable and simplistic alternative to current chronic pain treatments, like opioids. Presentation 16 Evaluating Toxoplasma gondii Colonization in the Murine Brain Using a Cellular Barcoding Approach Dana A. May1, 2, Ceire J. Wincott3, Matthew A. Child3, Sarah E. Ewald1 1Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology at the Carter Immunology Center, University of Virgin - ia School of Medicine, 2Department of Neuroscience, Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Virginia School of Medicine, 3Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus Cellular barcoding techniques are powerful tools to understand microbial pathogenesis. However, barcoding strat - egies have not been broadly applied to protozoan parasites, which have unique genomic structures and virulence strategies compared with viral and bacterial pathogens. Here, we present a CRISPR-based method to barcode protozoa, which we successfully apply to Toxoplasma gondii. Using libraries of barcoded T. gondii, we evaluate shifts in the population structure from acute to chronic infection of mice. Contrary to expectation, most barcodes were present in the brain one-month post-intraperitoneal infection in both inbred CBA/J and outbred Swiss mice. Although parasite cyst number and barcode diversity declined over time, barcodes representing a minor fraction of the inocu - lum could become a dominant population in the brain by three months post-infection. These data establish a cellular barcoding approach for protozoa and evidence that the blood-brain barrier is not a major bottleneck to colonization by T. gondii. However, our results examine the bottleneck capacity of the blood-brain barrier across the whole brain and lacks the resolution of the bottleneck effect within distinct brain regions. Therefore, my future work will utilize our barcoding approach in conjunction with brain microdissection to probe the within-host population dynamics of T. gondii brain colonization at various time points of chronic infection. 23Presentation 17 Molecular Mechanism of T-Type Calcium Current Elevation in Childhood Absence Epilepsy Samantha J. Thompson, Anika Sonig, and Jeffrey Noebels M.D. Ph.D. Baylor College of Medicine Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is the most common form of pediatric epilepsy where spike-wave seizures accompanied by lapses in consciousness occur hundreds of times per day. Known mutations in Cacna1a that cause CAE disrupt P/Q type calcium channels that are expressed broadly throughout the brain and are involved in synaptic transmission. Consequently, cortical loss of Cacna1a lead to elevated thalamic T-type calcium currents and evoke burst firing in the thalamocortical circuit that drive spike-wave seizures. Cav3.1 T-type calcium channels are encod - ed exclusively by Cacna1g alpha-subunits expressed in layer VI cortical neurons and thalamic relay cells. Elevated thalamic T-currents precede the onset of spike-wave seizures have been identified in 3 CAE mouse models. Trans - genic Cacna1g overexpression produces spike-wave seizures while Cacna1g deletion and ethosuximide, a T-type channel blocker, suppress seizures. The mechanism underlying downstream Cav3.1 thalamic T-current elevation in these models is unknown. To test if Cacna1g is transcriptionally upregulated in Cacna1a mutant mouse tottering, post-seizure tottering mice and wildtype using fluorescent in situ hybridization tech - nique RNAscope. We found a significant difference in thalamic relay Cacna1g transcription in tottering mutants that may explain elevated T-channel currents driving spike-wave seizures. Transcriptional upregulation is present prior to the onset of seizures and persists after seizure onset in adult tottering mice, suggesting Cacna1g upregulation may play a role in epileptogenesis and maintaining seizure activity in tottering mice.

We performed the 'tube' test over 6 consecutive days to establish the social hierarchy within groups of 3 age-matched male mice of the same genotype. We found that Mecp2 KO mice failed to form stable social ranks, displaying fewer dominant behaviors than WT mice. We followed the 'tube' test with a novel 'warm' spot test, where the same 3 age-matched mice compete to stand on a single warm spot in a cage with a cooled floor. As expected, the 'dominant' WT mouse occupied the 'warm' spot far longer than the other 2 mice, while Mecp2 KO mice equally shared the 'warm' spot regardless of their social rank, showing fewer dominant behaviors than WT mice. In vivo Ca2+ imaging with head-mounted miniscopes to follow neuronal activity in unrestricted mice poses a significant challenge to study Mecp2 KO mice because they begin to have neurological impairments around P50. To overcome this, we performed a single surgery to inject AAVs expressing GCaMP6 and implant a GRIN lens in the mPFC of WT mice at P25. After 2 weeks, WT mice displayed stable social ranks in the 'tube' and 'warm spot' tests. We are currently using this shortened and simplified procedure in Mecp2 KO mice to compare the activity patterns of mPFC neuronal ensembles in mice performing the 'warm' spot test. Poster 2 Common and Distinct Associations between Baseline Impulsivity and Longitudinal Development of Positive and Negative Alcohol Expectancies in Alcohol Na\u00efve Youth in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Cohort Faith Adams1, Iliyan Ivanov2, MD, Muhammad Parvaz, PhD1,2 1. Department of Neuroscience and 2. Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY Background: Both impulsivity and longitudinal development of positive and negative alcohol expectancies (PAE and NAE, respectively) are implicated in alcohol initiation and escalation in youth. However, for precise phenotyping of at-risk youth, it is imperative to determine whether PAE and NAE are fully complementary to each other and how dif - ferent facets of impulsivity (i.e., impulsive action, impulsive choice, and impulsive personality traits) at baseline map on to the longitudinal development of PAE and NAE in youth. Methods: From the ABCD sample, we identified alcohol na\u00efve participants at Year 1 (n = 8328, ages 10-11), Year 2 (n = 7,782; ages 11-12) and Year 3 (n = 4,776, ages 12-13). Stop signal reaction time from the Stop Signal Task (SST) paradigm, reaction time difference between high and low reward from the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and subscale scores from the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale were used to quantify impulsive action, impulsive choice, and impulsive personality traits, respectively. Bootstrapped linear mixed regression models were used. Results: At baseline, higher lack of planning and higher sensation seeking predicted higher PAE at Year 1(pYear 1<0.001), whereas lower impulsive choice, higher lack of planning and higher sensation seeking predicted higher PAE at Years 2 and 3 (pYear 2 <0.001, pYear 3 < 0.022). Moreover, lower impulsive choice and lower positive urgency predicted higher NAE at Year 1 (pYear 1<0.004), higher impulsive action, lower impulsive choice, lower positive urgen - cy and lower lack of perseverance predicted higher NAE at Year 2 (pYear 2<0.036), and lower impulsive choice, and lower positive urgency predicted higher NAE at Year 3 (pYear 3<0.001). Conclusions: Results indicate that although some facets of impulsivity consistently predict the longitudinal develop - ment of both PAE and NAE, there are some distinct associations as well, suggesting that PAE and NAE may not be fully complementary. These results identify different facets of impulsivity as targets for modulating alcohol expectan - cies for prevention efforts. 27Poster 3 Altered DNA Hydroxymethylation and Neuronal Activity Gene Expression in the Dorsal Hippocampus of a Tem - poral Lobe Epilepsy Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Neurobiology Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a prevalent form of focal epilepsy that is extremely difficult to manage, often leading to cognitive deficits that significantly impair the quality of life of affected individuals. Impaired hippocampal-depen - dent memory is one of the most common cognitive deficits in TLE. While the kainic acid (KA) model of TLE is widely used to study memory dysfunction in epilepsy, it remains unclear whether the underlying transcriptional and epi - genetic mechanisms of chronic epilepsy following prolonged behavioral testing are applicable. This study aimed to characterize the epilepsy-related memory deficits in the KA model of TLE, examine the effect of prolonged behavior training on hippocampal immediate early gene (IEG) expression and DNA methylation marks, and determine whether traditional behavioral testing methods can be used to study memory function in chronic epilepsy. Here, we injected male Sprague Dawley rats (125-150g) with either saline (vehicle) or 10mg/kg of KA to induce TLE, and measured behavioral seizure severity using the Racine scale. Six weeks following the injections, we conducted a battery of experiments to evaluate the effects of chronic epilepsy on locomotor activity, anxiety, hippocampus-de - pendent memory, and working memory. To accomplish this, we employed two experimental cohorts, each consist - ing of control and epileptic animals. One group underwent behavioral testing, while the other was housed under standard homecage conditions. The animals underwent the following tests: elevated plus maze (EPM), open-field test (OF), object location recognition (OLR), Y-Maze, Barnes Maze, and Fear Conditioning. Following the last test, we sacrificed the animals and extracted their hippocampi for Quantitative RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry. Our findings indicate that epileptic animals exhibited enhanced locomotor activity in the EPM, elevated levels of anxiety-like behavior in the OF, and deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory in the OLR, Barnes Maze, and Fear Conditioning tasks compared to controls. Conversely, no significant difference in working memory performance was observed in the Y-maze. Furthermore, following the prolonged behavioral testing, epileptic animals exhibited alter - ations in experience-dependent IEG expression and DNA hydroxymethylation levels, which were more pronounced than those observed in homecaged controls. While our study confirms previous findings showing a strong relationship between hippocampus-dependent memory impairment and chronic epilepsy, our results also suggest that the traditional sequential behavioral testing paradigm may not be the most appropriate approach for studying the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Specifically, our results demonstrate that prolonged behavioral testing induces significant changes in hippocampal gene expression, which may confound the interpretation of the underlying mechanisms of memory dysfunction. Therefore, caution should be exercised in the design and interpretation of prolonged behavioral experiments to study underlying molecular mechanisms involved in memory impairment in chronic epilepsy. Nonetheless, our findings provide a valuable roadmap for future studies investigating the impact of seizures and behavior testing on memory-associated mechanisms in chronic epilepsy.28Poster 4 Temperature-related increases in epileptic activity are captured by machine learning in a mouse model of epilepsy Asad I. Beck, Glorianna I. Gutierrez, Hannah Zaini, Horacio O. de la Iglesia Introduction: Presence of excessively synchronized neural activity (seizures) and epileptiform discharge (interictal spikes; IS) characterized epilepsy. Epileptic activity frequency may increase in relation to core body temperature, with both seizures and IS occurring more frequently as the individual's body becomes hotter. We examined whether increases in IS frequency could be indicative of imminent seizure onset by inducing temperature-related seizures in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS; heterozygous Scn1a gene deletion). Materials & Methods: Neural activity was via two electrocorticography electrodes and one electromyography elec - trode with a sampling rate of 400 Hz, while core body temperature was captured every three minutes via a sensor implanted in the peritoneal cavity. To induce temperature-related seizures, animal core body temperature was grad - ually increased by 0.5 \u00b0C every two minutes until a seizure was observed or core body temperature reached 42.5 \u00b0C. Finally, a previously trained machine learning model was used post-hoc to autonomously detect IS in collected data. Results: As core body temperature was increased, both seizure and ML-predicted IS frequency increased, with there being significant correlation between IS frequency and temperature (r = 0.27, p = 3.53e-17). Both temperature-in - duced and spontaneous seizures tended to be preceded and followed by increases in IS frequency, but not all increases in IS frequency evolved into seizures. Conclusions: These results suggest our model can capture epileptic activity - both spontaneous and tempera - ture-induced. Due to the low computational power needed, this ML-based method may be a potential avenue for real-time seizure forecasting and prevention for humans with epilepsy. Poster 5 Analysis of Spectral Responses to SPES to Localize the Epileptogenic Network Helen E. Brinyark, Soondos Kamel, Erin C. Conrad, Rachel J. Smith Introduction: Resection or ablation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) has been proven to reduce or eliminate seizures that are not controlled with medication in patients with epilepsy. However, 30-80% of patients undergoing this inva - sive surgery do not become seizure free. This is partly because no biomarker of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) exists. Intracranial EEG recorded during single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) can be analyzed to localize the SOZ. It has been shown that cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) and cortico-cortical spectral responses (CCSRs) evoked during SPES hold promise for SOZ localization. Methods: In this preliminary study, we analyzed CCEPs and CCSRs in two epilepsy patients. CCEP amplitudes were calculated from the EEG data as the root mean square values 15-50 ms after the stimulus onset for each response channel. CCSR amplitudes were calculated as the average power across 30 trials for each response in four canoni - cal frequency bands: theta (4-7 CCSR frequencies using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test and corrected for multiple comparison using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Results and Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that channels with significant spectral responses in the beta band correlated with the clinician identified SOZ. We also found that the significant spectral responses co-lo - calize with \"delayed responses\" which have been shown to be significantly associated with the SOZ. This overlap corroborates the use of CCSRs as a candidate biomarker for the SOZ. 29Poster 6 Tau Induced Alterations in Amyloid Precursor Protein Proteolysis Promotes Alzheimer's Disease Andy Delgado, Danitra Parker, Andrew M. Pickering University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Neurology The amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes sequential protease cleavage to generate metabolites of itself with biological effects relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Literature shows that in AD, non-amyloidogenic processing of APP is diminished and amyloidogenic processing is enhanced. How this shift in APP processing occurs is unknown. Literature shows the tau protein binds to APP, an interaction that may influence protease cleavage. In this study, we investigate the effects pathological forms of tau have on APP proteolysis. We will measure ADAM10, BACE1, and gamma secretase activity from lysates and membrane fractions of the SH-SY5Y cell line to compare treatment with tau oligomers and fibrils with untreated cells. We will also measure APP, sAPP-alpha, C99 and amyloid beta 42/40 ratio from lysates, membrane fractions and cell culture media to assess how tau pathology influenced production of APP derivatives. Our expected result is that tau will reduce ADAM10 cleavage of APP and increase BACE1 cleavage of APP, thus reducing production of the neuroprotective sAPP-alpha fragment and increasing the production of the neurotoxic C99 and amyloid-beta fragments. We further anticipate tau to alter gamma secretase cleavage of C99 such that it generates longer, more pathogenic variants of amyloid-beta. This finding would implicate APP tau bind - ing as an interaction that alters APP processing to promote AD. Poster 7 Emotional Stress regulates Endocannabinoid signaling in cerebellar cortex Mohamed Sayed, Jessica Fawcett-Patel, Muhammad Farooq, June Liu. Cell Biology and Anatomy department, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. Background: A growing set of evidence emphasizes cerebellum's major role in regulation of emotional memory. For instance, the endocannabinoid system in the cerebellum is involved in fear memory formation through retrogradely regulating synaptic transmission. A pilot study from our lab showed that predator odor stress reduces endocan - nabinoid signaling in the cerebellar cortex. This can be due to 1) increased degradation of endocannabinoids by monoacylglycerol lipase, 2) decreased endocannabinoid receptor signaling, or 3) decreased production of endocan - nabinoids by diacylglycerol lipase. We have shown that predator odor stress did not alter the activity of MAGL com - pared to naive mice. In this study we determined the effects of predator odor stress on endocannabinoid receptor signaling. Methods: P21 to P35 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 2 groups: a control naive group and fox urine exposed group. The latter was exposed to fox urine for 5 minutes, three hours before cerebellum was isolated. Sagittal slices (300 m) were cut from the cerebellar vermis. All recordings were obtained in lobules V and VI of the cerebellar ver - mis. miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded in the presence of a non-NMDAR inhibitor (5 M NBQX) and TTX (0.5 M) and after stable baseline, a synthetic CB1R agonist WIN55212-2 (5 M) is bath applied. Results: In na\u00efve mice, application of WIN55212-2 reduced the frequency of mIPSCs in stellate cells, which indicates that the activation of CB1R reduces the spontaneous GABA release. In fox urine exposed mice, WIN55212-2 reduced mIPSCs frequency by ~30% ,comparable to naive mice, suggesting that fox urine exposure did not disrupt the CB1R signaling. Conclusions: This study suggests that predator odor stress does not decrease endocannabinoid receptor signaling in the cerebellar cortex. (Supported 7 alters ultrasonic vocalizations in a sex-specific manner Leighton Douglas, John M. Reinhart, Katherine J. Blandin, Santana-Coelho, and Joaquin N. Lugo Introduction: Early-life status epilepticus (SE) is known to cause long-term deficits in learning, memory, social behav - ior, and communication. In order to better understand the acute effects of SE, our laboratory has used ultrasonic vo - calizations (USV) to investigate early communication deficits in mice. We have previously found that male mice that had experienced SE on postnatal day (PD) 10 present a decreased number of 50KHz USVs on PD12. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effects of SE on communication at an earlier timepoint in development that has not previously been investigated. Also, we assessed if there were any dimorphic effects of SE in communication. Methods: Neural activity was via two electrocorticography electrodes and one electromyography electrode with a sampling rMale and female C57BL/6 mice were housed and monitored at Baylor University for this experiment. We induced SE using an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5% KA (2.5mg/kg) on PD7. Age-matched control male and female pups were administered 0.9% physiological saline. After the injection, the mice were placed into an individual con - tainer with clean bedding and monitored through the duration of SE, which is characterized by continuous ton - ic-clonic seizures lasting 1-2 h. Control pups were also monitored during this time. On PD8 mice were placed individ - ually into containers where they were separated from the dam and sire. Their vocalizations were recorded for a total of two minutes through the Avisoft software. The files were analyzed in Matlab DeepSqueak where the calls were quantified and characterized. Vocalizations were then individually characterized based on established categories. A measure of total number of calls; total number of complex, two-component, upward, downward, chevron, short, composite, frequency steps, and flat calls; total duration of calls; Percentage of complex, two-component, upward, downward, chevron, short, composite, frequency steps, and flat calls; total duration of call; Average call duration; Average Median Frequency of calls; Average Amplitude of calls; and first call latency. Results: Analysis of USVs showed that the total number of calls did not differ between the groups. A two-way Anova revealed Mean amplitude was not affected by SEs (F1, 52=0.59, p=0.44)), but a trend to a main effect of sex was identified (F1, 52=4.04, p=0.05) suggesting that females present a lower call amplitude than males. ). A main effect was observed in short calls (SE: F1, 52=5.78, p=0.02; sex: sex: F1, 52=0.01, p=0.89). A chi squared analysis revealed select alterations to call repertoire which is consistent with similarly observed findings at the 24-hour timepoint. We observed a significant difference between female pups after SE, x2(9) = 2914, p<0.001. Z-tests for column proportions revealed select differences in various calls types of signifi - cance p < 0.05. There was an observed increase in the complex, upward, and chevron calls; decrease in two compo - nent, short, and frequency steps calls; and no change to the unstructured, downward, composite, and flat calls. We observed a significant difference between seized and control male pups, X2(9) = 57.609, p < 0.001. Z-tests for col - umn proportions revealed select differences in various calls types of significance p < 0.05. There was an observed increase in two-component, chevron, and frequency steps calls; decrease in upward, downward, and flat calls; and no change in the complex, unstructured, short, and composite calls. Conclusions: Preliminary data show that SE at PD7 alters USVs amplitude at PD8 in a sex-specific manner. Most of the findings in our study revealed the female pups were the main sex affected by SE. As seen in previous studies differences to specific call types were also observed. These findings support the need for additional research to explore the dimorphic effects that early life seizures can have on development.31Poster 9 Medial Prefrontal Cortex Subregion-Specific Activity and Plasticity in Memory Consolidation and Extinction Brianna Fitzgerald The prefrontal cortex is very important for cognitive activity including working memory, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors as they relate to environmental conditions. Deficits of prefrontal circuitry and plasticity during neurodevel - opment contribute to the onset and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disor - der (PTSD), anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder. The rodent functional analogue, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), has been demonstrated to be involved with fear processing and extinction. Many studies have demonstrated the role of the prelimbic (PL) subregion of the dorsal mPFC in fear promotion and the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the ventral mPFC ventral subregion of the mPFC, has not been vastly studied. Preliminary data from our lab suggest that the circuitry within the mPFC is, to a great extent, dependent upon the activity of the GABAergic interneuron populations, mostly the somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) or the parvalbumin-containing interneurons (PV-INs). My research centers around the investigation of the functional connectivity of interneuron populations involved in fear memory encoding and expression within the mPFC with a particular emphasis on prefrontal GABAergic microcircuits. Overall, we have observed subregion-specific plasticity changes in both SST-INs and PV-INs with fear processing in multiple regions of the mPFC. Poster 10 Striatal Somatostatin Interneuron Involvement in the Pathogenesis of Huntington's Disease Jahmel A. Fowler, MHA, Michelle Gray, PhD Department of Neurology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the gene encoding the Huntingtin protein. The resulting abnormal polyglutamine containing protein is expressed through - out the brain in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. HD patients exhibit motor, psychiatric, and cognitive deficits. Neuropathologically, this disease is characterized by significant degeneration of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum. These cells are very important members of the basal ganglia circuit and are critically involved in con - trolling motor coordination. The function of striatal MSNs is regulated by extrastriatal glutamatergic input from thalamus as well as and extrastriatal GABAergic input. One population of GABAergic interneurons express the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST)- and are also defined as persistent low-threshold spiking interneurons. In multiple mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) expressing mice, including the conditional human mutant Huntingtin expressing BACHD model, the SST-positive interneurons have increased spontaneous firing that likely impinges on the activity of MSNs. The increase in SST-positive interneuron firing in these mice could be contributing critically to the abnor - mal function of MSNs in HD. Thus, understanding the role mHTT expression plays in these cells is important and can provide insight into the dysfunction observed in the striatum of HD patients. In this study, we will use a genetic approach to knockdown mHTT expression in SST cells, by crossing BACHD mice to SST-Cre mice, to determine if mHTT expression in SST is contributing to the behavioral, neuropathological, and electrophysiological changes observed in BACHD mice. We hypothesize that expression of mHTT in SST cells influences the increased GABAergic changes observed in MSNs. Here, we report the initial characterization of the animal model for specificity of mHTT knockdown and preliminary behavioral data on BACHD/SST-Cre. 32Poster 11 Differences in Spinal Neuronal Recruitment during Pelvic Floor Stimulation in the Context of Early In Life Stress Anastasiia Gryshyna, MS; Cary DeWitte, BS; Alan Randich, PhD; Jennifer DeBerry, PhD The University of Alabama at Birmingham The exact etiology of chronic pelvic pain in unknown and that introduces several challenges for a correct diagnosis and proper treatment of this disorder. Multiple causes of chronic pelvic pain have been recognized, including abnor - malities in the immune system and in central and peripheral nervous system processing. Adverse life events have been shown to contribute to the development of chronic pelvic pain, however, the exact differences in neuronal activation and classifications have not been described in the affected population. In the following study, mice were subject to chronic neonatal maternal separation (NMS) for three weeks (postnatal days 1-21). In vivo spinal electro - physiological recordings were made once mice reached 8 weeks of age. The evoked responses of spinal neurons to descending presentation of von Frey hairs to the perigenital region were recorded. Neurons were classified as either wide-dynamic range (WDR) or nociceptive specific (NS), based on their response to non-noxious cutaneous mechanical stimulation. A significant main effect of sex was observed in the evoked activity of WDR neurons during mechanical stimulation. Additionally, male mice who have been exposed to maternal separation demonstrated increased pelvic hypersensitivity. The findings suggest that exposure to chronic early life stress not only contributes to the development of chronic pelvic pain, but also to spinal neuronal phenotype and could be sex dependent. The identification of pathways that contribute to the neuronal changes in chronic pelvic pain, provides a better under - standing about etiology of pain and creates potential avenues for prevention research. Poster 12 How Concussive-like Injury Affects Levels of Serotonin in Rats University Puerto Rico, School of Medicine, San Juan, PR Concussive brain injury is closely linked to anxiety. According to Collins SM et al., 2022, anxiety is associated with alterations in serotonin. A site of interest for serotonergic activity is a brain region called dorsal raphe (DR) locat - ed in the midbrain. Furthermore, a recent study revealed a correlation between serotonin activity and anxiety. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if concussion influences behaviors related to anxiety, and neuronal activity in the raphe nuclei. We hypothesize that concussive brain injury would increase signals of serotonin activity, given that neurons in the dorsal raphe are where most serotonin in the brain is produced. The experimental design consists of three phases: closed head injury via weight drop, as a model of concussion, behavioral analysis and tissue analysis. First a group of anesthetized rats will sustain a closed head injury via a weight drop to the closed head. Next, they will be video recorded for measurement of anxiety-like behaviors such as grooming and rearing, and lastly euthanized for the recollection of brains to undergo tissue staining through the technique of immunohisto - chemistry to measure signals of serotonin transporter in the dorsal raphe. Preliminary results for behavior analysis of grooming suggest that concussive-like injury (n=6) versus sham (n=6) does not affect the amount of grooming bouts (p=0.08). We will next be quantifying amount of rearing and cellular activity using c-Fos in the dorsal raphe nuclei. Future directions include performing double staining immunohistochemistry using c-Fos and a serotonin antibody (Anti-Tph2).33Poster 13 The effects of a concussion on behaviors associated with anxiety in male rats Taysha M. Jim\u00e9nez-Rivera; University of Puerto Rico, School of Medicine, San Juan, Puerto Rico The relationship between concussions and behaviors related to emotional stress remains unclear. Recent reports suggest that concussion increases fear-behaviors in paradigms of Pavlovian fear conditioning. Here, freezing behav - ior is used as an index of fear. Of note, other ethologically relevant behaviors such as grooming and rearing can also be utilized as indicators of emotional stress. Studies have introduced them as an index of anxiety. For this reason, we hypothesized that a closed head injury would alter rearing and grooming. To help us determine this, rats were anes - thetized and delivered either closed head injury via weight drop, or sham injury for controls. After recovery, rats were exposed to an open field space. Spontaneous activity was recorded to quantify rearing and grooming behaviors in the open field. Data collection was performed by observers blind to experimental manipulations. Specifically, the number of rears, time spent rearing, grooming bouts, and time spent grooming were quantified manually. Preliminary results suggest that closed head injury (n=10) versus sham (n=9) does not affect either the number of rears (p=0.16), time spent rearing (p=0.32), the number of grooming bouts (p=0.96), nor the time spent grooming (p=0.75). Next, we will assess rearing and grooming in other contexts. Together, these data suggest that concussive brain injury does not affect these specific behaviors related to anxiety. Currently, activity in brain regions involved in anxiety, namely the ventral hippocampus, is being quantified using cFos immunohistochemistry. Poster 14 Establishing a Novel Mouse Model of Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment to Assess Neural and Circuit Mechanisms Briana Machen, Alan Umfress PhD., James Bibb PhD., Sofia Beas PhD. Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment (CRCI) is a common neuropsychological side effect many cancer patients experience before, during, and after treatment. The cognitive deficits associated with CRCI (e.g., difficulty concen - trating, short attention span, stress, and lacking motivation) can negatively impact a patient's quality of life. As cancer survival rates increase, addressing CRCI is urgently needed to enhance survivor's well-being. However, the underly - ing mechanisms of CRCI are unknown, posing barriers to developing CRCI treatments. Current CRCI animal models lack consistency and clinical translatability. As such, standardized pre-clinical models are needed. Here, we aim to establish a clinically-relevant mouse model of CRCI that can then help us assess the neural and circuit mechanisms underlying CRCI. For this, mice will be orthotopically injected with E0771 breast cancer cells to induce breast can - cer. Mice will then be treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen that mimics clinical treatments (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) 3times/week for 3weeks). Thereafter, the independent or synergistic effects of breast cancer paired with CMF on anxiety-like behaviors, motivated responses, and PFC-mediated cognition will be characterized. Since altered dopamine (DA) signaling is a hallmark of CRCI and results in cognitive deficits similar to those experienced by CRCI patients, we will next assess how cancer and/or chemotherapy treatment affects DA release in-vivo. We expect both cancer and chemotherapy alone and combined will impair cognition, motivation, and emotional regulation. We also expect DA signaling to be dysregulated. Altogether, the results from this project will reveal substantial insight into how chemotherapy treatment leads to neurological and neuropathological effects. 34Poster 15 Amphetamine-mediated changes in midbrain neurons firing underline changes in striatal dopamine release Emily A. Makowicz, Mahalakshmi Somayaji, Shashaank N, Eugene V. Mosharov and David Sulzer Amphetamine (AMPH) and its derivatives are highly addictive substances that elicit their response by increasing stri - atal extracellular dopamine (DA) levels. Mechanisms that have been suggested to account for this include depletion of DA vesicular stores and blockade and reversal of dopamine uptake transporters (DAT) thus promoting non-exocy - totic DA efflux from striatal DA terminals. Additionally, in vivo studies suggest that AMPH augments action potential- mediated presynaptic DA release (Ramsson et al., 2011). Here, we studied the relationship between the firing activity of SNpc dopaminergic neurons and DA release in the dorsal striatum evoked by midbrain electrical stimulation in vivo in anesthetized animals. We found a ~5-fod increase in evoked striatal DA release accompanied by a ~50% decrease in DA neurons spontaneous firing following 10 mg/kg i.p. AMPH injection. The effect of AMPH on striatal DA release appears to be calcium-independent. Furthermore, deficiency of alpha-synuclein - a protein implicated in Parkinson's Disease - diminishes AMPH-mediated increase in striatal evoked DA release. Although still preliminary, these results suggest that both inhibition of DAT and a decrease in tonic neuronal firing mediate the effect of the psychostimulant on striatal DA release. Further evaluation of the relationship between DA neuron tonic activity and DA release from their striatal terminals will help to better understand the mechanisms of AMPH and alpha-synuclein involvement in these processes.

Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that disrupts autonomic, sensory, and motor function. Spinal progenitor cells (SPCs) can modulate the site into a more pro-regenerative milieu, but poor SPC survival due to inflammation can hamper transplant potential. Thin layered biomaterial encapsulation, termed conformal coating, is a technique that shields transplants from immune attack while allowing diffusion of nutrients and waste. Conformal coating reduces diffusion distances and minimizes transplant volume size compared to traditional encapsulations. Conformal coating has not been applied to SPCs as an SCI therapy, however, the objective of this study is to en - gineer a conformal coating capable of maintaining SPC survival and potency in inflammatory models. SPCs were expanded as neurospheres and encapsulated in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) capsule using a microfluidic platform. SPC viability, proliferation, SPC phenotype, and capsule integrity were evaluated over 14 days in vitro. Immunostain - ing and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate SPC outcomes. RNA was isolated from cell cultures to identify and quantify expression of specific marker proteins. Conformally coated neurospheres can be encapsulated without negatively impacting cell viability and sustained over a 2-week period. Future experiments will interrogate SPC secretory an Destynie Karen Ayala-Baylon, Hailey Edigo-Betancourt, Eric C Miller, Christopher Chapleau, Holly Robin - son, Mary Phillips, Tao Yang, Frank Longo, Wei Li, Lucas Pozzo-Miller Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene, affecting specifically females with a prevalence of 1:10,000 births and the manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms. MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator of multiple genes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), whose levels are lower in postmortem RTT brains and Mecp2-deficient mice. As BDNF has very low blood-brain barrier permeability, a brain-penetrant small molecule ligand of the BDNF receptor TrkB has become a potential ther - apeutic to improve impaired BDNF signaling in RTT. LM22A-4 improves breathing irregularities and restores spatial learning in female Mecp2 heterozygous (HET) mice. To evaluate LM22A-4's effects in vivo, we used 4-6 month old Mecp2 HET mice that express GFP-tagged MeCP2 in cells that had silenced the mutant allele by X-chromosome inactivation in their 'mosaic' brain. We dye-loaded pyramidal neurons of known 'genotypes' (based on MeCP- GFP expression) in ex vivo slices during whole-cell recordings, followed by fixation and confocal microscopy. Sur - prisingly, mutant neurons lacking MeCP2-GFP showed dendritic spine volume comparable to that in controls, while MeCP2-GFP-expressing neurons show smaller spines, opposite to the phenotype observed in Mecp2 KO. Consis - tently, LM22A-4 (i.p. 60 days in vivo) had an effect only in MeCP2-GFP-expressing neurons, which improved dendritic spine volumes to control levels. These data revealed unexpected differences in dendritic spine phenotypes in fe - male Mecp2 HET mice, while providing support to the potential usefulness of BDNF-related therapeutic approaches such as the partial TrkB agonist LM22A-4.

Traumatic life events are common among individuals with hoarding disorder (HD), though rates of posttraumatic stress disorder are no higher than in other groups. HD symptoms typically begin to appear in mid-childhood, and early life stress (ELS) is a known associated feature of negative mental health outcomes. The specifics of this rela - tionship are still unclear. We obtained Early Life Stress Questionnaire (ELSQ) responses from 35 participants with HD, 22 participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and 23 non-clinical control participants. We combined these quantitative data with qualitative interviews exploring what role ELS experiences play in HD. Per the ELSQ, individuals with HD reported significantly more ELS events than the nonclinical control participants. In qualitative in - terviews, HD participants described the ELS events that were most impactful in shaping their relationship to material possessions; these events tended to be long in duration and elicited feelings of scarcity of emotional support. Partic - ipants described relying on possessions in place of relationships and viewed possessions as potential sources of connection to peers. Our qualitative and quantitative results build on the cognitive behavioral model of HD, em - phasizing early experiences of prolonged stress or scarcity of emotional support as a key contributing vulnerability factor. Specific differences are consistent with earlier research that people with HD experience absence of early warmth. They further suggest that screening for ELS experiences is important when working with individuals with HD, and that HD treatments may benefit from increased focus on social and emotional connection building.36Poster 19 Unique protein degradation profiles in the anterior cingulate cortex during the formation of a directly vs indirect - ly acquired auditory fear memory Morgan B. Patrick1, Shaghayegh Navabpour 2, Timothy J. Jarome 1,3 1 School of Neuroscience, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA; 2 Department of Translational Biology, Medicine and Health, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Roanoke, VA, USA; 3 School of Animal Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major anxiety disorder that affects 6% of the world population with fe - males being 2-3 times more likely than males to develop it. Recent progress has been made in elucidating the brain molecular mechanisms supporting the formation of fear memories that underlie PTSD, with these studies primarily examining individuals that directly experience traumatic events. However, some individuals acquired PTSD from wit - nessing a traumatic event happen to someone else in close proximity, though the molecular mechanisms supporting the formation of indirectly acquired fear memories has yet to be explored. Here, we tested whether the molecular signature for directly and indirectly acquired fear was the same, specifically focusing on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) because prior research suggests that this area plays a crucial role in indirect fear learning. As a marker of the molecular signature for fear memory formation, we used an unbiased proteomic analysis of K48 polyubiquitination, a marker for protein degradation that we have consistently shown is critical for fear memory formation in several brain regions. We found that in the ACC male observer rats had a smaller, but largely distinct protein degradation profile from the demonstrator rat that they watched undergo auditory fear conditioning. K48 polyubiquitin proteomic analy - sis of female rats is currently being conducted to determine if any sex differences exist in these protein degradation profiles. These data suggest that indirectly and directly acquired fear memories have distinct molecular signatures, which has important implications for the development of treatments for \"bystander\" PTSD. Poster 20 NtsR1 -arrestin biased positive allosteric Dept., \u00b3Physiology Dept., Michigan State University East Lansing. With obesity rates increasing, there is a need to identify safe treatments for weight loss. The neuropeptide Neu - rotensin (Nts) supports weight loss via Neurotensin Receptor-1 (NtsR1). However, systemic Nts or NtsR1 agonists also hypothermia and hypotension, thought to occur via NtsR1-mediated Gq-coupled signaling, which reduced enthusiasm for NtsR1-based treatments. Recently, a blood-brain permeable NtsR1 positive allosteric modulator was developed (SBI-553) that biases for NtsR1 -arrestin signaling while antagonizing Gq-coupled signaling. An indepen - dent group showed that SBI-553 reduced stimulant intake in mice via modulating mesolimbic dopamine signaling without eliciting hypotension or hypothermia. Since natural reward (food) intake also engages the dopamine system, we hypothesized that SBI-553 could suppress feeding and promote weight loss in obese mice. To examine this, we treated normal weight and diet-induced obese C57/Bl6 mice with vehicle or SBI-553 via a cross-over design and assessed the impact on feeding, metabolism, and body weight. SBI-553 treatment did not promote weight loss in normal weight mice. In contrast, SBI-553 treated obese male mice lost weight, which they regained after discon - tinuing treatment. Curiously, SBI-553 did not alter ad libitum water or food intake, nor locomotor activity, though it modestly decreased O2 and CO2 production. However. SBI-553 treatment suppressed fasting-induced refeeding in obese male mice over 24 hr, suggesting it may influence hunger. Together, these findings suggest that systemic approaches to modulate Nts-NtsR1 may have promise to modulate body weight, and point to further investigation of the central and peripheral mechanisms by which it may do so.37Poster 21 The effects of short term EtOH exposure withdrawal on mPFC neurons Sierra Rodriguez, University of Dallas Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is linked to prefrontal cortex (PFC) impairments that compromise executive functions, leading to increased alcohol intake and heightened risk of relapse. In rodent models of AUD, activation of the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) regions of the PFC promote or extinguish alcohol intake, respectively. However, even within these regions neurons may show heterogeneous responses to alcohol or other reinforcers. Using a transgenic mouse line (TRAP2/Ai9) which permits fluorescent tagging of active populations, we identified PL and IL neurons that were active during withdrawal in groups of mice that self-administered alcohol or sucrose, respectively. Methods: We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp current-clamp recordings in PL and IL neurons that were either active (Ai9+) or inactive (Ai-) during withdrawal from alcohol or sucrose self-administration. We compared intrinsic membrane properties, including resting membrane potential and properties of evoked action potentials, including rheobase current, threshold, and firing frequency. Results: Our results demonstrate that the intrinsic excitability of withdrawal-activated PFC neurons differs between the PL and IL regions, and that these neurons exhibit distinct action potential firing properties following acute ap - plication of alcohol (20mM) ex vivo. In PL-Ai9+ neurons, acute application of EtOH increases the excitability of cells from EtOH drinking animals. However, in sucrose-drinking mice acute EtOH application decreases excitability. Conclusions: These findings support the existence of a PL/IL dichotomy in the context of reward-seeking and sug - gest that alcohol exposure indues changes in the intrinsic excitability of specific PL and IL ensembles, shaping PFC network activity and modulating control over drug-seeking behavior. Poster 22 Closed Loop Brain Computer Interface for Real-time Pre-motor Potential Recognition Background Ashton Weber, Caila Coyne, Hero Liu, Caleb Rowe , Macy McCuiston University of Alabama at Birmingham Neuroengineering PhD Background: This semester our cohort was challenged with the task of \"creating a model that predicts what a per - son will do before they do it\". We sought to accomplish this task using pre-motor potentials to predict a button press before it happens. Prior to motor actions, EEG signal amplitude from electrodes placed on the scalp outside the pre-motor cortex have been shown to increase. We empirically found that electrode placements Cz, C3, F2, and F3 are most contributive to pre-motor potentials as is seen in the literature by measuring the pre-motor cortex. Methods: We utilized gold-cup electrodes wired to a 4-channel ganglion board from OpenBCI to stream our data into MATLAB over Bluetooth. Data streaming and synchronization was accomplished using Lab Streaming Layer (LSL). Our model is trained on 20 time-locked trials that are epoched (2 to 0.5 seconds) and low-pass filtered in MATLAB before being fed into machine learning. The machine learning process of K nearest neighbor (KNN) allowed us to generate our model in MATLAB. Partitioned data was used to test the model prior to single-trial demonstrations revealing an over 80% accuracy on average. Conclusions: Open Brain-Computer-Interface successfully records pre-motor potentials with single-trial reliability. This study has important implications for developing BCI systems that can be used for clinical and research purpos - es, such as in the development of prosthetics or rehabilitation for individuals with motor disabilities.38Poster 23 Regulation of mitochondria and Richard 1School of Biological Sciences, Department of Neurobiology, University of California San Diego The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vast network of tubules and sheets that span from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. The ER plays a major role in protein secretion, Ca2+ homeostasis and lipid synthesis, the latter two func - tioning synergistically with mitochondria. It is known that the mitochondria and the ER can form mitochondrial-ER contact sites (MERCS) that facilitate lipid, and Ca2+ homeostasis. Loss of MERCS have been observed in neurodegen - erative disorders, with promotion of MERCS relieving neurodegeneration disorders. However, the mechanism behind the formation and dynamics of MERCS is not well understood. Here we propose that the post-translational modifica - tion O-GlcNAcylation, a major nutrient sensor that couples metabolism with cellular function and signaling, is altering mitochondrial and ER dynamics to favor MERCS. We show that increased O-GlcNAcylation decreases mitochondrial and ER motility in COS7 cells. Both the mitochondria and ER demonstrate a perinuclear clustering when O-GlcNAc is increased. In addition, ER analysis reveals decreased tubular length and width primarily affecting the perinuclear region of the cell. Using Split-green fluorescent Protein based Contact site. Sensor (SPLICS) associated with the ER and mitochondrial outer membranes we identified MERCS motility and localization differences influenced by O-GlcNAc. We propose that co-regulation of ER and mitochondria via MERCS is essential for cellular morphological alterations in response to cellular stress. Poster 24 Identification of Hippocampal Area CA2 in Hamster and Vole Brain and mice (Mus muscu - lus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus), are commonly used in studies of social behavior, including social interaction, social memory, and aggression. The CA2 region of the hippocampus is a critical node that is known to play a key role in social memory and aggression in mice, likely owing to its high expression of oxytocin and vasopressin 1b receptors there. However, CA2 has yet to be characterized in hamsters and voles. In this study, we sought to determine wheth - er we could identify CA2 in vole and hamster. To do this, we stained free-floating tissue slices using primary antibod - ies raised against known markers of CA2 typically used in mice and rats and fluorescently labeled secondary anti - bodies. Imaging was performed on an epifluorescence microscope and images were processed using Fiji software. Here we report that immunofluorescent staining for CA2 markers in vole and hamster brains, like in mice and rats, reveals a population of neurons that includes both neurons receiving mossy fiber input and those without, extending just beyond the end of the stratum lucidum. Antibodies raised against RGS14, commonly used to label neurons in area CA2, stained this population of neurons and colocalized with immunostaining for two other CA2 markers, STEP and PCP4. These cells were located at the tail end of the mossy fiber projections, marked by the presence of calbin - din stain in all three species. In addition to staining the mossy fibers, antibodies raised against calbindin also labeled the superficial layer of CA1 pyramidal cells in mouse and hamster but not vole. However, a WFS1 stain marked CA1 neurons in all three species. These results demonstrate that CA2 can be distinguished within the hippocampus from neighboring CA1 and CA3 areas in voles and hamsters, which should facilitate the future study of CA2's role in social behavior in these species.39Poster 25 Aerobic Chronic Exercise alters hippocampal DNA methylation in the Kainate experimental rodent Lobe Epilepsy C Homola, Jane Allendorfer, Farah D. Lubin. The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Neurobiology Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and its associated comorbidities have a substantial impact on the quality of life for many who are affected. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments that alleviate seizure occurrence or the associated comorbidities. Recently, clinical, and pre-clinical studies have begun to show positive effects of exercise on seizure control and cognitive function for people with epilepsy. Previous studies have indicated that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAme) are altered with epilepsy leading to abnormal gene expression regulation. However, it is unknown whether epigenetic regulations like DNAme are impacted by exercise leading to the subsequent positive effects on seizure control and memory. Here we investigated, in the epileptic hippocampus, 2 major forms of DNAme contributing to gene expression in the brain, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethy - cytosine(5-hmC), in response to exercise. We used a Kainic Acid (KA) induced model of TLE and investigated the effects of acute versus chronic aerobic exercise in epilepsy. While one bout of acute aerobic exercise was not suffi - cient to induce any whole blood bulk DNAme in either 5-mC or 5-hmC, 5-hmC levels were significantly altered in re - sponse to chronic 4-week aerobic exercise. We further explored the effects of chronic exercise in the hippocampus area CA3 of the epileptic hippocampus, showing a significant decrease of 5-hmC levels with epilepsy, whereas the chronic exercise intervention leads to significant increases in 5-hmC similar to the levels of non-epileptic controls. Gene expression analysis of methylation enzymes indicate that these bulk 5-hmC changes are primarily mediated by TET1 and TET3. Poster 26 State-Dependent PhD., and Sofia Beas PhD. Interoception refers to the ability to sense, integrate, and track signals originating from within our body. Interoception is critical for survival, and dysfunction in this ability can lead to mental health disorders. Interoception awareness has three main features: 1. Detection, 2. Magnitude, and 3. Discrimination of physiological needs. The paraventric - ular thalamus (PVT) has emerged as a brain region important for interoception since we previously showed that it integrates homeostatic signals and promotes adaptive behavioral responses. Moreover, we recently discovered that a significant neuronal subpopulation in the PVT, Type1PVT neurons, and not another subpopulation, Type2PVT, are responsible for the detecting and tracking of physiological needs. However, whether Type1PVT neurons can discrim - inate between two physiological needs is still unknown. Here, we set out to investigate whether Type1PVT neurons can discriminate between different physiological states (e.g., hunger vs. thirst) and promote specific behavioral responses (e.g., food-seeking vs. water-seeking behavior) needed to re-establish homeostasis. First, to confirm that Type1PVT neurons can sense and track hunger levels, we tested whether providing non-caloric food would prevent the satiety-induced modulation of these neurons. Next, we used chemogenetic approaches to test whether silencing Type1PVT neurons in hungry mice reduced food-seeking behavior. Lastly, we used c-Fos tagging in combination with c-Fos immuno to investigate whether different physiological deficits (hunger vs. water) produce differential recruit - ment of Type1PVT neurons. Altogether, the results from these experiments shed light on the neural mechanisms mediating interoceptive response. Future studies will investigate how addiction can hijack these systems resulting in interoception deficits. 40Poster 27 Activation of Calcium-Activated Chloride Channels Suppresses Inherited Seizure Susceptibility in Genetically Epilepsy-Prone Rats Miracle Thomas, Mark Simms and Prosper N'Gouemo Howard University Introduction: Inherited seizure susceptibility in genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPR-3s) is associated with in - creased voltage-gated calcium channel currents suggesting a massive calcium influx resulting in increased levels of intraneuronal calcium. Cytosolic calcium, in turn, activates many processes, including chloride channels, to restore normal membrane excitability and limit repetitive firing of the neurons. Materials and Methods: EACT and T16Ainh-A01, potent activator and inhibitor of calcium-activated channels trans - membrane protein 16A (TMEM16A), respectively, were used to probe the role of these channels in the pathophysiol - ogy of acoustically evoked seizures in the GEPR-3s. Adult male and female GEPR-3s were used in this study. Acous - tically evoked seizures consisted of wild running seizures (WRSs) that evolved into generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) and eventually culminated into forelimb extension (partial tonic seizures). Results: Acute EACT treatment at relatively higher tested doses significantly reduced the incidences of WRSs and GTCSs, and the seizure severity in male GEPR-3s. Furthermore, these antiseizure effects were associated with delayed seizure onset and reduced seizure duration. Interestingly, the inhibition of TMEM16A channels reversed EACT's antiseizure effects on seizure latency and seizure duration. No notable antiseizure effects were observed in female GEPR-3s. Conclusion: Together, these findings suggest that activation of TMEM16A channels may represent a putative novel cellular mechanism for suppressing GTCSs. Poster 28 Chemogenetic interrogation of Crh+ amygdala neurons in aggressive mice Emily L. Newman1, Khalil J. Threadgill1, Kerry J. Ressler1 1Psychiatry, McLean Hosp., Belmont, MA; Harvard Med. Sch., Boston, MA Introduction: Exposure to trauma can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder which can be accompanied by increases in emotional reactivity and aggression. The central amygdala (CeA) is a point of intersection for threat and aggres - sion neurocircuitry and corticotropin releasing hormone(Crh)-expressing CeA cells are necessary for adaptive active threat responding. The present study uses chemogenetics in mice to examine the role of Crh+ CeA neurons in terri - torial inter-male aggression. Materials and Methods: Male CRH-ires-Cre mice were tested for aggression every other day for two weeks. During these 5-min resident-intruder confrontations, a submissive intruder male was placed into the territory of the ag - gressive resident CRH-ires-Cre male and agonist behavior was quantified as latency to the first bite and total bite frequency. Aggressive resident males received intra-CeA adeno-associated virus for Cre-dependent expression of inhibitory designer receptors activated exclusively by designer drugs (DREADD; hM4Di) in Crh+ CeA neurons. After recovering from surgeries, mice were tested for aggression after receiving systemic vehicle or deschloroclozapine (DCZ) for chemogenetic CeA cells blocked aggression. Conclusion: Crh+ CeA cell activity is necessary for aggressive behavior onset in mice. Crh+ CeA neurons may serve as a therapeutic target to treat aberrant, offensive aggression with improved behavioral selectivity.41Poster 29 Investigating the spectrum of Brain Tumors associated with Adgrb3 and Tp53 loss in a mouse model of Li-Frau G. Van Meir2 1 Pharmacology, Physiology, & Pathobiology Theme, 2 Department of Neurosurgery, University of Alabama at Birming - ham, 3 Department of Neuropathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 4 Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham Introduction: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by a germline mutation in one TP53 allele, predisposing patients to the development of a variety of tumors from a pediatric age, including gliomas and medulloblastoma. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor 3 (ADGRB3), also known as brain specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI3) are highly expressed in the cerebellum and hippocampal neurons. Loss of ADGRB3 expression has been observed in brain tumors, but the significance of this observation has not been inves - tigated. Moreover, no mouse models to understand the role of ADGRB3 in brain tumor susceptibility and pathobiolo - gy have been developed thus far. Materials & Methods: To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying brain tumor formation in LFS patients and the role of p53 and ADGRB3 in the process, we have generated an LFS mouse model. The mice harbor a germ - line Tp53 deleted allele and a second floxed allele. These mice also express Nestin-Cre and are Adgrb3-/-. Results: About 20% of the mice developed hind leg paralysis and harbored large gliomas, which likely caused their demise. The remaining mice lacked brain tumors, but had other malignancies (sarcomas, etc.) as observed in pa - tients. Remarkably, the addition of Adgrb3 deletion led to a dramatic increase (from 20% to 60%) in the number of brain tumors. Conclusion: The Adgrb3-/- p53+/- Nestin-Cre mouse model constitutes a useful tool to understand the tumorigen - ic landscape caused by the loss of Adgrb3. We are now performing genomic analyses on the excised tumors and derived neurosphere cultures to further study the transformation process and the molecular changes induced by Adgrb3 loss. Poster 30 Genes, molecules, and mechanisms associated with heightened pain sensitivity and opioid abuse vulnerability Andre B. Toussaint, Mathieu E. Wimmer, Ishmail Abdus-Saboor Opioid abuse and chronic pain are co-occurring disorders with a complicated relationship. Furthermore, parental history of opioid exposure is seldom considered when prescribing opioids for pain relief. To explore whether paren - tal opioid exposure may affect sensitivity to morphine in offspring, we developed a \"rat pain scale\" with high-speed imaging, machine learning, and mathematical modeling in a multigenerational model of paternal morphine self-ad - ministration. For the multigenerational rodent model, we exposed adult male rats (sires) to morphine (0.75mg/kg/ infusion) for 60 days (the duration of rat spermatogenesis) using a self-administration paradigm; controls received saline. Following chronic morphine self-administration, each sire was bred with a drug-na\u00efve female to produce F1 offspring (morphine-sired or saline-sired). Adult male and female F1 progeny of morphine-exposed and saline-treated sires were allowed to self-administer morphine (0.25mg/kg/infusion) for 10-days on a FR1 reinforcement schedule. We found that male, but not female, offspring took more morphine than their respective controls. F1 morphine-sired male offspring also worked harder to receive infusions of morphine, under a progressive ratio schedule. We also find that male progeny of morphine-treated sires had no baseline changes in mechanical pain sensitivity but were more sensitive to the pain-relieving effects of morphine. Lastly, the male offspring of morphine-exposed sires also had increased expression of mu-opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area but not in the nucleus accumbens. Together, this rat pain scale revealed that paternal opioid exposure increased sensitivity to morphine's reinforcing and pain-relieving effects in male offspring. 42Poster 31 Influence of negative emotional states in pain Rico at Cayey, Department of Biology1, University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology2, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland3 Concussive brain injury has received increased interest as a public health concern in the United States. Concussion results in axonal damage that disrupts communication between brain regions, inducing negative emotional states, such as increased anxiety-like behaviors. Moreover, concussion leads to the development of somatosensory impair - ments, namely pathological pain that occurs distant from the site of injury. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are adjacent midbrain structures necessary for the processing of emotions and pain. We hypothesized that neuronal activity in these two brain regions will be affected by concussive brain injury, thus influencing both emotional and pain states. To test this idea, we used a closed head injury (CHI) model that simulates concussive brain injury in male rats. We performed platform mediated avoidance to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors. Then, we measured neuronal activity in the PAG and DRN using cFos immunohistochemistry. CHI rats showed in - creased time on the platform, suggesting that concussive injury increases anxiety-like behaviors. Immunohistochem - istry results revealed an increased neuronal activity in the DRN, supporting the idea that concussive injury influences both anxiety and pain. To further test this possibility, we are now examining the influence of CHI on pain-related re - sponses. Preliminary results suggest that CHI causes mechanical hypersensitivity. In conclusion, brain injury induces anxiety-like behaviors, and this negative emotional state might affect both emotional and pain processing. Poster 32 Transgenic expression of the hypermorphic SERT Gly56 Ala substitution induces tonic innate immune activation in the CNS in vivo Allison Veenstra-VanderWeele4, and Randy D. Blakely1, 2 *co-first authors 1Department of Biomedical Science, Charles E.

Winkle College of Pharmacy, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45229 4 Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, 1051 Riverside Dr., Unit 78, New York, NY, 10032, USA Altered serotonin (5-HT) signaling, as indicated by hyperserotonemia in a significant number of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients, has been proposed to contribute to ASD traits. A major regulator of 5-HT is the 5-HT trans - porter (SERT). Therefore, we generated mice expressing the ASD-patient derived SERT coding substitution Gly56Ala (SERT Ala56 mice). In this model, we observed hyperserotonemia, increased rates of CNS 5-HT clearance, alter - ations in 5-HT signaling, deficits in social behavior and juvenile communication, as well as repetitive behavior. The constitutive hyperfunction of SERT Ala56 is mirrored acutely by the ability of IL-1b to enhance SERT activity through a p38a MAPK pathway. Moreover, both genetic elimination of p38a MAPK in 5-HT neurons and pharmacological treatment of MW150, a specific, brain p38a MAPK inhibitor, can normalize disrupted behavioral traits. As 5-HT has been reported to diminish microglial reactivity, we hypothesize that excess 5-HT clearance of SERT Ala56 could lead to tonic inflammation and ASD-like traits. Inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels were found by qPCR to have signifi - cant IL-1b elevation in the midbrain of SERT Ala56 mice. Our findings indicate that our model displays evidence of region-specific, chronic inflammation. The latter finding is particularly interesting given the high level of IL-1b recep - tors on serotonergic raphe neurons. Ongoing studies seek to evaluate further the sex-specificity of these findings, explore additional molecular and cellular markers of immune and glial activation, as well as determine whether basal inflammatory changes support altered responses to challenge with environmental stressors.43Poster 33 Understanding Primate Amygdala Development: The Microglia's Perspective Dennisha King University of Rochester Background: The amygdala of nonhuman primates is remarkably similar to that of humans, developing over a lengthy postnatal period. This long development means that environmental events may influence neuronal growth and connectivity during early life. Our group and others including those working with human postmortem tissue have shown that throughout life, the primate amygdala has a repository of immature post-mitotic neurons (the paral - aminar nucleus, PL) that surrounds and interdigitates with the main basal nucleus (Bpc). While most PL neurons are immature at birth, by adolescence a proportion have developed mature profiles suggesting ongoing differentiation. The Bpc in contrast is largely populated by mature neurons based on immunocytochemical markers. While we are beginning to understand normal neural maturation in the PL, the role of microglia, the brain's immune cells, in PL development is unknown. However, microglia are critical for differentiation of precursor cells to neurons, clearing excess neuroblasts and pruning synaptic contacts. Each of these functions is associated with different morphological and molecular signatures. Microglia phagocytose unneeded neural precursors neural synapses (small microglia soma, ramified processes, relatively dispersed), and release growth factors that assist in neural differentiation. Methods: As a first step in characterizing the role of microglia in the developing PL, we assessed microglia in 3-month-old (infant) and 4-year-old (adolescent) macaques (n=4/group) in both the PL and adjacent Bpc. We immu - nostained 1:12 sections through the amygdala for Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), which is a marker for microglia. The region of the PL and Bpc were identified using adjacent sections stained for mature and immature neurons. High-power photomicrographs were then taken at similar levels across cases, in a blinded fashion. We then analyzed morphologic features (microglia density, 'clustering', and soma size/shape) Studies of microglia branching (Sholl) and immunostaining for chemical markers for synaptogenesis are ongoing. Results: The average density of microglia in the PL was 37% greater in adolescents (390 microglia/mm2) compared to infants (267 microglia/mm2; p=0.0143), with no differences in density across medial, central, and lateral PL. The Bpc microglia density was also greater in adolescents (341 microglia/mm2) compared to infants (290 microglia/mm2), although by a lesser percentage:16% (p=0.0143). The clustering (spacing) index, which measures microglial distribu - tion while accounting for density (calculated as: (average nearest neighbor distance)2 *microglia density) was similar between the infant and adolescent groups in the PL (p=0.395). In contrast, in adolescent Bpc the spacing index (0.473) was 10% less relative to infants (0.530), indicating closer spacing (p=0.0277). Conclusions: These preliminary data show an increase in microglia numbers from infancy to adolescence in both the PL and Bpc. There is also increased clustering of Bpc microglia in adolescence, suggesting potential increased microglia interactions with neurons. Ongoing data analyses will determine whether differences in increasing microg - lia densities in each region are associated evidence of regional synaptogenesis.44Poster 34 Nanopore long-read RNA sequencing reveals region-specific sex differences in wildtype mouse brain mRNA isoforms Emma F. Jones, Timothy C. Howton, Victoria L. Flanary, Brittany N. Lasseigne University of Alabama at Birmingham Introduction: The human brain has the most complex RNA splicing profile out of all tissues, and many neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with defects in alternative splicing (AS). AS is specific to a given biological condition, such as sex or brain region, similar to how diseases typically display a bias toward a condition. Unlike previous short-read technologies, long-read sequencing can capture full-length mRNA transcripts, essential for confi - dently determining the consequences of AS. Materials & Methods: We first extracted RNA from wildtype C57BL/6J mouse (n = 5 male and 5 female, age = 20 weeks) hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and cortex. We then prepared and librar - ies with the Oxford Nanopore GRIDion. We processed the resulting data with the nf-core nextflow nanoseq pipeline and performed differential transcript usage (DTU) analyses with IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR. Results: We identified significant region-specific transcript expression across all four mouse brain regions. Cerebel - lum had 438 genes with DTU, the most region-specific transcript expression across brain regions, followed by the striatum, cortex, and then hippocampus. We did not identify shared sex-specific DTU across all four brain regions but did identify 13 genes with sex-specfic DTU within brain regions. Interestingly, the striatum exhibited the most sex-specific splicing with 6 DTU genes, including Dhrs4. Finally, we determined 21 brain region-specific DTU genes that are known to be psychiatric disorder risk genes. Conclusion: Overall, with long-read RNA sequencing we identified different patterns of AS across wild-type mouse brain regions, including in genes known to be relevant to human disease. Poster 35 Ventral striatal dopamine encodes unique properties of visual stimuli in mice L. Sof\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez1,2, Austen Fisher1, and J. Elliott Robinson1 1Rasopathy Program, Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medi - cal Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA 2Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is an evolutionarily conserved set of brain circuits that plays a role in at - tention, appetitive behavior, and reward processing. In this circuitry, ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain innervate targets ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dopaminergic signaling in the NAc has been widely studied for its role in behavioral reinforcement, reward prediction error encoding, and motivational salience. Less well characterized is the role of dopaminergic neurotrans - mission in the response to surprising or alerting sensory events. To address this, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight.2 and fiber photometry to explore the ability of striatal dopamine release in to encode the properties of salient visual stimuli in mice, such as threatening looming discs. We report that lateral NAc dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than visual stimulus threat lev - el. This encoding is highly sensitive, as lateral NAc dopamine could be evoked by light intensities that were imper - ceptible to human experimenters. We also found that light-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, robust despite previous exposure history, and involve multiple phototransduction pathways. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine system's ability to encode visual information in mice, potentially relevant to studies/pathologies involving light and downstream dopamine circuitry. 45Poster 36 Microglia play beneficial roles in multiple experimental seizure models. Synphane Gibbs-Shelton, Jordan Benderoth, Ronald P. Gaykema, Justyna Straub, Kenneth A. Okojie, Joseph O. Uwe - ru, Dennis H. Lentferink, Binita Rajbanshi, Maureen N. Cowan, Brij Patel, Anthony Brayan Campos-Salazar, Edward Perez-Reyes, Ukpong B. Eyo University of Virginia Seizure disorders are common, affecting both the young and the old. Currently available antiseizure drugs are ineffective in a third of patients and have been developed with a focus on known neurocentric mechanisms, raising the need for investigations into alternative and complementary mechanisms that contribute to seizure generation or its containment. Neuroinflammation, broadly defined as the activation of immune cells and molecules in the central nervous system (CNS), has been proposed to facilitate seizure generation, although the specific cells involved in these processes remain inadequately understood. The role of microglia, the primary inflammation-competent cells of the brain, is debated since previous studies were conducted using approaches that were less specific to microglia or had inherent confounds. Using a selective approach to target microglia without such side effects, we show a broadly beneficial role for microglia in limiting chemoconvulsive, electrical, and hyperthermic seizures and argue for a further understanding of microglial contributions to contain seizures. Poster 37 Is Blood Brain Barrier permeability increased 24 hours following Pregnancy related Acute Kidney Injury? Ashley Griffin, Brittany Berry, Shauna-Kay Spencer, Teylor Bowles, Kedra Wallace University of Mississippi Medical Center Pregnancy related acute kidney injury (PR-AKI) is associated with increased risk of cognitive changes while the cause of these changes is still unknown. In nonpregnant individuals, following AKI, Indoxyl Sulfate (I.S.), a uremic toxin, accumulates in circulation and is associated with blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Whether there is an in - crease in BBB permeability following PR-AKI is unknown. The purpose of these experiments was to test the hypothe - sis that 24 hours following PR-AKI there is evidence of increased BBB permeability. Sprague Dawley rats arrived on gestational day (GD)10 and were grouped into the following: normal pregnant (NP; was administered via drinking water. On GD18, AKI rats received a 45-min bilateral renal ischemic reperfusion surgery. On GD19 animals were infused with 4% Evan's Blue (EB) via jugular vein followed by saline flush. Data was analyzed via one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons via GraphPad Prism with significance as p<0.05. In the frontal cortex, there were no differences between groups (p= 0.97). Similarly, with the posterior cortex (p=0.24) and cerebellum (p=0.48), there were no significant differences between groups. In the brain stem region, the 200 I.S group had significantly more EB than NP (p=0.0003), NP+AKI (p=0.0008), and 100 I.S (p=0.0001) groups. These results suggest that there are no changes in BBB permeability after PR-AKI, and that treatment of I.S. at a higher dose during pregnancy leads to a disruption of the BBB in the brain stem. 46Poster 38 Apparently high-dimensional spontaneous neural activity is locally low-dimensional in time Pranjal Gupta, Trevor Alston, John Pearson Introduction: It is commonly reported across species and brain regions that neural population dynamics are low-di - mensional, leading to a broad range of theories on the significance of this structure [1, 2]. However, several recent studies have reported that spontaneous activity in rodent sensory regions is high-dimensional [3], presenting a chal - lenge to explanations which posit low-dimensional dynamics as integral to neural computations. Here we hypoth - esized that the observation of high-dimensional population dynamics in these datasets results from neural activity progressing through a series of low-dimensional manifolds. That is, dynamics which seem to explore a high-dimen - sional subspace over a long period of time may be better described as dynamics which explore many low-dimen - sional subspaces over many short periods of time, where the high-dimensional space is composed of the union of the low-dimensional subspaces. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel statistical model and algorithm termed SPLAT to quantify the time-lo - cal dimensionality of neural population activity, defined as the number of active latent neural patterns during a small segment of time. Results: We tested its validity in both synthetic and real mouse V1 data [4] , where in each case evidence for estab - lishing meaningful locally low-dimensional latent variables in a high dimensional dataset was uncovered. Specifically for the real data, PCA estimates that 32 dimensions capture 85% of the variance, while SPLAT infers no more than 6 patterns are active during any given 10ms bin. Conclusion: Together, these results suggest that apparently high dimensional activity may represent passage through a sequence of low-dimensional neural computations.
