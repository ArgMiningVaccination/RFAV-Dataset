White House photo A Presidential Visit for VA's 20th Anniversary as a Cabinet Department President Barack Obama joined Secretary Eric K. Shinseki at VA Central Office on March 16 for the celebra - tion of the department's 20th anniversary as a Cabinet agency. A limited number of tickets to the program, held in the G.V. \"Sonny\" Montgomery Veterans Conference Center, were randomly distributed to headquarters employees by the Secretary's office. The program was also broadcast live on the VA Knowledge Network, where employees across the nation could view it. In his remarks, Obama noted that on March 15, 1989, the day the Veterans Administration was officially elevated to a Cabinet-level agency and renamed the Department of Veterans Affairs, a ceremony was held to swear in VA Administrator Edward J. Derwinski as the first Secretary of Veterans Affairs. At that ceremony, Obama said, \"President George H.W. Bush declared the mission of the agency is so vital that there is only one place for the veterans of America\u2014in the Cabinet Room, at the table with the President of the United States of America. I could not agree more,\" adding that he has pledged to transform the agency for the 21st century. After his speech, the President shook hands with several employees in the room, and departed. Secretary Shinseki then joined employees in the VACO canteen for a cake-cutting ceremony, with cake service provided by VA senior staff.

Which is best for my patient?\" As health care providers themselves, most VA researchers are famil - iar with these tough choices. VA Research is uniquely equipped to answer these types of questions because of its en - viable position within the Vet - erans Health Administration, the country's largest integrated health care system. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of clinical study, all of VA's research areas work collabora - tively to address the full spec - trum of veterans' health care needs, with VA's Cooperative Studies Program often playing a key role. CSP, a division of VA Research that specializes in multi-site clinical trials and epidemiological studies (stud - ies looking at the incidence and cause of disease), was cited by the National Institutes of Health as an example of \"insti - tutional completeness\" for its ability to bring about change in clinical practice. In addition to the lauded COURAGE trial, groundbreaking CSP-led comparative effectiveness trials include: n Intensive therapy to support kidney function. VA research - ers, in collaboration with NIH investigators, showed that delivering more intensive therapy\u2014for example, dialysis six times a week instead of Helping Clinicians and Patients Make the Best Choices Joel Kupersmith, M.D. Chief Research and Development Officer VA's comparative effectiveness research helps health professionals answer the question: 'Which health care approach will benefit my patient the most?'It was a medical story cel - ebrated for its immense impact on cardiovascular treatment: VA researchers, working with Canadian colleagues, found that patients with stable coro - nary artery disease\u2014in which plaque buildup restricts the blood supply to the heart muscle\u2014often fare well with medication and lifestyle chang - es alone. A commonly used treatment called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, commonly called angioplasty), which opens narrowed blood vessels using a flexible tube called a catheter with a bal - loon at its tip, might best be reserved for patients with more severe forms of heart disease. The VA study, known by the acronym COURAGE\u2014 short for Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evalua - tion\u2014is one among hundreds of \"comparative effectiveness\" studies that have been under - taken by VA Research. Unlike studies that ask only whether a new drug or other medical approach works better than an inert alternative called a pla - cebo, comparative effectiveness studies are head-to-head trials to see which option works bet - ter for a given health condition in a certain group of patients. These trials sometimes com - pare one drug to another. In other cases, they compare dif - ferent approaches such as sur - gery versus an accepted drug therapy, or different ways to deliver care to patients. VA's comparative ef - fectiveness studies respond to a dilemma faced by health professionals caring for our na - tion's veterans, as well as other three\u2014did not benefit patients with acute kidney failure, compared to conventional treatment. n Prolonged-exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress dis - order. VA researchers showed that prolonged-exposure ther - apy\u2014in which therapists help patients recall their trauma memories under controlled conditions\u2014helped women reduce their PTSD symptoms more than emotional support and counseling focused on current problems. n Two drugs for normalizing heart rhythm. VA researchers compared two drugs, amioda - rone and sotalol, to determine which is better at correcting a common heart rhythm abnor - mality called atrial fibrillation. The drugs worked equally to initially achieve a normal heartbeat, but amiodarone was better at maintaining the regu - lar beat. The two drugs were similarly effective in study par - ticipants with ischemic heart disease, a condition in which narrowed arteries restrict the heart's blood supply. In addition to conducting clinical trials, VA Research, through its \"Evidence-Based Synthesis Program,\" prepares and distributes reports based on existing information about important health care topics. By examining how therapies stack up against each other in defined groups of people, comparative ef - fectiveness research represents an important step toward personalizing care\u2014that is, tailoring health care to a spe - cific patient's circumstances. In personalization of care, VA has exceptional research capability, thanks largely to its electronic health record that supports sophisticated analysis by integrating all elements of a patient's health history. VA Research is also developing a genomic medicine program to learn how a person's genes can influence the way they react to a drug or other treatment. Armed with information about each intervention's ef - fectiveness and a profile of individualized health factors, VA providers can be maxi - mally informed and can best educate patients to contribute their preferences and values to health care decision-making. Research findings alone cannot improve health care outcomes. VA relies on its \"Quality Enhance - ment Research Initiative,\" or QUERI\u2014a program that translates findings into better patient care\u2014to inform doc - tors and patients of important research conclusions that call for changes in practice. VA's comparative effec - tiveness research helps health professionals answer the ques - tion so crucial in this exciting, yet sometimes bewildering, era of burgeoning health care op - tions: \"Which health care ap - proach will benefit my patient the most?\" VA nguard March/April 2009 \u0018news you can use \"Turning Hope Into Reality.\" This theme of VA Research Week 2009\u2014the annual celebration of department re - searchers' accomplishments\u2014 underscores the momentous improvements to the lives of veterans and other Americans that result from VA's research findings. During the week of May 3-9, with kick-off events April 29-May 1, VA will recognize the advances that continue to make it an acclaimed model for bench-to-bedside research and that lay the foundation for VA's preeminent patient care. In addition to recognizing the achievements of VA's visionary researchers, Research Week pays tribute to veterans who participate in studies, without whom the department's in - fluential research accomplish - ments would not be possible. \"The future of medicine is determined by the research we do now,\" said Joel Ku - persmith, M.D., VA's chief research and development of - ficer. \"This week honors the VA researchers and staff and veteran research volunteers who together make pivotal contributions to the evolution of medicine.\" Research Week opening events April 29-May 1 take place on Capitol Hill and at the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center. Hosted by the VA Office of Research and Development in collaboration with veter - ans service organizations and other partners, features include congressional and press brief - ings; presentations by veterans, public officials and others; and presentations and exhibits by VA researchers spotlighting research advances in such areas as Parkinson's disease, pros - thetics, regenerative medicine, spinal cord injury, pain man - agement, stroke and cardio - vascular disease, hypertension, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, vision and hearing, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, reducing disparities, collaboration, and women's health.

Kussman has announced his intention to retire from federal service by May 9, ending a 37-year government career. Kussman, who attained the rank of brigadier general in the Army, has been with VA since 2000. As Under Secretary for Health since 2007, Kussman has directed a health care system with an annual budget of approximately $40.2 billion, overseeing the delivery of care to more than 5.6 million veterans. VA, the nation's largest health care system, employs more than 231,000 health care professionals and support staff at more than 1,400 sites of care, including hospitals, commu - nity and facility-based clinics, nursing homes, domiciliaries, readjustment counseling centers, and various other facilities. \"I've appreciated the tremendous opportunity VA has given me to continue to serve those with whom I served while in uniform,\" said Kussman. \"VA has a reputation for providing 'the best care anywhere,' and I hope I have helped to enhance that reputation.\" In addition to its health care mission, VA is the nation's largest provider of graduate medical education and a major contributor to medical and scientific research. More than 80,000 volun - teers, 100,000 health profession trainees, and 25,000 affiliated medical faculty members are inte - gral parts of VA's health care community. Under Secretary for Health Kussman Announces His Retirement Kussman\u0018 March/April 2009feature VA nguard VA human resources offices across the country have begun roll - ing out the new electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) system to their employees. When the rollout is complete, all employees will have the electronic folder available to them 24 hours a day, seven days a week from nearly any location. If an employee needs a copy of a document such as an SF 50, Notifica - tion of Personnel Action, all they need to do is log into eOPF, open the document and click print. No more making appointments with HR or waiting in line to see an HR profes - sional for assistance. \"The folder is available anytime and doesn't have to be checked out,\" said Julie Young, a human resources specialist at VA Central Office who spearheaded the conversion from pa - per files to electronic files. \"That leads to numerous advantages for employees as well as VA.\" In addition to convenience, the electronic folders save money, are more secure than paper copies, and lead to more accurate files, according to Young. \"With the conversion to eOPF, there's the obvious savings of paper and associated resources that go along with filing, storing and transporting personnel folders, but we are also go - ing to save time, which is a valuable With the new eOPF system, personnel files will be just a mouse click away, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Coming Soon: Paperless HRIn the federal government, re - cords and files are important. If they are not available, things don't get done. Fortunately for VA employees, their personnel files will now be available to them anytime.Julie Young is spearheading the con - version to electronic files; opposite: more information on the initiative is available on the HR Transformation Web site. robert turtil March/April 2009 \u0018feature VA nguard resource,\" she said. \"Employees do not have to go to HR to check their files. HR employees don't have to go look for a file that may or may not be there. With eOPF, the file is always available.\" The convenience and time sav - ings of electronic folders should also result in more accurate files. Since employees can check their own files anytime they want, they can make sure everything is in order. If some - thing is missing, inaccurate or doesn't belong, they can pick up the phone and have it corrected. In a paper sys - tem, that mistake may go unnoticed for a long period of time. \"We urge every employee to log into the system as soon as it is avail - able to them to check their file,\" said Young. \"We adopted the use of a verification and validation system when the folders were scanned, but sometimes, things happen. If an employee finds something wrong, they should call their HR office and let them know as soon as possible.\" From the beginning, eOPF was designed to ensure the safety and security of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the same manner that VA protects the in - formation of the millions of veterans it serves. The Web-based system has multi-layered security that limits access and reduces risk of loss or damage to the documents. In addi - tion, records are backed up regularly and access is controlled through secu - rity permissions, with every instance of access to an individual's eOPF re - corded by user ID and reason code. \"Whenever someone other than the employee logs into the system to view a folder, they must enter a reason why they need to review that folder,\" Young explained. \"And all entries are tracked electronically. We can tell who looked at the folder and for what reason.\" With traditional paper files, it was possible for the files to be reviewed without such documentation. With eOPF, that risk is removed. The phys - ical security of the personnel folder is enhanced as well. Since the files are contained in a database and backed up on a regular basis, loss due to theft, fire or another disaster is no longer a concern. To date, more than 266,000 VA employee records have been scanned into eOPF\u2014replacing the paper files as official records. But some employees may wonder what happened to the hard copies. \"The old folders have been retired to the National Personnel Records Center at a new facility to house non-records, as they are no longer official,\" said Young, adding that the hard copies will remain there for a period of time before ultimately being destroyed. New personnel actions will be en - tirely paperless, with documentation entered into eOPF. Employees will no longer receive copies through mail or distribution. If a paper copy is needed, one can be printed from eOPF. VA employees who transfer to another agency or other employees who transfer to VA will not have to worry about the transfer of their re - cords during in-processing procedures, because eOPF is part of the Office of Personnel Management's Enterprise Human Resources Integration initia - tive, which is one of five e-Govern - ment initiatives designed to support the President's Management Agenda. Through eOPF, OPM will maintain 1.8 million executive branch employ - ees. Other benefits will be added to eOPF as the system matures, such as e-mail notification to employees that a new document has been added to their file and is ready for their review. \"eOPF provides employees and their HR personnel with numerous benefits, advantages and unprec - edented flexibility,\" said Young. \"We will continue to improve the system to better serve the employee as well as manage VA human resources.\" After reviewing their eOPF, employees should contact their HR office if they have any questions or concerns. Those who ex - perience technical difficul - ties accessing eOPF should contact their local eOPF administrator; they may also contact the eOPF Help Desk at eopf_hd@ telesishq.com or call 866- 275-8518. \"Questions concern - ing specific personnel actions or documents should be made directly to their ser - vicing personnel representative,\" said Young. \"If they have trouble logging in, they can contact either their lo - cal eOPF administrator or the Help Desk. If they contact the Help Desk via e-mail, an electronic ticket will automatically be created and tracked to resolve their problem.\" To learn more about eOPF and the other initiatives, visit the HR Transformation Intranet site at vaww. va.gov/HRTRANSFORMATION/in - dex.asp. By Gary Hicks \u0018 March/April 2009feature VA nguard As Dr. David MacVicar, staff psy - chologist at the VA medical center in Tuscaloosa, Ala., listened intently to a returning veteran from Iraq explain how his young son cries every time he hears the national anthem because it reminds him of his father going away to war, it became clear to MacVicar that something needed to be done for the families of these veterans, who also suffer invisible wounds of war. Soon afterwards, MacVicar talked with leadership at the medical center, and quickly garnered their support to try a new approach to providing need - ed services for not only the veterans of the current conflicts, but also the family members of these heroes. Out of the sorrowful experience of that young boy, as well as the heart- wrenching stories of other families affected, the Family Support Initiative at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center was born. The Tuscaloosa VAMC launched the initiative in November 2008 to help these veterans and their The Tuscaloosa VA Medical Cen - ter's Family Support Initiative is marshaling community support to help returning veterans and their loved ones. For most Ameri - cans, hearing the national anthem performed fills them with a sense of pride and patriotism, and often elicits tears\u2014tears of joy because of their love of country. For one young boy in Alabama, hearing the national anthem elicits tears, but in his case, they are tears of sorrow, of pain, and of loneliness. A New Approach to Healing the Invisible Wounds of Warapril jonesLeft to right: Family Support Team members Dr. Bettina Schmid and Dr. Kendall Thomas, with Tuscalo - osa VAMC psychologist Dr. David MacVicar. March/April 2009 9feature VA nguard families. The initiative has three parts: n VA chaplains are reaching out to community clergy to provide training in recognizing the symptoms of the invisible wounds of war, such as post- traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and are providing guid - ance on when to refer veterans to VA. n A Family Support Team, made up of a psychologist, a chaplain, and a so - cial worker, is available to meet fami - lies in their home for an assessment. Once the assessment is completed, appropriate referrals to VA and com - munity programs are made. n The Family Support Team is reach - ing out to community organizations and professionals in the community to provide education about the is - sues and challenges faced by veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and let them know that they can refer veterans and family members to the Family Support Program. The team was quickly assembled from two employees whose past ex - periences made them a perfect fit for this new team and new initiative; a third position will be filled in the near future. The team members are Dr. Bettina Schmid, a psychologist, and Dr. Kendall Thomas, a chaplain. Cur - rently the social worker responsibili - ties are being handled by Kristi Hill, a social worker for Tuscaloosa's Transi - tion Center for Returning Combat Veterans. Schmid is an Air Force veteran with a passion for outreach. Recently she and the team were asked to speak to a group of psychologists, social workers and counselors at the Univer - sity of Alabama Counseling Center. \"The University of Alabama is seeing more and more students who have served in Iraq and may need counseling services when they return,\" said B.J. Guenther, staff therapist for the UA Counseling Center. \"I asked Dr. Schmid and her team to speak to our staff about how to better counsel these veterans returning from war.\" At the Feb. 9 meeting, Schmid explained to the group that deploy -ment affects the whole family, and in the current wars, members of the mili - tary and their family members often must deal with multiple deployments. \"One of our goals is to educate family members about deployment- related issues and provide guidance on the needs of returning military members, especially those returning with physical injuries or psychological disorders, Schmid said. \"The Tusca - loosa VA is proud to take the lead in reaching out to veterans and families dealing with deployment.\" Schmid added that so far the team has had a positive response from the community and has also combined efforts with the local VA transition patient advocate on many occasions to share information and resources for outreach efforts. One vital part of the outreach effort is to establish care options for the family members at minimal cost with various medical and mental health providers in the community. Thomas has begun outreach ef - forts to local clergy members to pro - vide education and training that will help prepare them to recognize the symptoms of veteran-related problems and how to refer people in need of assistance to the best resources. A for - mer Navy and Marine Corps chaplain, he knows firsthand what local minis - ters may encounter when their church members return from war. \"In my experience of being for - ward-deployed as a Navy chaplain, I understand extremely well the difficul - ties of return and reunion of military families and readjustment,\" Thomas said. Thomas brings a wealth of experi - ence and sage wisdom to the team, including specialized training in mul - tiple disciplines, hospice care and fam -ily therapy among them. He spent all but four tours of duty with the military in an operational/deployment status, with collateral duties assigned, such as Family Readiness Officer and Family Advocacy Officer. Jessie Williams, a minister from the Live and Praise Worship Center in nearby Northport, Ala., said he is participating in the initiative because he too personally understands the pain of war. The Vietnam veteran served 18 months and remembers the negative stressors war had on his life. \"War links to some of the stresses, the hazardous duties it frames, the trauma it brings to the person's life, and you can feel that in a person,\" Williams said. \"I believe it's very necessary to our community to take part. The responsibility shouldn't be on one group alone. There are a lot of resources in the community. Everyone can take part in the restoration of vet - erans back to the community.\" As the team works to assist the families in need, they will rely on support from various agencies and sectors of the community to deal with the wounds of war that affect the entire community. As these two wars have demonstrated, veterans and their families are not the only ones affected when they return\u2014everyone in the community is either directly or indirectly affected by the outcomes of these veterans' service to the nation. Without the basic instinct of our patriot citizens to lend a hand to help someone in need, the efforts of the team would not be successful. This team serves as an example of what caring Americans can accomplish when they stand together to support the newest generation of warriors. By Damon A. Stevenson \"The responsibility shouldn't be on one group alone. There are a lot of resources in the com - munity. Everyone can take part in the restora - tion of veterans back to the community.\"10 March/April 2009feature VA nguard Chris Ott felt like she had been \"to hell and back\" since the day in March 2007 when her son, John \"J.T.\" Doody, was shot in the right leg in Iraq. He was making progress at first, but then he suffered a debilitating stroke caused by a blood infection, which ultimately led to the Marine's paralysis and loss of eyesight and speech. While her son underwent surgery, treatment and rehabilitation at the Naval Medical Center San Diego and then at the polytrauma center at the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, Fla., she wanted to be close by. \"After the injury, you're in such shock,\" Ott recalled. \"You walk around in a daze, just trying to get through the day. But the Fisher House is there. It allows us to be close to our loved ones and gives us the opportuni - ty to talk to one another\u2014people who are going through the same thing. We each have our meltdowns. But you hold each other up and create a new sense of family there.\" Fisher Houses are large, modern homes\u2014the newer ones have 20 bed - room suites with private baths\u2014that are built and donated by the Fisher House Foundation to the Department of Defense or VA to support families of service members or veterans with VA or military medical center. They have elevators and common areas, including kitchens, laundry facilities, dining rooms, living rooms, family rooms and libraries. Ott stayed at two Fisher Houses: the Naval Medical Center San Diego Fisher House, from March to May 2007, and the Tampa VA Fisher House, from February to December 2008. Fisher Houses provide a 'home away from home' for families of severely injured or wounded veterans. 'A family's love is good medicine' severe wounds or injuries who are in need of lodging while their loved ones receive medical care. \"I don't know what I would have done if the Fisher House wasn't there for me,\" said Ott. \"Well actually, I do know. I would have found a way to be close to my son. I would have slept in a chair by his bed.\" The Fisher Houses are usually located within walking distance of the don spragg\"It's an honor to be in this job,\" says Wayne Walker, manager of the Fisher House at the VA medical center in Richmond, Va. March/April 2009 11feature VA nguard She credits the Fisher House as a major contributor to her son's ongo - ing recovery. Recently, J.T. started talking\u2014and he hasn't stopped since. \"J.T. made so much progress when he stayed there. And I'm convinced that having their families so close is the number one factor in these young guys getting better. It gives them the feeling of being at home. The Fisher House is what allows that to happen.\" Ott's son is now an outpatient and lives in Riverview, Fla. She moved him into his own house as a Christmas present. Fisher Houses came to be built at VA medical facilities because a nurse at the Samuel S. Stratton VA Medi - cal Center in Albany, N.Y., in the early 1990s sensed an opportunity and acted on it. Jo-Anne Saulsbery saw a televised story in which New York construction magnate Zachary Fisher talked about how his foundation provided homes for the families of severely wounded service members next to military hospitals where their loved ones were being cared for\u2014she thought it was something that could be done at VA medical centers as well. \"I thought, 'Why not jot a letter to [Zachary Fisher] and ask him how I could get started setting up a comfort home here,'\" Saulsbery told the Fisher House magazine in 1994. She had struck the right chord. Two weeks later, she got a call from one of Fisher's associates, who told her the foundation wanted to build a Fisher House at the Albany VA Medi - cal Center. In 1994, the Fisher House at Al - bany became the first to house veter - ans' families at a VA medical facility. \"She really helped get this house built and get things started at VA,\" said Jerry Jensen, manager of the Albany Fisher House. \"She saw the need. She wanted to help, and she found a way to do it.\" There are now 13 Fisher Houses at VA medical facilities, and more are on the way. Seven are in pre-construction phases, and plans call for as many as 11 others to be built at VA facilities over the next few years. The VA Secretary provides the Fisher House Foundation a list of the department's highest priorities. Fisher Houses have been built near all Level One Polytrauma Rehabilitation Cen - ters. The program began in 1990 with a vision by Zachary Fisher and wife Elizabeth to serve family members in recognition of the special sacrifices of the men and women in uniform and the hardships of military service. Asked once why the Fishers build these homes, Zachary responded, \"Elizabeth and I believe it's important to show in tangible ways our feelings of appreciation for our country and the courageous, professional and dedi - cated men and women who protect and defend it, enabling the rest of us to enjoy the freedoms that we too of - ten take for granted.\" From 1990 to 1998, all Fisher Houses were given as gifts to the federal government by the Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Armed Services Foundation. Zachary Fisher died in 1999 and the Fisher House Founda -tion assumed the mission of building new Fisher Houses. Today, there are 43 Fisher Houses located at military hospitals in the U.S. and overseas, and at VA medi - cal centers throughout the country. Nearly 10,000 families stay in Fisher Houses each year, and more than 120,000 families have been Fisher House guests since the program began. The Fisher House program has made available nearly 3 million days of lodging to family members since the program originated in 1990. Fisher Houses are constructed by the Fisher House Foundation on gov - ernment land (military bases or VA medical center grounds). When they are completed, VA Fisher Houses are donated to VA. Carol Sheets, Family Hospitality Program manager at VA headquarters, said families of patients are approved to stay following an initial screening typically conducted by a social worker for the patient. The social worker then makes the referral to the Fisher House manager.

Caregivers for veterans also are authorized to stay at the houses. John Stenger, director of Health Care Engineering at VA Central Of - fice, said Fisher Houses have recently opened in Los Angeles and Dallas, with new houses underway in Bos - ton, St. Louis, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, Augusta, Ga., and Miami. The engineering and safety programs in headquarters are working closely with each of these VA medi - cal centers to coordinate the projects, Stenger said. Fisher Houses offer home-like en - vironments where families can prepare meals, do their laundry, relax and visit with other families. Each Fisher House is beautifully decorated and profes - sionally furnished to fit the style of the region. There is no charge to stay in a Fisher House, although donations to the Fisher House General Post Fund are accepted. Having families nearby also helps the patients in their recovery. \"A family's love is good medi - cine,\" said Ken Fisher, echoing the major theme of the Fisher House Foundation. He joined the foundation board after his uncle Zachary died. \"This is a very stressful time for a veteran and the veteran's family,\" said Dr. Madhu Agarwal, VA's chief of - ficer for Patient Care Services, which oversees VA's Fisher House program. \"By taking care of a veteran's family, we are providing services that help our patients.\" Fisher said the houses are a good example of how the public and pri - vate sectors can come together for the overall benefit of the American people. He said the number of Fisher Houses at VA medical centers is expanding to meet the need for ad - ditional housing for family members in large part because of the increased number of veterans and service mem - bers returning from Iraq and Afghani - stan with severe wounds. \"New houses were not built just because we are able to build them,\" Fisher said. \"We had them built where the needs are the greatest.\" Fisher added that the houses also serve as a setting in which families provide moral and psychological sup - port for each other. \"It's an important byproduct\u2014the bonding of family support for each other is found in the common areas where they meet and share their expe - riences.\" More Houses Planned for the Future March/April 2009 13feature VA nguard VA Puget Sound. \"Seeing and feel - ing the girl every day most certainly helped the girl's father recover. It's a great example of how having families nearby at the Fisher Houses provides veterans with inspiration to help them get through their sometimes challenging ordeals.\" The Fisher Houses help families defray costly housing, food and trans - portation expenses while providing ways for them to be close to their loved ones. For more than 15 years, Jim and Ann Rogers made the six-hour drive from their home in Parsons, W.Va., to the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center in Richmond, Va., several times a year to transport and be with their son, Ron, whenever he needed treatment related to the spinal cord injuries he suffered in a 1993 automobile accident while serv - ing at Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. Many of their visits required At the VA Puget Sound Health Care System just outside Se - attle, Fisher House residents and staff got used to seeing 4-year-old Jessica Storrs playing with her toys around the house. Her sunny, playful disposition belied the difficult time the girl's mother and aunt were hav - ing while the girl's father was under - going treatment and care at VA Puget Sound. Jessica's father, Niles, was admit - ted to VA in November 2008 and underwent a series of operations for cardiac-related complications. He was discharged after a weeklong stay and is back home with his family in Aber - deen, Wash. \"Having the little girl so close by was a big part of what helped the veteran bounce back,\" said Cecile Bagrow, Fisher House manager at Comfo rt and Companionship hotel stays five or six miles from the medical center for days or weeks at a time. Because they wanted to stay with their son around the clock, the two would travel back and forth from the hotel to the hospital, sometimes at odd hours late at night or early in the morning. Going back and forth was both trying and taxing on them physi - cally, mentally and emotionally. And it was expensive, because they were paying for their own lodging, meals and transportation. Now, thanks to the recently completed Fisher House right on the grounds of the Richmond medical center, the two are only a few minutes away. Jim Rogers estimates he and his wife have made about 30 trips to be with Ron during his hospital stays over the years. When the Fisher House in Richmond was completed last September, the Rogerses stayed for about four months. They went home and came back for another three weeks in January. \"It was magical for us to be able to stay there and be close to Ron dur - ing the holidays,\" said Ann Rogers. VA provides staff to run its Fisher Houses. Sheets said Fisher House managers and support staff are respon - sible for the day-to-day operations of the house. \"They keep the Fisher House in tip-top shape, collaborating with many other VA staff and volunteers, Central Office, the Fisher House Foundation and community support - ers,\" Sheets said. Fisher House managers deal with families in stressful situations; their job is to make sure those families are comfortably accommodated. \"I see my role, and that of the Fisher House staff, as an advocate for the families, keeping their best inter - ests at heart,\" said Bagrow, the Fisher House manager at Puget Sound. \"We offer the gift of hospitality\u2014listening to stories, giving hugs, bringing some Marilyn White, left, and Dorothy Damiano are longtime volunteers at VA's first Fisher House, on the grounds of the VA medical center in Albany, N.Y., where a photo of Fisher House founders Zachary and Eliza - beth Fisher hangs above the mantel. roZ budka1\u0018 March/April 2009feature VA nguard humor to their day.\" \"It's an honor to be in this job,\" said Wayne Walker, who became Fisher House manager in Richmond after his Army career, including serv - ing as a battalion command sergeant major in Afghanistan. Walker said his military background helps him in many ways because he was separated from his family at different intervals during his Army career, so he knows and understands what families go through. \"The family members who stay here are here because of the sacrifices made by their loved ones in service to their country,\" Walker said. \"We do everything we can to make them feel at home while they are here.\" Fisher House managers also share their individual experiences and net - work through national conference calls, annual conferences and reaching out to each other. \"They have a unique friendship and support each other in service to our nation's veterans, service members and their families,\" Sheets said. In addition to making sure the needs of the families are met, Fisher House managers develop policies and standard operating procedures for suc - cessful operation of the Fisher House. Managers serve as liaisons be - tween the clinical providers and veterans and families lodged at Fisher House. They consult with clinical staff to enhance services provided and typically make appropriate referrals for psychosocial support. They partner with other medical center staff to ensure smooth opera - tion of the house. They engage com - munity groups and veterans service organizations to plan special activities and events both at the Fisher House and in the community. And Fisher House managers work closely with the hundreds of volun - teers who serve at houses throughout VA. Volunteers serve in a variety of ways, ranging from organizing events to cooking to acting as a liaison be - tween Fisher House managers and the VA medical center staff. Their most important role, how - ever, may be the comfort and com - panionship they provide to families. Georgianna Smith has been vol - unteering at the Tampa Fisher House since July 2007, as a form of therapy after her son, Army Capt. Kevin Joseph Smith, was killed on Dec. 8, 2005, by a roadside bomb while serv - ing in Iraq. Smith does a range of chores around the Fisher House. She prides herself on working to make the house look like a 5-Star Hotel. More im - portant, she can understand what the families are going through, dealing with the severe wounds of their loved ones as they are being cared for at the medical center's Polytrauma Rehabili - tation Center. \"I know the kind pain\u2014and change\u2014these families are going through,\" Smith said. \"I am there for these families to help them with the change they have to learn to deal with. There's nothing more impor - tant.\" She now has her own cleaning business, and donates her time and services to the Fisher House. She also has led a drive to get local businesses to donate cleaning supplies and carpet cleaning equipment. Volunteers like Smith play a ma - jor role not only in providing meals and treats, but also in helping families cope with their situations. In Albany, Dorothy Damiano and Marilyn White have been baking for Fisher House guests for many years. Damiano retired in 1983 from the Albany VA Medical Center, where she worked as a trauma nurse. She has volunteered at the Fisher House since \"Many of our volunteers are there because they can personally relate to what the families are going through.\" Four-year-old Jessica Storrs was a familiar sight around the VA Puget Sound Health Care Sys - tem Fisher House when her father was undergoing treatment at the health care system.lorraine tho Mas March/April 2009 1\u0018feature VA nguard 1994, when it first opened.

On Mondays and Thursdays, guests will find White there, baking brownies, apple cakes, scones and raspberry squares. She also orients new guests and assists with managing the house. Damiano and White often sit down with the guests having coffee or tea and sharing stories. Sometimes they lend a shoulder to cry on. \"Dorothy Damiano was one of the first VA volunteers at a Fisher House,\" said Laura Balun, director of VA's Voluntary Service in headquarters. \"The comfort and love and relation - ships that take place at the Fisher Houses come about because of the dedication of volunteers like Doro - thy. Many of our volunteers are there because they can personally relate to what the families are going through.\" On Wednesdays, Blue Star Moth - ers Mallie Murray, Rebecca Hick - man and Linda Carr usually can be found baking brownies, cupcakes and snacks for Fisher House families at the Richmond VA Medical Center. They prepared the Thanksgiving meal for guests last year. They are planning to begin serving the guests a monthly meal. Sometimes volunteers run er - rands and help with transportation and other tasks, particularly helpful because many of the guests are not familiar with the city in which they are staying. The group also recently spurred a fund-raising campaign that led to the purchase of a golf cart used to help transport the guests from the Fisher House to the hospital to visit their loved ones. Murray's son serves in the Ma - rine Corps and has been to Iraq three times. \"You're dealing with people's emotions, with their finances, with the personal tragedy of whatever hap - pened to their loved ones,\" Murray said. \"You have to provide empathy and sympathy and still not lose your perspective.\" \"All of us say, 'There but for the grace of God go I,'\" said Hickman. \"We are here to help and offer them some hope,\" added Carr. \"We let them know that somebody does care.\" By Bill Outlaw Editor's note: Susan Wentzell contributed to this story.Blue Star Mother Mallie Murray bakes for the families staying at the Fisher House at the VA medical center in Rich - mond, Va., on Wednesdays. don spragg1\u0018 March/April 2009feature VA nguard President Abraham Lincoln's powerful words carry deep meaning for a nation during times of war and peace. For veterans, the immortal phrase \"to care for him who shall have borne the battle\" from Lincoln's second inaugural address means the nation will not forget their sacrifice. To commemorate Lincoln's historic reelection in 1864, volun - teers with Friends of Reclaiming Our Heritage from the Milwaukee area reenacted the 16th President's second inaugural ball Feb. 28. The organization, which counts employees and volunteers from the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee among its mem - bers, conducted the first-ever event as a commemoration of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. Held at the Marion Center for Nonprofits, located along Milwaukee's picturesque lakefront, the ball also raised funds to support the organization's multi-era military en - campment held each year at the VA facility. \"We are strongly tied to the VA and its history,\" said Laura Rinaldi, Friends of Reclaiming Our Heritage president and VA employee. \"Our facility started as the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in May of 1867.\" The legislation creating the National Home was one of the last bills signed into law by Lincoln before his assassination in 1865. Rinaldi, who was also a member of the organization's committee for the ball, noted that no detail was overlooked in recreating the look and feel of the second inauguration. \"We even patterned the breaks [during the ball] after an 1880s Grand Army of the Republic Ball that our dance mis - tress located. \"Everything was scheduled, right down to the music,\" Rinaldi added. \"We had regular music during the breaks and dance music by different groups during the ball itself.\" Music for the ball was provided by the Regimental Volunteer Band of Wisconsin, the award-winning fiddle and guitar duo John and Susan Nich - olson of Frogwater, and solo vocalist Gary Alexander. In keeping with the traditional theme of the evening, many of the guests arrived for the evening dressed in highly detailed 18th and 19th cen - tury attire. \"You can't just go to a costume shop and purchase a Civil War-era dress,\" said Patricia Lynch, ball dance Commemorating Lincoln President and Mrs. Lincoln (Robert Rotgers and Jessica Mi - chna) enter the ballroom. kirsten larson continued on page 19Milwaukee VA Medical Center employees help reenact the 16th President's second inaugu - ral ball. March/April 2009 1\u0018feature VA nguard only a month before he was assassinated, abraham lincoln delivered a surprisingly simple and brief second inaugural ad - dress on the steps of the recently completed capitol building in Washington, d.c. on March 4, 1865, lincoln took the executive oath of of - fice for the second time. at that time, the nation was in the last throes of the civil War. during the course of the war, more than 600,000 lives were lost. lincoln knew the war had taken a toll on the country, fracturing it into two halves. in front of thousands of specta - tors, he stood at the podium and delivered his address to the nation. speaking out on the tumultuous war and the end of slavery, lincoln, ever watchful of the times, spoke strong words of brevity, rec - onciliation and healing. to close, he stated: \"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as god gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan\u2014to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all na - tions.\" lincoln was setting the tone for the nation's healing and reconstruction. those powerful words became part of his legacy; they were eventually carved onto the walls of the lincoln Memorial in Washington, d.c. in May 1959, a portion of that address, \"to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan,\" became the motto of the department of Veterans affairs, then called the Veterans administration. today, on the front of V a central office in Washington, d.c., the motto is engraved on metal plaques adorning both sides of the main entrance. the plaques were installed at the direction of sumner g. Whittier, the fifth administrator of the Veterans administration. as chronicled in the nov. 10, 1959, issue of VAnguard, one of Whittier's first tasks when he became administrator was to create a \" chart room\" to serve as the operations center of the Veterans administration. the room contained several lincoln quotes, for inspirational and reflective purposes, including lincoln's \" house divided\" speech. Whittier, a huge admirer of lincoln, was inspired by lincoln's philosophy, and wanted it to guide the Veterans administration's dealings with veterans, especially those that are disabled. a graduate of boston university, Whittier spent most of his life in public service. a World War ii navy veteran, he was discharged as a lieuten - ant and went into local politics in boston. he served in the Massachusetts state legisla - ture, in the everett city govern - ment, and was twice selected as a delegate to gop national conventions. prior to joining the Veterans administration, he served as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts from 1953 to 1957. Whittier joined the Veterans administration as chief insurance direc - tor in january 1957, and from december of that year to january 1961, he served as administrator. he is credited with many Va firsts, including instal - lation of the first comput - ers, and creation of the employee newsletter (now magazine) VAnguard and the V a alumni associa - tion. he also brought to the forefront V a's connection to lincoln. in january 1961, Whit - tier accepted a position as executive director of the Michigan Medical service ( blue shield). he was later in - volved in three of president nixon's initiatives: welfare reform, revenue sharing, and the phase ii economic program. in the 1970s, Whittier became the director of the adult assistance planning office at social security and signed the first social security insurance treasury voucher for $285 million on jan. 1, 1974. in 2004, he published a book of poetry entitled, To Jessie, Sonnets to a Saint, and today, at age 97, he lives in Maryland. - By Amanda Hester A Guiding Philosophy: 50th Anniversary of the VA Motto Clockwise from top: Jaye Whittier, daughter of former VA Administrator Sumner G.

William upham sr. had traveled cross country from Westminster, Mass., to racine, Wis., with his fam - ily in 1853. after the civil War broke out in 1861, the youngest of five brothers and two sisters enlisted in racine's belle city rifles, which later became company F, 2nd Wisconsin infantry\u2014part of the famed \" iron brigade.\" \"My father was wounded at the First battle of bull run (Manassas) in 1861 and left for dead,\" upham jr. says. \" a minie ball had pierced his chest above the heart and left an enormous exit wound.\" Minie balls were large-caliber, soft lead bullets that caused terrible wounds throughout the civil War. the battle took place july 21, 1861, claiming the lives of about 850 union and confederate soldiers. upham sr. was one of 2,706 men wounded in the fight. three days later, scaven - gers on the battlefield came upon a motionless upham sr. and took off his shoes. suddenly, the wounded soldier spoke to them: \" i hope to use those shoes some day.\" \"he must have startled the crap out of those thieves,\" upham jr. says. after recovering at a confederate hospital, upham sr. was shipped to the infamous libby prison in richmond, Va. a few months later, he was paroled during a prisoner exchange and had a personal audience with president lincoln, who asked to see the young man's wound. \"When my father was old, i used to help him get dressed and would place both hands on his back trying to cover the wound. i couldn't cover the whole thing,\" upham jr. recalls. lincoln was so impressed with upham sr. that he ap - pointed him to the u.s. Military academy at West point in 1862. graduating four years later, upham sr. became officer of the guard at Fort Monroe, Va., responsible for guarding jefferson davis, former president of the confederacy. he got to know davis well, recalls his son, playing chess and talking with da- vis until the wee hours of the morning. davis was familiar with Wisconsin, having spent time there as a young officer. upham sr. resigned his commission in 1869. \"My father returned to Wisconsin and became one of the founders of the town of Marshfield,\" upham jr. says. \" he owned many businesses, served as mayor and was very much loved by his neighbors.\" in the great Marshfield fire of 1894, the town burned to the ground, save the upham home. \"after the fire, Marshall Field\u2014 founder of the chicago department stores\u2014who was a friend, sent my father a check for $25,000 to rebuild the town.

March 15 marked the 20th anniversary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The depart - ment we know today was founded as the Veterans Administration (VA) in 1930. For the next 58 years, the VA strove to keep Lincoln's promise\u2014\"to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan\"\u2014providing the nation's veterans the health care, benefits, education, homes and jobs they had earned through selfless service and sacrifice. Yet veterans still lacked a seat at the table in the Presi - dent's Cabinet Room. Congress and President Reagan rectified that shortcoming in 1988, and on March 15, 1989, the VA of our fathers and grandfathers be - came the Department of Veter - ans Affairs. Since 1989, the department has grown from 240,000 to 286,000 employees, serving more than 23 million veterans and their families. VA operates 153 medical centers, 755 outpatient clinics, 230 vet centers, 128 na - tional cemeteries, and 54 region - al offices. It is the second-largest of the 15 Cabinet departments, the sixth-largest insurance company, and the largest health-care system whose patients all have electronic health records. VA's online health record system recently received a top award for innovation in Web-based medical records, and its national cemeteries have recently earned the highest score ever in customer satisfaction. VA has a long and illustrious history under the leadership of such administrators as Frank Hines, Omar Bradley, Max Cleland and Harry Walters.

Pvt. August Bloedner, a mem - ber of the unit, used a natural outcrop of limestone to fashion the monu - ment, and it was placed on the graves at Munfordville, Ky., by the end of January 1862 before the 32nd Indiana Infantry marched on. The Bloedner Monument is the nation's oldest Civil War monument, and as such possesses exceptional historic significance. In 1867, the remains of these fallen soldiers and their monument were moved to Cave Hill National Cemetery in Louisville. This national cemetery is located in a corner of his - toric Cave Hill Cemetery, a premier Rural-style burial ground established in 1848. Initial interments of soldiers who died at camps and hospitals in the Louisville area occurred in No - vember 1861. The fragile Bloedner Monument, also known as the \"First German\" Monument, was transported to a curatorial facility at the University of Louisville, where it may reside for up to three years. Unfortunately, only about 50 percent of the original inscription\u2014a relief sculpture of an eagle and about 300 words in Ger - man carved in a rustic Fraktur-like script\u2014survive. Professional conservators will treat the monument while it is at the university to retard further loss of ma - terial; in the meantime, NCA will be seeking an appropriate facility where it can be displayed to the public. Con - current to this work, NCA is pursuing the creation of a replica of the monu - ment based on a 1955 photograph when it was in better condition, and historic transcriptions of the inscrip - tion to install at Cave Hill National Cemetery. Failure of the monument is due in part to the fact that it was fabricated from a poor-quality St. Genevieve limestone; in contrast, the small base made of Bedford limestone installed at the national cemetery in 1867 is in very good condition. Pollution and other environmental foes have has - tened deterioration of the limestone. The monument measures approxi - mately 5 feet long, 1 foot deep and 3- and-a-half feet high, and weighs about 3,500 pounds. Moving the monument required cutting through the mortar anchor -ing its limestone base from its footer. A steel \"lifting frame\" box was built around and below the monument on site. After padding the monument, it was lifted with a hydraulic crane onto a truck bed, where it was affixed to a substantial wood pallet and strapped into position for the 10-mile trip across town. NCA's contractor for the overall project is Heritage Preservation of Washington, D.C., which has exten - sive experience in outdoor sculpture preservation and care. Conservation Solutions Inc. of Santa Fe, N.M., is the conservator. All plans for the monument are being made in col - laboration with the VA Historic Preservation Office and the Kentucky Heritage Council, the state's historic preservation office. While the monu - ment is at the university, NCA and the Kentucky Heritage Council will work with Civil War-interest groups and others to identify a facility where it can be displayed and protected over the long term. The Bloedner Monument replica and interpretive signage about it are slated to be placed in Cave Hill Na - tional Cemetery by September 2009. August Bloedner was born in 1827 in the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg Preserving the Nation's Oldest Civil War Memorial NCA begins a project to save the Bloedner Monument at Cave Hill National Cemetery. On Dec. 17, 1861, a battle ensued at Rowlett's Station in western Kentucky in which the 32nd Indiana Infantry Regi - ment, composed entirely of German immigrants, deflected a Confederate attack. Union casualties were less than 40. March/April 2009 2\u0018feature VA nguard interment of the fallen 32nd indiana infantry on the Munfordville battle - field, and later installation of the monument, is documented in letters from the soldiers who witnessed it. \"on the morning after the battle, 10 of the fallen were buried on top of a knoll with all military honors,\" wrote one. in the afternoon, a military pro - cession \"moved to the burial place under the sounds of a mournful dirge ... then the dead were low - ered into the graves under inspiring sounds of the 'Marsallaise.' the companies to which the dead men belonged stepped forward, pulled sprigs of evergreen from their hats and dropped them on their former brothers in arms as a last greeting.\" in early February 1862, the regiment passed by these soldiers' graves again, and one soldier found that the burial site \"is surrounded by rails, their burial mound is adorned with fir trees and ivy ... a stone lays among these trees that contains the names, ages and birthplaces of these heroes handsomely and tastefully carved by an artist in the regiment.\" there are 12 names on the monument as well as an inscription that displays fierce germanic pride for serving the union despite some unfamiliarity with the language of the united states: \" here rest the first men of the 32nd First german regiment of indiana who gave their lives for the free institutions of the republic of the united states of north america. they fell on 17 december 1861 in the encounter at rowlett's station, ky., in which 1 regiment of texas- rangers, 2 regi - ments of infantry and 6 cannons of the rebels, more than 3,000 strong, were beaten into flight from the battlefield by 500 german soldiers.\"(now Thuringia), Germany, and he arrived in the United States about 1849. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Bloedner enlisted for three years; he was sent to Indianapolis to serve in the 32nd Indiana Infantry because it was made up of German immigrants, many of whom were not fluent in English. The Battle of Rowlett's Sta - tion did not result in a victory for either side, but the Union forces did protect a local railroad, ensuring that troops and supplies would continue to move through the area. Documenting the 'First German' Monument Top: To move the monument, workers first had to cut through the mortar anchoring its lime - stone base from its footer. Then a steel \"lifting frame\" box was built around and below it; above: Once it was free, it was padded and lifted onto a truck bed for its 10-mile trip. courtes Y nca histor Y progra M oFFice courtes Y nca histor Y M oFFice VA nguard around headquarters 2\u0018 March/April 2009In August 2005, the Office of Management and Budget issued Memorandum 05-22, establishing the goal of transi - tioning the federal government from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to version 6 (IPv6). Why? The world was quickly running out of IP ad - dresses, which are necessary for any electronic device to con - nect to the Internet. Under IPv4, networked devices are assigned a 32-bit address, limiting the number of addresses to 4.3 billion. Once an unthinkably large number, when only one in several thousand homes had a computer, it is not nearly enough in an age where multi- computer homes are common and cell phones and other devices can connect to the Internet. The new backbone of Internet infrastructure, IPv6 operates on a 128-bit address that can provide more than 340 undecillion possible ad - dresses. Yes, that's a real math term that equates to 340 fol - lowed by 36 zeroes. Most recently, the 2008 Beijing Olympics was the first major event to be broadcast entirely using IPv6. The short - age of IPv4 addresses has hit the rest of the world the hard - est, forcing many countries to adopt the use of IPv6 much earlier than in the U.S. As a result, many countries have surpassed the U.S. in their ability to reap the benefits of the newer network protocol. Many will long remember watching U.S. swimmer Mi - chael Phelps shatter one record after another during the 2008 Summer Olympics, bringing home eight gold medals. The implementation and use of IPv6 during the 2008 Beijing Olympics allowed for simulta -neous broadcasting of events in real time, without a single dropped frame of video cover - age. \"IPv6 is the future of the Internet and is becoming the foundation for all future com - munication infrastructures,\" said Steven Pirzchalski, direc - tor of telecommunications engineering and design with the Office of Information and Technology in VA Central Office. \"As the Department moves toward a converged net - work architecture, we will be able to take advantage of new capabilities like voice-over IP, IP-based video and other col - laboration-based applications that will allow us to offer more services cost-effectively. \" Since OMB's 2005 man - date, VA has consecutively been rated as one of the best federal agencies in meeting the new compliance. OMB rated VA's IPv6 compliance during the first year of the transition at 4/5, with a 5/5 for 2007 and 2008. In June 2008, VA met OMB's 2008 IPv6 man - date, and has been selected as one of three Level One federal agencies out of 165 tasked un - der the mandate. \"We have taken the over - all lead in developing an IPv6 training curriculum that other agencies are leveraging to sup - port their transition activities and we have taken the lead in assembling a multi-agency IPv6 test initiative that in - cludes VA, NIST, GSA, SSA and the IRS,\" said Pirzchalski. \"While we believe we were instrumental in helping many agencies achieve success during the first phase of the federal IPv6 transition process, we know that it is just the begin - ning and we will continue to be a thought leader in IPv6 during the ongoing transition process.\" While VA has been successful in complying with OMB, the new IPv6 infrastructure has the poten - tial to advance service to veterans\u2014in - cluding health care. For in - stance, a doc - tor might be able to check a patient's vital signs or con - trol an IV drip from a remote location in real time. \"The significantly greater number of addresses IPv6 provides is critical, but that is only a small part of the value IPv6 will provide the department,\" said Pirzchalski. \"We will be able to leverage new capabilities from IPv6 that will help us simplify our network, make it easier to manage, scale it to handle or - ders of magnitude more devic - es, provide greater security and make it more flexible to meet our changing requirements.\" Pirzchalski said IPv6 will give VA better ability to: n deploy converged services (video, voice, etc.) to add new capabilities and reduce costs; n provide enhanced in-home services to veterans and their families; n implement greater security across the entire enterprise; and n implement identity man - agement systems across the department and with business partners.In addition to bolstering patient care, IPv6 can also assist VA in its mission to re - spond to national emergencies and natural disasters such as its response to Hurricanes Gus - tav and Ike in Louisiana and Texas in August. New VA initiatives such as the expansion of commu - nity-based outpatient clinics may be the first to reap the benefits of IPv6. Auto-con - figured networks will bring CBOCs online faster, provid - ing them with a wealth of pa - tient medical history to better serve them. Phase II of OMB's IPv6 migration requires federal agencies to have IT staff, sys - tems and software on IPv6, a native IPv6 operational network, and IPv6 network services and applications on - line and in use by 2011, with a total transition away from IPv4 to IPv6 by 2014.IPv6: The Next Generation Internet Will Offer New Capability Steven Pirzchalski says the new backbone of Internet infrastructure will allow VA to offer better service to veterans.art gardiner VA nguard March/April 2009 2\u0018around headquarters President Obama's first pro - posed budget for VA expands eligibility for health care to an additional 500,000 veter - ans over the next five years, meets the need for continued growth in programs for the combat veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, and provides the resources to deliver quality health care for the nation's 5.5 million veteran patients.If accepted by Congress, the 2010 budget request would increase VA's budget from $97.7 billion this fiscal year to $112.8 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2009. This is in addition to the $1.4 billion provided for VA projects in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The 2010 budget repre -sents the first step toward in - creasing discretionary funding for VA efforts by $25 billion over the next five years. The gradual expansion in health care enrollment that this would support will open hos - pital and clinic doors to more than 500,000 veterans by 2013 who have been excluded from VA medical care benefits since 2003. The 2010 budget request provides the resources to achieve this level of service while maintaining high qual - ity and timely care for lower- income and service-disabled veterans who currently rely on VA medical care. The new budget provides greater benefits for veterans who are medically retired from active duty, allowing for the first time all military retirees to keep their full VA disability compensation along with their retired pay. The President's budget request also provides the resources for ef - fective implementation of the post-9/11 GI Bill\u2014providing unprecedented levels of educa - tional support to the men and women who have served the nation through active military duty. The new budget will sup - port additional specialty care in such areas as prosthetics, vision and spinal cord injury, aging, and women's health. New VA Centers of Excellence will focus on improving these critical services. The proposed budget also addresses homelessness among veterans. It expands VA's current services through a col - laborative pilot program with nonprofit organizations that is aimed at maintaining stable housing for vulnerable veterans at risk of homelessness, while providing them with support - ive services to help them get back on their feet through job training, preventive care, and other services. Finally, the President's budget request provides the necessary investments to carry VA services to rural com - munities that are too often unable to access VA care. The President's budget expands VA mental health screening and treatment with a focus on reaching veterans in rural areas in part through an increase in the number of vet centers and mobile health clinics. New outreach funding will help rural veterans and their families stay informed of these resources and encourage them to pursue needed care. Employees, veterans and the public can see how VA plans to spend the more than $1.4 billion it is receiving as part of President Obama's stimulus package on the VA Recovery Web site at www. va.gov/recovery. The stimulus package, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is a key part of efforts to stimulate the economy through government programs. VA will use the funds to improve medical facilities and national cemeteries, provide grants to assist states in acquir - ing or constructing state nurs - ing homes and domiciliaries, and to modify or alter existing facilities to care for veterans. For those programs requiring construction, VA expects to award competitive, fixed-price contracts that com - ply with the Buy American and reporting requirements of the Recovery Act. Stimulus funds will also be used to hire and train temporary claims processors, pursue needed information technology initiatives, and to oversee and audit programs, grants and projects funded un - der the Recovery Act. According to the VA Recovery Web site, the department's appropriation breaks down this way: medi - cal facilities-$1 billion; grants for state extended care-$150 million; general operating ex - penses-claims processors-$150 million; Veterans - ministration National Cemetery Administration-$50 million; general operating expenses- support of veteran stimulus payments-$7.1 million; Office of Inspector General-$1 mil - lion; and IT support of veteran stimulus payments-$100,000. In addition, VA is mak - ing a one-time payment of $250 to eligible veterans and survivors to mitigate the effects of the current economy. VA estimates $700 million in pay - ments will be made, with pay - ments beginning in June. To be eligible for the pay - ment, VA beneficiaries must have received compensation, pension, dependency and in - demnity compensation (DIC), or spina bifida benefits at any time between November 2008 and January 2009. Also, bene - ficiaries must reside within the United States or Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Is - lands, American Samoa, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The graduation ceremony was held at VA headquarters. The interns spent the previous 12 months at VA's National Cemetery Administration National Training Center in St. Louis. In the weeks following graduation, they began work as directors or assistants to directors at national cemeteries around the country. The National Training Center focuses on preparing employees to manage and oper - ate cemeteries as national shrines for America's deceased veterans and military personnel. No other federal training facility provides training in cemetery management. VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki was the key - note speaker at the graduation\u2014his first official ceremony after being sworn in as Secretary on Jan. 21. \"With today's graduation, you affirm your readiness to assume stewardship for the national shrines that are the final resting places of the men and women who have protected and preserved this country since before the birth of the republic. \"More than 3.4 million Americans\u2014veterans from the Revolutionary War to today's Global War on Terrorism\u2014lie in final repose in our cemeteries.

My Health eVet, VA's personal health record for veterans, now has a new feature available to help veterans manage their health care online, putting the power of e-health care with patients. Personalized Well - ness Reminders is joining the award-winning assortment of online tools available on My Health eVet. This new feature and current tools such as VA Prescription Refill, Research Health and others, enhance patient-provider relationships and continue to integrate into VA's much-lauded electronic health records system. More than access to on - line health information and a gateway to online benefits and services, My Health eVet enhances a veteran's commu - nication with their primary health care team and allows veterans to become active part - ners in their health care. With more than 740,000 users now registered on My Health eVet, it is clear that the integration of features, access to health information, and one-stop shopping for VA benefits and services improves patient sat - isfaction and enhances quality health care for veterans nation - wide. With the Wellness Re - minders feature, veterans can be more involved in their own health care by following re - minders of upcoming tests as well as having the information to avoid duplicate tests and procedures. Wellness Remind - ers lets the patient know, ac - cording to current guidelines and recommendations for good care, that it is time to have a test or examination done. For instance, a veteran can be reminded that it is time for a colorectal cancer screening or flu shot, accord - ing to Theresa Hancock, My Health eVet program director. Veterans with diabetes can be reminded of tests such as hemoglobin A1c, and women veterans can be reminded of breast or cervical cancer screenings. This feature also allows veterans to share their Wellness Reminders with non-VA health care providers; they can easily log them into their e-health journal and print out the summary prior to any clinic visit. Wellness Reminders is available to any veteran who registers on My Health eVet and completes the In-Person Authentication process at their local VA medical center or clinic. In-Person Authentica - tion requires VA patients to provide valid, government- issued photo identification (veteran identification card, driver's license or other gov - ernment-issued photo identi - fication) to an authorized VA staff member and sign a release of information form. VA patients also are required to watch a brief video that can be viewed right on the My Heal - theVet Web site. In-Person Authentication may be done at any VA medical center and many community-based out - patient clinics across the coun - try.

VA nguard March/April 2009 29around headquarters Ten students from Marshall Academy in Falls Church, Va., visited VA Central Office in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 5 as part of the third annual Information Technology Job Shadow Day. Sponsored by the Office of Information and Technology, this year's theme, \"Moving IT Forward: The Next Generation,\" emphasized the fast-paced and ever-ex - panding IT field. After a welcome by Act - ing Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology Stephen W. Warren, the stu - dents, all seniors at Marshall Academy, were given a brief overview of VA and its mis - sion. Throughout the daylong tour, the students visited dif - ferent areas of the building, including the Section 508 Compliance Lab, to learn more about VA's data storage, software applications and net - working capabilities. At noon, a panel discussion was held with former OI&T interns, many of whom became VA employees themselves. Later in the day, the stu - dents shadowed assigned men - tors\u2014senior-level IT special - ists\u2014to get some hands-on ex - perience with IT systems and applications. VA mentors for this year's students included Ruth J. Peterson, director, ad - ministrative support business operations; David Cheplick, director, wide area network; Shelby Bell, supervisory pro - gram management officer; Kevin Causley, director, region 5, OI&T; and John Livornese, director, record management services. The mentors focused on telecommunications, server-based networks, and IT communications, and also gave the students advice on the best degree paths to follow and cer - tifications that can help them acquire an IT position. At Marshall Academy, the students enroll in advanced IT classes, and most have already passed the exam to receive their professional-level Micro - soft certifications. Through their classes, they learn how to run an entire network, from cabling to servers to security. \"We hope the students will realize that all their train - ing and their hard work will lead to a nice job, that it all comes to fruition,\" said Allan Jones, network administration teacher at Marshall Academy. \"The main goal for the stu - dents is to learn what they need to do to get into these types of positions.\" Carlos Robinson, work - place coordinator of the IT Job Shadow Program in OI&T, said the shadowing program is important in plan - ning for the future of VA. \"This program gives the stu - dents step-by-step guidelines on how to become an em - ployee with the federal govern - ment. VA's objective is to get them familiar with the student intern programs available to them.\" At the end of the day, the students were excited about the hands-on experience and guidance they received from the VA staff. \"They were in - trigued with the correlation of what they are learning in high school to the IT applications their mentors displayed to them today,\" said Robinson. Marshall Academy, con - sidered a \"school within a school,\" currently has more than 750 students from 14 dif - ferent high schools. Students typically come to the school for one or two specific classes and then return to their base schools for their standard courses. Ten Local Students Participate in Third Annual IT Job Shadow Day During their visit, the high school students got a tour of the Section 508 Compliance Lab with test engineer Alan Schlank. \"Leadership development\" may not sound like such a new concept for most organiza - tions. Many government agen - cies can boast of educational opportunities for high-poten - tial, high-performing employ - ees, as well as document their record of training for Senior Executive Service candidates. The question then becomes, once these well-trained em - ployees become SES members, what further developmental opportunities are available to them? VA has recognized and embraced the notion that lead - ership is not a destination, but a continuous journey. The VA Executive Fel - lows Program, launched in 2006, is designed to reward and recognize senior executives who demonstrate outstand - ing leadership. This unique extended learning program un - derscores VA's understanding that not only do incumbent senior officials bring a wealth of talent, experience and knowledge to their leadership profile, but a valuable oppor - tunity exists to facilitate the ongoing learning and develop - ment of these senior career executives. VA Learning University, the department's corporate university, along with a group of VA's senior learning leaders, have designed the EFP to en - hance the networking of a di - verse group of leaders, facilitate the sharing of best practices, and provide access to new learning tools and resources customized for executives. This one-year program provides participants with a number of options for devel - opment activities, including: n executive coaching with pri - vate sector coaches; n VA senior mentors; n executive leadership train - ing; n detail assignments/mini-sab - baticals; n opportunities to serve as Developmental Opportunity Now Offered to Senior Leadership continued on page 30robert turtil VA nguard introducing 30 March/April 2009Music therapist J.

Presented to him on Oct. 26, 2008, at the National Veterans Creative Arts Festival in Riverside, Ca - lif., the award is named after the former chief of Recreation Therapy Service at the VA medical center in Knoxville, Iowa. Jefferies served as advisor to the Creative Arts Festival until she died of cancer in August 1994. Her award is presented to an individual who demonstrates true dedication to the Festival, its goals and philosophy. Crumrine said he is hon - ored and humbled to have won the award. \"It's a warm and contented sort of feeling to know that I am thought so well of by so many. It's humbling when I look at the list of others who have been honored and think that I am among them. It is particularly powerful when a veteran, who has sacrificed so much, is con - gratulatory towards me.\" Crumrine, who has worked at the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee since 1993, is well respected among his peers for using his love of music as medicine. \"Shep is very personable and so easygo - ing,\" said Berger, Ph.D., Zablocki VAMC psychologist and Crumrine's supervisor. \"He is able to handle all kinds of clinical situations, and the veterans really like him. He is dedicated to his job and does what it takes to provide an en - vironment of recovery for our veterans.\" Since 1998, Crumrine has been a member of the Na - tional Veterans Creative Arts Festival national committee and assistant stage manager for sound. \"His commitment to vet - erans is evidenced by his caring attitude toward them, and by the way he spends time getting to know them,\" said Elizabeth Mackey, Creative Arts Festival director. \"I've worked with him since he became involved with bringing veterans to the festival. He strives to make their lives better through his own musical talents and music therapy and by assisting them in any way possible.\" Some might ask: What is music therapy? By definition, it is the planned and inten - tional use of music as it affects brain functioning in four ways: attention and distraction; emotion and memory; physi - cal energy and coordination; and stress and anxiety. Music therapists consider these pro - cesses as they plan their use of music, customizing it to each patient depending on what the treatment objective is and the length of the treatment. \"My day is never the same,\" said Crumrine. A typical day begins in the inpatient acute mental health detox unit. After his morning meetings, where he details treatment plans and alerts the attending physicians on each patient's progress, he begins his music therapy sessions. Part of his focus is to re-program negative energy and thoughts, improve self- esteem, and pull emotions out of music. Since the hospital is af - filiated with the Medical College of Wisconsin, the VAMC trains a lot of residents. Crum - rine often works with nursing students and psy - chology graduate students, teach - ing them how to run therapy groups themselves and consult - ing with them afterwards. He conducts informal research in the areas of mental illness and music therapy. He often collects pre- and post-group meeting results to determine different scenario outcomes, such as changes in blood pres - sure, heart rate, mood and pain management. Crumrine, a native of Il - linois, received his bachelor's degree in chemistry and pre-med at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill. But he found something was missing in his medical studies: his love of music. After playing music all his life, he decided to incorpo - rate the two. \"I became a music thera - pist because it was the perfect combo of my interests in medicine and music,\" said Crumrine. After graduating from Illinois State University with a master's degree in music education and music therapy, he began working in the pri - vate sector but soon wanted a change from the money-driven insurance aspect of health care. \"In the private sector, my work was respected but not 'reimbursable'\u2014it was more about the money. I was intrigued by VA's mission: to not just care for the medi - cal needs, but to know the veteran's quality of life is im - portant as well. At VA, I feel supported and committed.

Results of the VA Diabe - tes Trial, published in the Jan. 8 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, indicate that different levels of blood glucose control are appropriate for different patients, rather than a more widely accepted standard. Trying to achieve the cur - Carlos Abraira, M.D., co-chair of the VA Diabetes Trial, discusses the use of a glucometer\u2014a device that measures blood sugar\u2014with pa - tient Fulgencio Rodriguez at the Miami VA Medical Center. larr Y gilstad rent standard recommended by the American Diabetes As - sociation for tightly controlling glucose may not be beneficial to many patients, and may actually result in a potentially life-threatening situation in which blood sugars are too low. \"In older patients with long-standing diabetes, inten - sive glucose control should not be the major focus of care,\" said Dr. William Duckworth, an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes management at the Phoenix VA Health Care System, who co-led the study with Carlos Abraira, M.D., of the Miami VA Medical Cen - ter. \"Risk factors such as blood pressure, blood lipids, diet and exercise should be of primary interest.\" Left unchecked, the high blood glucose levels that char - acterize diabetes damage blood vessels and nerves, resulting in serious complications and even death. Those complications include cardiovascular disease, blindness, and end-stage kid - ney disease. However, for patients who are older and have had diabetes for some time, less intensive control of blood glu - cose can be just as beneficial, according to the researchers. The VA health care system's guidelines already stratify recommendations for glucose control in diabetic patients, depending on their microvas - cular disease, or complications of small blood vessels and other diseases that are present. \"The current approach to care of diabetes in the VA is substantiated by this study,\" said Duckworth. \"Diet, exer - cise, blood pressure and lipid control are all essential factors in management of diabetes. Non-VA providers should consider altering the single goal used by the ADA or the American Association of Clini - cal Endocrinologists to the clinically more appropriate standards of the VA.\" One of the aims of the VA Diabetes Trial was to study the association between intense control of blood glu - cose in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Researchers compared good control with intense control in an older veteran population. They found that aggressive therapy to con - trol blood glucose was not significantly better than less intensive conventional therapy in preventing events such as heart attacks and strokes, with no benefit to lowering levels below 8 percent. There also was no signifi - cant difference in mortality, microvascular complications, or minor cardiovascular events, such as angina and transi - tory ischemic attacks (mini- strokes). The VA Diabetes Trial involved nearly 1,800 veter - ans at 20 VA medical centers across the country, who were followed for a minimum of five years and a maximum of seven-and-a-half years. Study Finds Less Glycemic Control Can Be Beneficial to Some Patients With Diabetes College students who get their flu shots are much less likely to miss school or work each influenza season and live a healthier life, according to a study published in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine in December. The study by researchers at the Minneapolis VA Medi - cal Center and the University of Minnesota surveyed 20,000 college students on two cam - puses. Roughly 30 percent of those students were vac - cinated, and about 24 percent suffered flu-related illnesses between 2002 and 2006. In short, the vaccine pre - vents an illness that can knock students off their feet for up to a week at a time. Multiplied over four years and 18 million college students nationally, that's a lot of lost time. \"We're excited to show bad disease, good vaccine, yet again,\" said Dr. Kristin Nich - ol, an infectious disease expert at the Minneapolis VAMC and a professor at the Univer - sity of Minnesota. The close proximity of students in dorms and class -rooms increases the likelihood of campus outbreaks. Other studies have found anywhere from 9 to 20 percent of stu - dents develop flu-related ill - nesses each season. \"Influenza-like illness is responsible for a substantial disease burden among college students, and vaccination is associated with substantial benefits,\" said Nichol. Researchers have long known that the vaccine can prevent flu, but the study quantifies in multiple ways its beneficial effects.Overall, one-fourth of the students who were not vaccinated said they had an influenza-like illness, defined as an upper respiratory infec - tion that included coughing and fever. That compares to one-fifth of students who were vaccinated. For the unvaccinated, those infections resulted in more missed classes (11 vs. 8 percent); bad tests (6 vs. 4 per - cent); uncompleted homework (9 vs. 6 percent); and badly executed assignments (11 vs. 8 percent.).

A thus-far unpublished finding, Pitman added, is that combat-exposed veterans had a broad array of psychiatric symptoms not seen in their brothers.A decade-long study conduct - ed by VA and the National Institute of Mental Health on PTSD among combat veterans and their identical twins has yielded critical information about the root causes of the condition. Researchers found that both genetic and environ - mental factors increase the risk of developing PTSD. \"In addition to building our understanding of how PTSD comes to exist, we may have useful signs for PTSD prevention and treatment,\" said study author Dr. Roger Pitman, a professor of psychia - try at Harvard Medical School. \"For example, persons with recognized PTSD risk factors may be best advised to avoid occupations that would have them serve in highly stressful situations, such as serving in military forces.

Ruff, neurology service chief at the Cleveland VAMC and professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve University. \"By them - selves, the deficits were not severe, but they compromised the veterans' ability to return to where they were.\" The researchers studied 126 veterans who had lost consciousness\u2014for less than 30 minutes\u2014from blasts and explosions an average of three times while in Iraq. Neuro - logical and neuropsychological testing revealed impairments in 80 of these veterans that the researchers attributed to TBI. Those veterans had been ex - posed to more explosions than the others, the study found. Among veterans diag - nosed with TBI, 93 percent reported having headaches that were more severe and persis - tent than those without TBI. Non-TBI veterans described headaches as tension-like and occurring about four times a month on average. Sixty per - cent of those with TBI said they experienced migraine-lev - el headaches three times more often than their non-TBI counterparts. Many of the veterans participating in the study said they had other symptoms as - sociated with PTSD, such as sleep disorders and problems with their sense of smell. Researchers say the force of a blast can damage delicate nerves that regulate the way the brain cares for these func - tions. \"The olfactory nerves are very small, so when there's movement, they get sheared off,\" said Dr. Keith Young, research coordinator for the VA Center of Excellence for Research on Returning War Veterans at the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System and associate professor and vice chairman for research at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine. \"People who have multiple ex - posures to blasts that cause loss of consciousness need to be carefully monitored for poten - tial problems in the future.\"Young said the study could help health care profes - sionals develop better tech - niques to identify veterans who need a greater level of care. \"The study points to the possibility of using olfactory testing to look for people who might benefit from additional medical testing,\" Young said. \"The good news about these olfactory tests is that they don't require computers, so in a field hospital, you could use scratch and sniff tests to identify people who need ad - ditional testing.\" According to Ruff, the study also suggests that TBI and PTSD must be treated as one problem and not two separate ones. The study can be found on the VA Office of Research & Development's Web site: www.research.va.gov. versed by treatment and could be taken as targets of PTSD treatment.\" Pitman's group studied more than 100 combat veter - ans of the Vietnam War, each of whom had an identical twin who did not serve in combat. \"We made the assump - tion that, because twins have the same genes and the same family upbringing, the twin who did not serve in combat represents what the combat- exposed twin would be like ex - cept for the combat exposure,\" he said. Prior to this research, experts had noted a smaller hippocampal volume in people with PTSD. The hippocam - pus is a part of the brain used in memory. The twins study showed a smaller hippocampal volume existed in both twins, indicating that the lower vol - ume may be a preexisting risk factor for PTSD.\"This suggests the 'fragile egg' hypothesis\u2014that some people are probably geneti - cally a little bit less resilient [to PTSD] than other people,\" said Dr. Julie Fudge, an associ - ate professor of psychiatry and neurobiology and anatomy at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. However, the ventrome - dial prefrontal cortex area of the brain used for decision- making is smaller in the com - bat-exposed veteran compared to their unexposed twin. \"We discovered a number of abnormalities in PTSD combat veterans not shared with their twins, and we in - fer that the abnormality was caused by combat,\" Pitman said. \"One of these is increased heart rate response when the combat veteran is startled.

Searching ahead, she wit - nessed a Dallas County constable's vehicle bounce off the retaining wall. Harrison pulled off the road and rushed to the car, finding the driver unresponsive. All the vehicle doors were smashed or locked shut. Soon other passersby, including VA registered nurse Becky Baird, came upon the scene offering help. A sheriff arrived and was able to pry open a door, allowing Harrison to crawl inside. The victim struggled to communicate that his neck, back and legs were in severe pain. Harrison supported his neck while Baird monitored his pulse and alertness. Firefight - ers soon arrived and the victim was removed from the car and hospitalized. He has since been released and has recovered. Rescue on the Slopes While on a ski vacation, Re - beka Silva, chief of Dental Service at the San Francisco VA Medical Center, witnessed a young girl collapse onto the snow as family members screamed her name.

Two attempts at the Heimlich maneuver failed as bulky ski clothes of rescuer and victim impeded effective contact. One more powerful thrust from a better position produced a cry from the girl's family\u2014\"There it is!\"\u2014as a large wad of bubblegum flew out. The girl took a deep breath and started crying.

The man's son had purchased a ticket for his return to Dallas, 175 miles away, but he hadn't shown up. Farmer mentioned the article to registered nurse Gail Clanton, and the two decided to check records; they found the man was indeed a patient at the clinic. They continued to investigate, learning that the man had been treated the day before, across the country at the VA Boston Healthcare System. The patient had told Boston staff that he had trav - eled for three days to visit his brother, but upon arrival, found his home had been torn down. The patient was left with no place to go and came to the VA Boston emergency room, where he was evalu - ated, treated and placed as an inpatient at the West Roxbury campus. He was then seen by a social worker and placed in a homeless shelter for veterans. Longview \"detectives\" Farmer and Clanton com - municated all the information they had gathered to adminis - trative officer Tim McNamara, who contacted VA police officer Bryan Spear, who in turn contacted Carthage, Texas, and Boston police. The mystery of the missing veteran was solved. The next day's newspaper included a story stating that the man had been located and that his family was bringing him home from Boston. The family stated that the man's memory had been slipping recently and they were grateful to the staff at the Longview VA clinic for locat - ing him.
