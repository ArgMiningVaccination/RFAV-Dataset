The VFC Program provides federally purchased vaccine for eligible children birth through 18 years of age at no cost to public and private health care providers throughout the state. Children eligible to receive VFC provided vaccines include children enrolled in Medicaid, children who do not have health insurance and children who are American Indian or Alaskan Native. In addition, children who have health insurance that does not cover the cost of vaccines are considered to be \"underinsured,\" and are eligible to be seen at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health clinics (RHCs) and public health facilities.
