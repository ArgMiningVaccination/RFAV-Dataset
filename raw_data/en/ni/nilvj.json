The south London ground, which has a capacity of 25,486, will become one of the capital's largest vaccination locations when it opens later in January. The site was pinpointed as an excellent location for a vaccination centre, and the Premier League side previously volunteered Selhurst Park at the start of the pandemic, delivering meals to those in need. Staff will use the Glaziers Lounge in the Main Stand, which has been modified to allow for safe vaccine delivery and social distancing. The hub will only operate via appointments for those who have already got their NHS invites to attend. Crystal Palace co-owner and chairman Steve Parish said: 'We are proud to be playing our part in helping the NHS deliver the vaccine to as many people as possible as quickly as possible. 'Selhurst Park sits at the heart of our community so we were delighted to put our stadium at the disposal of the NHS. 'Nothing could be more important than the rapid roll out of the vaccine program to allow us all to return to something approaching normality.' Dr Nicola Jones, GP lead for the roll out of the vaccine in south-west London, added: 'Our teams have done an amazing job working quickly to get ready to meet the tough logistical challenges of offering the vaccinations. 'We are immensely grateful for the support of organisations like Crystal Palace who are offering their time and facilities to help the NHS. 'The coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective, and will offer people a vital defence against the virus, but we can't be complacent, it is still so important that people continue to follow government guidance and keep their distance. 'The NHS will invite eligible people for the vaccine at a set time to ensure those most at risk are prioritised, it is important not to contact your GP for a vaccination "}
