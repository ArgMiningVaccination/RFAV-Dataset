I was just wondering if you know anything about it. If you do, what would you say is the best crystal for over all health that can be used for crystal acupuncture? Good Morning, I did some research on Crystal Acupuncture after receiving your question. Very interesting! From my understanding, Crystal Acupuncture is basically is the replacing of acupuncture needles with crystals (more specifically, crystal tips as you would find on a wand or pyramid, etc.). There are literally hundreds of energy meridians that are used in any acupuncture practice, to learn more about them would be key for a successful Crystal Acupuncture session. For overall health, I would recommend a clear quartz crystal wand. Quartz works very well with all of the chakras and I would suspect all meridians as well. It would be a great place to start. To see our selection of Clear Quartz and other wands (both natural and polished), click the link below.
