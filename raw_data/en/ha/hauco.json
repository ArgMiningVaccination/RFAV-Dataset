Vaccines causing night terrors? It's extremely distressing and leaves my husband and I in tears each time. He can't wake up, he is screaming, doesn't recognise us and is crying as hard as he possible can for roughly 10-15 minutes. They always occur before his dreamfeed around 11pm. He goes down around 6:30-7, and is always fine beforehand. Nothing distressing happens during the day beforehand either, it can be just a usual quiet day at home with us, or a day walking in the park with us, the dog and his nanny. It's been happening since his first vaccines around 16/17 weeks of age. We have had 2 different sleep trainers work with him previously, all of which were helping guide us in perfecting his naps, self settling, bedtime routine and dream feeds. We have asked them their opinion when it's happened and got different answers, one said it might be stomach problems, the other didn't give us an answer but some questions to consider. She asked about his birth and if it was traumatic, which it was at least for me because it was an emergency caesarean - his heart rate was dropping after labouring for 3 days. He wasting breathing at first, and took a while to cry. I don't know how long for since I had a lot of gas and air. She also asked if there was anything that has triggered a similar reaction when he was awake. The only thing we can think of would be his vaccinations. Please, I'm searching for any experience with this or advice? It's so hard to see, its heartbreaking.

Both my son and daughter have had them. My son who is now 7 no longer experiences them, but my 4 year old daughter has them occasionally still. They started with my son around 3 years old and lasted until he was about 5. My daughters started around 3 1/2. I've read they're more common in boys than girls. That genetics may play a role, if any other member has sleep issues. A big thing for us was sleep apnea. their father has sleep issues so if it continues were looking at a sleep study. Do them seem to have any triggers? I believe stress were the main causes of my children's. My son's started shortly after his sister was born. My daughters started before our second daughter was born, but she had some in the first few weeks after the baby was born. I've also noticed that if they're away from home for a full day or night this seems to trigger them. I can't imagine night terrors with a very young child/baby. My only experience is with 3 years and older. I can say though that my son did grow out of them and my daughters are now spacing further apart as she gets older. I wish you the best and hope you find a solution/answer if not at least a way to get through and manage. It's never an easy experience. Night terrors are very sad to watch and deal with. My daughter started getting them at about 2 yrs old(neither of my sons ever got them). She's 4 now and it's pretty rare... but maybe every 3 months she will have a few nights with them. I usually notice it's when she's just over tired or has gotten to bed at 9pm instead of her norm of 8pm. I've never heard of little ones under 18 months having them so I have no idea how to deal with an infant. I do remember reading something that said do not try to fully wake them. That can make it worse. Just hold them, keep them safe and hum/sing quietly until they calm down. This is what I do with my daughter. Even if she's flailing a bit I just hold her \"like a baby\" and keep her close. It always passes within 5-10 minutes. Good luck Mama. I've never worried about sleep apnea with my daughter since she isn't snoring or gasping for air. She's just truly sad/crying and scared/whimpery when it happens. My eldest had them. In her case, they were triggered whenever she lost sleep... example, woke up too early one day, skipped a nap the next would result in three nights of night terrors. They lasted from about 15 months to age 5 though they were pretty rare the last couple years because we understood her triggers. She developed into a sleep walker in her tweens which is common in kids that had night terrors but she outgrew that too. Remember that it's harder on you than them. They have no memory of them. They generally aren't even awake. Keep a journal for a couple weeks of schedule, food, activities, sleep... we found it immensely useful in tracking down what was causing the night terrors. My first had them a couple times but luckily not too often. I have read somewhere, but can't remember where, if they have them around the same time every night, that you can gently wake them up prior to the time they are usually having them to disrupt their sleep pattern. So maybe you wake LO up earlier than his dream feed and feed him, them put him back down. And see if that helps. But since I don't remember where I read that, I can't say that it was a credible source, so maybe look into first. As to your question about correlating to vaccines, I have never heard any evidence that vaccines can cause them. But maybe it's that the actual shot is a little traumatic and that causes the stress? Why don't you hold him while he's getting his shots? That might make it a little less traumatic for him. It's literally a few seconds of pain that have long term benefits. Think of it that way so you aren't as hard on yourself. You're not harming your child; you're helping him and society. The first set of shots were the hardest for my kids and each subsequent set got easier. My 3 year old didn't even cry when she got her flu shot this year. It could be from the anxiety of the doctors office and getting the needles, not the actual needles, that could be causing the terrors? I have no advice as my daughter has never had them before but just hold your kiddo and tell them every things ok and it will pass. Sorry this is happening to you and your family. Dear Kittyphina, Tonight I found your comment regarding your son's night terrors. Although it's been two years, I do hope this issue has been resolved for your son. I'm a mother of three adult children. My second born developed night terrors & a rare form of dyslexia (combining letters from upper or lower lines while reading) in the late 80's. My son, now in his late thirties is an avid reader but if he doesn't read regularly he lapses back. Sadly, three decades later he still suffers from night terrors, one to three a night, just as you described. If he has a fever it's even worse for him. He's injured himself numerous times. Outgoing, handsome and intelligent, the decades of sleep deprivation has effected his mental health. And as a man, a life of normalcy is out of reach. I'm now in my sixties still searching for answers. I too believe his life is damaged by vaccines. My cousins son developed autism days after his vaccinations. There's a new book out titled Plague of Corruption that I'm looking forward to reading soon. I only wish I knew in the 80's what I know now. Maybe I could've saved my son from a true nightmare. God bless you and yours! My oldest suffered from night terrors when she was little. I never thought to try and correlate them with anything since they're fairly common. Thankfully she outgrew them around 2 and hasn't had any since. - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [PregnancyYour Pregnancy Week-by-Week](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/) [GeneralLearn About What to Expect's Pregnancy [ProductsBaby Products](//www.whattoexpect.com/baby-products/) [In Hot TopicsCalling ALL moms who have traveled to Costa Rica with their kids ((((or places like Costa Rica)))) PLEASE HELP!!!!!!July 28, 2023 | by chanelpearlsMy mil included me on their summer vacation to Costa Rica, everything was planned out on their end, I'm basically just going along for the ride with my child.
