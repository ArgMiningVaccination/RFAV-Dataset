But if you or your partner are feeling frustrated or dissatisfied with your performance under the sheets, especially when it comes to timing and sense of ejaculatory control, it may be helpful to seek out a solution in order to last longer. Unlike other options available, from numbing sprays and wipes to prescription SSRIs, which come with a whole host of side effects, mate endurance is an all-natural, once-daily dietary supplement intended to help address premature ejaculation without any impact to sexual sensitivity and without any lasting side effects. When can I start expecting to see results? While results vary from person to person, you'll most likely start seeing results within the first few weeks of once-daily use. For best results, continue taking mate endurance for at least three months. Remember, it's an all-natural supplement, so it does take some time for your body to acclimate. Patience is key. How do I know mate endurance works? mate endurance is backed by scientific research and has a statistically significant effect on improving men's overall satisfaction and sense of ejaculatory control, while decreasing sex-induced stress and anxiety. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining the efficacy of mate endurance, the average participant taking the supplement increased his sense of ejaculatory control by 66% and felt a 68% increase in sexual satisfaction. How much longer can I expect to last in bed? Our clinical study focused more on the subjective factors associated with premature ejaculation, such as sense of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and overall distress caused by sexual relations, as opposed to time-based measurements. While the average participant did report an increase in endurance and length of sexual intercourse, exact stopwatch measurements were not included in the study. We've got a feeling that soon enough, you'll be getting a little too busy to check your watch. Go get 'em, tiger. Is mate endurance FDA approved? By law, the FDA does not approve dietary supplements.
