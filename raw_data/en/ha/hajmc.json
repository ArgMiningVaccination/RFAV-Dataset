Designated as a pre-eminent university by the Florida Legislature for meet - ing rigorous standards of achievement, FSU ranks among the nation's Top 20 public universities. From its excellence in the sciences, arts and humanities, to its service-learn - ing mission, an entrepreneurial culture, championship athletics and a prime location in the heart of the state capital, Florida State is widely known for offering an outstanding academic environment. Located on Florida's oldest continuous site of higher education, FSU is proud of its rich heritage and core values that champion excellence at every level. Building on its unique strengths, it is a recognized model for student success, distinctively providing academic rigor and an amazing array of re - search, creative efforts and engagement opportunities to students in a personal and caring atmosphere. FSU students are among the nation's best and brightest. They graduate at the highest rate found at any university in Florida, 74 percent in four years, a rate that ranks among the Top 10 nationally. An outstanding student-faculty ra - tio combined with a student-centered approach ensures every student receives a world-class education. FSU has eliminated disparities in its diverse student population and is now the largest and most diverse university in the country with an experiential learning requirement before graduation. Undergraduate students who excel in multiple areas of engagement outside the classroom are inducted into the University's Garnet and Gold Scholar Society. Our Student Veterans Center and programs designed to aid student-veter - ans' transition to academic life and our Honors Scholars and Fellows House, Office of National Fellowships and Center for Undergraduate Research and Academic Engagement are all examples of our strong commitment to help our more than 43,000 students reach their highest academic goals. With its impressive breadth of leading graduate, professional, and un - dergraduate programs, Florida State University is a demanding, intellectu - ally stimulating, yet warm and caring environment for students and faculty. Recognized nationally for its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, Florida State has been named by the Institute for Higher Education Policy as one of the top 10 institutions in the country for its outstanding efforts to im - prove access and support and educate traditionally underrepresented students. In addition, Florida State is annually named a Diversity Champion by Insight into Diversity and has received the magazine's Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award for seven consecutive years. Led by a world-renowned faculty that has included six Nobel laureates; numerous eminent scholars in the arts and sciences; Tony, Oscar, Emmy, and Pulitzer award winners, our academic programs continue to receive major rec - ognition for their quality and overall strength.The University is creating a culture across all academic disciplines that em - braces entrepreneurship, interdisciplinary learning and creativity. Through the largest private gift to a public university in Florida\u2014$100 million\u2014Florida State has established the Jim Moran College of Entrepreneurship, the first de - gree-granting college of its kind in the nation. Florida State University now has 18 colleges in addition to the Graduate School, which offer more than 280 undergraduate, graduate, doctoral, profes - sional, and specialist degree programs, including medicine and law, covering a broad array of disciplines critical to society today. Each year the University awards approximately 3,000 graduate and professional degrees. Florida State's programs in fine arts\u2014dance, film, interior design, mu - sic, and theatre\u2014are among the best in the world, offering an arts education comparable to leading conservatories. Our creative writing program is ranked among the nation's best and is home to the most consistently honored and pub - lished student body in the country. Florida State is responsible for governance of the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art and associated arts programs, one of the largest museum/university complexes in the nation. Other nationally recognized top programs include physics, chemistry, psychology, criminology, public administration, library science, information, education, business and law. At the doctoral level, interdisciplinary programs draw on notable research faculty strengths that transcend the traditional disciplines, including neurosci - ence, molecular biophysics, computational science, materials science and re - search at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\u2014home to the world's most powerful magnets. Our excellence shines beyond traditional academic settings. Located in countries around the globe, our international programs are unparalleled. In the area of athletics, our scholar-athletes continue to perform at championship levels on and off the field, and their hard work and dedication add to this University's outstanding reputation. Our students supplement their academic pursuits each year with hundreds of thousands of hours of community service outside of the classroom. In immeasurable ways, the University reaches out to our community, region, state, and nation. This level of service has been recognized by the Carnegie Foundation, which has selected Florida State for inclusion in its prestigious Community Engagement classification. With a dedicated faculty and staff, a commitment to strong graduate and undergraduate programs that prepare students well for the marketplace, and a powerful research agenda that contributes to the nation's economic well-being and quality of life, Florida State University is living proof of what it means to be an exciting leader in higher education. I hope that, as you become a part of our community, you will join us in our continuing pursuit of excellence. Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin University Notices 9 UNIVERSITY NOTICES President's Statement on Equal Opportunity and Non-Discrimination Florida State University is an equal opportunity employer and education - al provider committed to a policy of non-discrimination for any member of the University's community on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, veterans' status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or any other legally protected group status. This policy applies to faculty, staff, students, volunteers, visitors, applicants, and contractors in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, orders, and University policies, pro - cedures, and processes. In pursuing its mission of excellence as a comprehensive, graduate-re - search university with a liberal arts base, the University strives to create and maintain a harmonious, high performance work and educational environment. Conduct that discriminates, harasses, or intimidates by threat, is contrary to our commitment. Further, workplace behavior that is disruptive to the oper - ations of the University or that impairs workplace discipline interferes with this mission. It is my expectation that all members of our community are provided eq - uitable opportunities to succeed and enrich the strength, skill, and character of the University. It is also expected that all members of our community will help create a work and educational environment that promotes fairness, respect, and trust, free from discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. The University will continue to reinforce its commitment of non-discrimi - nation to all groups protected by local, state, and federal law. We will continue to monitor our methods of recruitment, retention, and advancement of qual - ified faculty, staff, and students and annually examine our affirmative action plan, as prescribed by federal guidelines, to measure whether our campus is reflective of the community we serve. The University further recognizes that discriminatory or harassing behav - ior may create an intimidating or hostile environment that interferes with the University's mission. As a result, the University has established internal com - plaint procedures available to all who believe their experience on any of our campuses has been less than appropriate. To facilitate University-wide compliance, I have appointed Renisha Gibbs, Associate Vice President for Human Resources/Finance and Administration Chief of Staff, to develop, administer, and coordinate University-wide initia - tives and complaint investigations. This will be accomplished through collab - oration with the Title IX Director; Dean of Students Department; the Office of Faculty Development and Advancement; the Athletics Department; and all University divisions, colleges, and departments. Questions regarding the above may be directed to your supervisor or Renisha Gibbs at (850) 644-8082 or rgibbs@fsu.edu .

President's Statement on Title IX \"No person in the United States, shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimina - tion under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assis - tance.\" Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and its implementing regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106 (Title IX). In accordance with Title IX, as a recipient of Federal financial aid, FSU does not discriminate on the basis of sex/gender in education programs and activities. In 2020, the US Department of Education adopted new Title IX reg - ulations defining sexual harassment and specifying procedures for the inves - tigation and adjudication of allegation of sexual harassment. FSU has created a new policy (2-2a) to supplement current policy (2-2) in order to implement the new regulations; both policies can be found at https://regulations.fsu.edu/ policies/office-president . Effective 8/14/2020, under the Title IX Compliance Policy, sexual harassment is defined as: sexual assault (including forcible rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault with an object, forcible fondling, incest, and statutory rape); dating violence; domestic violence; stalking; quid pro quo; and hostile environment. Additionally, other forms of sex discrimination and sex - ual misconduct not included in this definition are prohibited by law and con - tinue to be included in the Sex Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy. Furthermore, the Florida Educational Equity Act prohibits discrimination in schools based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, disability, or mar - ital status. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1000.05 (2019). FSU's commitment to addressing and eliminating all forms of discrimination on the basis of sex is reaffirmed in FSU's Sex Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy (https://regulations. fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu486/files/policies/president/FSU%20Policy%20 2-2.pdf ), which is applicable to all faculty, staff, students, visitors, applicants, and contractors. The University's Title IX Coordinator/Director is responsible for oversee - ing the development of sexual misconduct policies, ensuring compliance with Title IX and relevant federal and state regulations, and investigating Title IX complaints alleging student sexual misconduct. The Human Resources Deputy Coordinator will oversee investigations of alleged sexual misconduct by em- ployees and third parties. The Athletics Deputy Coordinator will accept Title IX incident reports to forward to the Title IX Director and will ensure athletics equity compliance. The FSUS Deputy Coordinator(s) will oversee investiga - tions of alleged sexual misconduct by K-12 students. Report regarding Title IX, as well as concerns about and complaints of non-compliance (including sexual harassment, sex discrimination, or other sexual misconduct), should be submitted to https://report.fsu.edu . Additionally, any questions may be di - rected to the Title IX Director/Coordinator or a Title IX Deputy Coordinator. Complaints will be addressed following the University's discrimination complaint procedures contained in its Equal Opportunity, Non-Discrimination, and Non-Retaliation Policy, Title IX Compliance Policy, and the Student Code of Conduct. Some acts of sexual harassment or misconduct may also constitute violations of criminal law and require mandatory reporting to the FSU Police Department, e.g., sexual battery, indecent exposure, sexual abuse. In such in - stances, refer to the University's Sex Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy and contact the FSU Police Department at (850) 644-1234 . Questions about the application of Title IX may also be directed to the Office of Civil Rights, US Department of Education.

It is my expectation that all members of our community are provided eq - uitable opportunities to succeed and enrich the strength, skill, and character of the University. It is also expected that all members of our community will help create a work and educational environment that promotes fairness, respect, and trust, free from discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Behavior that may be considered offensive, demeaning, or degrading to persons or groups will not be tolerated. Conflicts of Interest The following policy concerning conflicts of interest applies to graduate students who are being supervised or evaluated by faculty as well as graduate students who are serving as teaching assistants and thus supervising or evalu - ating undergraduates. Sexual relationships between faculty members/graduate assistants and stu - dents where a direct supervisory or evaluative relationship exists are fraught with the potential for exploitation. The respect and trust accorded a faculty member/graduate assistant by a student, as well as the power exercised by the faculty member/graduate assistant in a direct supervisory or evaluative role, make voluntary consent by the student suspect. In their relationships with students, faculty members/graduate assistants are expected to be aware of their professional responsibilities and to avoid conflict of interest, favoritism, or bias. 1. When any direct supervisory or evaluative role exists, a consensual sexual relationship between a student and a faculty member/graduate assistant is a conflict of interest. 2. Any situation of direct supervision or evaluation will be ended immediately when a consensual sexual relationship between a student and a faculty member/graduate assistant exists. 3. Any such relationship must be disclosed to the faculty member/graduate assistant's supervisor immediately. 4. Direct supervision includes any type of evaluative role. Examples of direct supervision of the student include teaching the student's class, serving as a thesis or dissertation director, instructor of record, member of the student's thesis or dissertation committee, member of the student's comprehensive or doctoral exam committee, member of other committees where the focus is evaluation or supervision of the student's academic competence or the student's assistantship. Individuals with Disabilities Florida State University adheres to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, in prohibiting discrimination against any qualified individual with a disability. Any student with a disability may voluntarily self-report the nature of the disability and identify needed accommodations to the Office of Accessibility Services, call (850) 644-9566 . Florida State University's 504 Coordinator is: Jennifer Mitchell, Director, Student Disability Resource Center 874 Traditions Way (108 Student Services Building) Phone: (850) 644-9566 /TDD (850) 644-8504 E-mail: jmitchell2@fsu.edu Web site: https://dsst.fsu.edu/oas To request reasonable accommodations for employment or visitors, please contact the Florida State University Human Resources/Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion Office, located at University Center, Bldg.

HIV/AIDS Policy Students, employees, and applicants for admission or employment at Florida State University who have or who may become infected with HIV will not be excluded from enrollment or employment or restricted in their normal responsibilities and access to University services or facilities due to their HIV/AIDS status, unless individual medically based judgments establish that exclusion or restriction is necessary for the welfare of the individual or of other members of the University community. That is, the University will not discriminate against otherwise qualified HIV-infected applicants, students, or employees. University Health Services is responsible for monitoring developments with regard to HIV/AIDS, acting upon and administering the policies of the Florida Department of Education Division of Colleges and Universities and the University concerning HIV/AIDS and coordinating the University's ef - forts in educating the University community on the nature and prevention of the disease. The University will be guided in its implementation of this policy by current authoritative medical information, applicable federal and state law, Florida Department of Education Division of Colleges and Universities' HIV/ AIDS Policy, and the guidelines suggested by the Centers for Disease Control, the Public Health Service, the American College Health Association, and the Florida Department of Health. Florida State University has designated HIV counselors who are avail - able for FSU students. Counselors are located at University Health Services. Confidential HIV testing is available for students at University Health Services. Any interested students should call (850) 644-4567 to schedule an appointment.

(c) The University maintains the right to forward possible violations of federal or state laws, local ordinances, and University regulations, to the proper authorities through the Florida State University Police Department. VI. Health Risks. Alcohol consumption may cause a number of changes in behavior which are related to dose, rate of intake, body size and percentage of body fluid, expectations, social environment, physical conditions (disease or, more com - monly, hormonal cycles can be factors), enzyme differences, and concentra - tion of alcohol in a drink. It may increase aggressiveness, lower inhibitions, cloud judgment, reduce resistance, and hamper the ability to make decisions. Alcohol first affects the area of the brain responsible for higher functions, such as decision-making and social inhibitions, suppressing an individual's self-control. Alcohol in the blood can slow reaction time, reduce muscle coordination and impair eyesight, contributing to deficits in performance, judgment, memory, and motor skills. Even low doses can significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely. Florida State University reiterates that no one should ever drink alcohol and drive. The des - ignated driver should never drink alcohol. Moderate to high doses of alcohol may cause marked impairments in high - er mental functions, altering a person's ability to learn and remember informa - tion. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol may produce the effects just described above. VII. Educational Resources and Support. In support of responsible management of alcohol, the University provides numerous resources and support services available to students, faculty, and staff of Florida State University, including alcohol education, counseling, treatment, rehabilitation, re-entry, prevention, and intervention, as well as oth - er educational programs and volunteer opportunities.

Florida State University Health Risks of Illicit Drugs Illicit drugs all have some health-threatening qualities\u2014some more than others. Examples include increased heart rate and lung damage from mari - juana; central nervous system disorders from cocaine, heroin, and hallucino - gens; and liver, lung and kidney damage from inhalants. HIV infection also is spread widely among intravenous drug users. Even infrequent use of illicit drugs can result in physical afflictions, such as hangovers, cardiovascular damage, digestive problems, tremors, impaired sexual response, and injuries due to lost coordination. Other possible effects include reduced alertness and impaired performance at school or work, interpersonal conflicts, and financial difficulties. Dependence and addiction are constant threats to users of illicit substances. Regular abuse of these substances generally exposes users to crim - inal elements, which may lead to involvement in further criminal activities. State and Local Penalties: Illicit Drug Penalties The penalty for possession (second-degree misdemeanor) is sixty days jail and $500 fine. Penalties for trafficking (first-degree felony) range up to thirty years imprisonment and fines of $500,000. Note: These are only for information. State sanctions are subject to change by the Florida Legislature. Florida State University Standards of Conduct State of Florida statutes declare that it is unlawful for any person under 21 years of age to consume or possess alcoholic beverages. Consequently, no one under the legal drinking age may consume, distribute, or possess alcohol on University properties or as part of any University activity. It is unlawful to sell, give, serve, or permit to be served alcoholic beverages to a person under 21 years of age. Furthermore, servers can be held civilly lia - ble for damage caused by underage drinkers to whom they provided alcoholic beverages.It is unlawful to be under the influence of, to use, possess, distribute, sell, offer, or agree to sell, or represent to sell, narcotics, hallucinogens, dangerous drugs, or controlled substances, except as where permitted by prescription or law.

Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin University Notices 15 Illegal Downloading of Copyrighted Songs and Movies Downloading and distribution of copyrighted music, movie and other entertainment files from online distribution sites that offer these items free of charge is illegal, in direct violation of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Florida State University Student Conduct Code, and the Florida State University Policy OP-H-6 \"Use of University Information Technology Resources.\" Illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music, movies or oth - er entertainment files is intellectual property/copyright infringement. Illegal downloading and file sharing activities maliciously expose the University's network, computing systems and personal computers to destructive computer malware (viruses, spyware, worms, trojan horses, rootkits, keystroke loggers, etc.), and denial of service attacks. Illegal downloading activity significantly increases the risk of exposure to personal identity theft and irreparable or cost - ly damage to both University and personally owned computing devices. The potential consequences of illegal downloading and file sharing are ex - tremely serious. There are both civil and criminal penalties for illegal down - loading and file sharing: In a civil suit, an infringer may be liable for a copyright owner's actual damages plus any profits made from the infringement. Alternatively, the copyright owner may avoid proving actual damage by electing a statutory damage recovery of up to $30,000 or, where the court determines that the infringement occurred willfully, up to $150,000. The actual amount will be based upon what the court in its discretion considers just. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504. Penalties to be applied in cases of criminal copyright infringement [i.e., violations of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a)], are set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319. Congress has increased these penalties substantially in recent years, and has broadened the scope of behaviors to which they can apply. Statutory penalties are found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319. A defendant, convicted for the first time of violating 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a) by the unauthorized reproduction or distribution, during any 180-day period, of at least ten copies or phonorecords, or one or more copyrighted works, with a retail value of more than $2,500 can be imprisoned for up to five years and fined up to $250,000, or both. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2319(b), 3571(b)(3). Defendants who have previously been convicted of criminal copyright infringement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319(b)(1) may be sentenced to a maximum of ten years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, or both. Finally, a defendant is guilty of a misdemeanor violation if he violated rights other than those of reproduction or distribution, or has reproduced or distributed less than the requisite number of copies, or if the retail value of the copies reproduced or distributed did not meet the statutory minimum, or if other elements of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a) are not satisfied. Misdemeanants can be sentenced a maximum of one year and can be fined a maximum of $100,000. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2319(b)(3), 3571(b) (5). Law firms representing the entertainment industry aggressively investigate instances of music and movie \"pirating\", and upon identifying the offenders, are increasingly invoking the applicable laws to reap financial settlements and awards totaling thousands of dollars. The University is not legally empowered to protect, represent, advise or otherwise assist students who become subject to legal proceedings because of copyright infringement. Students who are sued, offered an out-of-court settle - ment, or cited for criminal copyright infringement must obtain their own legal representation. In addition to civil and criminal penalties, violators will be subject to the University's disciplinary proceedings: Student Conduct Code A student found to be in violation of provision is subject to the outcomes defined in Section G. Examples of outcomes that may be imposed for violations of the Student Conduct Code include reprimand, educational outcomes, restitution, probation, suspension, and dismissal.

During the fiscal year 2020, Florida State University's faculty generated over $250 million in external funding to supple - ment state funds used for research and creative activities. These funds, derived through contracts and grants from various private foundations, industries, and government agencies, are used to provide stipends for graduate students, to improve research facilities, and to support the research itself. Many members of Florida State University's faculty are renowned scholars in their fields. In the natural sciences, Florida State University is perhaps best known for its basic research programs in physics, chemistry and biochemistry, biology, psychology, meteorology, and oceanography. Its programs in mate - rials science, high-field magnet research, superconductivity, geology, mathe - matics, computer science, and statistics also have strong research components, both basic and applied. Since 1982, Florida State has operated a College of Engineering as a joint program with Florida A&M University, an enterprise combining strengths in mechanical, electrical and computer, civil, environ - mental, chemical and biomedical, and industrial and manufacturing engineer - ing. The Florida State University College of Medicine, founded by statute in 2000, has major research components in the biomedical and clinical sciences, family medicine and rural health, geriatrics, and medical humanities and social sciences. Finally, Florida State is pleased to continue its traditional strengths in the performing and creative arts and social sciences. Special Programs The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is the only user-facil - ity of its kind in the United States, and the highest-powered magnet laboratory in the world. Headquartered at Florida State since 1994, the lab hosts more than a thousand visiting scientists each year from dozens of countries who come to use our unique magnets to explore promising new materials, solve global energy problems, and advance our understanding of the biochemis - try that underlies living things. Coupled with brilliant in-house researchers in physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, geochemistry, materials science, and medicine, their findings result in more than 400 scientific publications per year in peer reviewed journals such as Nature, Science, and Physical Review Letters . The National MagLab is home to more than a dozen world-record magnet systems that were designed and built in-house by experts in magnet and sci - ence technology, including the world's strongest continuous field magnet at 45 tesla, the most powerful MRI at 900 Mhz, a 21 tesla ion coclotron resonance mass spectrometer, 36 tesla NMR magnet, and a 32 tesla all-superconducting magnet These tools open new frontiers of science and have enormous poten - tial for commercial and industrial applications. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory has many exciting research opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers from across scientific disci - plines who are interested in hands-on research experiences in an environment filled with world-class resources and instrumentations. Florida State University has made major investments in faculty and in - frastructure in the area of materials science and engineering. The High Performance Materials Institute (HPMI) , located in the Materials Research Building, specializes in the synthesis and characterization of composite ma - terials containing carbon nanotubes. These light weight but very strong mate - rials have broad applications in transportation, armor, and energy. Associated with the NHMFL is the Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC) . Researchers at the ASC study high temperature superconducting materials that can be used in magnet construction, motors, and energy storage or transmission devices. Other materials efforts of note take place in the departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Physics, and Scientific Computing, as well as in units of the College of Engineering. The Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS) is a multidisciplinary re - search center organized to perform basic and applied research to advance the field of power systems technology. The research focuses on electric power systems modeling and simulation, power electronics and machines, control systems, thermal management, high temperature superconductor characteri - zation, and electrical insulation research. Development of cutting-edge tech - nologies and a technology-savvy workforce in a broad range of aerospace and propulsion disciplines is the focus of the Florida Center for Advanced Aero- Propulsion (FCAAP) . FCAAP is a Center of Excellence led by Florida State University with the University of Central Florida, the University of Florida, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University as partners. FCAAP is housed in the newly constructed Aero-Propulsion, Mechatronics and Energy (AME) Building . The AME building contains a variety of unique instruments and fa - cilities including wind tunnels and specialized device fabrication space. The Program in Nuclear Research is highly ranked nationally, with em - phasis on nuclear structure physics, nuclear astrophysics, radioactive beam studies, studies of nuclear reaction mechanisms using polarized Li beams, accelerator-based atomic physics, electron scattering, hadronic nuclear phys - ics, and relativistic heavy ion reactions. A large part of the program in ex - perimental nuclear physics uses Florida State University's Superconducting Linear Accelerator Facility, which ran its first experiment in 1987. The facility consists of a Super-FN tandem Van de Graaff electrostatic accelerator that in - jects into a heavy-ion superconducting linear accelerator. The facility utilizes state of the art instrumentation, provides forefront nuclear research capability, and is unique in the southeast. Florida State University's Coastal and Marine Laboratory (FSUCML) is lo - cated forty-five miles south of Tallahassee on Apalachee Bay. This research facility gives scientists from all over the nation immediate access to the pol - lution-free marine environment of the north Florida coast. Facilities include a fleet of research vessels, classrooms, saltwater-equipped laboratories, guest housing, and a dive locker. FSUCML has recently acquired a new 65' alumi - num research vessel, the RV Apalachee . A scientific diving program provides support for and oversight of all scientific and educational compressed-gas div - ing conducted under the auspices of Florida State University. The Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS) trains oceanographers, meteorologists, and scientists in related disciplines. Research at COAPS focuses on ocean and atmospheric dynamics and their applications to interdisciplinary studies. In particular, COAPS scientists specialize in the modeling of ocean and atmospheric dynamics, climate prediction on scales of months to decades, air-sea interaction and modeling, and predictions of socio-economic consequences of ocean-atmospheric variations. COAPS hosts the University's component of the Florida Climate Institute , a joint venture with the University of Florida. Structural Biology, a collaboration of faculty from the Departments of Biological Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mathematics, Medical Science, and Physics, is the research emphasis of the Institute of Molecular Biophysics . Research conducted by Structural Biology faculty focuses on the three-dimensional structure of biologically important macromolecules and the structural correlates of their functional properties. A variety of state-of-the-art research tools are available in the Institute and allied units including X-ray crystallography, cryoelectron microscopy, mass spectrometry, computer-based fluorescence, laser and NMR spectroscopies. Graduate students working under Structural Biology faculty can enroll in either the molecular biophysics (MOB) PhD program or in the graduate programs of biological science, biochemistry or physics. All aspects of child behavior and learning are researched in Florida State University's Child Development Programs . The programs provide research sites and laboratory settings in which faculty and graduate students may ob - serve and work with young children. The Institute for Justice Research and Development (IJRD) advances science, policy, and practice to improve the well-being of individuals, families, and communities impacted by criminal justice system involvement. IJRD conducts rigorous, real-world intervention research; rapidly disseminates findings to enact data-driven reforms; trains professionals at the intersection of social work and criminal justice; and har - nesses technology to maximize impact. A number of Florida State University programs have won national or inter - national distinction for their research. These include the following: The Learning Systems Institute (LSI) is a diverse, multidisciplinary pro - gram designed to bridge the gap between research and practice in education and training. Researchers at LSI combine strengths in educational leadership, instructional design, human performance, and grants management to design, build, and implement effective learning strategies for a wide range of clients around the world. Founded in the 1960s to help the South Korean government in its efforts to overhaul the country's school system through technology, LSI has grown to become an international resource for learning. In the 1990s, the institute's pioneering work in distance learning led to it becoming the home for the University's online educational outreach, based in the institute's Academic and Professional Program Services. The Florida Center for Reading Research was established by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2002 as the central source of research and training for Florida's initiatives in improving the reading and literacy levels of K-12 students throughout the 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityResearch Facilities and Special Programs 26 state. The center focuses campus-based research strengths in psychology and education on science-based approaches to reading instruction and assessment that is disseminated through the Florida Department of Education. Florida State University's Autism Institute , housed in the College of Medicine, coordinates and promotes research, education, and service relat - ed to the autism spectrum disorders. The institute promotes Interdisciplinary research that advances scientific knowledge and bridges the gap between this knowledge and clinical/educational practice. The Center for Innovative Collaboration in Medicine and Law is a joint effort of the College of Medicine and the College of Law. The center explores educational, research, and ad - vocacy avenues for collaboration and cooperation between the medical and legal professions on behalf of the well-being of consumers. The College of Medicine's Translational Science Laboratory houses a broad array of bio - medical instruments including mass spectrometers, a high through-put DNA sequencer and biophysical macromolecular characterization devices. Also housed in the College is the FSU Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facility. This facility contains a state-of-the-art Siemens Prisma MRI system that is being used primarily for brain imaging research. A Clinical Research Network is in place which leverages regional campuses, rural training sites and a clinical training site with external research partners. The Office for Clinical Research Advancement (OCRA) is a central coordi - nating and support office for interdisciplinary biomedical and behavioral re - searchers across campus that engages, connects, and supports FSU research faculty, clinicians, and FSU communities in advancing medical discoveries to improve health outcomes. Computing and information technology are widely used at Florida State University for both research and instruction. The University's Information Technology Services (ITS) manages a high speed network that connects com - puters throughout the University to each other and to the world. ITS also pro - vides wireless connectivity to the network from most locations on the FSU campus. In addition to the global Internet, Florida State University participates in the Florida LambdaRail and the National LambdaRail project, a special high capacity state and national network for academic and research purposes. The University maintains a shared high performance computing system, the Research Computing Center . The current setup has 748 compute nodes and 14,092 CPU cores. The theoretical peak performance of the complete system is 393 TeraFlops. The RCC has recently added 1.5 PetaByte low-cost archival storage capabilities to the facility. The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art located in Sarasota, Florida, is the designated State Museum of Florida. In 2000, the Legislature shifted administration of the museum to Florida State University in recognition, in part, of the growing trend to maximize the educational value and potential of museums and, in part, to take advantage of the University's commitment to the arts. That potential is especially evident through this association with the Sarasota community due to mutual strengths in the areas of the fine and per - forming arts and corollary interests, such as the American circus. The Ringling Museum, the home of an internationally renowned art collection, occupies sixty acres of beautiful bay front property including the museum of art, the historic Asolo Theatre (restored in 2006), Ca'd'Zan, the Ringling Mansion, and the Circus Museum, now featuring the Tibbals Learning Center, dedicated to preserving the world's largest and most complete collection of circus art and history. Together with the Florida State University Performing Arts Center, which lies adjacent to the art museum, it holds center stage for Florida State University's Ringling Center for the Cultural Arts, which was created by the Florida Legislature in the year 2000.Florida State University's Institute of Science and Public Affairs is a multi - faceted institute of public service and applied research that helps government and private agencies solve problems ranging from hazardous waste disposal to conflict resolution. Research centers within the institute are designed to respond to public and private sector needs. Specialists in the fields of biolo - gy, chemistry, geography, education, planning, public administration, phys - ics, economics, law, and other areas carry out the University's public service responsibility through programs in education, training, and applied research. The overriding objective is to successfully apply resources, human and tech - nical, to policy problems within the state of Florida. The Institute provides University students the opportunity to work on specific projects in institute centers under the supervision of experienced faculty and staff. These projects provide training for students in problem-solving environments. Government agencies and private sector organizations benefit from this dynamic source of trained and skilled personnel. Since 1951, students and faculty of Florida State University have benefited from its membership in Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) . ORAU is a consortium of more than one hundred PhD granting universities and a man - agement and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORAU works with its member institutions to help their students and faculty gain access to federal research facilities throughout the country; to keep its members informed about opportunities for fellowship, scholarship, and research appointments; and to organize research alliances among its members, including programs designed to increase the numbers of underrepresented minority students pursuing degrees in science- and engineering-related disciplines. In addition to membership in ORAU, Florida State University is one of the core university partners with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) . The other partner universities are Duke University, Georgia Tech, North Carolina State University, University of Tennessee, University of Virginia, Vanderbilt University, and Virginia Tech. Partnership with ORNL facilitates research col - laborations and affords access for faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to unique capabilities in neuron scattering, high performance comput - ing, and materials science. Furthermore, graduate students have the potential to participate in ORNL's Graduate Opportunities (GO!) Program involving dual mentorship between FSU faculty and national lab staff members.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Student Veteran Information 27 STUDENT VETERAN INFORMATION IMPORTANT NOTE: All policies outlined in this General Bulletin apply to every university student who matriculates during the fall, spring, or summer semester of the academic year covered herein. The policies outlined below, however, are specific to student veterans, military students, and/or veteran/ military dependents. Please familiarize yourself with this Bulletin in its en - tirety, and refer to the \"Student Services,\" \"Academic Regulations,\" and \"Financial Information\" chapters for a complete reading of policies and proce - dures pertaining to those areas. You are responsible for understanding not only the portions of this Bulletin pertaining to veteran/military/dependent students, but all of the policies and procedures that might pertain to you outside of your specific student designation. Student Veterans Center The Florida State University Student Veterans Center (SVC) provides pro - grams and services designed to enhance the retention, graduation, and ca - reer-placement rates of student veterans, active-military students, and veteran/ military dependents. SVC services include assistance with and certification of educational benefits provided through the departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense. In addition, the SVC conducts the orientation breakout sessions for these students and offers a one hour/week course each Fall and Spring semester called Strategies for Veteran Success (SLS 3407). The SVC also coordinates the dozens of Veteran Liaisons ( https://veterans.fsu.edu/about-us/ veteran-liaisons ) who are available for advice and assistance in academic and administrative units throughout campus. For more information, please visit A4300 University Center , call (850) 644-9562 , fax , or go to https://veterans.fsu.edu/ . Priority Registration Priority course registration for an upcoming semester is available to ac - tive-military students, student veterans, and military/veteran dependents who have made prior contact with the Student Veterans Center by self-identify - ing (as one of these types of students) or by submitting an FSU Request for Benefits form. However, priority registration is not available to these students if they are registering for classes for the first time (as either freshmen, transfer students or graduate students). In other words, the priority registration policy takes effect when the course-registration window opens for these students' second semester of classes. Any student who chooses to use V A education benefits must submit to the Student Veterans Center the required form(s) and supporting documentation. Note that Section 303 of Public Law 115-48 requires the federal Department of Veterans Affairs to publicly report if a school offers priority course regis - tration (or enrollment) to veteran/military students. In addition, Florida law 1004.075 requires public universities to offer priority course registration to veteran/military/dependent students who are using G.I. Bill \u00ae benefits, until these benefits expire. Florida State University exceeds this state law by of - fering priority course registration, until the time they graduate, to all veteran/ military students - including those not using G.I. Bill \u00ae benefits - and veteran/ military dependents (if dependents have used G.I. Bill \u00ae benefits during part of their time at FSU). Military Short-Term Absence or Call to Active Duty The University recognizes and appreciates the important contributions made in service of our country by active duty, Reserve, and National Guard members and their dependents. In order to accommodate the students and their dependents, University faculty and staff will provide them with the following options to accommodate unexpected training/drill, deployment, or change-of- station orders: For any training/drill, deployment, or change-of-station orders: Students must attempt to make arrangements with their instructors to maintain and/ or make up classwork as needed. Registration for those courses in which in - structors accommodate the absence will remain unchanged and tuition and mandatory fees will be assessed in full for those courses. Service members should provide instructors with maximum advance notice of absences, provid - ing copies of training/drill, deployment, and/or change-of-station directives from the Military, Reserve, or National Guard. Instructors will work with students wherever possible to assign grades as appropriate (including incompletes to be made up later). Instructors must ac - commodate absences of up to two weeks in duration (or equivalent in Summer) in accordance with paragraph one.When unable to make satisfactory arrangements with all instructors: Courses will be dropped and the tuition and mandatory fees for those courses will be rescinded. When unable to make arrangements with any instructors for unexpected orders requiring longer than a two-week absence: The student's entire regis - tration will be withdrawn or cancelled and 100% of the tuition and mandatory fees will be rescinded. Tuition Waivers - Military Veterans, Service Members, and their Dependents An out-of-state tuition waiver is offered to FSU students physically resid - ing in Florida who are current or former members of the U.S. Armed Services - including honorably discharged veterans, and members of the Reserve or National Guard - as well as eligible veteran/military dependents who are using certain federal Veterans Affairs educational benefits. The out-of-state tuition waiver is also extended to active duty members of the U.S. Armed Services who are stationed or reside outside the state of Florida. In accordance with Public Law 115-251, students using V A educational benefit Chapters 30, 31 or 33 must also submit a written request for an out- of-state tuition waiver to the FSU Student Veterans Center. In addition, these students must provide the SVC with their Certificate of Eligibility prior to the tuition-payment deadline each semester. Contact the FSU Student Veterans Center for additional information on out-of-state tuition waivers and their requirements. Military Credit Current and former members of the U.S. Armed Services may receive col - lege credit for certain military experience, training, or coursework. Academic credit acquired while in the military will only be awarded if it is recognized by the American Council on Education (ACE) in its Guide to the Evaluation of Education Experiences in the Armed Services . Note that ACE recommen - dations for vocational or technical credit are not accepted as transfer credit. Credits earned will be evaluated after the application review process has been completed and admission to the university has been granted. The Audit and Evaluation Section of the Office of the University Registrar will post all credit earned for military experience, training, or coursework, as recommend - ed in the ACE Guide, to the student's permanent record. Note that academic credit earned through the Community College of the Air Force is evaluated through the standard transcript-review process. Deferments and Financial Arrangements Students using V A education benefits are entitled to an additional stipend each month from the federal government. However, the first of these stipend checks are sometimes delayed, so these students should be prepared to meet all of their expenses for the first two months. Any time there is a delay in the receipt of V A educational benefits, stu - dents using these benefits to cover tuition and health fees can defer (postpone) their payment (in accordance with Florida law 1009.27(2)). This deferment is not automatic, however, and must be explicitly requested by eligible students through the Student Veterans Center, by the fifth day of the semester. Students receiving deferments who have other types of financial aid pending will have their tuition paid by that financial aid and their veterans deferment nullified. With certain exceptions (see the next paragraph), students who receive a veteran deferment but whose tuition is still not paid by the deferment expi - ration date will be assessed a $100.00 late payment fee and may have their course schedule cancelled. Moreover, such students will not be eligible to receive a veteran deferment in the future. (Note also that course registrations, transcripts, or diplomas will not be processed until all university debts are paid in full.) In accordance with Public Law 115-407, students using V A educational benefit Chapters 31 and 33 are protected from portions of the above policy, but only after these students provide additional documents to the FSU Student Veterans Center. The protection starts when a Chapter 31/33 student submits their Request for Benefits form, or their Certificate of Eligibility, or a Statement of Benefits, or their Chapter 31 authorization. The protection ends when the V A makes payment or 90 days after the date FSU certifies the tuition and fees. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityStudent Veteran Information 28 Return of Military Tuition Assistance Funds Due to Withdrawal Florida State University will return any unearned tuition assistance (TA) funds on a prorated basis through at least 60 percent of the period for which the funds were provided. TA funds are earned proportionally during an enrollment period, with unearned funds returned based upon when a student stops attending. These funds are returned to the military service branch. Questions concerning return of funds may be emailed to CTL-TPC@fsu.edu .

This is true in the professions, the sciences, the arts, and the humanities. The University recognizes that in an interdependent world, the welfare of the state and the well-being of its citizens are linked to the welfare of all peo - ples. Thus, it is vital that the teaching, research, and service of Florida State University support the economic and social development of the state, the na - tion, and other countries; protect the world environment; lead individuals and groups to better understanding of themselves and others; and contribute toward international understanding, world peace, and community self-awareness. The University, in serving the community, recognizes that its major re - sponsibility is to educate students in a manner that provides them with the understanding, skills, and knowledge that will allow them to be creative and useful citizens not only of the state, but of the world. In this process of educa - tion, students from other countries who study at our campus and Florida State University students who have studied overseas play an important role. To accomplish these goals, Florida State University encourages and seeks students from abroad for its undergraduate and graduate programs and profes - sional colleges and schools in such numbers and with such geographic origins, as to have an impact on the achievement of the University's educational goals. It also seeks to provide opportunities for study abroad for its students and to afford them guidance and assistance in integrating these experiences with regular university study. Finally, the University encourages the development of an international dimension in the teaching, research, and service through the exchange of persons, ideas, and materials with other countries. Florida State University seeks to accomplish these objectives through eval - uation of existing and proposed international programs and services and by both short- and long-range planning for continued improvement and innova - tion to further the goals of international education in the University. Consistent with these goals, the University resolves to make available its facilities and resources to offer diversified international educational programs of quality and usefulness for all its students. The financial support needed for the ac - complishment of these goals will be provided by University resources and is actively sought from state, federal, and foreign governments, as well as from international organizations, foundations, private organizations, and individual donors.

This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating non-public institutions. The major purpose of this sys - tem is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online SCNS to obtain course de - scriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This information is available on the SCNS Website, at https://flscns.fldoe.org/ . Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to the type of institution and discipline field or specialization. Course Prefixes and Numbers The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated courses is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or sub-category of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. The course number is a four-digit designator for the course level (first dig - it), century (second digit), decade (third digit), and unit (last digit). In the sci - ences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a different time or place. Example of Course Identifier For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by eighty- four different public and non-public postsecondary institutions. Each institu - tion uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. PrefixLevel CodeCentury DigitDecade DigitUnit Digit Lab Code (first digit)(second digit)(third digit)(fourth digit) ENC 1 1 0 1 SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means \"English Composi - tion\"Represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution, Freshman in this caseFreshman Composi - tionFreshman Skills INo labora - tory component in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same pre - fixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in \"Exception to the General Rule for Equivalency.\" Transfer of any successfully completed course from one participating in - stitution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and com - parable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has suc - cessfully completed ENC 1101 at a Florida College System institution is guar - anteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Note: Credit generated at institutions on the quarter-term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on semester-term sys - tems. For example, 4.0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satis - factorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appro - priate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary edu - cational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of fac - ulty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall en - sure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are gen - erated in courses for which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been accepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalen - cies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution B. For courses at non-regionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. C. Courses in the _900-999 series are not automatically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Theses, and Dissertations D. Applied academics for adult education courses E. Graduate courses F. Internships, apprenticeships, practica, clinical experiences, and study abroad courses with numbers other than those ranging from _900-999 G. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music, and Theatre) and skills courses in Criminal Justice (academy certificate courses) are not guaranteed as transferable. These courses need evidence of achievement (e.g., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions The SCNS makes available on its home page ( https://flscns.fldoe.org/ ) a report entitled \"Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions\" that con - tains a comprehensive listing of all non-public institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course's transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityFlorida's Statewide Course Numbering System 38 SCNS Contact Information Questions about the SCNS and appeals regarding course credit trans - fer decisions should be directed to Andrea White in the Office of Faculty Development and Advancement or the Florida Department of Education, Office of Articulation, 1401 Turlington Building, Tallahassee, FL 32399-0400 .

These three forces\u2014entrepreneurship, interdisciplinary, and diversity\u2014deepen FSU's impact and result in a powerful return to our students and the people of Florida for their continued support and trust. University History Florida State University, one of the largest and oldest of the twelve insti - tutions of higher learning in the State University System of Florida, had its beginning as early as 1823, when the Territorial Legislature began to plan a higher education system. In 1825 the Federal Government reserved two town - ships for the purpose of maintaining two such institutions in the territory, and in 1845 the United States Congress, supplemental to the act admitting Florida as a state in the Union, added two more townships. This led to an 1851 act of the Florida Legislature establishing two seminaries, one to be located east and the other west of the Suwannee River. By 1854 the city of Tallahassee had established a school for boys called the Florida Institute with the hope that the state could be induced to take it over as one of the seminaries. In 1856 the Legislature of Florida chose to accept the offer of the Institute's land and building and designated Tallahassee as the site of one of the state seminaries because of its railway connections, its \"salubri - ous climate,\" and its \"intelligent, refined, and moral community.\" Francis Eppes, who spent his formative years on the estate of his grandfa - ther, President Thomas Jefferson, at Monticello, in Virginia, and who shared his grandfather's views of the importance to a democracy of a liberally educat - ed citizenry, was the Mayor of Tallahassee who made the offer. Eppes served as President of the Seminary's Board of Education for eight years and instilled in the institution the Jeffersonian ideals that characterize it today. In February 1857, the institution began offering postsecondary instruction to male students as the Seminary West of the Suwannee River. The school first became coeducational the following year when it absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy, begun in 1843 as the Misses Bates School. Thus, the West Florida Seminary, founded in 1851, began operating in 1857, only twelve years after Florida achieved statehood. It was located on the hill where the Westcott Building now stands, which has been the site of an institution of higher education longer than any other site in Florida. Classes were held at the West Florida Seminary from 1857 until 1863, when the state legislature changed the name to The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute to reflect the addition of a military section that trained cadets. During the Civil War, cadets from the school, ranging in age from 12 to 18, fought in the Battle of Natural Bridge and helped make Tallahassee the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi not captured during the war. As a result of the brave action of the West Florida cadets in this battle, Florida State University's Army ROTC cadet corps is today one of only three in the nation authorized to display a battle streamer with its flag, a streamer which bears the words \"Natural Bridge 1865.\" After the end of the war in 1865, however, Union troops under General McCook descended upon Tallahassee and occupied the city (including campus buildings), remaining for more than a month. Following the war, the institution entered a period of growth and develop - ment. In 1884 the first diplomas, Licentiates of Instruction, were awarded, and by 1891 the Institute had begun to focus clearly on what we would today call postsecondary education; seven Bachelor of Arts degrees were awarded that year. By 1897 the institution had evolved into the first liberal arts college in the state, and in 1901, it became Florida State College, a four-year institution, with the first master's degree offered in 1902. That year the student body numbered 252 men and women, and degrees were available in classical, literary, and scientific studies. In 1903 the first university library was begun. The following statement from the 1903 Florida State College Catalogue adds an interesting footnote to this period: In 1883 the institution, now long officially known as the West Florida Seminary, was organized by the Board of Education as The Literary College of the University of Florida. Owing to lack of means for the support of this more ambitious project, and also owing to the fact that soon thereafter schools for technical training were established, this association soon dissolved. It re - mains to be remarked, however, that the legislative act passed in 1885, bestowing upon the institution the title of the University of Florida, has never been repealed. The more pretentious name is not assumed by the college owing to the fact that it does not wish to misrepresent its resources and purposes. In a 1905 reorganization of Florida's educational system by the legisla - ture, the University of Florida in Gainesville was established and designated a men's school, and the Florida State College became a women's school called the Florida Female College. The male student body moved from Tallahassee to Gainesville, taking with it the fraternity system and the College football team, which had been state champions in 1902, 1903, and 1905. In 1909 the name of the college was changed to Florida State College for Women, an institution that grew to become the third largest women's college in the nation during the 1930s. The College became fully accredited in 1915, and a chapter of the na - tional honor society of Phi Kappa Phi was installed in 1925, the year after the College was placed on the list of standard colleges and universities approved by the Association of American Universities and became a member of the Association of American Colleges. In 1935 the first chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state, Alpha Chapter of Florida, was installed at the College, a mark of its status as a true liberal arts college. The year 1947 saw many changes. Demand by returning World War II veterans had brought men back to the campus in 1946 with the establishment of the Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida and in 1947 caused the Legislature to return Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and name it Florida State University. A permanent president's residence was acquired. The student body, numbering 4,056, chose a new alma mater and selected the Seminole as its mascot. The Flying High Circus was born, and football was started again when the first home game since 1905 was played in October. Three years later, Campbell Stadium was built. The first Student Union was established and housed in the \"O Club\" on West Campus, a former Army Air Base which mainly housed male students and provided some class - room space three miles west of the main campus. The 1950s brought significant development and expansion to the University. To the colleges and schools that had existed since the Florida State College days\u2014Arts and Sciences, Education, Home Economics, and Music\u2014were added Library Science (in 1948), Social Welfare (later split into Social Work and Criminology), Business, and Nursing. A student in the Department of Chemistry was awarded the University's first Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) de - gree in 1952. A new building was completed for the Developmental Research School, which in 1905 had evolved from the High School and the College Academy of earlier days as the Observation and Practice School, created to provide on-site opportunities for experience and research to students in edu - cation. Tully Gymnasium, Strozier Library, and the Business Building were completed to enhance the education of the ever-increasing student population. In 1957 the Panama Canal Branch was opened. In the 1960s, the University acquired the Shaw Poetry Collection, estab - lished the Institutes of Molecular Biophysics and Space Biosciences, and constructed nine new buildings, including the Oglesby Union and the Fine Arts Building. During this period the Program in Medical Sciences was es - tablished. The first black student enrolled in 1962, and the first black PhD candidates graduated in 1970. Programs in African American Studies and Women's Studies were established. Continuing the liberal arts tradition begun in the 1890s, the Liberal Studies Program required of all undergraduates was expanded and strengthened. In each succeeding decade, Florida State University has added to its ac - ademic organization and now comprises eighteen colleges and the Graduate School. It has expanded from the original few acres and buildings to 383 buildings on 1,697 acres, including the downtown Tallahassee main cam - 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityThe University 46 pus of 487 acres; a farm, which for many decades supplied the Florida State College for Women with food; the Seminole Reservation\u2014a recreational facility; the Marine Laboratory on the Gulf Coast; the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering facility; the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and Division of Research at Innovation Park; and the branch campus in Panama City, Florida. One hundred and seventy years after its founding, Florida State University started the 2020-2021 academic year with a student population of over 43,000 and recognition as a major graduate research institution with an established international reputation. In Fall 2020, Florida State University enrolled students from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and 129 foreign countries. The enrollment break - down by class included 613 law (JD) students, 489 medical (MD) students, a total of 32,500 undergraduate students, a total of 10,610 graduate students, and a total of 823 non-degree-seeking students. Out of 43,953 students enrolled at the University that semester, 42.3 percent were men and 57.7 percent were women. The University employed a total of 2,545 faculty members in Fall 2020, 54.7 percent men and 45.3 percent women. The Panama City Campus is located on beautiful North Bay, one hundred miles west of Tallahassee, near the Gulf of Mexico. The campus, with its mod - ern classrooms and offices, has been designed to utilize the natural landscape of the site, creating an aesthetic and effective educational setting.

Admission of students to Florida State University is within the jurisdiction of the University, but subject to minimum standards adopted by the Florida Board of Governors. Preference for admission for any term will be given to those applicants whose credentials indicate the greatest promise of academic success in their chosen program of study. The application for admission is available online at https://admissions.fsu. edu/. When applying for admission, the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 allows colleges and universities to require the disclosure of social security numbers for the purpose of identification and verification of student records, including registration, financial aid, and academic records, and for verification of iden - tity in connection with the provisions of its services. The University does not use social security numbers for student identification; instead, the University assigns a Florida State University student identification number (EMPLID). An application cannot be submitted earlier than one year prior to the term for which admission is desired. In addition, the University reserves the right to close admission earlier than the published deadline(s) if any program limit is reached. The Office of Admissions will post all decisions electronically on the Application Status Check, an applicant's private account created at the time of application. Admission is for a specific term, and if the student is unable to enroll for the term indicated on the Application Status Check, the Office of Admissions should be notified immediately. A change in term will result in a re-evaluation of the application. The applicant should not assume that admission will automatically be granted. The University reserves the right to request an evaluation of any interna - tional academic document. (For transfer credit, an official course-by-course evaluation is required.) We recommend this evaluation be done by a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services. Offers of admission to the University are often contingent upon the subse - quent receipt of official college or university transcripts indicating satisfactory performance and verification of baccalaureate and master's degrees. Failure to submit such documents before the end of the second week of the initial academic term can result in the cancellation of admission and registration. An application or residency statement submitted by or on behalf of a stu - dent that contains false, fraudulent, or incomplete statements may result in de - nial of admission or denial of further registration and/or invalidation of Florida State University credit and related degrees. Prior to registering for classes, accepted students must be health compli - ant. For information regarding this requirement, refer to https://uhs.fsu.edu/ . Florida State University reserves the right to cancel the admission of any ap - plicant whose health record indicates the existence of a condition that may be harmful to members of the University community. Application The application is available online at https://admissions.fsu.edu/ . It is rec - ommended that the application be submitted nine to twelve months prior to the proposed term of enrollment.

Transcripts An official transcript from each college and/or university attended must be submitted to the Office of Admissions. Transfer credit posted on the record of another institution is not accepted in lieu of submitting the official tran - script from the original institution. Florida State University and other official transcripts already on file as part of the student's permanent record will be automatically obtained by the Office of Admissions. Transcripts are consid - ered official when they are sent directly from the college or university to the Office of Admissions and contain an official seal and/or signature. Transcripts bearing the statement \"Issued to Student,\" notarized transcripts, or transcripts submitted by the applicant are not considered official. Original documents or signed, officially certified photocopies of original documents may be submitted by the student only when institutions outside the United States will not send academic records to other institutions. The verifying signature should be that of an officer of the institution attended. All academic records that are not in English must be accompanied by certi - fied English translations. Certified documents should be true copies that are signed and dated by an educational official familiar with academic records. Documents signed by a notary or other public official with no educational affiliation will not be accepted. Test Scores Official test results will be required from a nationally standardized gradu - ate admissions test, such as the Graduate Record Examination revised General Test (GRE), the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the Miller Analogies Test (MAT), or an equivalent test that is acceptable for the program to which the applicant is applying. These scores are considered official only when they are sent directly to the Office of Admissions from the testing agen - cy. Examinee copies are not considered official. Note: The Faculty Senate and Graduate Policy Committee have waived GRE and GMAT test requirements for all terms in 2021 and 2022 (Spring, Summer, and Fall) for Master's and Specialist applicants. Please note this waiver excludes degree programs in the College of Business. International applicants whose native language is not English must sub - mit an English language proficiency exam, such as the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English (PTE Academic). These scores are considered official only when they are sent directly to the Office of Admissions from the testing agency and are not valid after two years. Departmental Requirements All applicants should contact their academic departments for specific dead - line dates and departmental requirements, such as departmental application, statement of purpose (letter of intent), r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or curriculum vitae, letters of recommendation, audition or portfolio, and application for fellowship or assis - tantship. These supporting documents should be uploaded to the online appli - cation. Do not mail departmental information to the Office of Admissions. It will delay the processing of your application. Graduate Student Admission Policies Admission to graduate study involves acceptance to the department or col - lege in which the applicant expects to earn a degree. Final admission to the University is subject to approval by the Office of Admissions. While there are minimum admission requirements established by the Florida Board of Governors, the University can elect to exceed them. In order to meet minimum University admission requirements, the appli - cant must have: A bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited U.S. institution, or a comparable degree from an international institution, with a minimum 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Admissions 56 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) grade point average (GPA) in all work attempted while registered as an upper-division undergraduate student working toward a baccalaureate degree, or A graduate degree from a regionally accredited U.S. institution, or a comparable degree from an international institution, and Test scores from a nationally standardized graduate admissions test that are acceptable for the academic program to which the applicant is applying. In addition: An applicant who is not in good standing (on probation or dismissal) at the last institution attended will not be considered for graduate study. Departments may impose more restrictive admission requirements than those stated above. It is recommended that applicants contact the academic program directly for information on departmental admission requirements. An applicant who has not earned a degree from a regionally accredited U.S. institution, or a comparable degree from an international institution, may be considered for admission as a provisional graduate student. (International applicants cannot be admitted as provisional.) For information on provisional graduate status, see the subsection on 'Provisional Graduate Students' in this chapter. International applicants whose native language is not English are required to have a minimum score of 550 on the paper-based or 80 on the Internet-based TOEFL examination, 6.5 on the IELTS examination, 55 on the PTE Academic examination, or the successful completion of Level 8 (Advanced Level) at Florida State University's Center for Intensive English Studies. Some departments may require a higher score or may waive the test requirement if the student has received a bachelor's degree or master's degree from a U.S. institution or other institution where English is the required language of instruction. International students expecting to receive appointments as teaching assistants are required to pass the SPEAK test which evaluates the English-speaking ability of non-native speakers of English and is administered at Florida State University. Students who receive a score of 26 or higher on the speaking section of the Internet-based TOEFL examination meet the University requirement to serve in all capacities as a teaching assistant; however, some departments may still require that the student take the SPEAK test. Provisional Graduate Students An academic program may recommend that a student be admitted to the University as a provisional graduate student. This requires that the program stipulate conditions that the student must meet during the initial semester/term of enrollment. The student will remain in this provisional category for only one semester/term and must meet all of the stipulated conditions during the initial semester/term to continue in the program. Students entering the University under this category register in the same manner as regular degree-seeking stu - dents. International students cannot be admitted into the provisional category. A provisional graduate student must be reviewed by the academic program and the University at the end of the initial semester/term to determine whether the stipulated conditions were met. If the conditions were not met, the student will not be able to continue in the program. While in provisional status a grad - uate student must register for graded graduate-level coursework (5000-level or above; excludes S/U courses) commensurate with the load requirements of the program and must earn at least an average of 3.0 for all graduate-level coursework taken. A hold blocking future enrollment will be placed on the record of a stu - dent who fails to meet the stipulated conditions during the initial provisional semester/term; such students will be ineligible to continue in the academic program. Students who met the minimum requirements for admission to the University either initially or during the provisional semester but failed to meet the program-specific conditions may subsequently seek admission to a different academic program as a degree or non-degree seeking student. A provisional student who does not earn at least a 3.0 average during the initial provisional term is not eligible for probationary status in the subsequent se - mester. Otherwise, a provisional graduate student is subject to the retention and dismissal regulations appropriate to a regular graduate student. For in - formation on non-degree classification, see the subsection on 'Non-Degree Students' in this chapter. Continuous Enrollment Please refer to the \"Academic Regulations and Procedures\" chapter in this Graduate Bulletin for continuous enrollment policies.Readmission Returning students seeking readmission to any student status, including graduate degree-seeking or non-degree seeking students who (1) have been absent from the University for two or more consecutive terms (including Summer); (2) have been dismissed from the University and have been ab - sent for two or more consecutive terms (including Summer); (3) have with - drawn from the University and have been absent for two or more consecutive terms (including Summer); (4) have had their last term of enrollment at the University administratively cancelled and have been absent for two or more consecutive terms (including Summer); or (5) have earned a graduate degree from the University and wish to enroll in a second graduate program, must sub - mit an application for readmission to the Office of Admissions. Academically dismissed students are not eligible for readmission unless they have been re - instated by their academic dean.

Returning graduate degree-seeking students who have been absent from the University for seven or more years or former provisional graduate students must submit a graduate application to the Office of Admissions according to the procedures prescribed for new admission. The readmission application and all supporting documents should be sub - mitted by the published deadline of the term for which readmission is desired. (Consult the \"University Calendar\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin for spe - cific deadlines.) Readmitted students are subject to retention requirements in effect at the time of reentrance. In addition, students claiming Florida residency must re - establish their eligibility for this classification when applying for readmission. Admission/Readmission Appeal Procedure Applicants to graduate programs who meet minimum University require - ments for admission and who are denied admission or readmission to a gradu - ate program, or as a non-degree student, may request reconsideration of their applications. The following procedures apply for all applicants who seek re - view of an admission or readmission decision: 1.

This decision shall be final, and there shall be no further appeals. Applicants who are denied admission or readmission to the University for judicial and/or conduct reasons may appeal by filing a written petition to the Admissions Committee through the Director of Admissions. Readmission after Multiple Withdrawals When a student has withdrawn from the University three or more times, subsequent readmission must first be considered by a committee whose charge it is to assess the student's capability of making satisfactory progress toward the degree. This committee, appointed by the Council of Associate and Assistant Deans, will make a recommendation to the dean of the student's college who will make the final decision.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Admissions 57 Second Graduate Program A student who has completed one graduate degree program at Florida State University must secure the approval of the proposed department before undertaking a second graduate program. Readmission is through the Office of Admissions. Work taken without such approval will not count toward a graduate degree. Admission as Non-Degree Student The non-degree student status is open to any post-baccalaureate student for either undergraduate or graduate coursework provided the student is in good academic standing at the last institution attended. Applicants who have been denied admission as degree-seeking students or who missed the deadline for submitting a degree-seeking application will not be considered for enrollment as a non-degree student. Registration begins the day before the beginning of the term and is on a space-available basis. In some cases, registration may require departmental approval. The non-degree application is available online at https://admissions.fsu. edu/.

A non-degree student at Florida State University who subsequently de - cides to seek reclassification from non-degree status to regular degree-seeking status must apply for graduate admission through the Office of Admissions. Enrollment as a non-degree student does not guarantee admission to a gradu - ate program. Work taken as a non-degree student does not automatically carry graduate degree credit; however, if the work is taken within the time limits prescribed by the degree program and approved by the department chair and dean, up to twelve hours of graduate-level credit with a grade of \"B\" or better in each course may count toward the degree, provided the student qualifies for admission to a graduate degree program. The University generally does not issue I-20 or DS-2019 visa documents for international non-degree students; however, international students on H-1, H-4, or J-2 visas can apply. In addition, foreign nationals on F-1 or F-2 visas can apply if they have graduated and are doing Optional Practical Training (OPT). Research scholars on J-1 can also apply. The academic program must contact the Center for Global Engagement ( https://cge.fsu.edu/ ), and the stu - dent must provide evidence of financial support and other information required by the United States government. In addition, the student must comply with all health requirements, including submitting a health history form and pur - chasing or providing proof of health insurance coverage prior to enrollment. For more details, see the \"Academic Regulations and Procedures\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Transient Graduate Students A graduate student seeking a degree from a university other than Florida State University may register for coursework at the graduate level as a non-de - gree transient student at Florida State University. Transient students must re - ceive prior approval from their graduate deans at their home institution for any courses taken at Florida State University for transfer to their home institutions. The transient application, with approved signatures, must be submitted to the Office of Admissions. Transient applications can be found at https://admis - sions.fsu.edu/ . Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University- Florida State University Interinstitutional Registration A Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) student plan - ning to participate in the Cooperative Program at Florida State University must obtain specific approval from the designated representative in the Office of the Registrar at FAMU. Approval is also required from the department of - fering the course at FSU. The completed co-op application must be returned to the Office of the Registrar at FAMU by the published deadline. (Consult the \"University Calendar\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin for specific applica - tion deadlines.) If approval to co-op is granted, the student will be registered for courses at Florida State University by a representative in the Office of the University Registrar at FSU. Some courses may have limited availability, and registration for these courses may be denied or delayed until drop/add at the beginning of the term. The approval of one institution does not bind the other to comply. All tuition and fees are paid at FAMU unless the course has additional departmental fees associated with it. Any departmental fees will be paid at FSU. Florida State University students planning to co-op at FAMU should refer to the \"Academic Regulations and Procedures\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Traveling Scholar Program The University participates in the Interinstitutional Academic Collaborative Traveling Scholar Program that enables a graduate student to take advantage of special resources available on another Atlantic Coast Conference campus but not available at the home campus, such as special course offerings, re - search opportunities, unique laboratories, and library collections. A traveling scholar's graduate advisor will approach an appropriate facul - ty member at the proposed host institution and recommend the scholar for a visiting arrangement. After agreement by the student's advisor and the faculty member of the host institution, graduate deans of both institutions will be fully informed by the advisor and have the power to approve or disapprove. A stu - dent will register at the host institution and will pay tuition and/or registration fees according to fee schedules established by that institution. Credit for the work taken will be recorded at the home university. Each university retains its full right to accept or reject a student who wishes to study under its auspices. A traveling scholar will normally be limited to one term on the campus of the host institution. A traveling scholar accepted by the host institution will be regarded as being registered at that institution for the period. A traveling scholar is not entitled to displacement allowance, mileage, or per diem payments. The home university, however, may elect to continue the financial support of the traveling scholar in the form of a fellowship or gradu - ate assistantship with any work obligation to be discharged either at the home or host institution. Academic Common Market The Academic Common Market (ACM) is an interstate agreement among southern states for sharing academic programs. Participating states approve their residents who qualify for admission to enroll in specific graduate pro - grams in other states on an in-state tuition basis. Arrangements traditionally are limited to unusual programs or programs not offered within the state of residence. To enroll as an ACM student, an applicant must obtain certification from the State Coordinator in the student's home state. Students must be ad - mitted to the appropriate degree program by the Office of Admissions, and the letter of certification must be received in the Office of Admissions before the first day of classes for the effective term. Information on the state's authoriza - tion of programs or the identity of the coordinator for a particular state may be found at http://home.sreb.org/acm/choosestate.aspx . For information on the programs in which FSU participates, contact the Academic Common Market Coordinator, 115 Westcott, (850) 644-7497 . Cooperative Programs in the State of Florida, Division of Colleges and Universities Cooperative graduate degree programs may be established in which the faculties of two or more of the universities within the state of Florida, Division of Colleges and Universities system join in offering a degree program in a par - ticular discipline. The degree is given by the university authorized by the State Board of Education to offer it, but coursework and faculty participation within agreed upon limits can occur on the campus of either or all of the participating universities. For information on possibilities in a particular discipline, students should contact the academic department. International Applicants Notice of Admission Formal notification of admission to Florida State University comes from the Office of Admissions and is for a specific term. The Center for Global Engagement will process the appropriate immigration form (Form I-20 or DS- 2019) necessary to obtain the student's visa when formal admission is granted and all required financial documentation is received. If the student is unable to enroll for the term indicated on the Application Status Check, the Office of Admissions should be informed immediately. If the student wishes to be reconsidered for a different term, the student must submit a new application and application fee. Certification of Finances The Certification of Financial Responsibility (CFR) must be completed before the Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20 or DS-2019) is issued. The I-20 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Admissions 58 and DS-2019 are immigration forms presented to the United States Embassy/ Consulate in order to obtain a U.S. Student Visa. The University is required by immigration authorities to verify the financial resources of each applicant prior to issuing the Form I-20 or DS-2019; therefore, it is important that the appli - cant knows the costs of attending the University and has the necessary support funds. More information on the CFR is available at https://cge.fsu.edu/ . Finances Before a United States Consul will grant a visa, international applicants must prove that they will have sufficient funding to meet all of their expenses while studying in the United States. Applicants must explain the source of funds noted on their I-20 or DS-2019 form and guarantee that they will receive funding for the duration of the program. If the student's government limits the amount of money that can be sent to students in the United States, the applicant should make sure that sufficient funds will be available to cover all costs while at the University. When ap - plicants leave their country, they must have enough money to pay for travel expenses to the University, fees for the entire term, living expenses until more money arrives, and the return fare to their home country. If the applicant's government requires verification of enrollment before money can be forward - ed, the student may request verification from the Office of the University Registrar after registration is completed at the University. On-campus employment opportunities are limited, and most international students are not permitted to work off campus except under special circum - stances. Students should have access to approximately half of the estimated total yearly amount at the beginning of each semester, since University fees must be paid upon registration at the start of each term. Students should also be prepared for initial expenses such as housing deposits, insurance, utilities, etc. The most up-to-date cost estimates for international students can be found at https://cge.fsu.edu/international-students/new-students . These estimates are for unmarried students with no dependents. Additional funds must be included for a spouse and/or family. Passports and Visas International applicants need a current passport from their own govern - ment and a visa from the United States Embassy/Consulate to enter the United States. Applicants should apply for a passport as soon as possible, although in some countries it will be necessary to provide proof of admission to a school in the U.S. before a passport is granted. Students already in possession of a passport must make sure it will remain valid for six months from the date they plan to enter the United States. It would also be prudent for students to check with the Embassy or Consulate of their native country to find out how passports are renewed while in the U.S. In some cases, students may need to get an extension of validity from their home country. If students are coming to the University specifically for the purpose of studying, they need to apply for a Student Visa (F-1 or J-1). It is granted upon presentation of a Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20 for the F-1 visa and Form DS-2019 for the J-1 visa which is typically granted to government-funded students) and proof that sufficient financial support to cover all expenses for the entire period of study in the U.S. is available. Graduate students holding F-1 or J-1 visas are normally required to carry from nine to twelve semester hours each semester, depending on the requirements of their department and the terms of any teaching or research assistantship. Health Insurance Requirement University Health Services provides outpatient care. Because students are likely to incur costs for medical care beyond that provided through outpatient services, adequate health insurance coverage must be obtained before they will be permitted to register for classes or to continue enrollment. In addi - tion, international students with \"J\" visa status who will be accompanied by dependents are required by federal regulations to purchase health insurance coverage for them. For more information regarding the health insurance re - quirement, refer to https://uhs.fsu.edu/ . International applicants are required to complete and submit a health his - tory form that describes previous illnesses and/or surgery. If students have had tuberculosis (or scars appearing on chest X-rays) or other serious infectious diseases, they must have a thorough medical examination before coming to the University and must bring these reports to campus. International applicants must be immunized according to state of Florida requirements, and must show proof of such immunization prior to registration. Students will not be allowed to enroll until they have submitted the health history form and have purchased insurance or provided proof of health insurance that meets the minimum cov - erage required by the state of Florida.Center for Intensive English Studies English is the language of instruction and communication at the University. International applicants who lack sufficient English language preparation must correct this deficiency before being admitted to the University. Students may do this in their home country or in the United States at a school that offers an intensive English language program. Florida State University offers such a program through the Frederick L. Jenks Center for Intensive English Studies. Detailed information on the Center may be obtained at https://cies.fsu.edu/ . Successful completion of English Studies at the Frederick L. Jenks Center for Intensive English Studies does not guarantee admission to Florida State University. Center for Global Engagement The Center for Global Engagement (CGE) provides immigration advising and support services to international students. Upon arrival at Florida State University, international students must immediately check in with the CGE. An orientation for new international students is required. In addition to the International Student Orientation, the Graduate School and most departments hold orientation sessions for new graduate students the week before classes start. Incoming international students are not allowed to register until they arrive in Tallahassee, report to the CGE, attend the International Student Orientation, obtain health insurance coverage, and submit their medical health history form to University Health Services. Federal reporting requirements make it essential for international students to enroll in a full course of study. For information about regulations that gov - ern both F and J visas, international students should refer to https://cge.fsu. edu/. Admission to the Panama City Campus Graduate students interested in attending the Panama City campus may request information from the Panama City Office of Admissions and Records, Florida State University, 4750 Collegiate Drive, Panama City, FL 32405- 1099, or online at https://pc.fsu.edu/academics/graduate-programs . The same policies, procedures, and requirements that pertain to the Tallahassee campus apply to the Panama City campus. Deadlines for applications and supporting documents at the FSU Panama City campus are the same as the Tallahassee campus. Further information is available by calling the Panama City Office of Admissions and Records at (850) 770-2160 or by visiting their Website at https://pc.fsu.edu/ .

For information regarding the secondary application and admission to the College of Medicine, interested students should contact: Florida State University, College of Medicine Admissions, P .O. Box 3064300, Tallahassee, FL 32306- 4300 or visit https://med.fsu.edu/ .Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Orientation and Information Sessions 59 GRADUATE ORIENTATION AND INFORMATION SESSIONS The Graduate School hosts a face-to-face New Graduate Student Orientation before classes begin each Fall semester. Additionally, the Graduate School hosts a virtual Orientation for graduate students who need to access Orientation remotely (e.g., online graduate students). The goals of Orientation are to provide students with an understanding of what to expect academically and financially as graduate students, describe the professional ethics associ - ated with graduate research and creative endeavors, highlight award-winning faculty and graduate students, and showcase campus services and extracur - ricular opportunities for graduate students. Graduate students attending this campus-wide Orientation can interact with representatives of graduate student organizations and campus offices, attend professional development work - shops, and enjoy refreshments provided by Seminole Dining and the Congress of Graduate Students. In addition to the information and networking opportu - nities afforded by the Fall Orientation event, professional development work - shops are offered collaboratively by the FSU Graduate School, Center for Leadership and Social Change, Center for Global Engagement, the University Libraries, and the Career Center throughout the academic year. The Program for Instructional Excellence (PIE), a unit of the Graduate School, offers a two-day TA Orientation/PIE Teaching Conference which ori - ents graduate student teaching assistants (TAs) to teaching at FSU. The PIE Graduate Student Teaching Conference is held the week before classes begin each Fall semester (please see additional details below). Additional orienta - tions/workshops may be offered by the individual departments that prepare graduate students for teaching in their discipline. Students will be notified through their individual academic departments of the date, time, and location of the University-wide orientation on teaching at FSU. Departments often offer their own formal or informal orientation sessions; queries regarding these meetings should be made directly to the chair of the student's department. Center for Global Engagement - International Student Orientation The Center for Global Engagement (CGE), under the Division of Student Affairs, is the department assigned by the University and designated by the federal government to provide services to international students in F-1 and J-1 visa classifications and ensure FSU compliance with federal immigration law. In addition to the Graduate Orientation mentioned above, the Center for Global Engagement offers orientation specifically for new international stu - dents. The orientation provides information and guidance on various topics including, CGE programs and services, healthcare, and insurance, essential immigration regulations, transportation, registration and fee payment, and more, to better prepare students for their arrival in Tallahassee. Through an online module, international students also learn about maintaining their legal non-immigrant student via status while obtaining their academic degree at FSU. Federal regulations make it essential that students know and understand their responsibilities under federal immigration law. Upon arrival in the U.S. international students must complete an Arrival Confirmation form before the CGE can process their required SEVIS registration. The CGE provides a variety of social and cultural programs such as International Coffee Hour, Global Caf\u00e9. Engage Your World Intercultural Dialogue Series, and other intercultural programs to promote interaction and increase cultural understanding among all FSU students. International students receive ongoing information about programs and services through weekly newsletters and social media. The Center for Global Engagement is located in the Global and Multicultural Engagement building (The Globe) at 110 S. Woodward Avenue, Tallahassee, FL 32306-4216 . The CGE's International Student and Scholar Services office, located on the second floor of the building. For more information, visit https:// cge.fsu.edu , call (850) 644-1702 , or e-mail cge@fsu.edu . Professional Development Professional development, improving and increasing one's skill sets, is important at every stage of graduate education and beyond. For example, improving one's oral and written communication skills and developing an understanding of research and creative ethical behavior are types of profes - sional development. At FSU, numerous professional development opportu - nities are offered by academic departments/programs, the Center for Global Engagement, the Center for Leadership & Social Change, the Career Center, and the Graduate School. One professional development program adminis -tered by the Graduate School is Preparing Future Faculty (PFF), which pro - vides a range of faculty experiences for graduate students, (e.g., presentations by faculty at FSU). Another approach to professional development is the series of workshops offered during the academic year for FSU graduate and postdoctoral students. Working closely with outstanding research faculty, administrators, and the Career Center, the Graduate School offers a wide range of workshops designed to equip students to achieve their educational and career goals. Descriptions of professional development workshops are located at https://gradschool.fsu. edu/professional-development/professional-development-workshops . Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) Program The Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program assists doctoral and terminal master's students in getting ready for faculty work. Through participation in coursework, workshops, mentoring, and interviewing faculty from other insti - tutions, PFF candidates increase awareness of expectations for faculty perfor - mance and of resources available to aid in scholarly careers, and build their readiness to address teaching, research, and related demands of faculty life. PFF program activities and requirements are organized around the key - stones of: Teaching Preparation, Research Preparation, Career Development, Mentoring, and Portfolio Development. To earn the PFF Certificate, stu - dents or postdoctoral scholars must complete a minimum of twelve graduate hours in the areas of Teaching Preparation, Research Preparation, and Career Development. Events are either discipline-specific or campus wide. All FSU doctoral students are eligible to participate, as are FSU post-doctoral fellows, adjunct/visiting faculty, and graduate students in terminal master's degree pro - grams (e.g., MFA). Candidates who meet specified requirements, often involv - ing participation over a two-year period, are awarded a completion certificate, but PFF events are open to all graduate students/postdoctoral scholars/visiting faculty regardless of whether they intend to earn a graduate certificate. FSU's PFF program coordinates with the national Preparing Future Faculty initiative of the Council of Graduate Schools and the Association of American Colleges and Universities, involving forty-five doctoral degree-granting insti - tutions and more than 300 partner institutions. To learn more about FSU's PFF program, check with your academic de - partment, visit https://gradschool.fsu.edu/professional-development/prepar - ing-future-faculty-pff or call The Graduate School at (850) 644-3501 . Preparing Future Professionals (PFP) Program The Preparing Future Professionals (PFP) program assists graduate stu - dents in preparing for work outside of academia (e.g., government, non-prof - its, industry). The PFP program provides opportunities for PFP candidates to improve their readiness for the work-force, whether in the United States or internationally. PFP program requirements and activities are organized around the keystones of Content (skills in the discipline), Ethics/Scholarly Integrity, Professional Preparation (transferable skills), and Portfolio. To earn the PFP Certificate, students must complete a minimum of twelve graduate hours in the areas of Content, Ethics/Scholarly Integrity, and Professional Preparation. In addition to the coursework requirement, PFP candidates will attend pro - fessional development workshops, complete an internship/practicum or inter - views in the field, and develop a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and a portfolio. All FSU graduate students and postdoctoral scholars are eligible to participate. Candidates who meet specified requirements by the time of graduation are awarded a gradu - ate certificate, but PFP events are open to graduate students and postdoctoral scholars regardless of whether they intend to earn a graduate certificate. To learn more about the PFP program, check with your academic de - partment, visit https://gradschool.fsu.edu/professional-development/prepar - ing-future-professionals-pfp , or call The Graduate School at (850) 644-3501 . Graduate Teaching Assistant Support The Graduate School Two programs that support graduate student teaching include the Program for Instructional Excellence (PIE) and Preparing Future Faculty (PFF). See the \"Preparing Future Faculty Program\" entry above. University-Wide Teaching Conferences, Workshops and Additional Teaching Development Programming The Program for Instructional Excellence (PIE) , a unit of The Graduate School, provides a variety of resources and programs in support of the teach - 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Orientation and Information Sessions 60 ing and learning development of graduate student teaching assistants (TAs), and any graduate student or postdoctoral scholar interested in learning about and developing best practices in teaching. PIE's programs also strive to create opportunities that foster a sense of collaboration and community among grad - uate students. The week before each Fall semester begins, PIE offers a two- day TA Orientation/PIE Teaching Conference to orient Tas and/or postdoctoral scholars to teaching at FSU. Participants learn strategies, methods, and tools for teaching; understand the role of the TA as a student, instructor, and appren - tice; and learn about University policy issues such as academic integrity and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The conference satisfies the required training elements as stated in the University-wide policy on teach - ing standards for TAs. PIE offers an orientation during the first week of the Spring semester to accommodate new students. The PIE Program also offers a variety of ongoing programming to promote interdisciplinary learning, in - cluding pedagogy-based reading groups, peer-teaching observations, teaching recognition programs, and online and face-to-face teaching workshops during the Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters. PIE's programming is open to all FSU graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, and staff. For more details about the conference and other programs offered by PIE, contact the Graduate School at (850) 645-7318, or visit the PIE Website at https://pie.fsu.edu/ . Office of Graduate Fellowships and Awards The Office of Graduate Fellowships and Awards (OGFA) , a unit of The Graduate School, assists current graduate students with articulating their interests and ambitions in support of identifying and applying for external fellowships and awards. Through participation in face-to-face individual and group meetings, workshops, and ongoing mentoring and advising, graduate students engage in the fellowship application process as an integral part of their professional development. OGFA's professional development opportuni - ties support early career development, academic portfolio building, and ongo - ing development of writing and communication skills. The Office of Graduate Fellowships and Awards offers online and face-to-face workshops during the Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters. All workshops qualify for PFF and PFP credit.

Freedom is an important experience that the University, one of the freest of institutions, provides for all of its citizens: faculty, students, administrators, and staff. Freedom is responsibly exercised when it is directed by ethical standards. As the Florida public university most deeply rooted in the liberal arts tra - dition, Florida State University not only focuses on intellectual development, but as a community engaged in moral discourse, it also recognizes the need for the development of the whole person. The University maintains a compre - hensive educational program ranging from classroom instruction to research and creative activities at the frontiers of human knowledge. These modes of searching for the truth are mutually enhancing and provide the context for the liberating experiences students gain from contact with ideas and individuals. Education based in the liberal arts provides an opportunity for students to learn to express themselves; to think critically both quantitatively and qualitatively; to gain an understanding of and respect for self and others; to understand the world by knowing more about its history, the role of science and technology, and social and cultural achievements; and to develop specialized talents for a vocation. This opportunity is provided with the conviction, as reflected in the University seal, that through such an educational experience one can come to a clearer understanding of the complex moral issues inherent in human life and can develop the knowledge and skills for effective and responsible participa - tion in the world. Florida State University shares a commitment to the dignity and worth of each person and is guided in its many endeavors by that underlying value. Through academic activity, community involvement, social interaction, cul - tural experience, recreational and physical activity, and religious involvement, students find many avenues in the University community for the development of the whole person. The University shares this society's commitment to the rule of law and expects members of the community to abide by the laws of the city, state, and nation, as well as University rules and regulations. The University aspires to excellence in its core activities of teaching, learn - ing, research, creative expression, and public service and is committed to the integrity of the academic process. The Academic Honor Code is a specific manifestation of this commitment. Truthfulness in one's claims and represen - tations and honesty in one's activities are essential in life and vocation, and the realization of truthfulness and honesty is an intrinsic part of the educational process. The University is a place of both assent and dissent and is committed to ac - ademic freedom and civil dialogue. In a free and vigorous academic communi - ty an ongoing clash of ideas is to be expected and encouraged. The University has a special obligation to see that all have an opportunity to be heard. Florida State University is committed to nondiscrimination in matters of race, creed, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, veterans' or marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or any other protected group status. This commitment applies in all areas with stu - dents, faculty, and other University personnel. It addresses recruiting, hiring, training, promotions, and applicable employment conditions. It is also relevant to those aspects of the University concerned with the choice of contractors, suppliers of goods and services, and with the use of University facilities. The University believes in equal opportunity practices that conform to both the spirit and the letter of all laws against discrimination. A responsible student recognizes that freedom means the acknowledge - ment of responsibility to the following: to justice and public order; to fellow students' rights and interests; to the University, its rules, regulations, and ac - cepted traditions; to parents, teachers, and all others whose support makes one's advanced education possible; to city, state, and national laws; to oneself; and to the opportunity for specialized training and continuing education toward the ends of personal fulfillment and social service. Students are urged to use their freedom in the University community to develop habits of responsibility that lead to the achievement of these personal and social values. Responsible student behavior requires observance of the Student Conduct Code, which is based on respect for the dignity and worth of each person and the requirements for successful community life. Relations among all persons should be characterized by mutual respect and equality. The University denounces all forms of sexism and racism. Sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual coercion of any sort are wrong and constitute a violation of fundamental moral requirements and state and federal law. Minimally responsible behavior requires that no one take sexual advantage of another. The cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity of the University community provides an opportunity for learning about those different from oneself. The University believes that each individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect and accorded the full opportunities of the University, without regard to prejudicial assumptions or attitudes. Discrimination based on race or ethnicity resulting from acts or policies is illegal and incompatible with the concept of responsible freedom as espoused by Florida State University. The University enforces all laws relevant to alcohol and controlled sub - stances and further strongly discourages the use of illegal substances at any time. The University disseminates and encourages the dissemination by others of information concerning the responsible use of alcohol. The University is a compassionate community. In its treatment of students, it recognizes the wisdom both of letting students experience the consequences of their actions and of providing the opportunity to learn and grow in ways that can overcome past difficulties. The University provides ongoing student support through the health center, counseling services, and the academic ad - vising process. The university experience is a time for adventure, fun, excitement, the making of new friends, and the discovery of new possibilities. There are nu - merous individual and organized opportunities for students to develop and to learn in the course of their university years to exercise newly acquired free - dom deliberately and responsibly. Matriculation to Florida State University, then, is a summons to the exercise of responsible freedom in a community of teaching, learning, and discovery. Integrity in Research and Creative Activity It is the policy of Florida State University to uphold the highest standards of integrity in research and creative activity, and to protect the right of its employees to engage in research and creative activity. Detailed policies and procedures can be found in the Faculty Handbook under \"Section 6: Policies and Procedures.\" Academic Honor Policy Introduction The statement on 'Values and Moral Standards at FSU' says: \"The moral norm which guides conduct and informs policy at Florida State University is re - sponsible freedom. Freedom is an important experience which the University, one of the freest of institutions, provides for all of its citizens - faculty, stu - dents, administrators, and staff. Freedom is responsibly exercised when it is directed by ethical standards.\" (See above 'Values and Moral Standards at FSU' section of this chapter.) The statement also addresses academic integrity: \"The University aspires to excellence in its core activities of teaching, research, creative expression, and public service and is committed to the integrity of the academic process. The [Academic Honor Policy] is a specific manifestation of this commitment. Truthfulness in one's claims and representations and honesty in one's activ - ities are essential in life and vocation, and the realization of truthfulness and honesty is an intrinsic part of the educational process.\" (See above 'Values and Moral Standards at FSU' section of this chapter.) Guided by these principles, this Academic Honor Policy outlines the University's expectations for students' academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and respon - sibilities of students and faculty throughout the process. The Academic Honor Policy Committee may take direct jurisdiction of a case under extraordinary circumstances when it is determined by a majority vote of the committee that taking direct jurisdiction is appropriate. Students in the College of Law and the College of Medicine are governed by the academic integrity policies and procedures of their respective colleges, which are subject to approval by the Academic Honor Policy Committee. Panama City students who have questions about the academic honor policy can contact the Dean's Office in the Holley Building for assistance. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Academic Integrity and Grievances 62 FSU Academic Honor Pledge I affirm my commitment to the concept of responsible freedom. I will be honest and truthful and will strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University. I will abide by the Academic Honor Policy at all times. Academic Honor Violations Note: Instructors are responsible for reinforcing the importance of the Academic Honor Policy in their courses and for clarifying their expecta - tions regarding collaboration and multiple submissions of academic work. Examples have been provided for the purpose of illustration and are not in - tended to be all-inclusive. 1. Plagiarism. Presenting the work of another as one's own (i.e., without proper acknowledgement of the source). Typical examples include: Using another's work from print, web, or other sources without acknowledging the source; quoting from a source without citation; using facts, figures, graphs, charts or information without acknowledgement of the source; or utilizing ghostwriting or pay-for-paper services. 2. Cheating. Improper access to or use of any information or material that is not specifically condoned by the instructor for use in the academic exercise. Typical examples include: Copying from another student's paper or receiving unauthorized assistance during a quiz, test, or examination; using books, notes, or other devices (e.g., calculators, cell phones, or computers) when these are not authorized; procuring without authorization a copy of or information about an examination before the scheduled exercise; or unauthorized collaboration on exams. 3. Unauthorized Group Work. Unauthorized collaborating with others. Typical examples include: Working with another person or persons on any activity that is intended to be individual work, where such collaboration has not been specifically authorized by the instructor. 4. Fabrication, Falsification, and Misrepresentation. Unauthorized altering or inventing of any information or citation that is used in assessing academic work. Typical examples include: Inventing or counterfeiting data or information; falsely citing the source of information; altering the record of or reporting false information about practicum or clinical experiences; altering grade reports or other academic records; submitting a false excuse for absence or tardiness in a scheduled academic exercise; or lying to an instructor to increase a grade. 5. Multiple Submissions. Submitting the same academic work (including oral presentations) for credit more than once without instructor permission. It is each instructor's responsibility to make expectations regarding incorporation of existing academic work into new assignments clear to the student in writing by the time assignments are given. Typical examples include: Submitting the same paper for credit in two courses without instructor permission; or making minor revisions in a credited paper or report (including oral presentations) and submitting it again as if it were new work. 6. Abuse of Academic Materials. Intentionally damaging, destroying, stealing, or making inaccessible library or other academic resource material. Typical examples include: Stealing or destroying library or reference materials needed for common academic purposes; hiding resource materials so others may not use them; destroying computer programs or files needed in academic work; stealing, altering, or intentionally damaging another student's notes or laboratory experiments. This refers only to abuse as related to an academic issue. 7. Complicity in Academic Dishonesty. Intentionally helping another to commit an act of academic dishonesty. Typical examples include: Knowingly allowing another to copy from one's paper during an examination or test; distributing test questions or substantive information about the material to be tested before a scheduled exercise; or deliberately furnishing false information. 8. Attempting to commit any offense as outlined above. Student Rights Students have the following important due process rights, which may have an impact on the appellate process: to be informed of all alleged violation(s), receive the complaint in writing (except in a Step 1 agreement, described in the Procedures Section, where the signed agreement serves as notice), and be given access to all relevant materials pertaining to the case. to receive an impartial hearing in a timely manner where they will be given a full opportunity to present information pertaining to the case. Students are also accorded the following prerogatives: when possible, to discuss the allegations with the instructor. privacy, confidentiality, and personal security. to be assisted by an advisor who may accompany the student throughout the process but may not speak on the student's behalf. to choose not to answer any question that might be incriminating. to contest the sanctions of a first-level agreement and to appeal both the decision and sanctions of an Academic Honor Hearing. The student has the right to continue in the course in question during the entire process. Once a student has received notice that he/she is being charged with an alleged violation of the Academic Honor Policy, or when a student has been found responsible for an Academic Honor Policy violation, the student is not permitted to withdraw or drop the course. Should no final determination be made before the end of the term, the grade of \"Incomplete\" will be assigned until a decision is made. Students in Tallahassee should contact the Dean of Students Department for further information regarding their rights. Students based in Panama City should contact the Student Affairs office in the Barron Building or the Dean's Office in the Holley Building. Procedures for Resolving Cases Step 1. Throughout the Step 1 process, the instructor has the responsibility to address academic honor allegations in a timely manner, and the student has the responsibility to respond to those allegations in a timely manner. For as - sistance with the Academic Honor Policy, students should consult the Dean of Students Department and instructors should consult the Office of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. Panama City students and instructors should contact the Dean's Office in the Holley Building for assistance. If a student observes a violation of the Academic Honor Policy, he or she should report the incident to the instructor of the course. When an instruc - tor believes that a student has violated the Academic Honor Policy in one of the instructor's classes, the instructor must first contact the Office of Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement to discover whether the student has a prior record of academic dishonesty in order to determine wheth - er to proceed with a Step 1 agreement (for Panama City-based instructors, the Dean's office in Panama City campus will also assist). The instructor must also inform the department chair or dean. (Teaching assistants must seek guid - ance from their supervising faculty member and adjunct instructors must seek guidance from their department chair.) However, faculty members or others who do not have administrative authority for enforcing the Academic Honor Policy should not be informed of the allegation, unless they have established a legitimate need to know. If pursuing a Step 1 agreement is determined to be possible, the instructor shall discuss the evidence of academic dishonesty with the student and explore the possibility of a Step 1 agreement (refer to https:// fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-and-grievances/academ - ic-honor-policy ). Four possible outcomes of this discussion may occur: 1. If the charge appears unsubstantiated, the instructor will drop the charge, and no record of academic dishonesty will be created. The instructor should make this decision using the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. 2. The student may accept responsibility for the violation and accept the academic sanction proposed by the instructor. In this case, any agreement involving an academic penalty must be put in writing and signed by both parties on the \" Academic Honor Policy Step 1 Agreement \" form (refer to https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/ academic-integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy )which must then be sent to the Office of Faculty Development and Advancement. This agreement becomes a confidential student record of academic dishonesty and will be removed from the student's file five years from the date of the final decision in the case. Any grade imposed as the result of an academic sanction will remain on the student's transcript indefinitely and will not be subject to course drop or withdrawal. 3. The student may accept the responsibility for the violation but contest the proposed academic sanction. In this circumstance, the student must submit the \" Academic Honor Policy Referral to Contest Sanction \" form (refer to https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/ academic-integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy ) along with supporting documentation to the Office of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. The student's written statement must demonstrate specific reasons why the proposed sanction is extraordinarily disproportionate to the offense committed for any change to occur in the sanction. The Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement (or designee) will review the submitted Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Academic Integrity and Grievances 63 documentation to determine whether the proposed sanction should be imposed. The Vice President (or designee) may affirm or modify the sanction as appropriate. The decision that results from this review is final. 4. The student may deny responsibility. In this circumstance, the instructor submits the \" Academic Honor Policy Hearing Referral \" form (refer to https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic- integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy ) along with supporting documentation to the Office of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement for an Academic Honor Policy Hearing. The student is issued a letter detailing the charges within ten class days of the receipt of the referral, and the schedule for the hearing will be set as soon as possible and within ninety days from the date of the letter. These timelines may be modified in unusual circumstances. Unless all parties agree, the hearing will not be held any sooner than seven class days from the student's receipt of the charge letter. The process then proceeds to Step 2. If the student is found to have a prior record of academic dishonesty or the serious nature of the allegations merits a formal hearing, the instructor must refer the matter to Step 2 for an Academic Honor Policy Hearing by submitting the \" Academic Honor Policy Hearing Referral \" form (refer to https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-and-grievances/ academic-honor-policy ) and appropriate documentation to the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. Allegations of academic dishonesty involving a graduate student engaged in any phase of the preliminary or comprehensive examination, thesis, or dis - sertation will be treated as egregious and will be resolved through the Step 2 process, in which the major professor will serve as the \"instructor\" under the hearing procedures. The Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement and the student's academic dean, (as well as the Vice President for Research in cases involving grant-funded research), should be informed as soon as possible of all such allegations. The decision regarding whether to submit a hearing referral will be made by a committee consisting of the de - partment chair and two faculty members appointed by the academic dean, one of whom should be the student's committee member serving as the University representative (if one has been identified), excluding the major professor. In rendering its decision, this committee should review all available information and consult with the major professor and the academic dean. Step 2. Academic Honor Policy Hearing. A panel consisting of five members shall hear the case. The panel shall include: one faculty member appointed by the dean from the unit in which the academic work is conducted; one faculty member appointed by the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement who is not from that unit; and two students appointed through procedures established by the Dean of Students Department. The panel shall be chaired by the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement (or designee), who votes only in case of a tie. The hearing will be conducted in a non-adversarial manner with a clear focus on finding the facts within the academic context of the academic work. The student is presumed innocent going into the proceeding. After hearing all available and relevant information from the student and the instructor, the panel determines whether or not to find the student responsible for the alleged violation using the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. If the student is found responsible for the violation, the panel is informed about any pri - or record of academic honor policy violations and determines an academic sanction (and disciplinary sanction, if appropriate). In some cases, a Step 1 sanction may have been appropriately proposed prior to the convening of an Academic Honor Hearing. If the student is found responsible in these cases, the panel typically will impose a sanction no more severe than that which was proposed by the faculty member. The panel is required to provide a clear written justification for imposing a sanction more severe than the sanction proposed in Step 1. The chair of the Academic Honor Policy hearing panel will report the de - cision to the student, the instructor, the academic unit, the supervising faculty member or a teaching assistant or an adjunct instructor, the student's dean, the Dean of Students Department, and the Registrar, if appropriate. If the student is found responsible, this outcome will be recorded with the Dean of Students Department and becomes a confidential student record of an Academic Honor Policy violation. Records in which suspension or a less severe sanction (in - cluding all academic sanctions) is imposed will be removed five years from the date of the final decision in the case. Any grade imposed as the result of an academic sanction will remain on the student's transcript indefinitely and will not be subject to course drop or withdrawal. Records involving dismissal and expulsion will be retained permanently, except in cases where a dismissed student is readmitted. Those records will be removed five years from the date of the student's readmission. Student Academic Problems Florida State University has established both informal and formal pro - cesses that provide fair and equitable routes for resolving student complaints and grievances. (See \"Academic Honor Policy,\" \"Grievance Procedure,\" and \"Grade Appeals\" headings of this Bulletin section for more specific information.) The University encourages students to raise any academic issue they en - counter as soon as possible, directly with the person who is closest to the mat - ter. Each of these complain resolution processes gives students the opportunity to present information and to appeal an initial decision to a higher authority. Please note the important distinction between the student grievances men - tioned above and student requests for exceptions to University academic poli - cies. Exceptions, such as student requests for late course drops or substitution of major requirements, are handled by each student's primary academic dean's office. Deans, or their designees, have final authority over decisions regarding academic policy exceptions. The academic dean considers information provided by students in making these decisions. When petitioning for an exception, the student must provide cause-specific documentation of their circumstances showing that their ability to complete their academic obligations or requirements was disrupted. Based upon the presented evidence, the Dean will determine if exceptional circum - stances beyond the student's control prevented the student from complying with the academic policy. If such circumstances are found to exist, the Dean will grant the request and provide specific directions to the student regarding how to proceed. Because the final authority rests with the dean, there is no appeal for having been denied an exception to academic policy (such as missing the course-drop deadline or asking for a course to be substituted for the required one in the major). Students can help to prevent situations that lead to grievances and requests for exceptions by staying aware of course requirements and deadlines, mark - ing course-drop dates on their calendars, and letting their instructor or adviser know as soon as possible if they are falling behind and need assistance. Sanctions Step 1. This Step 1 procedure is implemented with first-offense allegations that do not involve egregious violations. The decision regarding whether an allega - tion is egregious is made by the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement (or designee) and the instructor. The instructor should consider the seriousness of the violation, the student's circumstances, potential oppor - tunities for learning and consistency with past sanction in determining a pro - posed sanction. The following sanctions are available in the Step 1 procedure. 1. Additional academic work, including re-doing the assignment 2. A reduced grade (including \"0\" or \"F\") for the assignment 3. A reduced grade (including \"F\") for the course Step 2. An Academic Honor Policy Hearing is held for all second offenses, for all first offenses that involve egregious violations of the Academic Honor Policy, for all offenses that involve simultaneous violations of the Student Conduct Code, and in all cases where the student denies responsibility for the alleged violation. The decision regarding whether an allegation is egregious is made by the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement (or des - ignee) and the instructor. In some cases, a Step 1 sanction may have been appropriately proposed prior to the convening of an Academic Honor Policy Hearing. If the student is found responsible in these cases, the panel typically will impose a sanction no more severe than that which was proposed by the faculty member. The panel is required to provide a clear written justification for imposing a sanction more severe than the sanction proposed in Step 1. Students will not be penalized solely for exercising their right to request a Step 2 hearing. The following sanctions are available in Step 2 (see the Procedures section) and may be imposed singly or in combination: 1. Additional academic work, including re-doing the assignment 2. A reduced grade (including \"0\" or \"F\") for the assignment 3. A reduced grade (including \"F\") for the course 4. Educational Activities - attendance at educational programs, development of an academic plan with the assistance of the Academic Center for Excellence, participation in an Ethics Workshop, tutoring 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Academic Integrity and Grievances 64 regarding proper citation practices, meetings with appropriate faculty or administrators, writing essays, or other educational activities. Fees may be charged to cover the cost of educational activities. 5. Restitution, letter of apology, or other restorative act 6. Disciplinary Probation - a period of time during which any further violation of the Academic Honor Policy puts the student's status with the University in jeopardy. If the student is found responsible for another violation during the period of Disciplinary Probation, serious consideration will be given to imposing a sanction of Suspension, Dismissal, or Expulsion. Restrictions that may be placed on the student's activities during this time period include, but are not limited to: participating in student activities; representing the University on athletic teams or in other leadership positions; and participating In practice for athletic or other competitions. 7. Suspension - Separation from the University for a specified period, not to exceed two years. 8. Dismissal - Separation from the University for an indefinite period of time. Dismissal is considered a final sanction, but readmission is possible in some cases under documented exceptional circumstances. No consideration will be given to readmitting a dismissed student within the first three years after a dismissal is imposed. Dismissal is noted on the student's transcript. 9. Expulsion - Separation from the University without the possibility of readmission. Expulsion is noted on the student's transcript. 10. Withholding of diplomas, transcripts, or other records for a specified period of time. 11. Suspension of degree, in cases where an offense is discovered after the degree is posted. 12. Revocation of degree, in cases where an offense is discovered after the degree is posted. Appeals Decisions of the Academic Honor Policy Hearing Panel may be appealed to the Academic Honor Policy Appeal Committee, a standing four-member committee composed of two faculty appointed by the President and two stu - dents appointed by the Vice President for Student Affairs. The chair will be appointed annually by the President, and members will serve two-year renew - able terms. In case of a tie vote regarding a case, the committee will submit a written report to the Provost, who will then make the final determination. On appeal, the burden of proof shifts to the student to prove that an error has occurred. The only recognized grounds for appeal are: 1. Due process errors involving violations of a student's rights that substantially affected the outcome of the initial hearing. 2. Demonstrated prejudice against the charged student by any panel member. Such prejudice must be evidenced by a conflict of interest, bias, pressure, or influence that precluded a fair and impartial hearing. 3. New information that was not available at the time of the original hearing. 4. A sanction that is extraordinarily disproportionate to the offense committed. 5. The preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing does not support a finding of responsible. Appeals based on this consideration will be limited to a review of the record of the initial hearing, and the student will not be invited to appear before the Appeal Committee. The procedures followed during the appeals process are: 6. The student should file a written letter of appeal to the Office of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement within ten class days after being notified of the Academic Honor Policy Hearing Panel decision. This letter should outline the grounds for the appeal (see 1-5 above) and should provide supporting facts and relevant documentation. 7. The Academic Honor Policy Appeal Committee will review this letter of appeal and will hear the student and any witnesses called by the student, except in appeals based on consideration #5 above. The committee may also gather any additional information it deems necessary to make a determination in the case. The instructor is not typically involved in the appellate process. 8. The Appeals Committee may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial panel decision, or it may order a new hearing to be held. This decision becomes final agency action when it is approved by the Provost. In cases where the student is found responsible, the decision becomes a confidential student record of academic dishonesty. 9. Appellate decisions are communicated in writing to the student, the instructor, the instructor's academic unit, the supervising faculty member or a teaching assistant or an adjunct instructor, the Office of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement, the student's academic dean, the Dean of Students Department and the Registrar, if necessary, within thirty class days of the appellate hearing. Academic Honor Policy Committee An Academic Honor Policy Committee shall be appointed by the University President. The Committee will include: three faculty members, selected from a list of six names provided by the Faculty Senate Steering Committee and three students, selected from a list of six names provided by the Student Senate. The Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement or designee and the Dean of Students or designee shall serve ex officio . Faculty members will serve three-year staggered terms, and students will serve one-year terms. The committee will meet at least once a semester. It will monitor the operation and effectiveness of the Academic Honor Policy, work with the Faculty Senate and the Student Senate to educate all members of the community regarding academic integrity, and make recommendations for changes to the policy. Amendment Procedures Amendments to the Academic Honor Policy may be initiated by the Academic Honor Policy Committee, the Faculty Senate, the Student Senate, and/or the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Amendments to the policy must be approved by both the Faculty Senate and the Student Senate. Grievance Procedure Students who allege that academic regulations and procedures have been improperly applied in specific instances may have their grievances addressed through the general academic appeals process. In this process, the student brings a complaint first to the instructor, then to the department chair, and finally to the academic dean appropriate to the course involved, stopping at the level at which the complaint is resolved. If no resolution is reached, the student brings the complaint to the attention of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement for either resolution or referral to the Student Academic Relations Committee of the Faculty Senate. A graduate student whose complaint is unresolved must see the Dean of the Graduate School prior to meeting with the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. The Student Academic Relations Committee has the authority to direct, through the Vice President for Academic Affairs, that corrective ac - tion be taken when justified. Grievance Procedure: Panama City Campus Students who allege that academic regulations and procedures have been improperly applied in specific instances may have their grievances addressed through the general academic appeals process. In this process, the student brings a complaint first to the instructor, then to the Panama City Associate Dean (or department chair if applicable to the course), and then to the Panama City Dean (or College Dean if applicable to the course), stopping at the level at which the complaint is resolved. If no resolution is reached, the student brings the complaint to the attention of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement for either resolution or referral to the Student Academic Relations Committee of the Faculty Senate. A graduate student whose com - plaint is unresolved must see the Dean of the Graduate School prior to meet - ing with the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. The Student Academic Relations Committee has the authority to direct, through the Vice President for Academic Affairs, that corrective action be taken when justified. Grievance Procedure: Panama, Republic of Panama Campus Students who allege that academic regulations and procedures have been improperly applied in specific instances may have their grievances addressed through the general academic appeals process. In this process, the student brings a complaint first to the instructor, then to the FSU Panama Vice Rector for Academic Affairs. If the complaint is not resolved at this stage, then the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs forwards the complaint to the Academic Standards Committee, which then must make a recommendation to the FSU Panama Rector. If no resolution is reached at the Republic of Panama cam - pus, then the student will go to the department chair, and finally to the aca - demic dean appropriate to the course involved, stopping at the level at which the complaint is resolved. If no resolution is reached, the student brings the complaint to the attention of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement for either resolution or referral to the Student Academic Relations Committee of the Faculty Senate. A graduate student whose com - plaint is unresolved must see the Dean of the Graduate School prior to meet - ing with the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. The Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Academic Integrity and Grievances 65 Student Academic Relations Committee has the authority to direct, through the Vice President for Academic Affairs, that corrective action be taken when justified. Student Academic Relations Committee (SARC) of the Faculty Senate The Faculty Senate Committee on Student Academic Relations hears ap - peals from students concerning decisions about their academic work which they have evidence to show to have been arrived at improperly or unprofes - sionally in departments, schools, or colleges. The committee comprises five faculty members (appointed annually by the Faculty Senate steering commit - tee with the advice and consent of the Senate for staggered two-year terms) and two students, one undergraduate and one graduate (appointed annually by the University President). The committee elects its chair annually from the faculty representatives and reports its findings and recommendations to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Students wishing to make appeals to the committee on student academic relations should consult the Office of Faculty Development and Advancement. Appeals to this committee are made after all other available remedies have been exhausted. University Student Ombudsperson The Office of the University Ombudsperson provides students of the University community an avenue for confidential exploration of decisions regarding academic issues. Once all other appropriate mechanisms have been exhausted, students may present their case to the University Ombudsperson. The ombudsperson is a neutral facilitator and will assist students with any academic problem or grievance that may arise during their interaction with the University. While he/she may be an instrument for change, the ombudsperson does not resolve issues by any direct use of authority or power, but rather requests a reexamination of the problem. Grade Appeals System The purpose of the grade appeals system is to afford an opportunity for an undergraduate or graduate student to appeal a final course grade under certain circumstances. Faculty judgment of students' academic performance is inher - ent in the grading process and hence should not be overturned except when the student can show that the grade awarded represents a gross violation of the instructor's own specified evaluation (grading) statement and therefore was awarded in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory manner. The evaluation (grading) statement utilized during the grade appeals process is the one con - tained in the instructor's syllabus at the beginning of the semester. This system does not apply to preliminary or comprehensive exams or to thesis or disser - tation defenses; these issues are reviewed by the Student Academic Relations Committee via the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. Step 1. Within fifteen class days (defined throughout the Grade Appeals System as Mondays through Fridays during regular fall, spring, and sum - mer semesters, as noted in the FSU Academic Calendar maintained by the University Registrar. Class days are not dependent on whether an individual student has class on a particular day) following the date that final grades are made available to students, the student must contact the instructor in question to discuss the grade and attempt to resolve any differences. The student should document any attempts to contact the instructor in order to establish that the appeal was begun within this fifteen-class-day period. In the event that the instructor is not available, the student should provide that documentation to the instructor's program or department chair. It is expected that the student will first attempt to resolve the grade dispute with the instructor; however, ei - ther the student or the instructor may consult with the appropriate department chair, school director, or designee during this process. Step 2. If no resolution is reached within this fifteen-class-day period, after the student's documented attempt, the student has an additional ten class days to submit a written statement to the department chair, school director, or des - ignee. This statement must include an account of attempts to resolve the issue, as well as the evidence that forms the basis for the appeal. Within twenty class days thereafter, the department chair, school director, or designee will set a date for a meeting of a grade appeals screening com - mittee composed of three students enrolled in the academic unit offering the course to review the appeal. These students should be either undergraduate or graduate students, depending on the enrollment status of the student challeng - ing the grade. The meeting should occur within that twenty-class-day period, if practicable. Appropriate students who have no conflict of interest will be chosen to serve on this screening committee by a student organization asso - ciated with the program or department, if such an organization exists. If none exists or if members of such an organization are not available, the department chair, school director, or designee will select appropriate students who have no conflict of interest. Both the student and the instructor may attend the meeting, as may the department chair, school director, or designee. The role of the screening committee is solely to determine whether the student has presented sufficient evidence to warrant further review. Within five calendar days after this meeting, the screening committee will render its de - cision in writing (indicating that they recommend/do not recommend further review) to the department chair, school director, or designee, the student, and the instructor. A negative decision will end the appeal. A positive decision will trigger the next step in the process. Step 3. Within fifteen class days of a positive decision from the grade ap - peals screening committee, the department chair, school director, or designee will appoint and arrange for a meeting of a grade appeals board. The meeting should occur within that fifteen-class-day period, if practicable. The board is composed of three faculty members and two students other than those who served on the screening committee. These students should be either under - graduate or graduate students, depending on the enrollment status of the stu - dent challenging the grade. The purpose of this board is to determine whether or not to uphold the final grade assigned by the instructor. The board will consider only the evidence provided by the student and the instructor in making the determination. The student, the instructor, and the department chair, school director, or designee may attend the meeting. The grade will be upheld unless the evidence shows that the grade was awarded in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory manner, as a result of a gross violation of the instructor's own evaluation (grading) statement. If the original grade is not upheld, the board will recommend that an alternative grade be assigned by the department chair, school director, or designee. If the student has evidence that this grade appeals process has deviated substantially from these established procedures, resulting in a biased deci - sion, the student may consult with the Office of Faculty Development and Advancement regarding referral to the Faculty Senate Student Academic Relations Committee. Note: For additional information regarding general grading practices and approvals, please refer to the 'Grading Practices' section in the \"Academic Regulations\" chapter of this General Bulletin . Religious Holy Days Per Section 1006.53, Florida Statutes, the Florida State University policy on observance of religious work-restricted holy days provides that students shall, upon notifying their instructor within the first two weeks of the semester, be excused from class to observe a religious work-restricted holy day of their faith. While students will be held responsible for the material covered in their absence, each student shall be permitted a reasonable amount of time to make up the work missed. Instructors and University administrators shall in no way arbitrarily penalize students who are absent from academic or social activi - ties because of religious work-restricted holy day observance. Instructors will find the calendar developed by the University of Missouri ( https://diversity. missouri.edu/guide-to-religions/dates-practices-accomodations/ ) a useful re - source as they respond to student requests for absence. Students who allege that this policy has been improperly applied in specific instances may have their grievances addressed through the general academic appeals process. In this process, the student brings a complaint first to the instructor, then to the department chair, and finally to the academic dean appropriate to the course involved, stopping at the level at which the complaint is resolved. If no reso - lution is reached, the student brings the complaint to the attention of the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement for either resolution or referral to the Student Academic Relations Committee of the Faculty Senate. This committee has the authority to recommend to the Vice President for Academic Affairs that corrective action be taken when justified. Consult the 'Grievance Procedure' section of this chapter for a complete description. Sexual Relationships and Conflicts of Interest The following policy concerning conflicts of interest applies to graduate students who are being supervised or evaluated by faculty as well as graduate students who are serving as teaching assistants and thus supervising or evalu - ating undergraduates. Sexual relationships between faculty members and stu - dents where a direct supervisory or evaluative relationship exists are fraught with the potential for exploitation. The respect and trust accorded a faculty member by a student, as well as the power exercised by the faculty member in a direct supervisory or evaluative role, make voluntary consent by the student suspect. In their relationships with students, faculty members are expected to be aware of their professional responsibilities and to avoid conflict of interest, favoritism, or bias: 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Academic Integrity and Grievances 66 1. When any direct supervisory or evaluative role exists, a consensual sexual relationship between a student and a faculty member is a conflict of interest. 2. Any situation of direct supervision or evaluation will be ended immediately when a consensual sexual relationship between a student and a faculty member exists. 3. Any such relationship must be disclosed to the faculty member's supervisor immediately. 4. Direct supervision includes any type of evaluative role. Examples of direct supervision of the student include teaching the student's class, serving as a thesis or dissertation director, instructor of record, member of the student's thesis or dissertation committee, member of the student's comprehensive or doctoral exam committee, member of other committees where the focus is evaluation or supervision of the student's academic competence or the student's assistantship.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 67 GRADUATE ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES Required First class meeting Attendance Policy University-wide policy requires all students to attend the first class meeting of all classes for which they are registered. Students who do not attend the first class meeting of a course for which they are registered will be dropped from the course by the academic department that offers the course. This policy ap - plies to all levels of courses and to all campuses and study centers. It remains the student's responsibility to verify course drops and check that fees are adjusted. Please refer to 'Class Attendance' below for additional information. Note: Students who have received some or all of their financial aid prior to the end of drop/add for a term, may be subject to repayment of financial aid if there is a change in their financial aid eligibility. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, reduction of course load below required levels, cancella - tion of schedule, failure to meet satisfactory academic progress requirements, and other conditions required to maintain financial aid eligibility. Class Attendance All students are expected to abide by the class attendance policy set forth by the instructor in each class in accordance with the Faculty Handbook . When possible, students also must provide advance notice of absences, as well as relevant documentation regarding absences, to the instructor as soon as pos - sible following the illness or event that led to the absence. Any arrangement to make up work because of class absence is the responsibility of the student. The instructor, who will explain the evaluation (grading) statement at the be - ginning of the term, determines the effect of absences upon grades. Students must attend the section of the course for which they are registered. No instructor has the authority to permit a student to shift from one section of the course to another without following official drop/add procedures. No student may drop a course after the seventh week of classes without the per - mission of his or her academic dean. Until a student is officially enrolled in a course, they are not permitted to attend class, submit assignments, or take tests. Exceptions are limited to students auditing the course or making up work for a prior incomplete grade in the course. Students who are not officially registered for a course or do not appear on the course roster after the end of the second week of the semester should be referred to the appropriate office for approval to continue attending class. That may be the Office of Financial Aid, Student Business Services, the Office of the University Registrar, the Office of Admissions, etc. Students may contact the Office of the University Registrar if they are unsure of which office they need to contact for documentation. University Health Services will issue \"Provider Visit Verifications\" to stu - dents if requested. Such verification may include, at the discretion of the med - ical provider (Physician, PA, APRN, LCSW, or Physical Therapist), recom - mendations about bed rest, restricted activity and follow-ups. Students who need notes for class excuses will be unable to obtain them from University Health Services if they have not been seen by a provider at UHS. Ultimately, the authority for deciding whether the student is excused for medical reasons rests with the instructor. Students who are members of an intercollegiate team are required to attend all scheduled class meeting times or scheduled online activities associated with the course delivery. Absences due to illness, personal/family emergen - cies, or injury must be documented. Failure to adhere to the attendance policy may result in sanctions up to and including suspension from the athlete's sport for the remainder of the season. Student-athletes must remain eligible to enroll in order to maintain eligibility for all intercollegiate competition. Arranging to make up work missed because of legitimate class absence is the responsibility of the student. Within the University there are several categories of students that are ex - pected to exhibit behavior that conforms to the group to which they belong. These units include, but are not limited to, ROTC cadets, academic honor societies, veterans, athletes, medicine, and nursing majors. Membership with - in these units implies that the student agrees to fulfill the obligations of the organization. Military Short-Term Absence or Call to Active Duty Policies pertaining to accommodations for short-term absence of call to active duty, please refer to the \"Student Veteran Information\" chapter herein.Academic Career, Academic Level and Classification of Students The University classifies students based on whether or not they are de - gree-seeking. Degree-seeking students are further classified based on the type and level of degree they are pursuing. This classification is the academic career of the student. The University recognizes six academic careers, four degree-seeking and two non-degree seeking. Although rare, a student may be active in more than one career at a time, subject to the academic policies and requirements of each career and the degree requirements. Degree-seeking careers: Undergraduate: students pursuing baccalaureate degree of any type Graduate: students pursuing master's, specialist, or doctorate degree of all types (except the juris master, master of law letters, juris doctorate, or doctor of medicine degrees) Law: students pursuing the juris doctorate (JD) degree, juris master (JM), or master of law letters (LLM) Medicine: students pursuing the doctor of medicine (MD) degree Non-degree-seeking careers: Non-Degree, without Baccalaureate: students without a baccalaureate degree Non-Degree, with Baccalaureate (post-baccalaureate): students who have previously earned, at a minimum, one baccalaureate degree or higher level degree Depending on the career of the student, the University may record the ad - vancement of the student toward completion of the degree by tracking the academic level of the student. The academic level of undergraduate students is calculated on the basis of semester hours. Students with a career of Law or Medicine are classified based on their year within the program. Graduate students and various non-degree students do not have specific academic levels or classification. Graduate: admitted to a graduate program; Law (JD degree): first through third year; Medicine (MD degree): first through fourth year; Non-Degree seeking without Baccalaureate Degree; Non-Degree seeking with Baccalaureate Degree; and Transient Students. Non-Degree Seeking Student Regulations Academic rules governing regular students (e.g., fees, drop/add, with - drawal, grading policies) also apply to non-degree seeking students with the following exceptions: 1. Non-degree seeking students may enroll for fewer than twelve semester hours (underload) without permission. 2. In place of the retention schedule for regular students, non-degree seeking students with a baccalaureate degree must meet the following requirements: after attempting twelve semester hours, non-degree seeking with baccalaureate students must have achieved and must maintain a 3.0 (\"B\") average in all courses attempted. 3. Failure to achieve or maintain the appropriate grade point average (GPA) will result in a loss of registration privilege and dismissal from the University. 4. Non-degree seeking students may register for any course or courses on an S/U basis. Non-degree seeking students selecting courses for enrichment or other reasons where grades are not essential are advised to register on an S/U basis or on an audit basis. Consult the \"Academic Regulations and Procedures\" chapter of the General Bulletin for policies relating to non-degree seeking student status at the undergraduate level. The Office of the University Registrar serves as the academic dean for all non-degree students. Registration of Non-Degree Seeking Students All non-degree-seeking graduate students may register for up to 18 credit hours; enrollment beyond this limit may be subject to approval by the Registrar. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 68 All registration by non-degree seeking students is on a space-available basis. Because of excessive demand for some graduate courses, non-degree seeking students may be enrolled in such courses only with the permission of the graduate officer of that particular unit. Reclassification from Non-Degree Seeking Student to Regular (Degree-Seeking) Status Non-degree seeking students wishing to change to degree-seeking-student status must apply for admission through the Office of Admissions. Refer to the \"Admissions\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin for admission procedures and deadline dates. Work taken as a non-degree seeking student carries no degree credit. If the work is taken within the time limits prescribed by the degree program and approved by the department chair and dean at the time of formal admission or later, up to twelve hours of graduate-level credit with a grade of \"B\" or better in each course may count toward the degree, provided the student qualifies for admission to a graduate degree program. Student Course Load Recipients of stipends from the University, whether holders of fellowships or assistantships, must be full-time students as defined below. Non-degree seeking students are not required to obtain underload permission. The University reserves the right to determine full-time status based on course and/or research load and stage of degree completion. The standard full-time load for graduate students for certification purpos - es is twelve credit hours per semester, unless otherwise noted. For graduate students receiving a university or externally-funded fellowship, twelve credit hours per semester constitutes a full-time load. A student who wishes to regis - ter for fewer than twelve credit hours per semester must have written approval from his/her academic dean prior to registration. Included in the calculation of student load are credit hours of graduate credit other than formal coursework, e.g., credit hours in thesis or dissertation, in directed individual study, in super - vised research, and in supervised teaching. Some departments may permit such students to enroll on a part-time ba - sis. A student who wishes to register for fewer than twelve credit hours per semester must have written approval from his/her academic dean prior to registration. For graduate assistantship holders of a quarter-time or greater appointment, nine credit hours per semester is defined as a full-time load for those university policies that require a student to be considered full-time. Academic deans may grant exceptions to this policy for teaching assistants in those departments which conform to national course load policies in their disciplines. To be eligible to receive financial aid, all graduate students must be en - rolled for at least six credit hours per semester. The number of credit hours which a graduate student may carry without special permission is fifteen. A heavier load may be permitted by the student's academic dean. For federal immigration reporting requirements, international (F-1 or J-1) students meet the full course of study requirement with enrollment of a mini - mum of nine credit hours in the Fall and Spring semesters, prior to completion of coursework. Departments may require additional enrollment, depending on department policy. After completion of required coursework, the standard uni - versity policy applies. An F-1 or J-1 student who wishes to reduce enrollment below the required levels must request permission, in advance, from an advi - sor at the Center for Global Engagement. For more information, visit https:// cge.fsu.edu/ . Directed Individual Study Courses Students may enroll in courses directed by an instructor for individual study of a particular area. Individual academic departments or programs determine directed individual study policies for students taking directed individual study courses in that department or program. The directed individual study course title must be approved in writing by the instructor offering the course and the departmental chair, or representative, and is posted on the student's record. Office of the University Registrar University Registrar: Kimberly A. Barber; Senior Associate Registrar: Aimee Leturmy; Associate Registrars: Katie Cloud, Johnson University Center ; phone: (850) 644-1050 ; e-mail: regis - trar@fsu.edu ; Web: https://registrar.fsu.edu/ The Office of the University Registrar is the official custodian of permanent academic records of all past and currently enrolled students at Florida State University. It is responsible for assisting departments and students with reg - istration activities; maintaining student and departmental records for the term in progress; posting FSU credit, transfer credit, and grade changes; preparing transcripts; scheduling academic space; maintaining and updating curricula; certifying eligibility to receive credit for Credit by Examination; certifying attendance for loan purposes; implementing and monitoring academic regula - tions; certifying eligibility to graduate; and providing services and information to students, faculty, and administration. Reports and certifications of atten - dance and grade point average are made to governmental agencies, such as the Veterans' Administration, with the student's permission. Students should consult this office with questions concerning registration, locations and meeting times of courses, errors in registration records, dropping and adding courses, cancellation of registration, grade problems, application for graduation, and degree or enrollment verification. Report immediately all changes in permanent and local addresses, name, social security number, and residency to this office. Persons with Disabilities.

Registrar Cancellation of Schedule Students allowed to register in error are cancelled by the Office of the University Registrar. Students who are dropped or deleted from their last or only course by an academic department because of nonattendance on the first day of class are cancelled by the Office of the University Registrar. This cancellation is without liability for tuition. Graduate, law, and medical students whose registra - tion is cancelled by the University Registrar must apply for readmission if they have not been enrolled for two consecutive terms . For the purpose of this policy the cancellation term is considered a term of non-enrollment. Note: Students who have received some or all of their financial aid prior to the end of drop/add for a term, may be subject to repayment of financial aid if there is a change in their financial aid eligibility. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, reduction of course load below required levels, cancella - tion of schedule, failure to meet satisfactory academic progress requirements, and other conditions required to maintain financial aid eligibility. Cancellation of Student Schedules for Non-Payment of Tuition and Fees In accordance with Florida State University Regulation 5.081 Tuition, Fees, Payment , students who do not pay tuition and fees or make arrangements to pay tuition and fees by the end of the established fee payment deadline may have their schedules cancelled and academic progress discontinued for the semester. Students whose schedules have been cancelled may not attend class or receive grades. Students will be notified using their FSU e-mail account concerning outstanding tuition delinquencies and given an opportunity to pay tuition and fees or make arrangements for tuition and fee payment with the Office of Student Business Services prior to cancellation. For more informa - tion, please reference https://regulations.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/imported/stor - age/original/application/f63ce880bfa04fa18f1d2103e0fd4ec9.pdf . Reinstatement of Student Schedules Cancelled for Non- Payment of Tuition and Fees Students whose schedules are cancelled for non-payment of tuition and fees may submit a written appeal to the University Registrar for reinstatement and continuation of academic progress for the term. A written appeal must be submitted to the University Registrar no later than the end of the seventh week of classes as identified in the University Academic Calendar (consult the Registration Guide for term deadlines). Prior to a student's appeal being approved, the Office of Student Business Services must verify that payment for the current term has been received or that appropriate arrangements have been made for tuition and fee payment. Students whose schedules are reinstat - ed are subject to a $100.00 late registration fee and a $100.00 late payment fee. Check or credit card payments that are returned or refused will negate any tuition payment agreement for the reinstatement of a student's schedule. The University reserves the right to deny reinstatement when a demonstrated pattern of tuition delinquencies over two or more semesters has occurred. Note: The appeal must be submitted by the seventh week deadline for the term that was cancelled. Appeals received during the next term, for a prior term's cancellation, will be deemed to have missed the deadline and may not be considered. Student Cancellation of Schedule A student may cancel registration during the first four days of classes for a semester or Summer session by dropping all classes via their online student portal or submitting a written request to the Office of the University Registrar, Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 69 A3900 University Center , or to Withdrawal Services, A4300 University Center . Notification may also be sent from the student's official e-mail ac - count to Office of the University Registrar at registrar@fsu.edu . Beyond the fourth day of classes, a student cannot voluntarily cancel registration but must apply for withdrawal from the University. Students who cancel their regis - tration within the first four days are not liable for tuition; if tuition has been paid, such students should request a full refund of fees. Graduate, law, and medical students who cancel their registration and are not enrolled for the following term (non-enrollment for two consecutive terms) must apply for readmission . International students who wish to cancel their registration must request and receive prior authorization from a Center for Global Engagement advisor. Note: Students who have received some or all of their financial aid prior to the end of drop/add for a term, may be subject to repayment of financial aid if there is a change in their financial aid eligibility. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, reduction of course load below required levels, cancella - tion of schedule, failure to meet satisfactory academic progress requirements, and other conditions required to maintain financial aid eligibility. Cancellation of Student Health Insurance Cancellation of a student's full class schedule does not trigger the termi - nation of the insurance policy or the premium. The student must contact the Health Compliance Office of University Health Services via e-mail at health - compliance@fsu.edu to advise of the cancellation of schedule and request termination of the insurance. If the student has attended the first thirty-one calendar days of classes for the term for which coverage was purchased, the student has met the eligibility requirement to retain the coverage through the termination date and the cost of the insurance premium must be paid. Students leaving the University to enter the military may receive a prorated premium refund. The student must contact the Health Compliance Office of University Health Services via e-mail at healthcompliance@fsu.edu . Drop/Add or Changes of Schedule During the first four days of classes, individual courses may be added, dropped, or sections of a course changed. Students are financially liable for all courses appearing on their schedule after the fourth day of classes. To add courses after the first four days of classes may require the academic dean's approval. Courses dropped during this period do not appear on the student's transcript. Individual courses may be dropped through the seventh week of classes with the exception of courses involved in allegations of academic dis - honesty; however, tuition charges remain. Approval by the student's academic dean is required to reduce the academic load below twelve semester hours or increase an academic load above fifteen semester hours (to a maximum of twenty-one semester hours). Dean's approval for an overload or underload must be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar. If the student is appointed as a graduate assistant or is supported on a fellowship, an underload request form must be completed and submitted to the Dean of The Graduate School for approval. After the seventh week of classes, courses may be dropped only in excep - tional circumstances. Approval is required by the advisor and the academic dean. Such courses will appear on the student's transcript with the notation \"WD.\" Students who register for courses but who do not attend the classes will receive grades of \"F\" if the courses are not officially dropped. Note: Students who have a bachelor's degree and return for a second bache - lor's degree may petition for a late drop within the same semester timelines as noted above. Auditor Seating Privileges All regularly enrolled students and persons not enrolled in the University are afforded seating privileges after registration on a space-available basis with permission of the instructor, approval of the Office of the University Registrar, payment of the prescribed fee for each course, and presentation of the appropriate form approved by the Office of the University Registrar. Since no credit is allowed for attendance via \"seating privilege,\" formal admission to the University is not required, however, minimal demographical data must be provided as part of the approval and enrollment process. The course(s) taken will not appear on the student's permanent record. Note: The Office of the University Registrar serves as the academic dean for all non-degree students, including those individuals enrolling in courses on an audit basis. Students are cautioned not to preregister for any course they intend to au - dit. They will have to drop the course(s) from their official schedule and will incur additional financial liability. Note: Citizens 60 years of age or older who are Florida residents may attend classes under \"seating privileges\" criteria, and fees are waived except for those courses requiring individual instruction. All individuals auditing courses may register for up to 18 credit hours; enrollment beyond this limit in a single semester is not permitted. Transcripts The Office of the University Registrar issues official transcripts at the re - quest of the student. Individuals needing official transcripts are encouraged to submit their request online at https://my.fsu.edu/ under the \"Academics\" section of Student Central. In cases where a student is unable to submit an online request, a written request may be made directly to the transcript section of the Office of the University Registrar. Transcript service may be denied if a financial or judicial stop has been placed on a student's record. Clearance from the Controller's Office or the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities must be obtained prior to the release of the transcript. Transcript service may also be denied if the request is made by a third party without the student's written consent. A charge of $10.00 will be assessed for each official transcript issued. The University reserves the right to issue transcripts to other state of Florida schools for those students who attend the University under the state transient process. Students are responsible for any transcript fees incurred for providing these transcripts as required by the transient application process. Unofficial transcripts are available to students free of charge. Visit https:// my.fsu.edu/ , click Course Quicklinks and select View Unofficial Transcript . Proof of Enrollment All student enrollment verifications will be by official request only. Students in need of enrollment verification should submit an electronic request by logging into https://my.fsu.edu/ . Select Enrollment Verification. Follow the instructions to obtain your enrollment verification letter. Your letter will be processed the following business day. Written requests may be submitted directly to: Office of the University Registrar Florida State University A3900 University Center 282 Champions Way P.O. Box 3062480 Tallahassee, FL 32306-2480. Former students or outside agencies may request an enrollment verifica - tion or degree verification online from the National Student Clearinghouse at https://nscverifications.org/welcome-to-verification-services/ . Access to Records Students have the right to have access to their student records on file in the Office of the University Registrar. Students requesting access to information in their file, or a third party requesting information in a student's file with the written consent of the student , have the right to a response from the Office of the University Registrar within thirty days. When the record includes informa - tion on more than one student, only the information pertaining to the student making the request will be given. Parental or Third Party Access to Records Students may give a designated parent(s), or other third parties (i.e. sib - ling, spouse, etc.), authority to review their University financial status, grades, transcript, student profile, etc. by logging onto https://my.fsu.edu/ and clicking the Share My Information link. Granting access to a parent or third party to view information in this manner also authorizes University personnel to discuss those records with the designated parent or third party. Students should be aware that parents or third party individuals granted such access may see the selected student academic records, including but not limited to preferred name, gender identity, personal pronouns, classes, grades, billings, etc. Registration During each academic term, an official registration window is established for all currently enrolled, degree-seeking students who expect to enroll for the following term. Graduate students registering for their first term should consult with the departmental/program advisor prior to registering for classes. Registration at Florida State University is conducted by logging in to https://my.fsu.edu/ and choosing \"Enroll in Classes\". Students can register online for all of their courses and can gain access to information concerning their tuition and fees. Please note that by registering, students accept both fee and grade liability. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 70 Registration Guide and Course Schedules Florida State University publishes the Registration Guide. The Registration Guide contains a list of all registration deadlines, fee and payment informa - tion, and important announcements specific to the semester. This information is published online at the Office of the University Registrar Website, at https:// registrar.fsu.edu/ . Lists of course offerings, meeting times, locations, and instructors (when known) are available online through the Class Search . This system is available twenty-four hours a day, year-round. The Class Search is only available for newly admitted and current students through the myFSU portal ( https://my.fsu. edu/). Prospective students and all others may access a PDF listing of courses available on the University Registrar Website through the \"Snapshot of Class Search as a PDF (refreshed weekly)\" link ( https://registrar.fsu.edu/ ). Students are advised to organize their materials and plan their schedule before attempting to register online. Course listings for an upcoming semester will be available one to two weeks prior to the first enrollment appointment for that semester. Students must contact the appropriate departmental office for any clearances or authorization needed. Individual instructors should be con - tacted for courses requiring instructor permission. It is important to take care of any academic or administrative hold (stop) before attempting to register. Registration Responsibility Students are responsible for meeting prerequisites and co-requisites for each course in which they are enrolled. Students who do not meet course prerequisites and co-requisites may be dropped by the academic department. Students are also responsible for any changes made to their schedule without an advisor's approval through the drop/add process. Students may attend and receive credit only for those courses in which they are properly registered. Likewise, students will be held responsible for every course for which they register unless they officially drop the course or cancel registration prior to the published deadlines. Those students who register during late registration (normally the first four days of classes) will be assessed a $100.00 late registration fee. Course/Credit Modification Graduate students who are seeking to modify course credit downward should consult with their supervising committee and academic dean before contacting the unit teaching the course. Course credit may be modified down - ward with the approval of the chair of the department that is offering the course and the appropriate academic dean. No course may be modified upward. Any student wishing to modify credit may obtain the necessary forms in the Office of the University Registrar. Stops to Registration Registration is prevented if all academic and/or administrative require - ments have not been fulfilled prior to the term. A stop may be placed on the student record if one or all of the following deficiencies exist: academic dismissal, incomplete admissions documents, fiscal deficiency, or failure to process readmission papers after a withdrawal or after a two-term absence (including the Summer term) from the University (graduate, law, and medical students). Also, failure to meet specific requirements of a University college, school, or department, or the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, may result in a stop in registration activities or in the release of transcripts and diplomas. A stop is placed on all students who have outstanding charges due to the University. Students owing any fees are not permitted to register for classes. The stop is not removed and such students are not permitted to register until the debt is cleared. Students notified of a stop should contact the notifying office immediately and arrange for removal to be allowed to register for classes, receive official transcripts, and/or receive a diploma. If students with a stop on their records are allowed to register in error, they are considered illegally enrolled in the University. If the stop is not re - moved after notification of such an error, the student's registration is subject to cancellation. Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University- Florida State University Interinstitutional Registration A full-time student at one institution may enroll in one or more courses at the other institution under the following conditions:1. Permission is to be given by the academic dean of the student's home university, 2. Courses taken at the host university should be those normally not offered at the student's home university, 3. Students taking courses at the host university on a satisfactory/ unsatisfactory (S/U) basis will be held to the home institution policies regarding the total number of courses allowed on S/U basis or in a specific degree or major. Students are encouraged to consult their academic advisor about any limitations prior to registration, 4. The final grade obtained by the student shall be reported directly to the student's home university for entering on the student's transcript. Grades, credits, and quality points are treated as home-institution work, 5. All tuition and fees are paid to the home institution, 6. Students must maintain a minimum 3.0 cumulative Florida State University GPA to be eligible to participate in the co-op program. Prior to attempting twelve hours, students who fail to maintain the 3.0 GPA may consider themselves on probation, although no entry will be placed on their transcript, and they may continue to enroll, assuming all other conditions of eligibility are met. After attempting twelve hours, students must meet and maintain the minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA to continue enrolling through the program, 7. To register, see the FAMU-FSU Cooperative Program representative in the Office of the University Registrar. For engineering requirements, see the \"FAMU-FSU College of Engineering\" chapter of this General Bulletin. 8. Before students can register for classes they must provide proof of immunizations. Immunization compliance requirements are listed at https://uhs.fsu.edu/ . If the immunization document being submitted is the FAMU immunization form, two copies of the form are required. Note: Faculty and full-time students at either institution have equal access to the library facilities at both institutions, Interinstitutional Transient Students This program enables students to take advantage of special resources and/ or programs not available at their home institution. An interinstitutional tran - sient student, by mutual agreement of the appropriate academic authorities in both the sponsoring and hosting institution, will receive a waiver of admission requirements of the host institution and a guarantee of acceptance of earned resident credits by the sponsoring institution except in the case of international credits. An official course-by-course evaluation is required for all academic records from non-U.S. institutions. We recommend the evaluation be done by a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (https://www.naces.org/ ). Interinstitutional transient students must be recommended by their own academic dean, who will initiate a visiting arrangement with the appropriate dean at the host institution. Students will register at the host institution, paying tuition and/or registration fees established by that institution. The approval of one institution does not bind the other to comply. Students from other institutions who wish to take courses at Florida State University should submit an approved Interinstitutional Transient Student ap - plication to the Office of Admissions by the published deadline. (Consult the \"University Calendar\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin for specific applica - tion deadlines.) Students may complete the transient form online at https:// www.floridashines.org/ . Note: Academic rules governing regular students (e.g., fees, drop/add, with - drawal, grading policies) also apply to transient students. Transient students attending Florida State University are, by definition, classified as non-degree seeking students. Faculty Members Seeking Advanced Degree No faculty member in a tenure-earning position (e.g., assistant professor, associate professor, or professor) may work toward an advanced degree at the University. Exceptions are made when the faculty member already holds the terminal degree in their field and wants to pursue either another PhD in a different field or a less advanced degree than the one they hold (e.g., a faculty member holding a PhD may pursue a master's degree). Undergraduate Course Examinations Graduate students enrolled in undergraduate courses are subject to the Undergraduate Course Examination Policy. For more information, refer to the \"Academic Regulations and Procedures\" chapter of the General Bulletin .Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 71 Grading System Definition GradeQuality Points Per Credit Hour Excellent Law A+ 4.25 Excellent A 4.00 A- 3.75 Good B+ 3.25 B 3.00 B- 2.75 Average C+ 2.25 C 2.00 C- 1.75 Poor D+ 1.25 D 1.00 D- 0.75 Failure F 0.00 Honors Medicine HM 4.00 Pass Medicine PM 3.00 Administrative Failure Law AF N/A Administrative Disenrollment LawAD N/A Incomplete I N/A Incomplete Expired IE 0.00 No Grade Received from InstructorNG N/A No Grade Expired GE 0.00 Withdrawn while Passing W N/A Withdrawn with Dean's PermissionWD N/A Examination Credit EC N/A Departmental Examination ED N/A Grade Point Average Florida State University reports three types of grade point averages (GPAs) on the transcript, 1) term (or FSU Cumulative) GPA, 2) transfer credit, 3) combined overall. Quality points are assigned for each semester hour as listed above. In computation of the required grade point average (GPA) for retention and conferral of a degree, the total number of quality points is divided by the total number of semester hours for which letter grades are received. A student will not be allowed additional credit in subsequent attempts unless the course is specifically designated as repeatable to allow additional credit. Repeatable courses may be taken to a maximum number of times or hours as spelled out in the course description. Course enrollment beyond these limits may not be counted towards the student's earned credit hours. Should a student enroll in a non-repeatable course the quality points associated with the subsequent enrollment will be calculated into the FSU cumulative GPA. With the approval of the department, the academic dean, and the Dean of The Graduate School, some graduate coursework taken at Florida State University will be excluded from the student's GPA. Permission for the Florida State University GPA to begin as a new calculation for graduate students shall be granted in the following admission/readmission circumstances: 1. When seven or more years have elapsed since a student was actively enrolled in a graduate degree program at Florida State University; 2. A student has earned a master's/specialist/doctoral degree from Florida State University and is seeking a second master's/specialist/doctorate; or 3. A student has earned a master's/specialist degree from Florida State University and is seeking a doctorate in a different major. Aside from these exceptions, the Florida State University GPA will not be- gin as a new calculation for graduate students in the following circumstances: 4. During any period of time less than seven years in which the student was not actively enrolled in a graduate degree program at Florida State University; or 5. A student has earned a master's/specialist degree from Florida State University and is seeking a doctorate in the same major. 6. A student who transfers from one degree program and/or major to another. All requests for exception to this policy and its specifications must be endorsed by the students' academic dean and submitted to the Dean of The Graduate School for approval. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Course Option With the permission of the major professor or chair of the student's major department, a student may enroll in as many as six semester hours during the master's degree program or up to nine semester hours during the doctoral program on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. A student's registration in a course under the S/U option must be indicated on the proper form to the Office of the University Registrar from the major professor or chair of the student's major department. A student may change to a letter-grade (A, B, C) or S/U basis during the first seven weeks of the Fall/Spring semesters or, in the case of Summer terms, by the prorated deadlines published in the Summer 'Academic Calendar' in the Registration Guide . Please note that some courses are offered for S/U grade only and are not available for a letter grade. Semester hour restrictions as stated above on the S/U option do not apply to courses normally offered on the basis of the S/U grading system, including courses in the College of Law for students of other graduate programs. Such hours are exempt from the total stipulated as permissible in the preceding paragraph. In individual study, thesis, dissertation, recital, supervised research, and internship credit, as well as for courses taken on the S/U option, the assigned grade will be \"S\" (satisfactory) or \"U\" (unsatisfactory). Although course hours with a grade of \"S\" will be credited toward a degree, the \"S\" and \"U\" grades are not used in determining grade averages for admission to candidacy or for conferral of a degree. Incomplete Grade Policy Incomplete (\"I\") grades should be recorded only in exceptional cases when a student, who has completed a substantial portion of the course and who is otherwise passing, is unable to complete a well-defined portion of a course for reasons beyond the student's control. Students in these circumstances must petition the instructor and should be prepared to present documentation that substantiates their case. Incomplete grades should not be granted in order to allow students to do extra coursework in an effort to increase their grade. Even under these circumstances, the authority for determining whether to grant an incomplete rests solely with the instructor. A graduate teaching assis - tant must have approval from a supervising faculty member to grant an incom - plete. One exception to this guideline occurs when an incomplete is applied as a result of allegations of academic dishonesty that have not been resolved by the end of a semester. Deans' offices can often provide guidance to instructors regarding the appropriateness of an incomplete grade in individual cases. In order to assign an incomplete, an instructor is required to indicate on the grade roster the time frame for resolution of the grade and the default grade to be assigned if the student does not complete the remaining academic work. Some departments also require that an incomplete grade be documented with an \"Incomplete Grade Agreement.\" It is the student's responsibility to complete the remaining academic work within the agreed-upon time frame. Under University policy, an incomplete grade automatically reverts to the predetermined default grade at the end of the semester that has been specified by the instructor as the time frame for resolution, unless one of two conditions is met: 1. Upon completion of the agreed-upon work, the instructor submits a grade-change form that replaces the \"I\" with the final grade for the course; 2. The instructor submits a separate \"Incomplete Extension of Time\" form to the Office of the University Registrar before the end of the semester in which the \"I\" is set to expire. In cases where no default grade or instructor-determined expiration semes - ter exists, incomplete grades will expire to an IE (Incomplete Expired) at the end of the next term of enrollment unless the instructor submits a grade change form prior to the official grade posting deadline. An incomplete grade should not be set as the default grade for an existing incomplete. Furthermore, grades are awarded based on progress of work completed during a set semester/term and as such, a graduate student should not receive several semesters of incom - plete grades for thesis, treatise and/or dissertation hours until completion of the defense. No grade changes will be made to default grades or unresolved \"I\" grades after the degree has been granted. Thus, it is critical that an instruc - tor work closely with the student and department staff regarding the clearance of an incomplete grade. Grading Practices At the end of each term, student's grades are made available at https:// my.fsu.edu/ . 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 72 Once a final grade in a course has been reported by the instructor to the Office of the University Registrar, it cannot be changed by the instructor ex - cept in cases of error in recording with permission of the department head and the dean of the college, or as a result of a final determination from a formal grade appeal. The University will not automatically expire \"I\" grades earned prior to Fall 2010 or \"NG\" grades earned for any semester. Students must work with faculty and academic deans to resolve any outstanding \"I\" or \"NG\" grades prior to graduation. Outstanding \"I\" or \"NG\" grades that are not resolved prior to the degree posting will not be changed except in cases of error in recording. Faculty and academic deans reserve the right to expire an \"I\" or \"NG grade to \"IE\" or \"GE\" respectively. These grades are considered final grades and will calculate as an \"F\" in the student's overall GPA. In cases where the \"I\" or \"NG\" grade was earned in a course approved for numeric grades or \"S/U\", the grade will expire to the lowest possible value, generally a 60 or \"U\". Grades of \"I\" are not assigned to any courses if a student withdraws from the University. A grade of \"I\" or \"NG\" in a course that is approved for \"S/U\" or numeric grades will follow the same grading and expiration policy. Grades earned at another institution cannot be used to improve a grade point average or eliminate a quality point deficiency at Florida State University. Grade Changes to Courses Completed Prior to Posted Degree Once a degree has been awarded, all coursework leading to that degree is considered final and not subject to change. Grade changes or withdrawals for coursework that applies to the awarded degree may be considered only in cases of documented University error or in cases where the courses in question are documented as applying to a degree that is still in progress. Courses that are designated as \"shared\" between degree programs, such as those used in combined or joint degree pathways may not be changed unless both degrees are still in progress. Forgiveness Policy Effective Fall 2004, Florida State University discontinued the forgiveness policy for all students. Please refer to the 'Drop /Add or Changes of Schedule' section in this chapter for additional information. Academic Standing and Retention The University reserves the right to exclude at any time a student whose conduct is deemed improper or prejudicial to the interest of the University community or whose academic performance is substandard, regardless of GPA. Students in graduate or professional degree programs, excluding College of Law students and MD candidates in the College of Medicine, whose cu - mulative grade point average for graduate courses (5000 and above) taken at Florida State University falls below 3.0 at the end of a term (not counting courses for which \"S\" or \"U\" grades may be given) will be considered not in good standing by the University and will be placed on academic probation. If a 3.0 cumulative grade point average is not attained by the end of the next full term of enrollment, the student will be placed on academic dismissal. Academic dismissal constitutes a separation of the student from the University for academic reasons. Students on dismissal will not be permitted to register for courses, including registering as a non-degree student. However, at the time of dismissal, the major professor and/or department chair/director may petition the academic dean for consideration of special circumstances that the professor thinks constitute justification for an exception to this regulation, but under no circumstances will a student be allowed more than one additional term of probation after reinstatement. Owing to the differential uses of the designation, \"academic probation\" shall not appear on permanent records of regular graduate students. After one probationary period, however, a student whose average falls within the probationary range will receive automatic dismissal. Statuses of \"academic warning,\" \"probation,\" or \"reinstated from dismissal\" do not specifically prohibit a student from participating in extra - curricular activities unless otherwise specified by University policy, rules, or by-laws governing the activity or organization. Consideration of the academic dismissal takes priority over any readmission application and must be resolved first. Students on dismissal are not eligible for readmission or the readmission appeal process unless they have first been reinstated by the academic dean. The academic dean is the final authority for reinstatement considerations. Students pursuing multiple degrees under different careers (i.e., graduate and undergraduate simultaneously) are subject to the retention standards of the career associated with each degree. Dismissal from one career does not automatically constitute dismissal from the second career when those careers are different (undergraduate and graduate).Dismissal and Reinstatement for Specific Professional Colleges Any program classified as a professional program in the FSU Degree Program Inventory (DPI) can apply to the Graduate Policy Committee (GPC) to be excluded from the general retention or dismissal policy. Retention and dismissal policies of the College of Law are described in Section 13 of the College of Law's Academic Rules, Policies, and Procedures By-laws. The policies for promotion, remediation, probation, and dismissal for the College of Medicine are specified in the College of Medicine's Student Handbook. Continuous Enrollment Continuous enrollment at Florida State University is defined as enroll - ment without an interruption of two or more consecutive semesters (including Summer term). Credits earned at other institutions during any semester while not registered at Florida State University will not constitute continuous enroll - ment at the University. Graduate, law, and medical students who are not enrolled at the University for two or more consecutive semesters (or con - secutive semester and Summer term), and who are not on approved leave of absence, must apply for readmission before resuming their studies . Leave of Absence Under special circumstances, graduate students may apply for a leave of absence from the University for a specific period of up to three consecutive semesters (includes Summer term). The circumstances justifying a leave in - clude, but are not limited to: personal or family medical conditions, call to active military duty, parental leave, death in immediate family, or completion of an off-campus internship. The student must provide appropriate documen - tation and a rationale for the leave request. To apply for a leave of absence, a student must complete the Request for Leave of Absence Form at https://gradschool.fsu.edu and submit it togeth - er with appropriate documentation to the major professor/advisor/Program Director. If the major professor/advisor/Program Director approves the appli - cation, it should then be forwarded to the department head and subsequently to the college's academic dean for consideration. If approved at all of these levels, the college academic dean should notify the Registrar's Office and the Dean of the Graduate School (or designee) of the decision. The college aca - demic dean should also notify the student of the decision (approved or denied). The Registrar's Office will place a notation on the student's record. A student who is denied a request for leave at any step may appeal the decision to the Dean of The Graduate School (or designee). Retroactive Leave of Absence Requests are not permissible nor are Leave of Absences Requests for the se - mester of admission or readmission. A leave of absence is not meant for one semester or term of non-enrollment. An approved leave of absence preserves the student's academic status in his or her degree program, and the time off will not be counted against the time limits for awarding degrees. Consequently, registration is not required during the leave period and the student need not re-apply to the program to return to active status at the end of the approved leave period. A leave may be extended for additional consecutive semesters (includes Summer term). A student should apply for the leave extension no later than four weeks prior to the end of the final semester/term of his or her initial leave to allow time to consider and process the request. Extension of a leave is subject to approval of the program, college, and the Graduate School. The cumulative number of consecutive leave semesters (including summer term) shall not exceed six. The total consecutive or non-consecutive leave time a student is not registered in the program shall not exceed twenty-four months. At the conclusion of the approved leave, a student must enroll at Florida State University and return to active status no later than the start of the next academic semester. Students cannot be on leave during their semester of graduation and must be registered for a minimum of two hours that semester. A student on a leave of absence may terminate the leave at any time prior to the approved ending date. In such cases the student would be immediately subject to the continuous enrollment and registration policies. Students re - turning from a leave of absence of more than one year will be required to disclose any legal or campus disciplinary charges that arose during the leave and provide updated contact and mailing address, residency documentation, and other biographical information as required by the University for reporting and processing purposes. Programs may have more strict leave of absence and registration policies. For example, a program may decide that under no circumstances would it allow a formal leave of absence or a program may choose to only allow a leave of not more than three consecutive semesters. Such policies shall be detailed in the program's graduate student handbook.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 73 While on leave a student will not have access to campus facilities and per - sonnel. This means a student will not have access to labs, libraries, and online resources that require an FSUID. Students on leave cannot remain in student housing. There is no guarantee that financial aid will be continued. Students with financial aid or student loans should confer with the Financial Aid Office and review their loan agreements prior to requesting a leave of absence to ascertain the consequences a leave will have on their loan status. University assistantship and fellowship support will be discontinued for the duration of the leave. Programs are not obligated to reinstate funding support that was provided prior to the leave though they are encouraged to do so if funds are available. Students receiving external support, e.g., an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, should check the terms of the award to determine the impact of being on leave. In-state residency status may be impacted if the student moves out of the State of Florida, and then returns to resume the degree program. Students should seek guidance from the Registrar on the potential impact on in-state residency. International students should check with the Center for Global Engagement to determine if a leave would adversely affect their visa status. Students should also consider other factors that might impact their cir - cumstances upon their return to active status. For example, a major professor might depart the University, or under extreme circumstances a degree program might be suspended or terminated. The University has an obligation to provide a path to completion for enrolled students as well as students on a formally approved leave of absence. Note: If allowed by the student's academic program and University policy, an alternative to taking an official leave could involve reducing the standard course load temporarily because of exceptional personal circumstances. Readmission Please refer to the \"Admissions\" chapter in this Graduate Bulletin for read - mission policies for returning students who have not been dismissed. Withdrawal from the University All graduate, law, or medicine (MD degree) students who wish to leave the University after the close of the drop/add period for a term must formally with - draw. Dropping all classes does not constitute formal withdrawal. Students who do not attend classes and fail to withdraw will be assigned grades of \"F\" for each course. Withdrawal requests are not automatically approved but must be request - ed. Withdrawals are initiated in the withdrawal services section of the Dean of Students department in the University Center. The statement \"Withdrew from the University\" will appear on the transcripts of students who properly withdraw within the first seven weeks of class. Under documented exceptional circumstances (beyond the student's control), as determined by the appropriate academic dean, a student withdrawing from the University may receive \"WD\" grades in all courses taken that term. Students who cancel their enrollment during the first four days of classes for a term are not held liable for tuition and registration fees. Those who have paid are eligible for a full refund. Students who withdraw after the first four days of classes but prior to the end of the fourth week of classes are eligible for a twenty-five percent refund of tuition and registration fees, less the building and capital improvement fees; this deadline is adjusted for shorter Summer terms. Students who withdraw after this deadline are fully liable for fees and are not eligible for a refund, except as provided in policies set forth by the State Board of Education and Florida State University. Students who receive Title IV funds and who decide to withdraw from the University may be re - quired to repay some or all the funds received. A graduate, law, or medicine (MD degree) student wishing to reenter the University for the following two semesters after withdrawal must have the ap - proval of their academic dean on the 'Application for Withdrawal and Reentry' form. For degree-seeking students wishing to reenter the University after two semesters, an application for readmission must be submitted to the Office of Admissions. Formal application must be made to the Office of Admissions by the published deadline. Students who left the University on dismissal must resolve that and be reinstated by the academic dean before any decision can be made on the readmission application. (Consult the \"University Calendar\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin for specific application deadlines.) International students who wish to withdraw must request and receive pri - or authorization from a Center for Global Engagement advisor. For further information on refunds, see the 'Refunds of Fees' section in the \"Financial Information\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Student-athletes who wish to withdraw must receive prior authorization from Student-Athlete Academic Support. Students who are withdrawing and who have purchased student health in - surance through the University should contact the Health Compliance Office at University Health Services for information about their health insurance and whether they are eligible to retain or cancel coverage.Readmission after Multiple Withdrawals When a graduate, law, or medicine (MD degree) student has withdrawn from the University three or more times, subsequent readmission must first be considered by the University Withdrawal/Reinstatement Committee whose charge is to assess the student's capability of making satisfactory progress toward degree. This committee, appointed by the Council of Associate and Assistant Deans, will then make a recommendation to the dean of the stu - dent's college, who will make the final decision in cases where a student's Florida State University GPA is less than twelve quality points deficient. In cases where the student has excessive withdrawals or dismissals, or has a Florida State University GPA that is more than twelve quality points defi - cient, the University Withdrawal Reinstatement Committee will make the final determination. University Withdrawal/Reinstatement Committee and Deadlines for Requesting and Processing Withdrawals Students petitioning for a withdrawal are expected to submit their requests and documentation in a timely fashion following the date the withdrawal is initiated. There are three types of withdrawals (see below). Depending on the type of withdrawal the academic dean may review the withdrawal or it may be required to be submitted to the University Withdrawal/Reinstatement Committee. Students considering a withdrawal should discuss their options with their academic advisor or dean prior to any deadlines. 1. Current term. Students may request a withdrawal for the current term at any point during the term after the official drop/add period. Withdrawals submitted prior to the last day of classes for the same term are considered current term withdrawals. Students should check the Academic Calendar for the date of the last day of classes for the term in question. The academic dean may render decisions to approve or deny withdrawal requests in accordance with University and college policies and procedures. Students are held grade liable for all classes for withdrawals requested after the 7th week of the term. Current term withdrawals may result in a \"WD\" grade appearing on the transcript 2. Retroactive withdrawals initiated within one year (three terms, including the current term and summer): These withdrawals are considered retroactive withdrawals and are reviewed by the academic dean in a fashion similar to current term withdrawals. Students should first meet with their academic dean to determine the steps to petition for a retroactive withdrawal. Students' academic deans may require additional documentation for retroactive withdrawals. The academic dean may render decisions to approve or deny withdrawal requests in accordance with University and college policies and procedures. No petitions will be accepted after the student's degree has posted. 3. Retroactive withdrawal over one year. Withdrawals initiated, but not completed or approved within one year, are only considered by a student's dean's office in extraordinary circumstances. Students should first meet with their academic dean to determine if their request for a withdrawal over one year will be considered and then if so, they should submit any required supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances. The academic dean may render decisions to approve or deny withdrawal requests in accordance with University and college policies and procedures. No petitions will be accepted after the student's degree has posted. If approved, retroactive withdrawals will have \"WD\" grades assigned. The decision of the University Withdrawal/Reinstatement Committee con - stitutes final University action. Medical Course Drop/Withdrawal Medical course drops are generally approved for unforeseeable illnesses or injuries that have interfered with the student's ability to complete specif - ic course(s). Similarly, medical withdrawals (all courses dropped) may be approved for acute, severe illnesses or injuries that incapacitate the student. Chronic conditions generally do not qualify unless the student has been stable for a sustained length of time and then experiences an unexpected change in health status. Students with chronic or recurring health problems should con - sult with their clinicians and carefully assess a realistic class schedule based on their condition and their likelihood of relapses. Courses approved to be dropped or withdrawn under these circumstances may be noted on the tran - script with \"WD\" grades. Note: For information regarding medical course drops and medical withdraw - als, visit https://dsst.fsu.edu/ or call the Office of Withdrawal Services at (850) 644-1741 . 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Academic Regulations and Procedures 74 Guidelines for Field Placement Fitness These guidelines apply to all student field placements, including intern - ships, practicum experiences, and student teaching. The University has the authority to determine both the fitness of its students to be placed in field placements and the suitability of particular field placement sites. The academ - ic judgment of qualified faculty, on issues relevant to the professional require - ments of a given field, is critical to this process. Students may either be denied a field placement or removed from a place - ment on the basis of the academic judgment of qualified faculty. Students have the right to be informed of the academic and non-academic requirements for obtaining a field placement early in their majors. They also have the right, except in emergency cases, to receive notice of their deficiencies and an op - portunity to correct those deficiencies prior to a final decision. Students should consult the information provided by each specific college, department, or aca - demic program of interest for more detailed information. FloridaShines Information All current and prospective students of higher education in the state of Florida may access the FloridaShines Website. By logging on to https://www. floridashines.org/ you can perform a variety of tasks, including the following: View a map indicating the location of every participating college or university Search course catalogs from all public and many private Florida colleges and universities Get questions answered about financial aid Plan your course of study and compare majors and degree requirements Get a copy of your unofficial transcript Investigate career options through your institution's career center Find out general information about every participating college or university in the program. Each FSU student may use their University FSUID and password to log on to the FloridaShines Website. Supervised Research and Teaching Students may be granted credit for supervised research and supervised teaching at the option of their department. A student may register for such ac - tivity in more than one term, using the same numbers and, again at the option of the department, may count the hours in meeting residency requirements for the degree program. No more than three semester hours of supervised research credit and three semester hours of supervised teaching credit may be counted toward the master's degree. The limit for candidates for doctoral degrees is five semester hours in each category. Credit for Short Courses Short courses are offerings that are not regular curricular offerings. Credit will not be given for any short course or for similar program in excess of the equivalent of one credit hour for each week of the program, provided that each week contains the equivalent of fifteen contact hours. In no case shall credit be given for any short course or institute or similar program having a duration of less than two full weeks. Individual Study Courses A student registered for an individual study course must attend at least one conference a week on the campus. Directed individual studies are not permitted during an intersession period. The graduate-level directed individual study (DIS) is for S/U or letter-grade credit at the discretion of the department. Transfer Credit The University accepts transfer credit from all nationally accredited in - stitutions (or comparable institutions with certain limitations depending on the type of degree being pursued. See the \"Graduate Degree Requirements\" section of the Graduate Bulletin for details. Changing of Major Department Admission to graduate study is contingent on approval by the department in which the student proposes to major. Therefore, an enrolled student is not free to change major departments at will. A change must have the approval of the chair of the department into which the student proposes to transfer and of the academic dean of that department. The appropriate signed documentation should be forwarded to the Office of the University Registrar.Degree-Seeking Status at Two Separate Institutions Under certain circumstances students may wish to pursue degrees at Florida State University and another institution simultaneously. In all cases students in this situation must consult their Florida State University academ - ic advisor and academic dean to request approval in advance. If approval is granted, students may enroll at Florida State University and another institution under the following conditions: 1. Students are responsible for complying with all rules, regulations and policies of both institutions, including but not limited to: admission standards; academic rules; residency; fees; graduation requirements; university, college and departmental deadlines; and student codes of conduct. Florida State University is under no obligation to waive or otherwise modify any policies, requirements, or deadlines to facilitate the student's enrollment at another institution. 2. Enrollment certification and degree verification issued by Florida State University will be based solely on current registration hours with Florida State University and any awards, honors, or degrees posted by Florida State University. The University will not combine enrollment or degree verification with another institution. 3. Students receiving financial aid must designate one institution as the primary institution for financial aid distribution. The primary institution will be responsible for monitoring awards and delivery of financial aid. Florida State University will not combine enrollment hours with another institution for financial aid purposes. 4. Students who are planning to transfer courses to Florida State University should seek advising in advance of doing so. The University limits the number of transfer hours a student may bring in depending on the type of degree and program. Hours used to satisfy a previous degree, either at Florida State or another institution, cannot be counted toward the current degree the student is pursuing. Note: Different conditions, rules, and policies may apply in the event that Florida State University has an approved consortial or cooperative agreement with the second institution. Students should be aware that approval by Florida State University to pursue degrees at Florida State and another institution in no way binds the other institution to a similar approval. Students are encouraged to consult with the second institution about its policies before enrolling in any courses. Official E-mail Accounts for All Students at Florida State University The official method of communication at Florida State University is your FSU e-mail account. In order to stay informed and aware, you are required to set up and maintain your account and check it regularly. If you choose to have your official FSU account forwarded to another e-mail account, you are still held responsible for all information distributed by the University to your FSU account.

Address updates may be done online at https:// my.fsu.edu/ by clicking on the address link under the \"Personal Information\" section of the Student Center or in person at the Office of the University Registrar, 3900 University Center A . Students are strongly encouraged to pro - vide emergency text numbers and contact information.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 75 GRADUATE DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS Prerequisites for All Graduate Degrees Graduate work in any department must be preceded by sufficient under - graduate work in the field or a related one to satisfy the chair of the department that the student can successfully conduct graduate work in the chosen field. A student is expected to have sufficient command of the English language to enable the student to organize subject matter and to present it in credible written form. Any faculty member may at any time refer a student to the Reading/Writing Center of the Department of English for noncredit remedial work. Editing Services and Statistical Assistance The following guidelines have been approved by the graduate policy committee: 1. University regulations are quite clear concerning plagiarism and inappropriate assistance; these regulations apply with particular force to theses and dissertations: \"...violations of the Academic Honor Policy shall include representing another's work or any part thereof, be it published or unpublished, as one's own\" - Office of Faculty Development and Advancement Website, Faculty Handbook. Appendix A: Florida State University Academic Honor Policy; 2. The ready availability of editing services and statistical assistance, and in particular of computer and statistical research design assistance, must not be seen as a substitute for required training and/or coursework; 3. Professional editing services may not become a substitute for faculty advisement and should be confined to language structure; 4. The major professor must be informed and concur before a student seeks assistance in any or all of the editing or statistical assistance areas, and faculty concurrence should be documented as part of the student's record. The particular scholarly work in question should be reviewed prior to such assistance, so that issues of scholarly form and content have been dealt with in advance of the use of such services. The student must confer with the major advisor before incorporating any advice obtained through the above-mentioned services into written work; 5. In all cases, such assistance must be noted in the acknowledgments accompanying the final version of a paper, thesis, or dissertation. Review of Theses, Dissertations, and Treatises Theses, treatises, and dissertations are expected to reflect original work. The review of academic integrity should be completed prior to the defense. Faculty may choose to use appropriate plagiarism checkers and peer review tools with early drafts of these manuscripts as an instructional aid in advis - ing students on matters relating to plagiarism. The approvals of all committee members appearing on the online Manuscript Signature Form constitute testi - mony from the committee that they are satisfied that the thesis, dissertation, or treatise meets FSU's standards of academic integrity as described in the FSU Academic Honor Code and appropriate steps have been taken to assure that this is the case. Language of Theses, Dissertations, and Treatises The typical language of the dissertation, treatise, or thesis is English. Under special circumstances the Major Professor, the Academic Unit Head, and the Supervisory Committee may approve writing the body of the the - sis/dissertation in a language other than English if doing so is essential for scholarly reasons. Lack of sufficient English competency is not an acceptable justification for using an alternative language. The Major Professor shall im - mediately notify the Dean of the College and the Dean of the Graduate School for all cases where such approval has been granted. Notification requires com - pletion of the ETD Alternative Language for the Dissertation/Treatise/Thesis Form. All committee members must be completely proficient in the alternative language. It is the responsibility of the Major Professor and the Supervisory Committee to ascertain that the candidate's thesis/dissertation is written in ac - ceptable English or an alternative language, in an appropriate scholarly style. All non-English-language dissertations, treatises, or theses must have the pre - liminary pages and main section headings in English. This would include the content of the title page, committee page, acknowledgments, abstract and bi - ographical sketch. All main section headings, including chapter and appendix headings, must be in English, but chapter/appendix titles may be in the chosen language.Language of the defense The defense shall be conducted in English. Graduate Students Enrolled for Two Degrees Simultaneously Under certain special circumstances it is possible for a student to work concurrently on two degrees in two different departments. Students intending to do this must be accepted by both departments. A Dual Enrollment Request Form showing endorsement by both department heads and dean(s), as appro - priate, must be sent to the Dean of The Graduate School for approval. Once approved, the Office of the University Registrar will be notified of the dual registration. Dual Enrollment Request Forms must be submitted for review/ approval at the correct time to ensure proper advisement, prior to the graduate student completing 12 hours in the second degree program and before the student has reached the final semester and applied for graduation so there are no delays in graduation clearance. Note: Initial admission to a graduate program at Florida State University must be to one program only. After the first semester, the student may apply and be accepted to the second degree program desired. Second Graduate Degrees University policy prohibits the awarding of more than one degree from a specific degree program due to the overlap of core requirements of that degree program. Students should seek guidance from their advisors or their college when choosing to pursue a dual degree. This policy applies to both current and readmitted students. Combined Bachelor's/Master's Pathways, Joint Graduate Pathways, and Dual Degrees If a student is effectively removed from a combined pathway or joint pathway, then there will be no sharing or double-counting of credit hours. Any graduate coursework previously taken and shared/double-counted will no longer apply. Combined Bachelor's/Master's Pathways . Combined bachelor's/master's pathways provide academically talented undergraduate students an opportu - nity to complete both a bachelor's and a master's degree. Upon approval, a combined bachelor's/master's pathway allows for up to 12 graduate hours to be shared with, or double-counted toward, an undergraduate degree program. Joint Graduate Pathways . Joint graduate pathways provide qualified mas - ter's students with an opportunity to earn two master's degrees or master's/ professional degrees from two academic degree programs. Joint graduate pathways share academic content that allows a student to expand their breadth of knowledge and content expertise to include additional domains not covered in a single degree. All post-baccalaureate degree programs must have at least 30 unique hours of coursework. Upon approval, joint graduate pathways allow graduate/professional courses in excess of the 30-hour minimum to be shared with, or double-counted, toward both degree programs. Dual Degree Programs Dual degrees are two degrees earned simultaneously when a student is ac - cepted by both departments/programs and is approved by the appropriate aca - demic deans and the Dean of The Graduate School. A student must be admit - ted to one academic program initially, and after the first semester, may apply and be accepted to the second degree program. There is no formal relationship between the two degree program requirements in a dual degree situation. To ensure that students entering a second graduate degree program re - ceive timely and effective advisement on a program of study approved by the second department, admission to the second graduate degree program must be approved before the student completes more than twelve credit hours of coursework that are counted in that department toward the second graduate degree. In special circumstances, students may petition their academic deans for an exception. This limit of twelve credits earned only applies to students admitted to their first graduate degree program in the Fall 2014 semester and onwards. Dual Enrollment Request Forms must be submitted for review/approval at the correct time to ensure proper advisement, prior to the graduate student completing 12 hours in the second degree program and before the student has reached the final semester and applied for graduation so there are no delays in graduation clearance. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 76 Graduate Level Certificate Programs The university offers a variety of certificate programs, which consist of an organized curriculum of courses that lead to specific educational or occupa - tional goals. A list of all of the certificate programs offered by the university is available in the Academic Degree and Certificate Programs chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . These programs are generally considered professional in nature and the completion of these programs are noted on the student's official university transcript, if the following conditions are met: 1. The student must apply and be admitted into the certificate program in order to be officially recognized as pursuing the program by the university. a. Some certificate programs may be restricted by degree level or offered only to degree-seeking students, while others are open to all enrolled graduate and post-baccalaureate non-degree students. b. The admissions criteria may include previous educational background, grade point average, or other qualifications. c. For formal admission requirements and procedures, students should contact the department offering the certificate program. 2. The student must apply to the certificate program prior to completing the second course in the program. a. Completing the certification program coursework without proper admission to the program could jeopardize future enrollment opportunities in certificate program courses or the recognition of the completion of the certificate program by the university. b. Once the student has been admitted to the certificate program, the department will notify the Registrar's Office so it is reflected on the student's official academic record. c. Once the student has completed the last course required for the certificate program, the department will notify the Registrar's Office and the certificate will be posted to the student's official transcript. In the event that the student completes a degree program prior to complet - ing the requirements for the certificate, the student would be required to be readmitted as a degree seeking or non-degree seeking student to complete the certificate program. Note: Students completing an undergraduate degree may not enter a graduate certificate program unless they are admitted as a degree-seeking graduate stu - dent or post-baccalaureate non-degree student. Undergraduate students cannot start taking graduate courses for the graduate certificate until the bachelor's degree is awarded. Master's Degree Programs Degrees Offered The University confers at the master's level the Juris Master (JM), Master of Law Letters (LLM), Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MS), Master of Accounting (MAcc), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Engineering (MEng), Master of Fine Arts (MFA), Master of Music (MM), Master of Music Education (MME), Master of Public Administration (MPA), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Science in Planning (MSP), Master of Social Work (MSW), Specialist in Education (EdS), Professional Science Master (PSM), and Specialist (SPE) degrees. The minimum requirements stated below govern all of these degrees ex - cept the EdS, the PSM, the SPE, and the MFA degrees. Individual departments may have additional or specific requirements over and above those stated here. Consult the appropriate departmental section of this Graduate Bulletin for details. Types of Programs There are three types of programs by which a student may secure a mas - ter's degree: thesis, coursework-only, and project. It is optional with any de - partment whether it requires all majors to proceed under one or the other type, or whether it permits individual students to choose between them. For specific information, consult the appropriate departmental section of this Graduate Bulletin . Thesis-Type Master's Program. A thesis-type master's program is focused on research and scholarship, culminating in written output in the form of the thesis. Thesis-type programs usually include graduate coursework in specific content areas, research methods, analysis, and theory. The scope of the thesis is discipline-specific and typically requires more than one semester of inten - sive work. A thesis clearly exceeds the requirements of a typical course paper and follows the traditional model of academic, publishable work (i.e., consists predominantly of written work). The thesis must present original research conducted by the student under the close supervision of the student's faculty supervisory committee. To qualify for a master's degree under a thesis program, the student must complete a minimum of thirty semester hours of credit including thesis credit. At least eighteen of these hours must be taken on a letter-grade basis (A, B, C). The minimum number of thesis hours for completion of a master's degree shall be six hours. Theses can only be completed by students in a thesis-type program and require two course codes: one for thesis credit hours and one for thesis de - fense. Graduate students pursuing a thesis-type program must adhere to all committee composition requirements set by the university and their academic unit. Additionally, students in a thesis-type program must electronically sub - mit their manuscript to The Graduate School for format review and adhere to all manuscript clearance deadlines. Coursework-Only Program. A coursework-only master's program may in - clude capstone options such as comprehensive exams, graduate-level intern - ships, or cumulative projects (written or creative). Coursework-only programs are not required to include one of these capstone options by the university. These capstone options exceed the scope of a typical course assignment but are smaller in scope than master's thesis or project-track. Typically, capstone experiences are completed at the end of the program under the supervision of one faculty member while students are registered for a capstone-type course. Each unit may choose its own nomenclature for the capstone option (including but not experience,\" or \"comprehensive project\"), as as the terminology does not include the word \"thesis\" and is distinct from terminology chosen for the project programs within that unit. To qualify for a coursework-only master's degree, the student must complete a minimum of thirty semester hours of credit. At least twenty-one of these hours must be taken on a letter-grade basis (A, B, C). In a course - work-only master's program, graduate students complete a degree broadly sampling discipline-specific and/or interdisciplinary content courses, theories, and methods. Capstone options can only be completed by students in a coursework-only program and require one course code for the course during which the cap - stone experience is completed. The capstone option may take any format and students are not required to submit evidence of the completed work to The Graduate School, only to their unit. Any capstone option is subject to unit requirements, but not subject to university rules regarding committee compo - sition, manuscript formatting, or manuscript deadlines. Project Master's Program. A project master's program is primarily focused on creative achievement and activity culminating in a terminal project dis - tinguished by its predominantly non-written output. While project master's programs include graduate coursework in specific content areas, the emphasis is on applied and/or creative activity, interpretation, and theory. The project in a project master's program does not follow the traditional model of academic, publishable work and does not need to be limited to writing. There may or may not be a written component included in the project (e.g., students may do both a performance and written assignment), but the majority of the work should be in a format other than written. The project may take a variety of spe - cialized interactive formats, including but not limited to: audio/digital (e.g., film, video, photography, or static image), performance (e.g., dance, theater, music), or art (e.g., exhibit). The scope of the project is discipline-specific and typically requires more than one semester of intensive work and exceeds the requirements for a typical course project/assignment. The project must present an original artistic and/or professional endeavor produced by the student under the close supervision of the student's faculty supervisory committee. Each unit may choose its own nomenclature for the project (including but not limited to: \"creative project,\" etc.), as long as the terminology does not include the word \"thesis\" and is distinct from terminology chosen for the coursework-only pro - gram within that unit. To qualify for a master's degree in a project program, the student must complete a minimum of thirty semester hours of credit. At least twenty-one of these hours must be taken on a letter-grade basis (A, B, C). The minimum number of project hours for completion of a project master's program shall be six hours. Projects in lieu of thesis being completed by students in a project master's program require two course codes: one for project credit hours (or unit-specif - ic nomenclature) and one for project defense (or unit-specific nomenclature). Additionally, graduate students completing a project master's program are re - quired to submit a record of their output (e.g., copy of digital file, photographs of an exhibit, footage from a performance, etc.) to The Graduate School in electronic format for storing and cataloging.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 77 Requirements at the Master's Level At the master's level students are expected to demonstrate an understanding and make sense of the core knowledge needed to function in their professional field. Master's level students are expected to demonstrate an understanding of the research process, and/or creative or problem-solving activity or application of the knowledge appropriate to their discipline. The student is held responsi - ble for meeting the requirements listed below. Standardized (Advanced and Achievement) Tests Certain departments require the area or advanced tests of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) or other standardized achievement tests. These tests should be taken no later than during the first term of residence in graduate study. Consult the chair of the major department for details. Transfer Credit Transfer of graduate courses not counted toward a previous degree from another regionally accredited U.S. graduate school (or comparable interna - tional institution) is limited to six semester hours, and transfer of graduate courses not counted toward a previous degree within Florida State University is limited to twelve semester hours, except when the departmental course re - quirement exceeds the thirty hour University-wide minimum requirement. In the latter case, additional transfer credit may be allowed to the extent of the additional required hours. In all cases, the majority of credit must be earned through Florida State University or its official consortial institutions. All trans - fer credit must: l) be recommended by the major department; 2) be evaluat - ed as graduate work by the Records Audit and Analysis in the Office of the University Registrar at Florida State University; and 3) have been completed with grades of 3.0 (\"B\") or better. Grades earned at another institution cannot be used to improve a grade point average or eliminate a quality point deficiency at Florida State University. The University does not accept experiential learning or award credit for ex - periential learning. Transfer credit based on experiential learning from another institution will not be accepted. General Course Requirements The distribution of hours among 4000-, 5000-, and 6000- level courses and above is determined by the college or school of the student's major de - partment. Only courses numbered 5000 and above are normally to be taken by graduate students. A graduate student's directive committee or department may, however, permit the student to take specified 4000 level courses in the degree program. Such 4000 level courses may be credited toward a graduate degree but cannot count in a student's minimum thirty total semester hours of graduate credit or graduate GPA. Language Requirements There is no University-wide foreign language requirement for the master's degree, except for the Master of Arts (MA) degree. Each department sets its own language requirements. Residence Requirements There is no University-wide residence requirement for the master's degree beyond that implicit in the limitation upon transfer credit, the recency of work requirement, and the full-time student load requirement. Master's candidates are advised that some programs and departments may impose a stricter rule as required by the specific program of study. Recency of Work The work for the master's degree must be completed within seven years from the time the student first registers for graduate credit. Any graduate work transferred from another institution must have commenced not more than sev - en years prior to completion of the degree for the credits to be applicable to the master's degree. If the master's degree is not completed within seven years from the time the student first registers for graduate credit, and the pro - gram and/or Department Chair does not choose to approve an Extension of Time (EOT), then the student may no longer be enrolled in that program or at Florida State University. Program of Study As early as possible during the first term of graduate work, students should prepare a program of courses with the help of their major professor or super - visory committee. This program must be approved by the major professor and the chair of the major department. A copy of the approved program is to be kept on file in the department. Major Professors At the earliest opportunity, the student should follow the convention of the major department or college to identify the major professor, who will serve as the student's advisor and supervisor. If nine or more semester hours of work are taken in any department other than the major one, these hours may be considered a minor if so desired by the student and by the major department. Designation of the major professor requires the mutual consent of the student, department chair, and professor involved. Supervisory Committee A master's degree supervisory committee must be designated for all thesis students and may be designated for non-thesis or project master's students at the option of the department. The supervisory committee must consist of a minimum of three members of the faculty who have Graduate Faculty Status, one of whom is designated as the major professor. All additional members of the committee must hold Graduate Faculty Status or (in the case of specialized or non-tenure track faculty) co-doctoral or co-master's Directive Status. Under special circumstances, persons external to the University may be appointed as Courtesy Faculty with co-doctoral or co-master's Directive Status and serve on a student's supervisory committee as an additional member or co-chair. The department or college must enter the composition of the supervisory com - mittee into the online Graduate Student Tracking system in a timely manner, but no later than the second week of classes in the semester that the student intends to defend. Only official members of the supervisory committee (i.e., those listed on a student's committee in the Graduate Student Tracking/GST database) may vote and sign the online Manuscript Signature Form indicating approval of the thesis. A supervisory committee's judgments on the quality of a student's thesis or dissertation should be independent, unbiased, and based solely on the academ - ic merits of the work before them. Any other standard risks a breach of pro - fessional ethics or law and undermines the integrity of the process and those involved. Any personal, professional, or financial relationships (e.g. involving the major professor, supervisory committee members, and/or student) that may create the perception of bias in that process must be avoided. Immediate family members, domestic partners and married couples are restricted from serving together on the same supervisory committee in any capacity as this could potentially lead to a perception of bias. For the purposes of this policy, immediate family members are defined as a parent, grandparent, spouse, sib - ling, child or grandchild by blood, adoption or marriage. Exception requests for extenuating circumstances can be submitted by the unit's academic dean to the Dean of The Graduate School for consideration. However, for doctor - al supervisory committees, under no circumstances can a Committee Chair (or Co-Chair) and University Representative be immediate family members, domestic partners, or a married couple. The University Representative must be drawn from outside the student's department (as well as outside the stu - dent's degree program for interdisciplinary programs) must be a fully-tenured member of the faculty with Graduate Faculty Status (GFS) and should be free of conflicts of interest with other members of the supervisory committee. Financial conflicts of interest would not include the typical practice of hiring a student on a university assistantship in the home unit but would include the student being hired by the major professor's private company. If any such conflict of interest exists, it should be reported by the depart - ment chair to the academic dean's office of the student's academic unit, who will evaluate the situation for potential harm and take appropriate action. If questions or irregularities arise that cannot be resolved within the academic unit, the dean's office should contact the Dean of The Graduate School or designee for resolution by submitting an exception request to The Graduate School. Prospectus A thesis-type program may require preparation and submission of a pro - spectus to the student's major professor, supervisory committee, and depart - mental chair for approval. Students are reminded to seek Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval prior to commencing any research involving human or animal subjects. The stu - dent's name must appear on the IRB approval and/or application form as a PI or associate/co-investigator for the period of time when the student's research was conducted. Students must be listed on an ACUC protocol in order to con - duct any animal research. Failure to be listed or obtain the required approvals may result in the thesis being permanently embargoed and unpublishable in any form, and the student may not be allowed to graduate. Thesis The subject of the thesis must be within the major field and must reveal in - dependent investigation and knowledge of the methods of scholarship. It is the responsibility of the major professor to supervise the preparation of the pro - spectus and the thesis. The manuscript must be prepared according to the style and form prescribed by the department and must conform to the University requirements regarding format. A student who enrolls in thesis hours need not be enrolled continuously thereafter in thesis hours if they meet the minimum University requirement for full-time or part-time enrollment through other coursework. A student must be enrolled in a minimum of two thesis hours in the semester of graduation. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 78 The minimum number of thesis hours required for the master's degree is six. Those with underload permission must register for at least two credit hours of thesis per semester. Underloads must be approved by the student's academic dean. Before registering for thesis hours, the student must consult the major professor as to the proportion of time to be devoted to thesis work. Before writing the thesis, the student should become familiar with the University's manuscript formatting and clearance requirements. The thesis should be in the hands of the major professor and the examining committee at least two weeks before the date of the oral examination. At the same time, the thesis should be submitted electronically to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School so that the clearance advisor can provide the student with a critique of the manuscript with respect to The Graduate School's for - matting requirements. Electronic submission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's website under Thesis, Treatise and Dissertation. At least two weeks prior to the date of the examination, the student will submit an announcement of the thesis title, date, and place of the examination to The Graduate School. The announcement must be submitted electronically on The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal and will be posted on the Defense Calendar on The Graduate School's Website. Electronic submis - sion instructions can be found on The Graduate School's website under Thesis, Treatise, and Dissertation. After approval by the oral examining committee, which includes or may be the same as the supervisory committee, the student should electronically submit the final version of the thesis to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor. The post-defense, final content-approved version of the thesis must be submitted electronically to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School within sixty days of the defense date or by the semester deadline (whichever is earliest). If the appropriate deadline is missed, the student must be re-exam - ined. Consult the Registration Guide for the manuscript submittal and forms deadline dates. As a condition of undertaking a thesis master's program, the student agrees that the completed thesis will be archived in the University Libraries system. The student will make the electronic thesis available for review by other schol - ars and the general public by selecting an access condition provided by The Graduate School. The electronic thesis also will be archived by ProQuest; the student will select an access condition that concurs with the access condition in the University Libraries system. If the student wishes ProQuest to register the copyright, an additional fee must be paid. Publication of the thesis through standard media for scholarly work is encouraged. Examination in Defense of Thesis The defense of the thesis will be oral. Responsibility for suggesting the time, designating the place, and presiding at the examination rests with the major professor. It is recommended that students defend no later than the eighth week of classes in the semester of intent to graduate. Students must meet all manuscript and online forms deadlines set by The Graduate School in the semester of graduation. Consult the Registration Guide for the manuscript submittal and online forms deadline dates. Academic courtesy requires that the thesis be submitted to each member of the supervisory committee at least two weeks before the date of the oral exam - ination. At the same time, the thesis should be submitted electronically to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School so that the clearance advisor can provide the student with a critique of the manuscript with respect to The Graduate School's formatting requirements. The supervisory committee, the chair of the major department, and such other members of the faculty as may be appointed by the academic dean will conduct the examination. All members of the graduate faculty are invited to attend. At least two weeks prior to the date of the examination, the student will submit an announcement of the thesis title, date, and place of the examination to The Graduate School. The announcement must be submitted electronically on The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal and will be posted on the Defense Calendar on The Graduate School's Website. Electronic sub - mission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's Website under Thesis, Treatise, and Dissertation. All committee members and the student must attend the entire defense in real time, either by being physically present or participating via distance tech - nology. Individual departments may impose stricter requirements on physical attendance, e.g. all members must be physically present. Departments and other degree-granting programs must publicize their policy on defense atten - dance in their Graduate Student Handbook and in the relevant section of the Graduate Bulletin . If exceptional emergency circumstances, e.g. medical or other emergency situations, prevent the participation of a committee member, then it may be necessary to arrange for an additional appropriately qualified colleague to attend the defense. A minimum of three members with Graduate Faculty Status must participate.The oral examining committee will certify the results of the examina - tion: passed, failed, or to be reexamined. The report of results following a re-examination must indicate the student either passed or failed. To receive a passing grade, the written thesis must be in the final form or require only minor revisions at the time of the defense. A grade of PASS for the defense of thesis requires at least a majority approval of the committee. Individual departments may impose stricter requirements for what constitutes a grade of PASS. Departments and other degree-granting programs must publicize their policy on this issue in their Graduate Student Handbook and in the relevant section of the Graduate Bulletin . If the student passes, each member must sign the online Manuscript Signature Form to substantiate the results of the defense. The degree cannot be awarded until the required forms have been completed on The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal and the final version of the manuscript has been submitted to and approved by the Manuscript Clearance Advisor. After approval by the oral examining committee and completion of the Final Content Approval Form by their major professor(s), the student should electronically submit the final content-approved version of the the - sis to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor. Electronic submission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's website under Thesis, Treatise and Dissertation. The post-defense, final content-approved version of the thesis must be submitted to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School within sixty days after the defense date or by the semester deadline (whichever is earliest). If the appropriate deadline is missed, the student must be re-examined. Consult the Registration Guide for the manuscript submis - sion and forms deadline dates. Comprehensive Examination A comprehensive or other type examination, either written, oral, or both, at the option of the department, may be required for the master's degree. Testing requirements and procedures are established by the major department. Additional Master of Arts (MA) Requirements In addition to the requirements listed above, candidates for the Master of Arts (MA) degree must meet the following requirements: Proficiency in a foreign language demonstrated by certification by the appropriate language department, or completion of twelve semester hours in a foreign language with an average grade of at least 3.0 (\"B\"), or four years of a single language in high school. Six or more semester hours of graduate credit in one or more of the following fields: art; classical language, literature, and civilization; communication (not to include speech correction); languages and linguistics; music; philosophy; religion; and theatre. Doctoral Degree Programs Degrees Offered The University offers the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Doctor of Education (EdD), Doctor of Music (DM), and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) with degrees in several departments of the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, College of Communication and Information, College of Criminology and Criminal Justice, College of Education, FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, College of Fine Arts, College of Human Sciences, College of Music, College of Nursing, College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, College of Social Work, as well as in several interdepartmental and interdivisional areas. See relevant sections of this Graduate Bulletin . Requirements of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree The student is held responsible for meeting the requirements listed below. The PhD is a research degree designed to produce the critical scholar. The degree is granted only to students who: l) have mastered definite fields of knowledge so that they are familiar not only with what has been accomplished in their specific fields but also with the potential and opportunity for further advances; 2) have demonstrated the capacity to do original and independent scholarly investigation or creative work in their selected fields; and 3) have the ability to integrate their selected fields of specialization with the larger domains of knowledge and understanding. Admission Admission in the formal sense is governed by the same minimum standards as stated in the \"Admissions\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . However, a special effort is made by the departments to select and to admit only those who appear clearly qualified for studies at this advanced graduate level.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 79 Diagnostic Examination The student who has been admitted to work toward the doctoral degree may, before the end of the second semester of post-baccalaureate study, be required to take a departmentally administered diagnostic examination. It will be designed to appraise the student's ability to pursue the PhD degree in the field and to facilitate counseling in the development of the student's program of study. The department will notify the Office of the University Registrar if the diagnostic examination is failed and the student's program is to be terminated. Scholarly Engagement The purpose of the Scholarly Engagement requirement is to ensure that doctoral students are active participants in the scholarly community. To meet the Scholarly Engagement requirement, doctoral students should interact with faculty and peers in ways that may include enrolling in courses; attending seminars, symposia, and conferences; engaging in collaborative study and research beyond the university campus; and utilizing the library, laboratories, and other facilities provided by the University. The goal is to prepare students to be scholars who can independently acquire, evaluate, and extend knowl - edge, as well as develop themselves as effective communicators and dissem - inators of knowledge. Each academic unit with a doctoral program should include a program specific statement in its Graduate Handbook describing how its students can meet the Scholarly Engagement requirement. Transfer Credit Transfer of graduate courses not counted toward a previous degree from another regionally accredited graduate school (or comparable international in - stitution) is limited to six semester hours and transfer of graduate courses not counted toward a previous degree within Florida State University is limited to twelve semester hours, except when the departmental course requirement exceeds the thirty hour University-wide minimum requirement. In the latter case, additional transfer credit may be allowed to the extent of the additional required hours. In all cases, the majority of credit must be earned through Florida State University or its official consortial institutions. All transfer credit must: 1) be recommended by the major department; 2) be evaluated as grad - uate work by the Records Audit and Analysis in the Office of the University Registrar at Florida State University; and 3) have been completed with grades of 3.0 (\"B\") or better. Grades earned at another institution cannot be used to improve a grade point average or eliminate a quality point deficiency at Florida State University. The University does not accept experiential learning or award credit for ex - periential learning. Transfer credit based on experiential learning from another institution will not be accepted. Course Requirements The PhD degree represents the attainment of independent and compre - hensive scholarship in a selected field rather than the earning of a specific amount of credit. Individual programs are planned to increase the likelihood that prior to students reaching the preliminary examinations they will have gained sufficient mastery of their field to complete them successfully. Prior to degree conferral, all doctoral students must have completed a minimum of twenty-four credit hours of dissertation. Major Professor Early in the doctoral program, the student should consult with the profes - sors under whom the student may be interested in working and from whose areas of competency a dissertation topic could be selected. The student should request that the selected faculty member serve as major professor. The depart - mental chair will approve the major professor who must be a member of the faculty with Graduate Faculty Status (GFS) and have special competence in the student's proposed area of concentration. The appointment must be mutu - ally agreeable to the student, major professor, and departmental chair. Supervisory Committee Upon the request of the major professor, the departmental chair will ap - point the supervisory committee that will be in charge of the work of the stu - dent until the completion of all requirements for the degree. The supervisory committee will consist of a minimum of four members of the faculty who have Graduate Faculty Status, one of whom is the university representative of the faculty. Programs may establish a more stringent policy on supervisory committee membership, but such policies may not conflict with the University policy. For example, a program may choose to stipulate that more than the minimum number of committee members hold Graduate Faculty Status in the program or must be members of the tenure-track faculty. If deemed desirable and not established by policy, it may also be appropriate to include additional members to provide necessary expertise. All additional members of the com - mittee must hold Graduate Faculty Status or (in the case of specialized or non-tenure track faculty) co-doctoral or co-master's Directive Status. Under special circumstances persons external to the University may be appointed as Courtesy Faculty with co-doctoral or co-master's Directive Status and serve on a student's supervisory committee as either an additional member or co- chair. The department or college must enter the composition of the supervi - sory committee into the online Graduate Student Tracking system in a timely manner, but no later than the second week of classes in the semester that the student intends to defend. Each year, the supervisory committee, the major professor, or the student's advisor prior to selection of a major professor will assess the progress of the student in writing and will make available copies of the annual review to the student, the departmental chair, and the academic dean. The Dean of The Graduate School, the academic dean, and the chair of the major department may attend committee meetings as non - voting members. Only official members of the supervisory committee (i.e., those listed on a student's committee in the Graduate Student Tracking/GST database) may vote and sign the online Manuscript Signature Form indicating approval of the dissertation. A supervisory committee's judgments on the quality of a student's thesis or dissertation should be independent, unbiased, and based solely on the academ - ic merits of the work before them. Any other standard risks a breach of pro - fessional ethics or law and undermines the integrity of the process and those involved. Any personal, professional, or financial relationships (e.g. involving the major professor, supervisory committee members, and/or student) that may create the perception of bias in that process must be avoided. Immediate family members, domestic partners and married couples are restricted from serving together on the same supervisory committee in any capacity as this could potentially lead to a perception of bias. For the purposes of this policy, immediate family members are defined as a parent, grandparent, spouse, sib - ling, child or grandchild by blood, adoption or marriage. Exception requests for extenuating circumstances can be submitted by the unit's academic dean to the Dean of The Graduate School for consideration. However, for doctor - al supervisory committees, under no circumstances can a Committee Chair (or Co-Chair) and University Representative be immediate family members, domestic partners, or a married couple. The University Representative must be drawn from outside the student's department (as well as outside the stu - dent's degree program for interdisciplinary programs) must be a fully-tenured member of the faculty with Graduate Faculty Status (GFS) and should be free of conflicts of interest with other members of the supervisory committee. Financial conflicts of interest would not include the typical practice of hiring a student on a university assistantship in the home unit but would include the student being hired by the major professor's private company. If any such conflict of interest exists, it should be reported by the depart - ment chair to the academic dean's office of the student's academic unit, who will evaluate the situation for potential harm and take appropriate action. If questions or irregularities arise that cannot be resolved within the academic unit, the dean's office should contact the Dean of The Graduate School or designee for resolution by submitting an exception request to The Graduate School. University Representative The University representative is drawn from outside the student's depart - ment, as well as outside the student's degree program for interdisciplinary programs. The University representative must be a tenured member of the faculty with Graduate Faculty status and should be free of conflicts of inter - est with other members of the supervisory committee (see above Supervisory Committee Section). The University representative is responsible for ensuring that the student is treated fairly and equitably in accordance with University, College, and Departmental guidelines and policies, and that decisions made by the supervisory committee reflect the collective judgment of the committee. This responsibility begins with appointment to the supervisory committee and ends with the defense of the dissertation. The University representative should verify that the defense is conducted appropriately, and then submit the online Defense Report to The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal within one week of the defense. Content knowledge in the subject of the dissertation is valuable for the University representative, but not required. In addition, the University representative represents the University's interest and is responsi - ble for ensuring that our doctoral graduates are of high quality. If questions or irregularities arise that cannot be resolved within the college, the University representative should contact the Dean of The Graduate School for resolution. Program of Study As soon as possible, the student, under the supervision of a designated advisor or major professor, should prepare and receive approval of a plan of courses to be taken. This Program of Study must be signed by the faculty ad - visor or major professor and the chair of the major department. A copy of the student's approved Program of Study is to be kept on file in the department. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 80 At the time of the annual review, changes to the plan should be noted and approved. Once designated, the supervisory committee should be included as part of the approval process for any changes to the Program of Study. Language and Statistical Analysis Requirements There are no University-wide foreign language, statistics, or other tool requirements for the PhD degree. Each department prescribes its own requirements. The procedures for testing foreign language proficiency are set by the de - partment prescribing the requirements. The Department of Classics prepares and administers the examinations in Greek and Latin. For departments allow - ing foreign students to use English in satisfaction of language requirements but unwilling to accept satisfactory completion of their departmental courses as sufficient demonstration of language competency, the University's Office of Assessment Services will administer the Educational Testing Services Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) which certifies comparative attain - ment. Foreign students deficient in English may be referred to the Center for Intensive English Studies. The completion of that coursework may be accept - ed as an indication of competency. Examinations for other approved languages are prepared and administered by the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics. The language courses numbered 5060 are service courses designed to pre - pare the student for the language exemption examinations. The student may take these courses as many times as needed. Students will use the 5069 courses to register for the examination. These instruments afford means of continuing access to the materials and literature of research; therefore, the candidate should acquire competency in them early in the doctoral program. Preliminary Examination Satisfactory completion of a preliminary examination shall be required for admission to candidacy for the PhD degree. No student may register for dissertation hours prior to the point in the semester in which the preliminary examination was passed. An admission to candidacy form must be completed and filed in the Office of the University Registrar prior to registration for dis - sertation hours. After completion of the admission to candidacy process, the student may retroactively add dissertation hours for that semester in which the preliminary examination was completed. Retroactive changes are only permit - ted if the preliminary examination is passed by the end of the seventh week of the semester. For term specific deadline dates, please refer to the \"Academic Calendar\" in the Registration Guide . The preliminary examination is designed to test scholarly competence and knowledge and to afford the examiners the basis for constructive recommen - dations concerning the student's subsequent formal or informal study. The form and content of this examination will be determined by the department, college, school, or examining committee (typically, but not necessarily the same composition as the supervisory committee) administering the degree program. Prior to the examination, the student's examining committee will determine whether the student 1) has a 3.0 average, and 2) has progressed sufficiently in the study of the discipline and its research tools to begin inde - pendent research in the area of the proposed dissertation. The chair of the major department, the academic dean, and the Dean of The Graduate School may attend any session of the supervisory or examin - ing committee as nonvoting members. A member may be appointed to the examining committee at the discretion of the academic dean or Dean of The Graduate School or on recommendation of the major professor. Normally, the examining committee will be identical with the supervisory committee. The examining committee will report the outcome of the examination to the academic dean: passed, failed, additional work to be completed, or to be re-examined; the report following the reexamination must indicate the student either passed or failed. The results of the examination will be reported to the Office of the University Registrar for inclusion in the student's permanent record. If a student fails the preliminary examination before being admitted to candidacy, a re-examination may be offered by the student's supervisory com - mittee or other relevant decision-making body within each department or unit, per that department or unit's doctoral student handbook. The Academic Dean's office should be notified of the outcome of any preliminary exam attempt. Students can take the preliminary examination for admission to candidacy only two times. A second failure on the preliminary exam makes the student ineligible to continue in the degree program. The second attempt at the pre - liminary exam shall occur no sooner than six full class weeks after the results of the first attempt are shared with the student. For the purpose of this policy, a \"full class week\" is defined as a week with five days during which classes are held at FSU. Students must be registered separately for their first and sec - ond attempt, if necessary, within the same semester, and must receive either a \"pass\" or a \"fail\" grade for each attempt. An exception request regarding the timing of the re-examination can be submitted for consideration to the Academic Dean's Office by either the stu - dent or the supervisory committee. Students who allege that academic reg - ulations and/or procedures were improperly applied for the re-examination of their preliminary exam may have their grievances addressed through the general academic appeals process. The full preliminary exam policy as listed here must be added to all doctoral student handbooks.\" Time Limit for Completion of Degree Requirements All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within five calendar years from the time the student passes the preliminary examina - tion and is admitted to the candidacy. If the student's major professor and/ or Department Chair does not choose to either approve an Extension of Time (EOT) or require the student to take the preliminary exam and/or coursework again for readmission to candidacy, then the student may no longer be enrolled in that program or at Florida State University. Admission to Candidacy A student who has passed the preliminary examination and has been certi - fied by the Office of the University Registrar (with an admission to candidacy form) is considered a candidate for the doctoral degree and is eligible to reg - ister for dissertation credits. A student must be admitted to candidacy at least six months prior to the granting of the degree. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure a minimal lapse of time for effective work on the dissertation after acquisition of the basic competence and after delineation of the problem and method of attack. More realistically, the student should expect to spend a year or more of work on the dissertation. Prospectus After passing the preliminary examination, the student may be required by the department to submit to the major professor, supervisory committee, and departmental chair a prospectus on a research project suitable for a doc - toral dissertation. Students are reminded to seek Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval prior to commencing any research involving human or animal subjects. The student's name must appear on the IRB approval and/or application form as a PI or as - sociate/co-investigator for the period of time when the student's research was conducted (i.e., data collections and analyses). Students must be listed on an ACUC protocol in order to conduct any animal research. Failure to be listed or obtain the required approvals may result in the dissertation being permanently embargoed and unpublishable in any form. Dissertation A dissertation must be completed on some topic connected with the major field of study. To be acceptable it must be an achievement in original research constituting a significant contribution to knowledge and represent a substantial scholarly effort on the part of the student. It is the responsibility of the major professor to supervise the preparation of the prospectus and the dissertation. The manuscript must be prepared accord - ing to the style and form prescribed by the department and must conform to the University requirements regarding format. Before writing the dissertation, the student should become familiar with the University's manuscript format - ting and clearance requirements. The dissertation should be in the hands of the major professor and the examining committee at least four weeks before the date of the oral examination. At the same time, the dissertation should be submitted electronically to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School so that the clearance advisor can provide the student with a critique of the manuscript with respect to the Graduate School's formatting requirements. Electronic submission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's website under Thesis, Treatise and Dissertation. A student who has completed the required coursework, passed the Preliminary Examination and submitted an Admission to Candidacy form to the Office of the Registrar, and continues to use campus facilities and/or receives faculty supervision, but has not been cleared by the Manuscript Clearance office shall include in the required full-time load a minimum of two credit hours of dissertation per semester, including Summer term, until completion of the degree. A student must be enrolled in a minimum of two hours of dissertation in the semester of graduation. Those with underload per - mission must register for at least two credit hours of dissertation per semes - ter (or term). Underloads must be approved by the student's academic dean. Before registering for dissertation hours, the student must consult the major professor as to the proportion of time to be devoted to dissertation work. Prior to degree conferral, all doctoral students must have completed a min - imum of twenty-four credit hours of dissertation. For more information on the full-time load for doctoral students, see the \"Student Course Load\" section of this Graduate Bulletin .Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 81 For more specific information on final-semester registration, see the sec - tion \"Registration for Final Term.\" As a condition of undertaking a dissertation program, the student agrees that the completed dissertation will be archived in the University Libraries system. The student will make the electronic dissertation available for review by other scholars and the general public by selecting an access condition pro - vided by The Graduate School. Examination in Defense of Dissertation The defense of the dissertation will be oral. Responsibility for suggesting the time, designating the place, and presiding at the examination rests with the major professor. It is recommended that students defend no later than the eighth week of classes in the semester of intent to graduate. Students must meet all manuscript and online forms deadlines set by The Graduate School in the semester of graduation. Consult the Registration Guide for the manuscript submittal and online forms deadline dates. Academic courtesy requires that the dissertation be submitted to each member of the supervisory committee at least four weeks before the date of the oral examination. At the same time, the dissertation should be submitted electronically to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School so that the clearance advisor can provide the student with a critique of the manuscript with respect to The Graduate School's formatting requirements. Electronic submission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's website under Thesis, Treatise and Dissertation. The supervisory committee, the chair of the major department, and such other members of the faculty as may be appointed by the academic dean will conduct the examination. All members of the graduate faculty are invited to attend. At least two weeks prior to the date of the examination, the student will submit an announcement of the dissertation title, date, and place of the exam - ination to The Graduate School. The announcement must be submitted elec - tronically on The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal and will be posted on the Defense Calendar on The Graduate School's Website. Electronic submission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's Website under Thesis, Treatise, and Dissertation. All committee members and the student must attend the entire defense in real time, either by being physically present or participating via distance tech - nology. Individual departments may impose stricter requirements on physical attendance, e.g., all members must be physically present. Departments and other degree-granting programs must publicize their policy on defense atten - dance in their Graduate Student Handbook and in the relevant section of the Graduate Bulletin . If exceptional emergency circumstances, e.g. medical or other emergency situations, prevent the participation of a committee member, then it may be necessary to arrange for an additional appropriately qualified colleague to attend the defense. If the University representative is unable to attend in real-time, then a new, appropriately qualified University representa - tive must be selected to attend the defense. A minimum of four members with Graduate Faculty Status must participate. The oral examining committee will certify the results of the examination: passed, failed, or to be reexamined. The report of results following a re-exam - ination must indicate the student either passed or failed. To receive a passing grade, the written dissertation must be in final form or require only minor revisions at the time of the defense. A grade of PASS for the defense of dis - sertation requires at least a majority approval of the committee. Individual departments may impose stricter requirements for what constitutes a grade of PASS. Departments and other degree-granting programs must publicize their policy on this issue in their Graduate Student Handbook and in the relevant section of the Graduate Bulletin . If the student passes, each member must sign the online Manuscript Signature Form to substantiate the results of the defense. A written critique of the conduct of the examination in defense of the dissertation should be submitted by the University representative from the graduate faculty to The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal within one week after the date of defense. After approval by the oral examining committee and completion of the Final Content Approval Form by their major professor(s), the student should electronically submit the final content-approved version of the dissertation to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor. Electronic submission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's Website under Thesis, Treatise, and Dissertation. The post-defense, final content-approved version of the disserta - tion must be submitted to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School within sixty days after the defense date or by the semester deadline (whichever is earliest). If the appropriate deadline is missed, the student must be re-examined. Consult the Registration Guide for the manuscript submis - sion and forms deadline dates. Publication of Dissertation As a condition of undertaking a PhD program, the student agrees that the completed dissertation will be archived in the University Libraries system. The student will make the electronic dissertation available for review by oth - er scholars and the general public by selecting an access condition provided by The Graduate School. The electronic dissertation will also be archived by ProQuest; the student will select an access condition that concurs with the access condition in the University Libraries system Publication of the dissertation through standard media for scholarly work is encouraged. Guidelines for Restrictions on the Release of Theses, Dissertations, and Treatises The free and open dissemination of the results of research conducted at Florida State University is required if the University is to contribute effec - tively to the education of its students and to the body of human knowledge. Conflicts can develop among the interests of research sponsors, research di - rectors, and the students doing the research. To ensure that the interests of all parties are protected, the following guidelines should be observed. Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) as well as treatises must be made available in their complete and original format. They cannot be subdi - vided into chapters and disseminated under different distribution options. Worldwide Access. Recommended to all of our students. This option makes the ETD freely available worldwide via the FSU ETD Digital Library Repository. It should be noted that some publishers may see a conflict with this level of distribution prior to publication. Embargoed Access ( Twenty-four Months ). Recommended to students who have a patent application in process or who want to restrict access to the ETD for a limited amount of time in order to pursue commercial interests or other publication. After the restricted time period, the document will be made freely available through worldwide access (option above). The maximum delay in the release of a thesis, treatise, or dissertation to the FSU Digital Library Repository and ProQuest shall not exceed twenty-four months from the date the thesis, treatise, or dissertation is approved by The Graduate School. In special circumstance, the Dean of The Graduate School may grant an additional delay of forty-eight months in twenty-four month in - crements, if the case is made that the delay is in the best interest of all parties or if publication or commercial interest in the document is still ongoing. Such a request must be submitted at least one month prior to the expiration of the original period of delay. A request for such a delay must be submitted to the Manuscript Clearance Portal by completing the Embargo Request section of the Manuscript Access Agreement Form. This request must be approved in the Manuscript Clearance Portal by the major professor (or co-major professors, if applicable), the Manuscript Clearance Advisor, and the Dean of The Graduate School. The department or program chair, or dean of the relevant college may endorse the request if the major professor is retired, deceased, etc. It should be recognized that adherence to this policy does not constitute a guarantee that information in the sequestered thesis, treatise, or dissertation will not be disseminated by means other than the written manuscript. Information about particular access issues related to electronic theses, trea - tises, and dissertations may be obtained from The Graduate School. Note: Students should not suffer delays in their normal academic progress, including the final defense of the thesis or dissertation, as a result of a desire to delay release of the thesis or dissertation to the library. The FSU Digital Library Repository, in cooperation with The Graduate School, may provide restricted access to ETDs at FSU (i.e., Campus Community-Only Access). Students may request that full access to their ETD be limited to people connected to FSU's network. Please note that approval for Campus Community-Only Access is not automatic. Students must provide \"reasonable justification\" for their request. Also, in order to be granted Campus Community-Only Access, students must receive approval from their major professor (or co-major professors, if appli - cable) on the online Manuscript Access Agreement Form. Final approval may be granted by the Dean of The Graduate School only after the online Manuscript Access Agreement Form is submitted to The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal with appropriate approvals and justification. This online form is reviewed by the Manuscript Clearance Advisor at The Graduate School before being reviewed by the Dean. Requirements of the Doctor of Education (EdD) Degree The EdD degree is offered by the College of Education, the College of Music, and the College of Fine Arts. Potential candidates for this professional degree are selected on the basis of experience, skills, and goals of the students seeking admission to the programs in which the degree is offered. Such students will ordinarily have had some years of teaching or academic administrative experience and have shown some promise of being able to de - velop their pedagogical or administrative skills through further research and 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 82 training. The College of Education permits, as part of its experience require - ment, the completion of a practicum, undertaken during the period of doctoral studies, in which the student engages in doctoral work-related activities within an external agency. Once the degree has been earned, its possessor should be able to perform the tasks of the profession with a high degree of efficiency. The EdD degree is further distinguished from the PhD degree by the nature of specific training (although there may be a core of studies common to the two curricula) and by that of the dissertation. The training is designed to fit the goals of individual students under the careful guidance of a supervisory committee; since the purpose of the disser - tation is to provide solutions to educational problems as they arise in the field, it shall be designed to deal with methodological or administrative procedures capable of providing such solutions. Students are therefore advised that their programs must include enough methodological inquiry to establish a basis for the procedures used to arrive at their conclusions. In light of the above, the distinction between the EdD and PhD degrees cannot be made solely on the basis of research tool requirements. Depending on the dissertation project proposed, the candidate's supervisory committee may require as much training in such research tools as statistics, foreign lan - guages, computer languages, or other programming techniques as necessary to complete the project. The provisions of this section indicate steps leading to the EdD degree that differ from those leading to the PhD degree. Requirements of the Doctor of Music (DM) Degree The DM degree is offered to a candidate who demonstrates superior ability in music as a composer or performer. A candidate is admitted on the basis of creative aptitude and professional achievement. The degree is awarded to a candidate who has achieved distinction in performance or composition and who completes relevant theoretical and historical studies. The provisions of this section indicate steps leading to the DM degree that differ from those leading to the PhD degree. Additional information pertaining to the DM degree are noted in the \"College of Music\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Requirements of the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Degree Please refer to the \"College of Nursing\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin for the requirements for this degree. Professional Degree Programs The Graduate School oversees all post-bachelor programs with the ex - ceptions as noted in this Graduate Bulletin. The Graduate Policy Committee (GPC) is the governing body for all academic graduate and professional post-bachelor programs regarding general policies, procedures, and qual - ity review. Programs seeking exceptions can apply to the Graduate Policy Committee (GPC). Requirements of the Doctor of Medicine (MD) Degree Candidates for the MD degree must: Be able to fully perform the essential functions in each of the following categories: observation; communication; motor, intellectual, and behavioral/social attributes as described in the College's Technical Standards for the admission and educational processes Successfully complete all required and elective courses and clerkships, Years One through Four Pass the USMLE Step 1, Step 2CK, and Step 2CS Complete all requirements listed in the procedure's log including CME Conference attendance, all listed procedures, ACLS, and BLS Complete all required surveys Be a \"student in good standing\" in the Spring semester of the Fourth Year The Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee reviews the academic record of all fourth-year students in the Spring semester of the Fourth Year and verifies that all requirements have been met by each student. The results are submitted to the Executive Committee for consideration. The Executive Committee certifies the candidates are eligible to receive the Doctor of Medicine Degree. For more information, please refer to the \"College of Medicine\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Transfer Credit In rare cases a student may petition to be accepted to the College of Medicine and transfer credits from another institution. Transfer credits will be considered only for first year or second year courses. Requests for credit will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis and the College of Medicine reserves the right to determine which credits would be accepted. Transfer credit will be limited to a maximum of the equivalent of two years of coursework. Requirements of the Juris Doctor (JD) Degree The Juris Doctor (JD) degree is awarded by the College of Law to stu - dents who have satisfactorily completed coursework and related requirements equivalent to three academic years of full-time enrollment. Potential candidates for this professional degree are selected on the basis of Law School Admission Test (LSAT) scores, undergraduate grades, letters of recommendation, and goals of the students seeking admission, as commu - nicated by personal statements. Successful completion of a bachelor's degree program at a regionally accredited institution is a prerequisite for law school admission. The legal curriculum is designed to fit the goal of providing students with the professional skills and core knowledge necessary to engage in le - gal or law-related careers, while complying with standards prescribed by the American Bar Association and the Florida Bar. The first-year curriculum is comprised entirely of required courses in core subjects and the second- and third-year curricula are primarily comprised of elective courses. Apart from the first-year curriculum, graduation requirements include coursework related to professional responsibility, upper-level legal writing and skills training, as well as pro bono service. For more information, please refer to the \"College of Law\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Transfer Credit Students must complete a minimum of forty-five credit hours of approved course work from the Florida State University College of Law. This require - ment may not be satisfied by credit earned under the auspices of another law school or through graduate-level courses at Florida State University or Florida A&M University. Generally, transfer credit is limited to the first year of Law School, the equivalent of twenty-four credit hours. Continuance and Graduation of Master's and Doctoral Students Academic Standards A graduate student is not eligible for conferral of a degree unless the cumu - lative grade point average is at least 3.0 in formal graduate courses (5000-level or above). 4000-level courses may be credited toward a graduate degree but cannot count in a student's minimum thirty total semester hours of graduate credit or graduate GPA. No course hours with a grade below \"C-\" will be credited on the graduate degree; all grades in graduate courses except those for which grades of \"S\" or \"U\" are given or those conferred under the pro - vision for repeating a course will be included in computation of the average. All conditions of admission must be met; in addition, there are usually other departmental requirements which must be met. Faculty Academic Judgment Master's Degree Successful completion of coursework constituting the student's program of studies, comprehensive exam, master's project, or thesis does not guarantee continuance in a master's degree program or award of the master's degree. Faculty judgment of the academic performance of the student is inherent in the educational process in determining whether the student should continue to be enrolled or be awarded the master's degree, or whether admission into a higher-level degree program is warranted. Doctoral Degree Successful completion of coursework constituting the student's program of studies, comprehensive exam, preliminary exams, defense of prospectus, and defense of dissertation does not guarantee continuance in a doctoral program or award of the doctoral degree. Faculty judgment of the academic perfor - mance of the student is inherent in the educational process in determining whether the student should continue to be enrolled, admitted to doctoral can - didacy, and awarded the doctoral degree. Registration for Final Term For doctoral students and master's students in a thesis-type program, regis - tration shall be required in the final term in which a degree requiring a thesis, dissertation, or treatise is granted, in accordance with the policies stated in the 'Thesis' and 'Dissertation' sections of this chapter.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Degree and Certificate Requirements 83 If a non-thesis student needs only to complete the comprehensive exam - ination in a term and did not register for the examination in the previous term, registration must be requested from the Office of the University Registrar stat - ing the department and the name of the examination. The student must pay the \"examination only\" fee. If the student has not been enrolled for the previous two terms, readmission is required before registration. Clearance for Degrees A student should apply for graduation online at https://my.fsu.edu/ (under the \"Academics\" tab) in the term that the student anticipates completing the degree. The application window is available in the academic calendar for the applicable term. If a candidate applied for graduation in a previous term but did not complete the degree, the application for graduation will be carried forward to the subsequent term. A student's manuscript must be cleared in order to graduate; however, stu - dents also must meet departmental and University requirements before they can graduate. A manuscript is considered cleared if the Manuscript Clearance Advisor has approved the formatting of the manuscript AND all online forms have been completed in the Manuscript Clearance Portal. Students should become familiar with the University's manuscript formatting and clearance requirements before writing their thesis, dissertation, or treatise. Manuscript Clearance Workshops are also held during each semester. Workshop dates are posted to the Thesis, Treatise, and Dissertation section of The Graduate School Website, as well as to the University's calendar of events. All theses, dissertations, and treatises must be electronically submitted to The Graduate School via the ProQuest ETD Administrator Website; hard copies or submissions via e-mail or any other electronic method will not be accepted. Students should submit their manuscript to The Graduate School at the same time that the manuscript is submitted to the committee prior to the defense. This initial submission is reviewed by the Manuscript Clearance Advisor, who then provides the student with a reviewed, marked-up copy of the manuscript that shows formatting corrections to be made before submitting the post-defense version of the manuscript. After the defense, students submit the final content-approved version of their manuscript, incorporating changes requested by their committee as well as those requested by the Manuscript Clearance Advisor. Students not meeting these deadlines will be considered graduates of the following semester. Manuscript Clearance Deadlines Students will fall under either the Semester Deadlines or the 60-Day Deadline (typically whichever is earliest). Sixty-Day (60) Deadline . The post-defense, final content-approved manu - script and the required online forms must be electronically submitted to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor within sixty days after a successful defense. If a student defends early in the semester of graduation, or in a semester prior to graduation, the manuscript clearance deadline that applies is the 60-Day Deadline. For example, a student that defends on August 20 would have to have their manuscript cleared by October 20, even though the Fall semester clearance deadline is later in the semester. Additional formatting revisions are often required after the 60-Day Deadline in order for final manuscript clear - ance to be completed. The student must receive an email granting \"Official Final Clearance\" from the Manuscript Clearance Portal no later than one week after the 60-Day Deadline. No exceptions will be made for this policy. Semester Deadlines . Four deadlines are posted per semester as follows: Last day to submit doctoral dissertation or treatise for pre-defense (initial) format review Last day to submit master's thesis for pre-defense (initial) format review Last day for submission of successfully defended, final content- approved thesis, dissertation, or treatise and completion of all required online forms Last day for thesis, dissertation and treatise students to receive an e-mail from Manuscript Clearance confirming final clearance The relevant pre-defense (initial) format review deadline is the date by which students must submit their manuscript to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor for an initial formatting review. Manuscripts will not be reviewed and counted as an initial submission under the following conditions: not submitted via the ETD Website; poorly formatted based on The Graduate School guide - lines, or otherwise appears \"sloppy\"; sections omitted; page numbers omitted. While it is understood that content will likely change after the defense, it is expected that manuscripts submitted for the initial format review are at least 90% complete and have been formatted in full accordance with the criteria in the most recent version of The Graduate School's formatting guidelines. The final deadline indicates the date by which students must submit the post-defense, final content-approved version of their manuscript to ProQuest ETD and ensure completion of all required manuscript clearance forms in The Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal by 11:59 p.m. ET. Although students cannot complete all forms in the Manuscript Clearance Portal direct - ly, they are ultimately responsible for ensuring their committee has complet - ed the needed approvals. Please note: Additional formatting revisions are often required after this date in order for final manuscript clearance to be completed. Contact the Manuscript Clearance Advisor ( clearance@fsu.edu ) for any questions regarding the clearance process. Policy for Awarding Degrees Florida State University helps students meet their academic goals by mon - itoring academic progress toward their degree. If a graduate student has com - pleted their respective degree requirements, the academic dean of the student's program confirms this, and the student is eligible to be awarded the degree, the University reserves the right to award the degree. Once the degree is awarded, the student must be readmitted to Florida State University in order to enroll in any courses. Graduate students pursuing dual degrees in different disciplines must obtain formal approval of their academic dean, following established University pro - cedures for such approvals. The student's degree program, not the major, will appear on the diploma. A list of degree programs is available in the \"Academic Degree and Certificate Programs\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Should the University invoke its prerogative to award a degree once a stu - dent has completed all stated degree requirements, the student may appeal this decision. If the student can demonstrate that continued enrollment is necessary to achieve his or her academic goals, the appeal may be granted. Reasons such as, but not limited to, desire to continue financial aid, participate in student activities, and access student services do not constitute legitimate academic reasons for appeal. The student's transcript will reflect both the degree pro - gram and the major when degrees are posted. Any graduate student who wishes to appeal for continued enrollment, thereby postponing graduation, must submit a written request to the stu - dent's academic dean no later than ten class days after being notified that the University is invoking its right to award the degree. This appeal will be re - viewed by a committee composed of the student's primary academic dean the Dean of The Graduate School, and the University Registrar. The committee must find evidence to support the student's claim of a legitimate academic need in order to grant permission to continue taking courses. Once a degree has been awarded, all coursework leading to that degree is considered final and not subject to change. \"Incomplete\" grade changes or any other grade changes should be submitted prior to the posting of the degree. Grade changes or withdrawals for coursework that applies to the awarded de - gree may be considered only in cases of documented University error or in cases where the courses in question are documented as applying to a degree that is still in progress.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Financial Information, Tuition, Fees, Aid, Scholarships, and Employment 85 GRADUATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION, TUITION, FEES, AID, SCHOLARSHIPS, AND EMPLOYMENT Vice President for Finance and Administration: Kyle Clark; Controller: Judd Enfinger; Associate Controller, Office of Student Business Services: John Bembry General Information Tuition and fees are collected by the Office of Student Business Services.

Florida Residency Requirements for Tuition Purposes The Florida Residency for Tuition Purposes Policy is based upon state stat - ute, rules of the two higher education governing boards in Florida, and state - wide guidelines developed by college and university administrators in con - junction with the Statewide Residency Committee and the Florida Department of Education. Section 1009.21, Florida Statutes, outlines the broad legal pa - rameters for establishing residency for tuition purposes in Florida public high - er education institutions. It is the highest level of authority regarding residency as established by the Florida Legislature. This statute also provides authority for the Department of Education to establish rules related to residency for tuition purposes. Please note: Under Florida law it is possible for U.S. citizens with undoc - umented parents/guardians, lawful permanent residents, and certain non-U.S. citizens to be classified as Florida residents for tuition paying purposes. In addition, undocumented and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) students who have attended a Florida secondary school for three consecutive years immediately preceding high school graduation, and apply for enrollment to a Florida public post-secondary institution within 24 months of high school graduation, may qualify for a waiver of out-of-state tuition fees. At Florida State University there are three offices responsible for the re - view of residency for tuition purposes: the Office of Admissions, the College of Law, and the College of Medicine. The Office of Admissions determines residency for first-time-on-campus students except for the applicants to the College of Law or College of Medicine which are handled by their respec - tive admissions staff. Reclassification determinations for students who enroll as out-of-state students for tuition purposes and wish to change to in-state students for tuition purposes are handled by the Office of Admissions. Each residency decision will be determined based upon all available information from the application for admission and the \"Florida Residency Declaration for Tuition Purposes\" form. The University reserves the right to request additional information if warranted. For the full text of Florida Statute, Section 1009.21: https://www.flsenate.gov/ Laws/Statutes/2014/1009.21 For the full text of State Board of Education Rule 6A-10.044: https://www. flrules.org/gateway/RuleNo.asp?ID=6A-10.044 For the full text of State Board of Education Rule 6A-20.003: https://www. flrules.org/gateway/RuleNo.asp?ID=6A-20.003 For the full text of Board of Governors Residency Regulation 7.005: https:// www.flbog.edu/regulations/active-regulations/?fwp_chapters=chapter-07 Residency Appeal Committee Students who are denied the classification of Florida resident for tuition purposes have the right of appeal. The appeal must be based upon new in - formation that was not made available during the initial review. All appeals must be in writing to the Residency Appeal Committee, care of the Office of Admissions. Appeals should be submitted as soon as possible after receipt of the initial decision and no later than the end of the term for which Florida residency for tuition purposes is desired. All appeals will be reviewed by the Residency Appeal Committee and Committee decisions are final. Residency Guidelines A Residency Guidelines document was adopted by the Articulation Coordinating Committee to assist college and university administrators in implementing Florida Residency for Tuition Purposes Policy. The Guidelines are maintained by the Statewide Residency Committee which is comprised of residency experts from the state's public colleges and universities. For the full text of the Guidelines on Florida Residency for Tuition Purposes , visit https://www.floridacollegesystem.com/sites/www/Uploads/ files/Students_pages/ACCResidencyGuidelines.pdf . Basic Definition of Residency for Tuition Purposes A Florida resident is a student who has, or a dependent person whose parent or legal guardian has, established and maintained legal residency in Florida for at least twelve months preceding the first day of classes of the term for which residency is sought. Residence in Florida must be as a bona fide domicile rather than for the purpose of maintaining a residence incident to enroll - ment at an institution of higher education. To qualify as a Florida resident for tuition purposes, the student must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident alien, or in legal status as determined by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Please note: See above for information about individuals who are U.S. citizens with undocumented parents/guardians, lawful permanent residents, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and certain non-U.S. citi - zens who may be classified as Florida residents for tuition paying purposes. Other persons not meeting the twelve-month legal residency requirement may be considered as Florida residents for tuition purposes only if they fall within one of the exception categories authorized by the Florida Legislature and State Board of Education. All other persons are ineligible for classification as a Florida resident for tuition purposes. Living in or attending school in Florida will not, in itself, establish legal residence for tuition purposes. Each student shall submit a Florida Residency Declaration for Tuition Purposes form, electronically or in another format, and the documentation required to establish Florida residency for tuition purposes. The burden of providing clear and convincing documentation that justifies the University's classification of a student as a resident for tuition purposes rests with the student. For documentation to be \"clear and convincing,\" it must be credible, trustworthy, and sufficient to persuade the University that the ap - plicant has established legal residence in Florida. Students who depend on out-of-state parents for support are presumed to be legal residents of the same state as their parents. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Financial Information, Tuition, Fees, Aid, Scholarships, and Employment 86 Tuition and Instructional Fees The \"Academic Calendar\" appearing in the Registration Guide each term sets forth the beginning and ending dates of each term and all deadlines.

Annual Estimate of Cost The annual estimated costs listed below are for the 2021-2022 academic year and do not include Summer tuition. They do not apply to law or medical students. The estimate is taken from the Office of Financial Aid Website at https://financialaid.fsu.edu/ . Note: International students should refer to https://cge.fsu.edu/internation - al-students/new-students for an estimated cost of attendance. Graduate Florida Residents Non-Florida Residents 1 The tuition and fee estimate is based on ten semester hours for graduate stu - dents attending two terms (Fall and Spring) per year at the Tallahassee cam - pus. Refer to the Student Business Services Website at https://studentbusiness. fsu.edu/ for tuition rates for all campuses or specific programs. 2 Cost of meeting this requirement is included in financial aid considerations. Students who currently have health insurance may show proof of comparable coverage and may not be required to purchase the University policy. Refer to https://uhs.fsu.edu/ for additional information. Payment of Fees Payment of registration fees and tuition detailed below is an integral part of the registration process. Registration (including payment of fees) must be completed on or before the proper due date. The appropriate University office must be provided a properly executed authorization to defer fees prior to the deadline published in the academic calendar in those cases where fees are to be paid by a previously approved loan, scholarship, or other third-party arrangement. Florida Prepaid College Program without local fees does not pay the full amount due, nor do Intern Participation Certificates. Students must pay the remaining balance due by the published deadline. Method of Payment Students who enroll must pay fees and tuition in full or initiate an install - ment contract by the tuition payment deadline. We encourage students to sub - mit their third-party agency billings as soon as they have registered for classes. All waivers, agency billings, and department billings for all students must be submitted by the third day of the term. Financial aid deferments will be en - tered by the Office of Financial Aid for eligible student accounts. If tuition is not paid or arrangements have not been made by the posted deadlines, a late payment fee will be assessed. Any course added after the tuition payment deadline must be paid in full within five days or a $100.00 late payment fee will be assessed. The University does not send out a paper bill because students may change their course schedule and therefore the amount owed through the fourth day of the semester will be inaccurate. Tuition and fees should be paid by the fee payment deadline as posted at https://studentbusiness.fsu.edu/ . Note that other University related fees have separate and earlier deadlines. Students can, however, get the amount of their tuition and fees due on the Internet at https://my.fsu.edu/ (from myFSU Student Portal , click $ Make a Payment ) or when they register for classes through the Web. Other options include access - ing the kiosks located on the first floor of University Center A Building , calling the Office of Student Business Services at (850) 644-9452 , or going to A1500 University Center , 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday.

Through this plan, students must pay half (tuition and fees greater than $150.00) of their currently owed tuition, plus a $10.00 Installment Contract Fee, by noon on the main campus tuition payment deadline. The second half of the installment payment is due by the sixth week of class. The installment contract agreement may be executed in person or by calling Student Business Services. Failure to pay the balance of tuition by the due date will result in a late payment fee and a financial hold on your account and may result in the cancellation of your course schedule. Once an installment contract is executed, any course added at a later date must be paid in full within five days. It will not be covered under the previously executed contract. Failure to pay tuition in full for such a course will result in the assessment of a late payment fee. Convenient Drop Box for Payments. Student Business Services will accept check, money order, or cashier's check in our drop box. Our secure payment drop box is located outside our office at A1500 University Center .

Students who are requesting their tuition be paid by an agency must submit the required doc - uments as soon as possible, but no later than the third day of the semester, and preferably thirty days in advance. Those students receiving financial aid should submit the documents by the third day of the semester; otherwise, tuition will be deducted from the student's financial aid and refunds will not be made to the student until the agency or department makes their payment to the Office of Student Business Services. Financial aid students must report this payment as an income source on their application, or upon further evaluation by the Office of Student Financial Aid, the student may be \"over-awarded\" and may be required to repay financial aid to the University. If the agency or department has not paid the tuition by the end of the current semester, a late payment fee of $100.00 will be assessed to the student's account and the student is required to pay it before being granted other University services. Accounts left unpaid at the end of the semester will be put in a delinquent status and the student will not be able to receive University services (registration, transcripts, diplomas, etc.) Agencies that do not pay in a timely manner may cause the Office of Student Business Services to put the student's account in a non-billing status for subsequent semesters; consequently, the student will be required to pay tuition by the regularly scheduled deadline, and the University will refund to the student the amount that the agency pays (less University charges) after they have paid it. Students with agency payments that are contingent upon grade(s) received are not eligible for agency billing, and tuition must be paid by the regularly scheduled deadline. The Office of Student Business Services does not bill agencies for housing, books, meals, etc. Departmental Billing. Departmental billings must be submitted to the Office of Student Business Services by the appropriate college or school by the third day of each semester.

Students who withdraw after the fourth day of the semester/term but prior to the end of the fourth week of the semester (or for Summer sessions by the first twenty-five percent of the term) are eligible for a twenty-five percent refund of tuition and fees. After this period, students who withdraw are held fully liable for fees. Students who withdraw and have received federal finan - cial aid (Title IV programs), state or university aid may be required to repay to the aid source the amount of unearned financial aid funds disbursed to them as of their withdrawal date as described in the section on 'Withdrawals and Return of Financial Aid.' Note: In the case where a withdrawal petition is approved, a refund can only be provided if the refund withdrawal request is submitted and completed within six months after the end of the semester/term in which the with - drawal occurred. If financial aid is received by the student during the term in which the refund is granted, state and federal regulations may require that the refund be returned to the aid source. An application for a request for refund of fees should be submitted as follows: Food Plan. Director of Food Services, 144 Oglesby Union Housing Fees. Assistant Director of Housing for Contracts and Assignments, 109 Student Life Building Parking Decals. Director of Transportation & Parking Services, 104 North Woodward Avenue Textbooks. Manager of Florida State University Bookstore, Parking Garage, Main Level Withdrawal and Return of Financial Aid Per federal regulation (34 CFR 668.22), students who withdraw and have received financial aid will be required to repay to the program sources the amount of unearned financial aid funds disbursed to them as of their with - drawal date. The unearned amount of program funds is calculated based on the last date of academic activity, which indicates the percentage of the semester completed. Both the University and students receiving financial aid are required to return unearned financial aid to the aid source. Title IV aid programs are repaid in the following order: Unsubsidized Stafford/Direct loans, Subsidized Federal Stafford/Direct loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal PLUS/Direct PLUS loans, Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Program, and Teach Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (Teach) Grants. The University is required to return the unearned portion of the financial aid funds it received from withdrawing students that was used to pay insti - tutional charges such as tuition, fees, housing, and other education-related expenses assessed by the institution. The funds returned to the aid source by the University will be credited against the students' total liability of unearned funds. Students will owe the University the amount returned to the aid source for institutional charges. In addition, any student who receives Title IV funds who stops attending classes during the semester and does not offi - cially withdraw from the University is considered an unofficial withdrawal according to Title IV federal regulations. The University is required to return unearned financial aid to the federal government for all unofficial withdrawals in the same manner as students who withdraw officially. Students who owe grant overpayments remain eligible for Title IV pro - gram funds for forty-five days if, during those forty-five days, the student: 1) repays the overpayment in full to the University; 2) enters into a repayment agreement with the University; or 3) enters into a repayment agreement with the Department of Education. Entering into a repayment agreement does not mean the student is eligible to register for additional classes, receive a tran - script, diploma, etc. Students can lose financial aid eligibility if they do not comply with the options above and should consider their repayment responsi - bilities for these programs as part of any withdrawal decision. Bright Future Repayment Requirement Students who were eligible for Bright Futures and who graduated with a baccalaureate degree in seven or fewer semesters, or in 105 semester hours or fewer, may receive funding for one semester of graduate study, not to exceed 15 credit hours paid at the undergraduate rate. Florida Statute also requires that students who drop or withdraw from any course(s) must repay any Florida Bright Futures Scholarship disbursed for the course(s). However, a student who receives an award under this program and subsequently drops one or more courses or withdraws from all courses after the end of the drop and add period due to a verifiable illness or other documented emergency may be granted and exception pursuant to s. 1009.40(1)(b)4., unless the institution's policy is to refund the cost of the courses. Financial Aid Director of Financial Aid: Somnath Chatterjee General Information Florida State University recognizes the high cost of education today and makes every effort to offer financial assistance through a variety of programs to qualified students.

Please see Financial Aid Terms and Conditions for specific award requirements. Visit https://finan - cialaid.fsu.edu/ for additional information.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Graduate Financial Information, Tuition, Fees, Aid, Scholarships, and Employment 91 Degree Applicable Hours Degree-seeking students, regardless of academic career, will be provided a multitude of advising resources, ranging from in-person advising, online program of study guides, academic maps, and/or graduate committee review. Qualitative and quantitative metrics are maintained to ensure student enroll - ment in courses relevant to their academic degree programs and majors, as such these courses are deemed degree-applicable for financial aid purposes. Inclusion in a degree progression initiative may require students to enroll in specific classes. These classes are considered degree-applicable by the University. Students not actively assigned to a structured degree progression initiative may self-identify as needing additional support and may enroll in the same classes, where allowed. In these cases, the courses are considered elec - tive hours and are considered degree-applicable by the University. Courses not deemed degree applicable may be ineligible for certain types of financial aid. Deadlines The federal financial aid application period for the 2021-2022 year begins October 1, 2020 and ends June 30, 2022. Some federal and institutional grant funds and federal work-study funds are limited, so students are encouraged to apply as soon as possible after October 1, 2020. This application is valid for Fall 2021, Spring 2022, and Summer 2022. Financial Aid Application Process To apply for federal, state, and institutional aid at Florida State University, students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students are encouraged to apply online at: https://studentaid. gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa . To apply, the following materials will be necessary to complete the data required: The student's social security card and driver's license W-2 forms or other records of income earned Student's and student's spouse's (if married) Federal Income Tax Return Records of other untaxed income received, such as welfare benefits, social security benefits, TANF, and military or clergy allowances Current bank statements and records of stocks, bonds, and other investments Business or farm records, if applicable; and Student's alien registration card, if student is not a U.S. citizen. Note: Students may apply for financial aid before being admitted to Florida State University, but while early application for aid is recommended (as soon as possible beginning October 1), a student cannot be offered aid until he/she is officially accepted for admission to Florida State University. Loan Entrance Counseling Sessions and Master Promissory Note Federal regulations require all students receiving a Federal Stafford Unsubsidized Loan or Graduate Plus Loan to participate in a loan entrance counseling session and endorse a master promissory note prior to receiving the first distribution of the loan. No Federal loan can be disbursed until this requirement is met. A student accepting a loan award for the first time at Florida State University can complete the loan entrance and master promissory note requirement by accessing the Federal Department of Education Website at https://studentaid. gov/h/manage-loans and clicking on the loan entrance counseling and master promissory note links. Students will need their Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID) to access their profile. Students can obtain an FSA ID by visiting https:// fsaid.ed.gov/ . The student will be asked to provide certain information, in - cluding reference addresses for future use. Students are strongly encouraged to print a copy of the completed confirmation page to retain for their records. The FSA ID is used to complete the e-signature. Students who prefer an alter - native format or who have questions about loans, the loan entrance counsel - ing, or master promissory note information process may contact the Office of Financial Aid. Fees and Financial Aid Students Financial Aid Payments & Refunds : When financial aid is processed to the student's account, the University first applies financial aid payments towards tuition and housing charges (and towards other charges as allowed) before issuing refunds. Financial aid is processed to accounts beginning with the pub - lished disbursement dates and continues through the semester. For more infor - mation and upcoming dates, visit https://studentbusiness.fsu.edu/ . To receive your aid, you must comply with Financial Aid terms and conditions located at https://financialaid.fsu.edu/Terms-and-Conditions . You must also confirm that your financial aid file is complete prior to disbursement by checking your sta - tus and clearing any holds or to-do list items at https://my.fsu.edu/ . Financial aid refunds are sent by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to any US-based bank account, so students must designate a refund bank account and enroll in direct deposit to receive a refund of excess Financial Aid or a refund of financial aid that cannot be applied to University charges. Additionally, the University must receive written permission to apply federal financial aid to charges other than tuition and housing and federal aid cannot be applied to excess-hours fees. For instructions on how to provide that permission, or for direct deposit enrollment instructions, see https://studentbusiness.fsu.edu/ . If you have any questions, please call (850) 644-9452 at the Office of Student Business Services. For financial aid questions, please contact the Office of Financial Aid at (850) 644-0539 . Deadline : If the financial aid payment is not sufficient (or allowed) to cover all charges, or if a student's schedule, university bill, or financial aid offer changes after application of financial aid, then the student is responsible for paying the balance by the tuition payment deadline, (see the \"Academic Calendar\" in the Registration Guide ). After this date, a $100.00 late payment fee is assessed and grades will be held at the end of the semester until fees are paid in full. Note: Financial Aid students who are having their tuition paid by an agen - cy, department billing, or Florida Prepaid College Program should submit the required documents no later than the third day of the semester (see the \"Academic Calendar\" in the Registration Guide ). The basic Florida Prepaid College Program does not pay the full amount of tuition owed to the University, nor do Intern Participation Certificates. Students must pay the remaining balance due by the posted payment due date. Deferments, Loans, and Check Cancellation Deferments Students must confirm their application is complete by the first week of the semester by going to https://my.fsu.edu/ and viewing their Financial Aid. Students may qualify for a deferment or extension of the tuition due date if they are awarded financial aid that is not disbursed by the published tuition deadline. Students who have been awarded aid (and in the case of loans, have accepted aid) sufficient to meet their tuition cost and who have submitted all To-Do-List items, may receive an automatic extension of the tuition deadline if their aid is not disbursed by the published deadline. Students should review their Student Account Invoice after the end of Drop/Add and before the pub - lished tuition deadline to determine if all aid has been applied, or to check to see if the tuition deadline has been extended. If tuition is still owed by the initial published deadline and aid is still pending, students should contact the Office of Financial Aid prior to the tuition payment deadline. Financial aid students who do not receive a financial aid deferment or extension must pay their tuition in full by the tuition payment deadline. See the dates published in the \"Academic Calendar\" included in the Registration Guide . Failure to pay by the published deadline will result in a late payment fee assessment. Note: Financial aid deferments expire before the end of the semester. See the Registration Guide for the expiration date. Students must confirm that their financial aid has posted and all requirements have been met by the deferment expiration date. Go to https://my.fsu.edu/ (from Student Account Quicklinks , click Account Statement ). Students will then see courses and fees detailed. With a temporary deferment, the total balance may show ($0.00) for the Current Term Tuition. When financial aid posts, the screen will show how much has been paid toward tuition. Students must ensure financial aid pays tuition in full by the deferment deadline. If there are questions, contact stu- dentbusiness@fsu.edu or (850) 644-9452. If the student's financial aid is not available by the expiration date, it is the student's responsibility to pay tuition in full. Failure to pay by the expiration date will result in a late payment fee as - sessment of $100.00, and the schedule for the next semester may be cancelled. Additionally, registration will not be permitted and transcripts and diplomas will not be mailed until debts are paid in full. Short Term Loans Students in need of funds as a result of financial aid being delayed may apply for a short-term loan (also known by the name delayed delivery loan) by contacting the Office of Financial Aid. Eligibility for the loan will be deter - mined by the type of aid awarded and the hours enrolled. Accounts in delin - quent status (past due) are not eligible for these loans. Short term loans will be disbursed approximately 1-2 business days after the loan has been approved and disbursed according to the disbursement method indicated on the student's disbursement permissions. Students must have either paid or deferred their full amount of tuition by the tuition payment deadline in order to be eligible for short term loans. Short term loans are due when the financial aid arrives, 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityGraduate Financial Information, Tuition, Fees, Aid, Scholarships, and Employment 92 or by the financial aid deferment deadline, whichever comes first. Debts not paid will prohibit students from using University services such as registration, transcripts, etc. Short term loans are not available until the financial aid distribution peri - od. Students should come prepared to buy books and pay initial living expens - es until financial aid disbursement. Emergency Loans Students who have a documented emergency such as eviction or utility suspension may apply for an emergency loan at the Office of Financial Aid. Documentation and a picture ID are required to receive an emergency loan. Accounts in delinquent status are not eligible for an emergency loan. These loans must be paid by the due date, and University services will not be grant - ed until paid in full. For emergency guidelines and requirements, contact the Office of Financial Aid. Check Cancellation Any Federal Direct Stafford Loan check available at financial aid distribu - tion that is not disbursed by the check cancellation deadline will be returned to the lender for cancellation. Loan Cancellation and Refusals Students should notify the Office of Financial Aid to decline or refuse an awarded loan (Federal Loans, Private Loans, or Graduate Plus) prior to it be - ing disbursed to the student. If the loan has already been disbursed and a stu - dent wishes to partially or fully refuse a loan, the student is required to notify the Office of Financial Aid and complete a cancellation form within fourteen days. The form can be completed at the Office of Financial Aid and repayment can be made to Florida State University by FSUCard, cash, cashier's check, or money order, or the original check can be brought to the Office of Student Business Services, A1500 University Center . Loan Exit Interviews Federal and University regulations require that all recipients of federal loans participate in an exit interview counseling session upon graduation, with - drawal from the University, or dropping below six semester hours. Counseling sessions can be completed online at https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans . For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid at financialaid@fsu. edu or (850) 644-0539 . Additional Sources of Financial Support Scholarship opportunities can be found on the FSU Scholarship Foundation FS4U, at https://fsu.academicworks.com/ . It is the student's responsibility to report all additional sources of financial aid via \"Outside Aid\" located at https://my.fsu.edu/ within the Financial Aid student portal. The Federal Work Study Program (FWSP) The FWSP is a federally funded, need-based financial aid program, admin - istered by the Office of Financial Aid. This program enables students to earn a portion of their financial aid offer. This program offers a positive alterna - tive to loan indebtedness through meaningful part-time employment. Weekly work schedules are mutually determined by the student and the employing de - partment to suit the student's class/exam schedule and the employer's needs. According to federal regulations, the work schedule cannot interfere with a student's class schedule. Students may also utilize their Federal Work Study offers by participating in community service through the Community Service Work Study Program (CSWSP) . This program is designed to locate and develop off-campus commu - nity service jobs and offer referrals for eligible students. Students may assist with programs related to health care, childcare, literacy training, education (including tutoring), welfare, and social services. Some students may serve as mentors for educational and recreational activities or work as counselors in areas such as career counseling. To determine eligibility for the FWSP and CSWSP, students must apply for financial aid at Florida State University by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (F AFSA) , and by submitting all other required documentation.

Nomination is through the department or college, but competition for these awards is on a University- wide basis. The stipend is a minimum of $5,000 per academic year plus tuition waivers. Assistants also receive the health insurance subsidy benefit.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin University-Wide Standards for Graduate Teaching Assistants 95 UNIVERSITY-WIDE STANDARDS FOR GRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANTS AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY These are University-wide standards that any graduate student must meet prior to assuming one of the various instructional roles. These are meant to be university-wide minimum standards; departments may adopt additional or more stringent standards. Programs that do not use graduate students in instructional roles would not be affected by these standards. They are meant to cover the formal use of graduate teaching assistants (TAs) in course instruc - tion. Extra help sessions and voluntary tutorials in addition to regular class meetings would not normally fall under these requirements. The companion policy, University-wide Standards for Undergraduate Teaching Assistants at Florida State University details the policies that apply to the use of undergrad - uates as TAs. Certification of General Teaching Competence Each semester in accordance with guidelines of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) and the stan - dards outlined in the following sections, the Academic Dean of each College is required to certify in writing to the Dean of The Graduate School that each graduate student who serves as a TA in the classroom or online is competent to teach and for international graduate teaching assistants (ITAs), that they are also competent to teach in spoken English. (See SACSCOC statement below.) Note: Colleges/units need to validate that each TA is serving their designated instructional assignment in the classroom before certifying to the Dean of The Graduate School that the TA certification process is complete. TAs serving as the instructor of record (IOR) for an undergraduate-level course need to be qualified to serve in this role prior to the start of the semester, appointed under the correct job code (M9184), and assigned to the course in Student Central. Students who do not meet the criteria for certification should not be appointed as a TA, serve as the IOR for any undergraduate-level course, or receive access to a course management site. The University monitors faculty teaching loads, class sizes, and TA usage on a regular basis. As such, it is vital that all instructional assignments are properly documented for all students. General Administrative responsibility for the teaching assignment rests within the department in which the student is employed as a graduate TA. Each depart - ment is responsible for providing orientation, training, supervision, and evalu - ation of its graduate student TAs, and for assigning a faculty member to work closely with the individual graduate student to assist him or her in carrying out teaching responsibilities and to facilitate professional development. There should be a departmental orientation for TAs prior to beginning their teaching responsibilities. It is also recommended that all TAs attend the Program for Instructional Excellence (PIE) Teaching Conference sponsored by PIE before beginning their teaching responsibilities. It is recommended that each program has a discipline-specific teaching manual for its graduate TAs to supplement the university teaching manual, Instruction at FSU , that may be viewed online at https://odl.fsu.edu/ . Graduate Assistantship Job Code To monitor compliance with university policies and Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requirements, it is imperative that the proper appointment clas - sifications be used for graduate TAs. It is the responsibility of departments that employ graduate teaching assistants to establish the appropriate job code according to teaching responsibility. The Graduate School and the Human Resources Office will verify the requirements for each classification and are the offices to contact if there are any questions. Job codes to be used for gradu - ate students can be accessed at https://hr.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu2186/files/ PDF/OPSJobCodes.pdf . As a general rule: Note: The university's Conflict of Interest policy applies to all teaching assistants. As a general rule, job codes should be assigned as described here: Categories 1 and 2: W9185 Graduate Assistant (Teaching) - Stipend (FLSA Exempt) This Graduate Assistant shall be classified as a degree-seeking graduate student who assists in the teaching function but is not the IOR and does not have primary responsibility for teaching. The appointee must be fully admitted to and meet the requirements of the University, be fully admitted to a graduate degree program, and be under the supervision of a faculty member. Examples: tutors, recitation leaders, laboratory supervisors, assistants to faculty instructors; when assigned to a standalone undergraduate course, duties may include grading of undergraduate-level work. Categories 3 and 4: M9184 Graduate Teaching Assistant - Stipend (FLSA Exempt) This Graduate Teaching Assistant shall be classified as a degree- seeking graduate student who has a master's degree in the teaching discipline, or at least eighteen (18) graduate semester hours in the teaching discipline, and performs primary teaching duties as the IOR that are related to that student's academic program. The appointee must be admitted to and meet the requirements of the University, be fully admitted to a graduate degree program, and be under the supervision of an appropriate faculty member. Example: A graduate student having full instructional responsibilities for a credit class as IOR. Category 5: 9183 Graduate Teaching Associate (Teaching) - Stipend (FLSA Exempt) This Graduate Teaching Associate shall be classified as a degree- seeking graduate student who has a master's degree in the teaching discipline, or at least eighteen (18) graduate semester hours in the teaching discipline, and assists in the teaching function of a graduate course or co-listed course (4000/5000; 4000/6000), but is not the IOR. The appointee must be fully admitted to and meet the requirements of the University, be fully admitted to a graduate degree program, and be under the supervision of a faculty member. Examples: For graduate- level or co-listed courses, tutors, recitation leaders, laboratory supervisors, assistants to faculty instructors, or comparable roles. Limited grading and instruction of graduate students as described under \"Description of Duties\" are permitted as long as a supervising faculty member retains final authority over grades and provides supervision of instructional content. Category 5 Graduate Teaching Associates may not take on the lead instructor role of a graduate or co-listed course. Description of Duties and Minimum Requirements for Different categories of Instruction Category 1. Duties: This category may include a variety of duties for un - dergraduate-level courses. TA responsibilities cannot involve routine direct contact with a group of undergraduate students in face-to-face or online in - structional support roles. Limited one-to-one engagement (e.g., office hours) is permissible. Examples of appropriate tasks include grading of multiple-choice type assignments, the setup of laboratory demonstrations, and clerical course management tasks. If routine instructional contact with a group of undergrad - uates is expected, then the TA must meet the English language competency standard required for a Category 2 appointment. Required qualifications and training: Program-specific guidelines for the specific duties Undergraduate degree in discipline or related field Some graduate work completed or enrolled in Must attend Day 1 of the Fall PIE Teaching Conference before the commencement of one's TA duties. Day 1 includes required training on the Sexual Harassment Policy, Academic Honor Policy and the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Day 1 also includes training in the use of Course Management System (CMS) for instruction, time management for TAs, and interacting professionally with one's students. Equivalent preparation offered by the academic unit (that has been approved by the Graduate School) may be substituted for day one of the Fall PIE Teaching Conference, and this alternative must include training in the specific policies noted above. Supervision by a faculty member in the teaching discipline Planned and periodic evaluations of the TA Category 2. Duties: For assignment to undergraduate courses, this cate - gory includes a variety of duties (e.g., grading of undergraduate-level work; 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityUniversity-Wide Standards for Graduate Teaching Assistants 96 tutoring; proctoring of computerized exams and laboratories; assisting with or leading laboratory, recitation, or discussion sections; or assisting students with software or equipment use). When grading undergraduate-level work performed by graduate students, potential conflict of interest or grading with - in the programmatic cohort (as defined in Category 5) should be avoided. Any anticipated grading within the programmatic cohort must be reported to the Academic Dean's Office at the beginning of the semester. This catego - ry assumes a greater degree of interaction with undergraduate students than Category 1 and thus requires a higher level of competency in spoken English. A Category 2 TA may provide assistance in graduate-level or co-listed courses (4000/5000 or 4000/6000 combined courses). Examples of appropri - ate tasks for Category 2 TAs in graduate-level or co-listed courses include set - ting up laboratory demonstrations, proctoring exams, moderating a discussion board, distributing assignments, preparing class materials/presentations/visual aids, taking attendance or recording questions and responses in class, record - ing lectures, assisting students with software or equipment use, other clerical tasks, and grading of undergraduate-level work. No grading or comparable assessment of graduate-level work for graduate-level credit, and instruction of content not previously introduced by the IOR may be performed by Category 2 TAs assigned to graduate-level or co-listed courses. Required qualifications and training: Program specific guidelines for the specific duties Undergraduate degree in discipline or related field Some graduate work completed or enrolled in Must attend Day 1 of the Fall PIE Teaching Conference before the commencement of one's teaching duties. Day 1 includes required training on the Sexual Harassment Policy, Academic Honor Policy and FERPA. Day 1 also includes training in the use of the CMS for instruction, time management for TAs, and interacting professionally with one's students. Equivalent preparation offered by the academic unit (that has been approved by the Graduate School) may be substituted for Day 1 of the Fall PIE Teaching Conference, and this alternative must include training in the specific policies noted above. Supervision by a faculty member in the teaching discipline Planned periodic evaluations of the TA Note: The distinction of Categories 1 and 2 recognizes that the extent of in - teraction with undergraduates, and thus the necessary spoken English compe - tency of the TA, varies across disciplines though the position title is the same. Note: Regarding Category 3 and 4 Appointments, these types presume the graduate TA is the IOR for an undergraduate course only (1000-4000 course level, no co-listed courses). The policy forbids a graduate student from being the IOR or taking on the lead instructor role for a graduate course or co-listed course. Unit may apply to the Graduate School for exceptions to this rule. When grading undergraduate-level work performed by graduate students registered in undergraduate courses, potential grading within a programmatic cohort (as defined in Category 5) should be avoided. Any anticipated grading within a programmatic cohort must be reported to the Academic Dean's Office at the beginning of the semester. Category 3.

Student participation in a \"teaching in the discipline\" course or equivalent academic unit orientation Direct supervision by a faculty member in the teaching discipline Planned and periodic evaluations of the TA Category 5. Duties: Providing assistance to lead instructors of gradu - ate-level or co-listed courses. In addition to duties described for Category 2 TAs, Category 5 TAs may perform limited grading and instruction. Grading is supervised by the IOR and should be based on faculty-created criteria (e.g. rubrics, point-breakdowns, sample solutions, etc.). Final assignment of grades is reserved for the IOR. Category 5 TAs must defer to the IOR for all final decisions. When in - teracting with students, Category 5 TAs should communicate their support role to the students enrolled. They should explain that grading is based on faculty-provided criteria, is reviewed by the IOR, and can be discussed with the IOR. Category 5 TAs may provide limited instruction in graduate-level and co-listed courses. In addition to reviewing material previously introduced by the IOR, Category 5 TAs may present new material on their own in rare in - stances, and only after discussing the planned lecture with the IOR first. They may present new material several times throughout the semester if the super - vising faculty member is in attendance at each of these sessions. At a mini - mum, a super-majority of class sessions that introduce new material should be led by the IOR. Category 5 TAs may not assign final course grades, but may assign grades on daily work, quizzes, laboratory participation, etc. Category 5 TAs may not develop course material unless it is in direct consultation with and review from the IOR. Furthermore, Category 5 TAs may not grade student who fall under the university's Conflict of Interest policy or within the TA's programmatic cohort. For the purposes of this policy, a TA's programmatic cohort is defined as the group of graduate students in the unit where the TA is pursuing a degree or certificate who are many or most of the same courses as the TA within the same times frame as the TA. Units must ensure that no conflict of interest or no grading within their programmatic cohort will exist. Required qualifications and training: Minimum of eighteen (18) hours of graduate coursework in the teaching discipline Must attend Days 1 and 2 of the Fall PIE Teaching Conference before the commencement of one's teaching duties or an equivalent offered by the academic unit (that has been approved by the Graduate School).

Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin University-Wide Standards for Graduate Teaching Assistants 97 Note: Alternative \"equivalent training\" that is provided by an academ - ic unit must include training in the specific policies indicated above. Student participation in the PIE Advanced Graduate TA training; must be completed during the semester of a student's first Category 5 assignment. The training covers, among other topics, potential conflict of interest situations and how to resolve them; navigating professional and student roles within the same program; and more. Direct supervision by a faculty member in the teaching discipline Planned and periodic evaluations of the TA Certification of Spoken English for Graduate Teaching Assistants As noted above, Academic Deans are required to certify to the Dean of The Graduate School that the TAs in the college are competent to teach. This statement should also include certification that all graduate TAs whose native language is not English are competent to teach in spoken English. All international graduate students who are not native speakers of English, and who are going to be TAs, should take the SPEAK test when they arrive on campus (as noted below, students who scored 26 or higher on the speaking portion of the IBTOEFL may be exempted from taking the SPEAK test). The Center for Intensive English Studies (CIES) adminis - ters and scores the SPEAK test, CIES also offers courses in spoken English (EAP courses). The SPEAK test is administered several times in the week(s) prior to the beginning of each semester, and the scores are available within three to four days of the date the test is administered. Scheduling and regis - tration information can be found at https://cies.fsu.edu/programs/english-ac - ademic-purposes/speak-exam-information . Departments are urged to take advantage of this opportunity to receive an initial estimate of speaking ability. In addition, the SPEAK is routinely administered as an end-of-term evaluation for students enrolled in EAP courses. TAs not enrolled in EAP courses may also take the test at that time. Course offerings, as well as test dates for SPEAK tests, are distributed periodically to departments via e-mail to TA coordinators. This information is also available on the CIES Web site at https://cies.fsu.edu/ programs/eap . The standards for certification of spoken English are as follows: A score of 50 or higher on the SPEAK test, or 26 or higher on the speaking portion of the IBTOEFL, certifies a student to serve in all categories. A score of at least 40 on the SPEAK test is acceptable for a TA appointed in Category 1. Appointment in this category is appropriate if there is no or limited direct contact with undergraduate students e.g., is responsible for grading tests and/or only providing direct support to an instructor. If there is to be any routine direct communication with a group of undergraduate students whether face-to-face or online, the higher standard applies. Limited one-to-one engagement e.g., office hours is permissible. A score of 45 on SPEAK, or 23-24 on the Speaking section of TOEFL iBT, certifies a TA to serve in Categories 1; and in Category 2 for up to two semesters if also concurrently enrolled in an appropriate EAP course(s). If, by the end of these two semesters, the student's skills have not improved sufficiently to achieve a score of 50 on the SPEAK exam, the student will be eligible to teach only in Category 1. The student will be allowed to continue to serve in Category 2 or serve as IOR in Category 3-4 by meeting at least one of the following two criteria: Achieve a score of 50 on SPEAK. Enroll in Advanced Spoken English for ITAs (EAP 5835) and score 90 or better in the course. Student's scoring 40 or below on SPEAK should enroll in the appropriate EAP course if the goal is to serve in Categories 2-4. Once a 45 on SPEAK is achieved such a student will be certified to serve in Category 2 for up to two semesters if also concurrently enrolled in an appropriate CIES English language course(s). If, by the end of these two semesters, the student's skills have not improved sufficiently to achieve a score of 50 on the SPEAK exam, the student will be eligible to serve only in Category 1. The student will only be allowed to continue to serve in Category 2- or serve as IOR in Categories 3-4 by meeting at least one of the following two criteria: Achieve a score of 50 on SPEAK. Enroll in Advanced Spoken English for ITAs (EAP 5835) and score 90 or better in the course. Students serving in Category 5 must achieve a score of 50 on the SPEAK exam before assuming their duties. The standard for international students serving as ITAs in Modern Language and Linguistics is 45 (SPEAK) or 23 (TOEFL) if the student is teaching a course in their native language. Exceptions In general, if new graduate students are unable to attend the Fall PIE Teaching Conference prior to commencing their first semester of teaching they may only be appointed to Category 1. However, prior to the commencement of their teaching duties they must complete the online required policy mod - ules (Sexual Harassment Policy, Academic Honor Policy and the FERPA) that are available through PIE or undergo equivalent preparation offered by the academic unit (that has been approved by the Graduate School). If equivalent preparation is not available and if they are to continue teaching in the Spring or Summer and thereafter, they must attend the Spring PIE Teaching Workshop which is held the Friday of the first week of classes. Ultimately, they must participate in training through one of the PIE options or through the academic unit in order to continue to serve as a TA. If students' first semester of enrollment is Spring and they are to be as - signed teaching responsibilities they must complete the required online train - ing modules and attend the PIE Spring Teaching Workshop or an academic unit equivalent (that has been approved by the Graduate School). In unique instances, a Department Chair or Dean may appeal the applica - tion of these standards by submitting a request to the Dean of The Graduate School. Equivalent Previous Experience and Emergencies With the exception of the minimum of eighteen hours of graduate course - work in the teaching discipline for primary instruction and in accordance with guidelines provided by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), the following options will be available to deal with special circumstances: A graduate student who through previous preparation or teaching experience has demonstrated knowledge and strong teaching skills can be exempt from some of the requirements, as appropriate, by certification of the program chair. In an emergency, a department may appoint a graduate TA who has not met all the University-wide requirements for that category of appointment if there is an assurance that the student will meet the requirements by the end of the term in which the student is teaching. Instructor of Record (IOR) Policy FSU defines the \"Instructor of Record\" as the individual designated by the academic unit as responsible for a course, including developing its design, delivery, assignments, and assessments. All IORs, regardless of rank or type, must meet the appropriate standards for credentials and appointment. (FSU Policy 3A-6) Normal policy forbids graduate students from serving as an IOR and teach - ing a graduate course. This includes co-listed undergraduate/graduate sections. Exceptions can be made by requesting approval from the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement through the Dean of the Graduate School. Please refer to FSU' s Faculty Handbook (Section 5, under Graduate Teaching Status) for more information on this. SACS Statement Graduate Teaching Assistants: master's degree in the teaching discipline or eighteen graduate semester hours in the teaching discipline, direct supervision by a faculty member experienced in the teaching discipline, regular in-ser - vice training, and planned and periodic evaluations.

Graduate degree programs in the College of Arts and Sciences grew organical - ly from these strong undergraduate roots, and the contributions of the college to graduate education have been integral to the evolution of the University. The first recorded Master's degree at the Florida State College for Women was awarded by the College of Arts and Sciences in 1908, and the first doctorate at Florida State University was awarded in Chemistry in 1952. The College of Arts and Sciences comprises over thirty departments, institutes, centers, and interdisciplinary programs. In addition to awarding bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees and heavily supporting the Liberal Studies for the 21st Century Program, the College of Arts and Sciences offers an extensive array of foundation courses for pre-professional and professional programs. Faculty within the college have earned national and international rec - ognition for research, teaching, and distinguished service to the profession. Among the faculty are members of the National Academy of Sciences, Nobel Laureates, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and recipients of numerous other national and international honors. Graduate students within Arts and Sciences have received marks of distinc - tion that include local, national, and international scholarships and fellowships. Opportunities Departments in the College of Arts and Sciences work with various pro - grams, schools, and colleges to offer cooperative and interdisciplinary degree programs at the graduate level. Well-funded research opportunities for gradu - ate students are extensive among the science departments. Scholarships, Awards, and Assistantships Many students are supported by graduate teaching or research assistant - ships which are available across the college. In addition to being eligible for the assistantships, students in the College of Arts and Sciences may apply for various types of graduate fellowships. Fellowship opportunities are available through The Graduate School. The application deadline for most fellowships is mid-January for awards beginning the following academic year. Requirements The College of Arts and Sciences offers the master of arts (MA), the master of fine arts (MFA), the master of science (MS), professional science masters (PSM), and the doctor of philosophy (PhD) degrees. In addition to reviewing the requirements highlighted below, students should consult all University- wide degree requirements and academic procedures for the master's and doc - toral degrees as summarized in the \"Graduate Degree Requirements\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Admissions Criteria Students who wish to pursue graduate study in the College of Arts and Sciences must apply through the Office of Admissions and must be accept - ed for graduate study by the intended department or program. The applicant must have an earned bachelor's degree with a minimum upper division 3.0 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) or have earned a graduate degree. All applicants must submit test scores from a nationally standardized graduate admissions test that is acceptable to the program to which they are applying. Prospective graduate students who are foreign nationals must also earn a minimum score of 550 on the paper-based or 80 on the Internet-based TOEFL examination, 6.5 on the IELTS examination, or 77 on the MELAB examination. Individual de - partments and programs may set higher standards for admission. For more detailed information about specific graduate programs in the College of Arts and Sciences, students should consult departmental or program entries of this Graduate Bulletin .Limitations on Supervised Teaching and Research Coursework Students may be granted credit for supervised research and supervised teaching at the option of their department. A student may register for such activity in more than one term. No more than five semester hours of supervised research credit and five semester hours of supervised teaching credit may be counted toward the master's degree. The normal limit for candidates for doc - toral degrees is five semester hours in each category. Master's Degree Requirements Master's degree students must complete their program of study within seven calendar years from the time of initial registration. A thesis-type mas - ter's program requires a minimum of thirty semester hours, six of which must be thesis credits. A course-type master's program also requires a minimum of thirty semester hours. A student who enrolls in thesis hours need not be enrolled continuously thereafter in thesis hours if they meet the minimum University requirement for full-time or part-time enrollment through other coursework. The minimum number of thesis hours required for the master's degree is six. Students who have left the campus must register for at least two semester hours of thesis credit per term as long as they are receiving faculty supervision. Master's students should consult regularly with their supervising professor about progress toward the degree. Doctoral Degree Requirements Doctoral students must complete their degree requirements within five cal - endar years from the time the preliminary examination is passed. No student may register for dissertation hours prior to the point of the term in which the preliminary exam was passed. Dissertation hours may be added retroactive - ly during the term in which the preliminary exam is passed, provided that an Admission to Candidacy Form has been filed with the Registrar during the same semester. Retroactive changes are only permitted if the preliminary exam is passed by the end of the 7th week of the semester. See the \"Academic Calendar\" in the Registration Guide for semester-specific deadlines. A min - imum of twenty-four dissertation hours is required for completion of the doctoral degree. Students admitted to doctoral candidacy must register for a minimum of two dissertation hours each term in which any work is being done on the dissertation, even after the minimum of twenty-four dissertation hours has been met. Students who are off campus must also register for at least two semester hours of dissertation each term in which they receive faculty super - vision or make use of university resources. To meet the Scholarly Engagement requirement, doctoral students should interact with faculty and peers in ways that may include enrolling in cours - es, attending seminars, symposia, and conferences; engaging in collaborative study and research beyond the university campus; and utilizing the library, laboratories, and other facilities provided by the University. The goal is to prepare students to be scholars who can independently acquire, evaluate, and extend knowledge, as well as develop themselves as effective communicators and disseminators of knowledge. The purpose of the Scholarly Engagement requirement is to ensure that doctoral students are active participants in the scholarly community. Each academic unit with a doctoral program should in - clude a program-specific statement in its Graduate Handbook describing how its students can meet the Scholarly Engagement requirement. Effective with all committees appointed after August 24, 2009, the PhD supervisory committee must meet the new minimum university standard of four members with Graduate Faculty Status (GFS). Included among these four members will be the University Representative who must hold not only GFS, but also be a tenured faculty member. Annually, this committee will assess in writing the progress of the student, making copies of its report available to the Dean of the Graduate School, department chair, and the student's aca - demic dean (Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences). Within a week of the dissertation defense, the University representative must file with the Dean of the Graduate School and the student's academic dean (Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences) a report on the dissertation and adherence to University procedures governing the defense. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCollege of Arts and Sciences 104 Final Term Registration Students must register for at least two semester hours of thesis or disser - tation credit in the final term in which a degree is granted.

Hartline; Associate Dean for Academic Programs: Kathleen A. McCullough; Associate Dean for College Operations : J. Dennis Cradit The College of Business is one of a select group of business programs in the country fully accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). This accreditation includes all undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs in business and separate accreditation of the bachelor's and master's programs in accounting. Since its beginning in 1950, the College of Business has developed into a major unit that provides quality business education for students employed in regional and national organizations. The faculty and programs of the col - lege are committed to educating and developing future business leaders and executives. This commitment to quality is reflected in three essential areas: a talented and dedicated faculty, an outstanding student body, and a close rela - tionship with the business community. Over the years, the College of Business has been successful in building a very capable and motivated business faculty. Faculty members throughout the several business disciplines are very produc - tive researchers and effective teachers. These faculty members also maintain important contacts with the business community through various types of ser - vice and applied research activities. As a result of capable and dedicated faculty, the College of Business has been able to attract highly qualified students. Business students have strong analytical and communicative aptitudes and have a spirit of enterprise and creativity. The interaction of these types of students with highly qualified busi - ness faculty, coupled with well-designed business program options, creates a stimulating learning environment. Lastly, the achievements of the College of Business have been recognized by the business community in the form of development funds for scholarships, endowed chairs, professorships, teaching and research grants, and other pro - gram activities.

The College has six academic units: 1. Department of Art 2. Department of Art Education 3. Department of Art History 4. Department of Interior Architecture and Design 5. School of Dance 6. School of Theatre These academic units offer an extensive program of instruction in all areas of the visual arts, theatre, and dance. In fact, nearly every level of undergradu - ate and graduate degree that a university can offer in these areas is represented within the College, including the established terminal degree in each disci - pline. Accordingly, the College is unique in the state of Florida. Enhancement of the fine and performing arts is one of Florida State University's specific goals as presented in its mission statement. The compre - hensive nature and consistent quality of the College may be credited in large part to the recognition and support for the arts evident in the University. The very idea of arts training within a university context is held to be fundamen - tally important to an individual's education in today's society. The College of Fine Arts shares much in common with an independent arts school, but the differences are more important than the similarities. The University strives toward education of the whole person, and it has a great variety of cultural and curricular resources to reach this end. Therefore, our students have the oppor - tunity to benefit from the entire University, a warm and friendly residential college and major graduate research institution. There is no substitute for this environment. The College promotes the visual arts, design, theatre, and dance within this community. Its goal is to provide a broad-based liberal arts education for students, while at the same time training them to be dancers, actors, designers, artists, scholars, teachers, or other professionals in the field. It functions to enrich their lives and to provide them with the means of self-expression in an increasingly complex and impersonal technological society\u2014a society ever more dependent upon visual language and information. The study and practice of the arts are therefore viewed as a necessary link in the educational system, both as a learning process and as a means of personal fulfillment. Measures are applied within the College\u2014and indeed throughout Florida State University's campus\u2014to keep the spirit of open inquiry vital and productive. Regardless of the department of a student's major, the College of Fine Arts provides an unusual opportunity for working with a distinguished faculty of nationally and internationally recognized artists and scholars, all of whom teach undergraduate as well as graduate students. Facilities In addition to the lecture rooms, general classrooms, seminar rooms, and media-specific laboratories (e.g., printmaking, electronic imaging, ceramics, sculpture, photography, digital fabrication, and the like), four specialized fa - cilities merit particular mention. First, art students in designated degree pro - grams are provided individual studios, making it possible for them to work in a healthy environment that promotes the cross-fertilization of ideas and con - structive debate. Students at different stages of development learn from each other as well as from their professors, who regularly come to their studios for tutorials and critiques. These studios are housed in the Carnaghi Arts Building. Second, dance students train in spacious, comfortable studios and perform in their own fully equipped professional dance theatre, experimental black box theatre, and grand studio; in addition, students explore dance technology in state-of-the-art labs, all within what are arguably the best university dance facilities in the country. Also, theatre students train and perform in four ven - ues, including two traditional proscenium theatres, a lab theatre, and a stage for student-produced works. Finally, students in art education, art history, and interior architecture and design work in specifically designed and dedicated spaces in the newly renovated William Johnston Building located in the center of campus. Interior Architecture & Design students in their junior, senior, and graduate years have dedicated studio space to enrich their interaction and the creative process.The Florida State University Museum of Fine Arts The Florida State University Museum of Fine Arts is first and foremost an extension of the teaching mission of the College. Large, modern, and well equipped, it houses the permanent collection and several times a year hosts faculty and student shows, including MFA graduate exhibitions. In addition, the school faculty and the museum staff pride themselves on originating shows of national prominence, documented through professional and scholarly cat - alogs, often complemented by the efforts of graduate students. The Florida State University Museum of Fine Arts is a community resource of regional significance in the Southeast and is fully accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Maggie Allesee National Center for Choreography The mission of the Maggie Allesee National Center for Choreography (MANCC) is to raise the value of the creative process in dance by provid - ing (1) a model of support for professional choreographic creativity within a comprehensive, graduate research university, (2) access to a stimulating envi - ronment where experimentation, exploration, and life-long learning are both valued and encouraged, and (3) opportunities for engagement with the creative process in dance to the national field as well as our students, staff, faculty, and community. Facility for Arts Research The Facility for Arts Research (FAR) offers space and specialized equip - ment for experimental printmaking, spatial audio, electronics, and digital fabrication to researchers, faculty, and students as part of a rigorous interdisci - plinary investigation into artmaking. FAR engages and educates 21st century makers in the collaborative, cross-disciplinary experiences of contemporary arts research, supporting and promoting the integration of digital and tradition - al art and design methods to create unique objects that might be impossible to make in other ways. Specialized Study in Museum Theory and Practice The College of Fine Arts, along with the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, the College of Human Sciences, and the College of Communication and Information, offers an interdisciplinary program in museum theory and practice. The program prepares graduate or postgraduate students who wish to supplement their academic knowledge with specific ex - pertise in the museum field. A strong emphasis is placed on preparing students for the profession with career guidance and planning, informal discussions with museum professionals, mentorships, and seminars on professional train - ing. The program is available to graduate students in art education, art history, interior design, theatre, arts administration, classics, dance, history, as well as information studies, and it will continue to attract disciplines as it expands. Program requirements consist of four core courses, a museum internship, and special projects and electives as determined by individual departments. Study Abroad The University offers many opportunities for international study open to all qualified state university students. Study-abroad programs range in nature from long-established study centers in Florence, Italy and London, England to recently developed programs in Spain and France. Operated by Florida State University, they provide the opportunity for a truly rewarding educational and cultural experience. Representing as it does a collegial body of students of the arts, the College of Fine Arts has had a particular affinity for the Florence program, one which has led to a history of involvement since the founding of the program in 1966, largely through the efforts of the art history faculty. In every year that it has existed, at least one member of the College faculty has taught in Florence, and the College has significant representation among the students studying there. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on the opportunities at the London and Valencia Centers. Of particular signifi - cance to students of theatre is the London program, with its year-round theatre offerings. Students of theatre, art, dance, design, and art history flourish in the rich, humanistic environments of these magnificent cities and cultural centers. This they can do usually without disrupting their sequence of courses and without loss of residency since the Florence, London, and Valencia campuses are true extensions of the Tallahassee campus. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCollege of Fine Arts 128 Athanor For the past thirty-five years the College has published Athanor , a well-re - spected art history journal which presents scholarly articles by graduate stu - dents from universities across the nation. The journal results in part from an art history graduate student symposium conducted on campus each year. It is attended by students whose papers have been accepted for presentation and by distinguished art historians invited to address the symposium and to respond to the papers. This event proves to be of particular value to graduate students in art and art history. Requirements of the College Individuals seeking admission to one of the programs in the College should consult the appropriate General Bulletin and the department regarding admis - sion processes and standards.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin The Graduate School 129 THE GRADUATE SCHOOL Graduate Dean: Mark Riley; Senior Associate Dean: Judith Deans: Lisa Liseno, Adrienne Stephenson The University's first graduate degree was a Master of Science (MS) de - gree in psychology that was awarded to Barbara Elizabeth James in 1903.

Scott Dunn The Florida State University College of Medicine is fully accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association to provide a four- year program of study leading to the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. The MD degree is a requirement for admission to medical residency programs and is a prerequisite for taking the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 3, and a prerequisite for licensure for the practice of medicine in the United States. Steps 1 and 2 of the USMLE are taken during medical school. The mission of the College of Medicine is to educate and develop exem - plary physicians who practice patient-centered health care, discover and ad - vance knowledge, and are responsive to community needs, especially through service to elder, rural, minority, and underserved populations. The third- and fourth-year curriculum is primarily in ambulatory settings and focuses on pre - paring students to deliver primary care for Florida's underserved senior, rural, minority and inner-city populations. However, the Florida State University College of Medicine student selection process and the comprehensive physi - cian training program do not exclude students interested in specialty medicine, as specialty training is a required part of the curriculum. The Florida State University College of Medicine (FSUCOM) was created in June 2000 by a legislative act, Florida House Bill 1121/Senate Bill 1692, to serve the unique needs of the citizens of the state of Florida. The Program in Medical Sciences (PIMS), founded in 1971 as an expansion program of the University of Florida College of Medicine, is the foundation upon which The Florida State University medical school is built. During the first two years of medical school, the basic sciences and early clinical exposure are taught at Florida State University and housed in the John E. Thrasher College of Medicine Building. Years three and four are communi - ty-based and focus on clinical training. The community-based model ensures that students receive training in a variety of practice settings including ru - ral and inner-city hospitals, nursing homes, residency programs, clinics, and doctors' offices. Clinical training sites are located in Tallahassee, Pensacola, Orlando, Sarasota, Daytona Beach, Ft. Pierce, several Family Medicine Residency Programs, Marianna, Immokalee, and several other rural commu - nities. Students are connected to the College of Medicine and the respective regional campuses through Internet access, videoconferencing and hand-held data units. Through these units, students can access medical information, com - municate with the College of Medicine main campus, and record and evaluate their clerkship and preceptorship experiences. The John E. Thrasher Building at the College of Medicine houses the ed - ucational program. It serves as the hub for the extensive electronic network connecting all faculty and students at several locations throughout Florida. Basic medical science and clinical training courses that utilize state-of-the- art technology and nationally recognized academicians and clinicians at The Florida State University College of Medicine and at clinical sites elsewhere in Florida have been established. The Medical Library The Florida State University Charlotte Edwards Maguire Medical Library was developed as a twenty-first century library with over ninety-five percent of its resources delivered in electronic format for access twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week from desktops, laptops, or PDAs anywhere the student or faculty member is located. FSU students and faculty have access to over 2,100 MEDLINE journals and other medical journals specifically selected by faculty. These subscribed journals provide access to 6.2 million full-text articles appearing in PubMed. Approximately 400 electronic medical reference and textbooks are licensed both for the College of Medicine and the University. New and emerging evidence-based medicine Websites and PDA products are especially suited to the electronic environment because they are continually updated and summarize the latest medical treatments and proto - cols. To name a few, the library licenses InfoRetriever, DynaMed, ePocrates, Clinical Evidence, ACP Pier, PepID, and the Cochrane databases. The physi - cal facility of the Maguire Medical Library is located in the John E. Thrasher Building at the College of Medicine. The library holds a small core collection of print reference and textbooks and provides ample individual study space for students. As part of a larger university system, the students and faculty of the College of Medicine also have access to a broad range of electronic resources that support disciplines related to the medical curriculum and research inter - ests of the college, such as psychology, health policy, aging studies, nutrition, exercise, and sports medicine. These resources include databases as well as large collections of e-books and e-journals. Overall, 48,000 electronic serial titles and approximately 400,000 e-books are available to COM students and faculty for both on-campus and remote access. Medical students also have access to the Paul M. Dirac Library and the Robert Manning Strozier Library of Florida State University. The Clinical Learning Center The Clinical Learning Center, located in the John E. Thrasher Building at the College of Medicine, is a state-of-the-art teaching and assessment center that provides opportunities for medical students to learn clinical skills in a sim - ulated clinical setting. Students learn and practice hands-on clinical skills in a supportive environment that incorporates the latest and best innovations in in - teractive medical technology and education. Fourteen examination rooms and two consultation rooms are equipped with audio-visual resources to record student-patient interactions for teaching and evaluation. Using standardized patients trained to portray an actual patient by simulating an illness or other physical findings, the Clinical Learning Center provides support for faculty in small group sessions to help teach students communication and physical exam skills. The Office of Advising and Outreach The Office of Advising and Outreach, located in the John E. Thrasher Building at the College of Medicine, provides pre-health advising and coun - seling to all Florida State University students who are interested in pursuing careers in the health sciences.

The pre-clerkship coursework (years one and two) takes place on the Florida State University main campus and is designed to provide students with essential basic science and general clinical information necessary for their clinical training in years three and four. Students study a core curriculum to help develop an understanding of the structure and function of the human system. The structure and function of the healthy human is studied in the first year. During the second year, emphasis is placed on microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, and general therapeutic principles for the \"sick\" human. The basic science and clinical instructors use a combination of small group and lecture-based instruction. The third and fourth years are devoted to required and elective clinical clerkship rotations of two to eight weeks, most of which take place at one of the College of Medicine Regional Medical School campuses. Hospitals, phy - sicians' offices, neighborhood clinics, residency programs, and public health units are used as training sites in which students actively participate in the clin - ical setting. Up to twenty-four weeks (minimum sixteen weeks) in the fourth year are devoted to student electives in which students are able to choose among select rotations including subspecialty rotations. Twelve weeks must be spent in FSUCOM sponsored electives at any of the College of Medicine sites. The remaining twelve weeks can be spent in an elective study at any accredited medical school or approved clinical setting in the United States. In select cases, consideration may be given to limited international electives with prior approval. The FSU College of Medicine trains students in allopathic medicine, which includes diagnosing, managing, and treating disease. The college confers upon its graduates the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD). Upon completion of the four-year MD educational program, these physicians pursue graduate medical education (internship, residency, and sometimes fellowships), which is nec - essary for eventual licensure. Training in residency programs may take from three to nine additional years after completion of medical school. To earn the MD degree a student must complete all required coursework and clerkships in years one through four, including a minimum of sixteen weeks of electives in the fourth year; complete all required surveys and eval - uations; pass the USMLE Step 1, Step 2 CK, and Step 2 CS; pass an OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) at the end of the third year clerk - ship rotations (graduation OSCE); complete all requirements in the procedures log; remain in good standing and maintain a passing grade in each course or clerkship. Further information may be found in the online College of Medicine Student Handbook at https://med.fsu.edu/sites/default/files/userFiles/file/ StudentHandbook.pdf . As part of the academic and clinical curriculum, the College of Medicine emphasizes the importance of the professional and ethical development of all medical students. The College of Medicine expects professional behavior of physicians in training in all academic activities and when interacting with patients, colleagues, faculty, and staff. Professional behavior encompasses understanding of and adherence to all aspects of the academic honor code, as well as altruism, accountability, caring, compassion, devotion to duty, the practice of excellent medical care, and respect for others. These qualities and behaviors are evaluated throughout the student's four years at the College of Medicine. In conferring the Doctor of Medicine degree, the Florida State University College of Medicine certifies that the student is competent, knowl - edgeable, and possesses those personal traits essential to practicing the art and science of medicine. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Biomedical Sciences Program The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Biomedical Sciences Program is de - signed to prepare the next generation of health scientists for medical research and teaching in an era of increasing coordination and integration of traditional disciplines. The College of Medicine grants the PhD in Biomedical Sciences through an interdisciplinary program with the goal of training students to conduct research in the broad area of the molecular basis of human disease, including the function of the human genome in development, neurobiology, aging, cancer, and other disease. Undergraduate majors in biology, biochem - istry, chemistry, microbiology, or other life sciences are suitable for graduate studies in biomedical sciences. The curriculum for the Biomedical Sciences degree includes core courses in statistics and ethics in research, as well as specialized biomedical course -work and laboratory research. Laboratory rotation in at least two laboratories during the first year is a degree requirement. The direction and supervision of graduate work at the doctoral level resides primarily with the major pro - fessor and supervisory committee, which is comprised of four faculty mem - bers. Research rotations during the first year allow students to make informed choices regarding the research area and major professor with whom they will conduct their PhD work. A core curriculum of the fundamentals, the choice of electives from other departments, and intellectual interaction with faculty and postdoctoral fellows encourage graduate students to mature into independent scientists. To be considered for graduation from the FSUCOM with the PhD in Biomedical Sciences, the student must successfully complete all course re - quirements within five calendar years from the time the student gains admit - tance to candidacy by passing the preliminary exam. Other requirements for graduation include attending the Health Science Seminar Series, successfully completing the preliminary doctoral examination, submitting a doctoral re - search proposal approved by the major professor and the supervisory com - mittee after admission to doctoral candidacy, registering for a minimum of twenty-four semester hours of dissertation credit, and submitting, publicly presenting, and successfully defending a dissertation.

All Performance Majors 1. Performance and research requirements consist of two one-hour public recitals, one studio recital or lecture/demonstration, one performance of operatic role (voice majors only), and three chamber works (on the same or different program). Students are also required to write a research treatise on a subject related to their major field. For voice performance majors with an opera emphasis, the requirements are one public recital, two major opera roles, and one lecture recital/project. Opera emphasis students should consult with their major professor regarding the treatise or non-treatise track. For voice performance majors with a pedagogy emphasis, the requirements are one public recital, one lecture recital, one chamber works recital, an extended research treatise on a subject related to pedagogy, advanced foreign language study, and an expanded comprehensive examination which includes voice teaching. For piano performance majors with an accompanying/chamber music emphasis, the requirements are two vocal accompanying recitals, two instrumental chamber music recitals, lecture recital, and the research treatise. The treatise is a formal, scholarly, written document incorporating original research conducted by the student. A prospectus should be submitted to and approved by the supervisory committee in advance (usually done at the preliminary examination). With regards to the treatise, DM students may select one of two approaches: Option 1. The student completes an original research document consisting of a minimum of 12,000 words (not including supplementary matter such as title page, table of contents, lists of figures, bibliography and appendices). Option 2. The student completes an original research document consisting of a minimum of 6,000 words (not including supplementary matter such as title page, table of contents, lists of figures, bibliography and appendices). In addition, the student performs an additional Lecture Recital (MV_ 6987) for 1 to 4 credits. Typically, this second lecture recital is related to the content of the written document. Note: a. All treatise submission requirements of the FSU Graduate School and all University deadlines are applicable to both of the options above.b. Following submission of the completed treatise to the supervisory committee, an oral defense with the committee is required. The treatise defense is normally held after completion of all recitals and submission of the treatise to the advisory committee. Students must register for MUS 8985 Treatise Defense during the semester in which the defense is conducted (normally the semester of graduation). c. Guidelines for selection of music for lecture recitals are determined by each area or the supervisory committee. Guidelines may include consideration of genre and historical periods or other aspects an area might determine. 2. The preliminary examination is administered under University- wide regulations and must be completed at least six months prior to graduation. 3. The dissertation requirement is satisfied by registration for the recitals and the research treatise. The examination in defense of dissertation is satisfied by the examinations administered prior to recitals and by the defense of research treatise. Examination in Defense of Dissertation and Treatise The defense of the dissertation/treatise will be oral. Responsibility for sug - gesting the time, designating the place, and presiding at the examination rests with the major professor. It is recommended that students defend no later than the eighth week of classes in the semester of intent to graduate. Students must defend by no later than the Format Approval Deadline in the semester of intent to graduate. Consult the Graduate School Canvas site for more information as format approval deadlines may change somewhat depending on the year. Academic courtesy requires that the dissertation/treatise be submitted to each member of the supervisory committee at least four weeks before the date of the oral examination. The supervisory committee, the chair of the major department, and such other members of the faculty as may be appointed by the academic dean will conduct the examination. All members of the grad - uate faculty are invited to attend. At least two weeks prior to the date of the examination, the student or major professor will present an announcement of the dissertation/treatise title and the date and place of the examination to the Graduate School. Consult the Registration Guide for the deadline dates. All committee members and the student must attend the entire defense in real time, either by being physically present or participating via distance tech - nology (e.g., Skype or Zoom). If exceptional emergency circumstances, (e.g., medical or other emergency situations), prevent the participation of a commit - tee member, then it may be necessary to arrange for an additional appropri - ately qualified colleague to attend the defense. A minimum of four members with Graduate Faculty Status must participate. The oral examining committee will certify in writing to the academic dean of the major department the results of the examination: passed, failed, or to be reexamined. The report of results following a reexamination must indicate the student either passed or failed. To receive a passing grade, the written dissertation/treatise must be in final form or require only minor revisions at the time of the defense. A grade of PASS for the defense of treatise or dissertation requires at least a majority approval of the committee, and the committee must sign the Doctoral Exam Form for the College of Music file. In addition, if the student passes, each member must sign the Manuscript Signature Form to substantiate the results of the defense. It is the responsibility of the major professor to submit this completed form either directly to the clearance advisor or to the appropriate college or depart - mental office for subsequent delivery to the clearance advisor in the Graduate School. A written critique of the conduct of the examination in defense of the dissertation/treatise should be submitted by the university representative from the graduate faculty to the College of Music academic dean and the dean of the Graduate School within one week after the date of defense. The degree cannot be awarded until both forms have been received by the Graduate School and the final version of the manuscript has been submitted to and approved by the clearance advisor. The final version of the dissertation/treatise that is approved by the supervi - sory committee must be submitted electronically to the university manuscript clearance advisor in the Graduate School within sixty days of the defense date or the student must re-defend. A manuscript processing fee is charged.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin College of Nursing 147 COLLEGE OF NURSING Graduate Interim Dean: Laurie Grubbs The mission of the College of Nursing is to educate clinicians, leaders, scholars, and advanced practitioners who can enhance the quality of life for people of all cultures, economic levels, and geographic locations.

Craig Stanley; Associate Dean for Research: TBA The College of Social Work has a long standing tradition of excellence. Dr. Raymond F. Bellamy, professor of sociology from 1918 to 1956, first in - troduced social welfare content into the curriculum in 1926. Dr. Coyle Moore later became the first Dean of the School of Social Welfare which was estab - lished in 1949. By the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression, undergraduate courses in casework and group work were offered, as well as internships at the Leon County Welfare Association and the Leon County Unemployment Relief Council. In June 1973, the social work program became identified as the School of Social Work and in 2005 it received the designation of College of Social Work, offering social work degrees at the baccalaureate, master's, and doctor - al levels. The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) initially accredited the MSW degree program in 1950. The baccalaureate program was among the first of such programs accredited by CSWE in 1974. The PhD program in social work was approved by the Florida Board of Regents in 1974 and accepted its first student in fall of that year. There are presently approximately 226 undergraduates and 984 graduate students enrolled in the College, with thirty-seven faculty members. More than thirty students are engaged in active study for the PhD in social work. Administratively, the College is directed by a Dean and two Associate Deans. Other administrative faculty is responsible for the BSW, MSW, PhD programs, international programs, and field education. Faculty committees oversee most areas of College functioning, with student representatives on most of these committees. U.S. World and News Report ranks Florida State University's College of Social Work amongst the top Colleges of Social Work programs in the country and the most highly ranked College in the state of Florida. We are dedicated to the preparation of the outstanding social workers of tomorrow. The College offers an up-to-date, rigorous, academic curriculum and carefully selected internships that provide students with the opportunity to put into action the conceptual and practice aspects of social work. Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) The College of Social Work adheres to accreditation standards estab - lished by the Council on Social Work Education. These standards are referred to as EPAS and were voted and put into effect December 2015 (replacing 2008 EPAS).

Field Education Director of Campus-Based Field Education : Katrina Boone, MSW; Director of Online Field Education: Rosalyn Deckerhoff, MSW The purpose of field education is to provide students with a structured learning opportunity for development and reinforcement of appropriate levels of competence in the field of social work. Field education allows students to apply knowledge, values, and skills learned in the classroom to social work practice settings. As students undertake learning tasks within the reality of agency life, a vehicle is established whereby knowledge and theories can be applied, attitudes and values examined, and skills developed and refined. The field education component of the College of Social Work is designed to ensure that each student completes a high quality educational experience in a supervised agency placement. This learning experience is designed to enhance a student's ability to integrate theory into effective evidence-based social work practice, broaden the range of skills for performing social work functions, and strengthen awareness of attitudes, motivations, and judgments identified with the profession of social work. The Office of Field Education selects field placements based on the potential for providing the range and depth of learning experiences necessary to achieve the educational objec - tives established for those students. Agencies affiliating with the College of Social Work represent the diversity found in social services throughout our community. The College offers a wide array of internships in both public and private agencies, and with diverse populations of clients so that students will be provided opportunities for exposure to a wide range of social work roles and learning tasks.

Many Master of Accounting alumni hold important positions in major accounting firms, consulting, industry, gov - ernment, and nonprofit organizations. Doctoral graduates are faculty members at some of the nation's leading universities. The accounting faculty is recognized nationally for excellence in teach - ing and research. Faculty members have expertise in a wide variety of areas including financial accounting and reporting, managerial accounting, govern - mental accounting, accounting information systems, assurance services, and taxation. The department maintains close relationships with alumni and the account - ing profession. These relationships provide students the opportunity to interact with professionals and to become more familiar with the accounting environ - ment in business. The external support of alumni and friends of the accounting program provides for many enhancements of the learning environment, which result in Florida State University maintaining one of the leading accounting programs in the country.

Demand for MAcc graduates has been strong in the past and is expected to continue to be strong in the foreseeable future.

ADULT EDUCATION: see Educational Leadership and Policy Studies ADVERTISING: see Communication AFRICAN HISTORY: see General Bulletin; History AFRO-AMERICAN STUDIES: see General BulletinGraduate Department of ANTHROPOLOGY Pullen The Department of Anthropology offers graduate education for students with an interest in archaeology, physical anthropology, and cultural anthropol - ogy. Faculty members are concentrated on research in the greater Southeastern United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Mesoamerica, and the Mediterranean. Course work and research experiences are available in prehistoric and his - toric archaeology, underwater archaeology, geoarchaeology, zooarchaeology, environmental archeology, climate change and cultural heritage, sociocultural anthropology, folklore, economic anthropology, and osteology. The Florida State University, through the Department of Anthropology, is the host institution for the Southeast Archeological Center (SEAC), which is responsible for archaeological research and collections from U.S. National Park Service installations throughout the southeastern United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The SEAC collections exceed three million items and span the period from Paleoindian to the twentieth century. The cen - ter offices and laboratories are located in Innovation Park, southwest of the main campus. As the capital of the state, Tallahassee also is home to the Department of State, which is responsible for cultural resources in Florida. The Florida Master Site File, the Bureau of Archaeological Research, the National Register of Historic Places, and Florida Folklife Programs are administered by the Department of State. The U.S. Forest Service and the State Park Service have offices in Tallahassee. Students have found internships and employment in all of these agencies. Training and field experience are available in archaeology field and lab methods (terrestrial and underwater), physical anthropology, forensic scienc - es, and ethnography. Programs sponsored by other Florida State University departments of interest to anthropology students include courses offered in Classical Archaeology (Department of Classics), Geographical Information Systems (Department of Geography), computational forensics (Scientific Computing), historical administration (Department of History), Museum and Cultural Heritage Studies (Department of Art History), ethnomusicolo - gy (College of Music), international and multicultural education (College of Education), Digital/Data Humanities (Program in Interdisciplinary Humanities), and Emergency Management and Homeland Security (Center for Disaster Risk Policy). General Information Assistantships To remain eligible for an assistantship after the first academic year, and in each subsequent year, a student must perform the assigned duties satisfactorily as determined by the Graduate Program Director and maintain a \"good stand - ing\" status. The department's criteria for \"good standing\" are: 1. the student must not have received a grade below a \"B\" in any anthropology course; 2. the student must have a satisfactory GA performance evaluation; 3. the student may not have any incomplete grades older than one semester; and 4. the student must pass the departmental master's comprehensive examinations on the first attempt. Master's students who are not in good standing are not eligible for contin - ued support as a graduate assistant beyond their initial 9-month appointment. In other words, master's students who are not in good standing after their first two semesters in the graduate program will no longer be eligible for depart - mental funding. Assistantships are subject to the Constitution and laws of the State of Florida and the United States, the regulations of the University, and the Collective Bargaining Agreement between Florida State University and the United Faculty of Florida - Florida State University - Graduate Assistants United (UFF-FSU-GAU). All graduate assistants at FSU work under the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiated by the UFF-FSU-GAU and the Florida State University Board of Trustees. UFF-FSU-GAU is the labor union 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityAnthropology 158 certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduate assistants at FSU.

Fieldwork: FSU Anthropology faculty offer terrestrial and underwater field schools and expect and encourage graduate students to enroll in them. 9. Underwater Archaeology: If a student wishes to do underwater archaeological research, they will need to be an American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) diver with FSU. If the student is already an AAUS diver at their current institution, they will need to get a VOT (Verification of Training) from their Diving Safety Officer (DSO) transferred to FSU's DSO Chris Peters, cpeters@fsu.edu . Contact Chris to start making arrangements. If a student is not an AAUS diver already, they will need to take the scientific diving course offered in the Spring semester. To take this course, the student will need to already be certified as an open water diver with any diving agency. Contact Chris Peters ( cpeters@fsu.edu ) or Dr. Jessi Halligan ( jhalligan@fsu.edu ) for more information. Register of Professional Archaeologists Students concentrating in archaeology are encouraged to read the current standards of the Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA). It is expected that students will keep documentation of their field and lab work experienc - es so that they may successfully apply for certification at the completion of the master's degree. Below are the basic requirements for RPA membership. Additional information and application instructions can be found at https:// rpanet.org/ . There are four basic requirements to become a member of the Register of Professional Archaeologists:1. The applicant must have an advanced degree (such as an MA, MS, PhD, or DSc) from an accredited institution in archaeology, anthropology, art history, classics, history, or other germane discipline with a specialization in archaeology. 2. As part of that advanced degree, the applicant must have designed and executed an archaeological study and have reported on that research in the form of a master's thesis and/or PhD dissertation. The thesis or dissertation must show a substantive data analysis by the applicant directed toward an explicit archaeological research problem. 3. The applicant must accept the responsibilities and standards described in the Code of Conduct, Standards of Research Performance, and Grievance Procedures of the Register of Professional Archaeologists. 4. If the applicant has an advanced degree as described above, but the thesis/dissertation did not include specific research on an archaeological topic and a substantive data analysis on that topic, and the applicant can document a similar research project with data analysis equivalent to that required for a thesis or dissertation through another report or publication, application can still be made by use of the documentation of such other reports or publications. Standards of Performance The department is responsible for ensuring that students meet standards of behavior that are congruent with expectations of the anthropological profes - sion, as outlined in the American Anthropological Association's Principles of Professional Responsibility, the Society for American Archaeology's Principles of Archaeological Ethics, and the Register of Professional Archaeologists' Codes of Ethics & Professional Standards. Students are also expected to comply with the FSU Academic Honor Policy (https://fda.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/imported/storage/original/application/0ab8e - 9de6a98c1377d68de9717988bda.pdf ) and the FSU Student Conduct Code (https://dsst.fsu.edu ). Academic Performance Standards A student is expected to: 1. Maintain required grades for their academic program. 2. Correct any deficiencies related to academic probation within one semester. 3.

The faculty members of each subfield will work together to create the format and standard set of exam questions. All subfield faculty members will be responsible for grading the exams from their respective subfield within 15 days of the completion of the comprehensive exams. 2. Comprehensive exams will be taken as follows: Archaeology and Cultural will be taken at the beginning of the Spring semester of the student's first year (this assumes the student completed the corresponding Graduate Core Seminars the previous semester); the Physical comprehensive exam will be taken at the end of the Spring semester in which the student takes the Graduate Physical Anthropology Core Seminar. 3. Students will enroll in ANG 8966 Master's Comprehensive Exams in the Spring semester in which they take the exams. The Graduate Program Director will be the faculty of record. 4. Students must pass all three comprehensive exams in order to progress to the prospectus and thesis stage. 5. If a student fails any exam, they will have the option for one more attempt at each failed exam. The student must re-take each failed exam within 45 days of the first attempt, at a date and time agreed upon by the student, Graduate Program Director, and subfield faculty members. Faculty members of the subfield will write new exam questions for the re-take exam and grade them within 15 days. 6. Students who fail any portion of their comprehensive exams on their first attempt will be placed on departmental probation and will not be eligible for funding in the subsequent academic semester. 7. If a student fails the same comprehensive exam twice they will not be able to remain in the graduate program. Graduate Reading Lists Graduate reading lists in cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, and archaeology are included as part of the graduate handbook. Schedule of Classes Usually by mid-semester, the department staff assembles the schedule of classes for the upcoming semester. The list will be available on-line by the university, however, the department version is available earlier and may be obtained from the Graduate Director. A one-year proposed schedule of classes is included in the graduate hand - book to facilitate planning. Please note however, that courses can change de - pending on faculty schedules and the teaching needs of the department. Some classes are offered with greater frequency than others. Many classes are on a two-to-three-year rotation.Plan of Course Work The student, with his or her faculty advisor, should plot out several years of course work using the two-year proposed schedule of courses. This process should begin early in the Fall semester and should be updated or revised each semester. A copy of the form is included in the graduate handbook. Thesis The student shall choose a thesis committee consisting minimally of his or her major advisor and two additional regular faculty members, one of whom may be from another department within the university. Following the success - ful completion of the comprehensive examination, the student will present, within three months, a thesis prospectus to be approved and signed by his or her committee and placed on file in the department. This prospectus will con - tain a description of the proposed research and whatever other information and materials the student's committee deems appropriate. The student will work with his/her committee to complete the thesis and meet for an oral defense of the thesis. Graduate Students with an Interest in Underwater Archaeology Underwater archaeology at FSU is focused upon the discovery, excavation, and interpretation of inundated terrestrial sites, and therefore is methodologi - cally oriented towards geoarchaeology and earth sciences research. Students entering the Department of Anthropology to earn the Master of Arts or Master of Science degree are advised that courses in underwater ar - chaeology are available, but these courses and technical preparation in this specialty will require additional time in the degree program. The usual course load for graduate students is twelve credit hours per semester. Most courses provide three hours credit, but techniques and field courses may carry more credit. A minimum of thirty-one semester hours is required for the MA or MS degree. Students with no previous experience in either terrestrial archaeology or diving techniques can expect to graduate with significantly more (field and dive) hours than the average student. Students who wish to participate in diving must be certified as an AAUS Science Diver through the Academic Diving Program at FSU. Students must have current First Aid and CPR training including training in AED and Oxygen Administrator training. Students with no previous diving preparation are advised to take a diving certification course during the summer before admission to graduate studies at Florida State University or to take the PEN 1136 course for elementary diving certification during the first semester of registration (Fall). Because the PEN course is a 1000-level undergraduate course, it must be taken in addition to the regular course load. Tuition waivers, available to graduate students with assistantships or fellowships, do not apply to courses at this level. Students with basic diving certification must, after admission to graduate studies, be evaluated by the Academic Diving Program as a first step in be - coming certified as an AAUS Science Diver. FSU offers the following course for students wishing to become a certified AAUS Science Diver in order to take underwater archaeology courses or to participate in underwater archaeol - ogy courses: BSC 5476C, Introduction to Scientific Diving (3). Students with no previous terrestrial archaeological field school experi - ence are advised to enroll in a summer field school prior to entering graduate studies at Florida State University or enroll in the department Field School in Archaeology (ANG 5824, 9 hours credit) as soon as appropriate for their courses of study.

APPLIED BIOLOGY: see Biological Science; Nursing ARABIC LANGUAGE: see Modern Languages and LinguisticsGraduate Department of ART College of fine Rutkovsky, Stewart The Department of Art offers a course of study leading to the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree. The program is national in orientation and contrib - utes to the cultural life of the University, the Tallahassee community, and the state of Florida. The strength of the department lies in the excellence of its artist-faculty members and their commitment to the personal practice of art as a vital part of a university. A major role of the University is to maintain and develop a sense of re - search and inquiry. Within this context, students of the department are taught how to approach and solve visual problems in two and three dimensions. The program has several general goals: to stimulate students to the free expression of their creative ideas, to provide instruction in the skills and techniques neces - sary to this expression, to develop strong critical and self-reflective skills, and to guide students to an understanding of contemporary issues in the visual arts. The curriculum of the Department of Art is largely designed to train pro - fessional studio artists, giving students the discipline, artistic, and critical un - derstanding required for life as practitioners. Students develop the capacity for creative thinking and a sense of open inquiry, together with a thorough aware - ness of the multiplicity of new and traditional principles, thus enabling them to make a valuable contribution as artists, teachers, or arts administrators.

Media It is the graduate student's responsibility, in concert with his or her facul - ty, to find the appropriate media with which to express an original aesthetic vision. Work may be done in ceramics, electronic media, design, drawing, painting, performance, photography, printmaking, sculpture, video or any combination. The studio workshop class structure and interdisciplinary free - dom that is part of the departmental philosophy allow the ideas to dictate the medium that students use. Student and Faculty Responsibilities Just as the primary responsibility rests with the students to find their own appropriate media, they are also expected to find an articulate visual language. The MFA program is for those persons who are ambitious and willing to grow as artists. As students, they must search for their own appropriate media and work toward becoming fluid practitioners in art. The faculty is challenged to respond to the students' individual needs, helping them in their search for a personal position in their work. The representative career choices for graduates in studio art include: pro - fessional studio artist (painter, sculptor, photographer, ceramicist, printmaker, multimedia artist, digital arts artist), designer, creative director, illustrator, and production artist, to name the most obvious. Some graduates of the MFA program choose careers in college teaching, while others pursue careers as exhibiting artists or freelance designers. Additionally, the program fosters in - terdisciplinary research and investigation, preparing artists who can embrace unknowable future career options. Faculty members are proactive in assisting students with individual professional goals both during and after their degree. Facilities The department is housed in five locations, including large spaces convert - ed to studio spaces and equipped to meet the needs of working artists. All MFA students are provided with a suitable space to work. In these spaces, students participate in group seminar classes and individual tutorials, and faculty mem - bers will typically visit the studio to talk about specific problems suggested by the work, or they may bring up more general artistic issues or technical problems. These discussions may be formal reviews with the student's thesis committee or may be very informal. A rich dialogue always occurs among students. Graduate students also have access to the department's photography labs, sculpture labs, computer labs, digital fabrication labs, printmaking labs, sound and video editing lab, and installation rooms. The Facility for Arts Research (FAR) is a research facility that provides graduate students with an opportu - 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityArt 162 nity to work with visiting artists and researchers on projects that investigate the integration of digital technologies with traditional processes. The Working Method Contemporary Gallery provides an exhibition space devoted to reg - ular MFA exhibitions while also serving other departmental uses. This space offers monthly exhibition opportunities with excellent public exposure. Visiting Artist and Scholar Program The Department of Art recognizes the value of presenting diverse experi - ences to our students; the visiting artist and scholar program is essential to this goal. An active visiting artist and scholar program brings in artists, designers, and critics from all parts of the country who are experts in their field. They will usually give a public lecture, as well as student critiques, seminars, and work - shops. The University's annual celebration of Opening Nights Performing Arts also brings prominent artists, critics, and historians to the campus. Museum of Fine Arts (MoFA) The Museum of Fine Arts is an integral part of the educational mission of the department. It has a tradition of originating exhibitions of important contemporary and historical issues, as well as bringing to the community some of the best shows other galleries have originated. The program regularly in - cludes national and regional competitions and invitational, faculty, and student exhibitions, along with lectures and symposia devoted to significant develop - ments in art history and art criticism. Graduating students display their thesis exhibitions in the museum. The University and the city offer a variety of other exhibition spaces. Academic Study Academic study is an essential part of the MFA program. A broad range of art history or other academic courses are available to help provide depth of understanding of fundamental artistic issues. Financial Assistance The art department offers financial support in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, and technical or laboratory assistantships. Those who are interested in a teaching assistantship are required to take a college art teaching course prior to the award. Technical assistantships may be awarded to first-year, second-year, and/or third-year students. Teaching assistantships may be awarded in the second and/or third year of residency except in the case of students with a master's degree or equivalent teaching experience, who may be awarded a teaching assistantship earlier. Financial assistance is awarded based on merit. For more specific information, see the \"Financial Information\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Graduate Students are also eligible for the following: Legacy Fellowships worth $10,000 per year for three years Requirements Admission In addition to University admission requirements, the department requires that all applicants submit a portfolio of up to twenty images of recent original work and an artist's statement describing and contextualizing the work sub - mitted for review.

Program The MFA is a terminal degree for those who wish to practice studio art, teach at the college level, or function in a curatorial role. It is a three-year residency with a minimum requirement of sixty semester hours at the graduate level. The program includes a minimum of forty-two semester hours in studio art, nine hours of electives within or outside the department, and a minimum of three courses (nine hours) in academic study at the graduate level. A minimum of nine hours of the forty-two studio art hours must go towards preparation of the graduate thesis exhibition and written component. All students are required to write a thesis paper as part of their graduation thesis exhibition. The thesis paper defines the intensive research leading up to the thesis exhibition and cites the student's artwork within a larger context.Review Process The student progresses through the MFA program by passing a series of reviews held each semester. During these reviews, students present their work and engage in a constructive dialogue with the faculty. The students must pass their final formal committee reviews in conjunction with their thesis exhibi - tion; students who do not pass are required to resubmit their work at a later time. For specific details regarding reviews, please go to the MF A Handbook https://art.fsu.edu/programs-2/graduate/ .

Close faculty-student relationships In general, there are two major roles in the fields of art education, art ther - apy, museum education, and arts administration for which advanced graduate studies have relevance. The first role is that of practitioner in which the art professional concentrates on teaching, supervision, clinical, or administrative practice. The second role is one in which it is the task of the art professional to produce historical, philosophical, or scientific theory applicable to art educa - tion, art therapy, museum education, and arts administration. The doctoral program may lead to either the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) or Doctor of Education (EdD) degree. Many of the recipients of the doctoral de - gree are now teaching on the faculties of colleges and universities throughout the United States as well as internationally, or are administering arts programs in educational or arts institutions and agencies. Doctoral Degree Program of Studies The four major area specialties in which the program is divided anticipate the spectrum of scholarship in this expanding field. The degrees are classified under two different majors; Art Education or Museum Education and Visitor Centered Curation. The student may also choose a concentration from one of the following areas of inquiry: art education, art therapy, museum education, or arts administration. Residency requirements for the doctor of philosophy degree (Ph.D.) & doctor of education degree (Ed.D.): After earning a master's degree, you must be continuously enrolled on the University campus or in one of its teaching centers for a minimum of 18 graduate semester hours in any period of 12 con - secutive months.

Transition Program for Non-Chemical or Non-Biomedical Engineering Majors The Graduate Committee of the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering has instituted an accelerated transition program for prospective graduate students who are non-Chemical or non-Biomedical Engineering Majors. These students should follow the Summer preparatory curricu - lum shown below in order to formally enter the FAMU-FSU Chemical and Biomedical Engineering graduate program. More details are available online at the departmental Website. Target Applicants and Eligibility 1. Applicants with non-ChE or non-BME BS degrees in engineering. 2. Applicants with Physics BS degrees. 3. Applicants with Chemistry, Biochemistry, or Biology BS degrees having strong math skills (through Ordinary Differential Equations). Transition Program Requirements The transition program requires that students take one online course and one accelerated transition course during the preparatory Summer prior to tak - ing the graduate core courses offered in the Fall semester, as follows: 1. ACS online course or equivalent - \"Beakers to Barrels: Chemical Engineering for Chemists\" Online Short Course. This course will be replaced in subsequent years by a departmental online course; 2. Graduate preparatory course - combined summer course of Mass and Energy Balances, Transport I and II, and Thermodynamics for accelerated preparation of entering students. Two three credit hour six-week courses (Summer terms B and C) will be taken during the Summer before core ECH/BME coursework; and 3. Required completion of the graduate section of ECH 4504: Kinetics and Reactor Design. Requirements 1 and 2 must be completed successfully prior to matricula - tion in Fall core graduate courses. Students who do not successfully complete all three requirements before their third semester in the graduate program will not be allowed to continue. Notes: Students needing to take any mathematics course(s) through differen - tial equations would need to complete these prior to entrance. Students need - ing a course in ordinary differential equations should take ECH 3301: Process Analysis. Other graduate electives or thesis hours can be taken during the first two years if prerequisites are met. Courses prior to the first Fall semester will be at the student's expense or sup - ported by the department based on available funds. The PhD Qualifying Examination (see below) follows the first Spring semester. Academic Regulations and Procedures for Graduate Students Selection of Course Plan Selection of courses for the first semester should be done in consultation with the departmental Graduate Coordinator. All students must also regis - ter for the departmental seminar ECH/BME 5935r, Chemical/Biomedical Engineering Seminar, every semester. After the first semester in the graduate program, the supervising major professor will develop a course plan for MS- thesis and PhD candidates. For course-based MS students, the departmental Graduate Coordinator will assist in developing the course plan, acting as the de facto supervisor. Selection of Major Professor All full-time graduate students following the MS thesis or PhD options are required to select a research topic and major professor by the end of the first term in which they enter the Department. A form for this purpose is available online at the departmental Website. The completed form should be submitted to the departmental Graduate Coordinator. The major professor is responsible for directing the student's research and progress toward a degree. Once a major professor has been approved, a super -visory committee should be established and a program of study prepared in consultation with the major professor before the end of the second semester of enrollment in the graduate program. Supervisory Committee The supervisory committee for a master's degree candidate must consist of a minimum of three faculty members with graduate faculty status. The major professor is the chair of the supervisory committee and must be a faculty mem - ber from the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering. At least one other member of the committee must be from the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering; the third member of the committee should be from outside the department. Additional members may be appointed to the committee if deemed desirable by the major professor. The supervisory committee for a doctoral candidate must have at least four members (including major professor) with graduate faculty status. The ma - jor professor is the chair of the supervisory committee and must be a faculty member from the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering. Two of the remaining members of the committee must be from the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, and the fourth member must be from outside the Department. Additional members may be appointed if deemed desirable. Members of the supervisory committee must be approved by the Department Chair. Program of Study A program of study should be prepared by the student in conjunction with the major professor and submitted to the supervisory and graduate commit - tees. For graduate students working toward a thesis-based MS or PhD, the program of study should be defined based on the student's background and research objectives, in consultation with the major professor and supervisory committee. For graduate students working toward a course-based MS, the pro - gram of study should be defined in consultation with the Graduate Committee. The program of study is a complete plan of courses to be taken and research objectives to be achieved. On approval of the program of study, this form will also be placed in the student's permanent file. If changes to the initially approved program of study become necessary, a new program of study form must be submitted for approval. PhD Qualifying Examination and Prospectus All students admitted to the PhD program will be required to take the PhD qualifying examination after completion of the core course ECH 5052, Research Methods in Chemical Engineering. A research topic will be assigned by the graduate qualifying examination committee. The student must write a research proposal and defend it orally in front of the graduate qualify - ing-examination committee by the end of the first Summer semester, unless otherwise approved by the Graduate Committee. This examination must be passed within two consecutive attempts, or the individual will not be allowed to continue as a doctoral student. For additional details, see PhD Qualifying Examination Requirements on the departmental Website. Upon successful completion of the qualifying examination, the student may continue work toward the PhD degree. Within five semesters of admission to the graduate program (within the three semesters following the PhD qualify - ing examination), students are expected to present a prospectus detailing their program of study for PhD dissertation work. If this timeframe cannot be met, the student must petition the graduate program chair for special dispensation, stating specific reasons for the delay. The PhD prospectus will consist of a written plan of research that must be orally defended in a formal presenta - tion before the student's major professor and supervisory committee. After the successful completion of the PhD prospectus, the student will be admitted formally to the PhD candidacy and their research program. The doctoral com - mittee should provide continual feedback to the PhD candidate throughout the progression of the student's research. As such, it is important to maintain regular and at least annual meetings of the student and doctoral committee so that updates on research can be presented and feedback can be received by the student. For additional details, see Academic Regulations and Procedures for Graduate Students at https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/cbe/graduate-resources . Maintenance of Good Standing In order to maintain good standing in the department, the student must maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.0, with no more than two grades in the \"C\" range. No more than one course in the \"C\" range will be counted toward fulfilling the degree requirements. No grades below \"C\" will be counted to - ward degree requirements. Students without an undergraduate degree in chem - ical or biomedical engineering should obtain a grade of \"B\" or better in all required undergraduate courses. Master's and doctoral degree students must submit a brief written annual report on research progress, goals, and completed courses during the Spring Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Chemical and Biomedical Engineering 185 semester for evaluation by the graduate and supervisory committees. A form for this purpose is available on the departmental Website. An assessment of the progress of the student in research and courses by the student's supervisory committee will be placed in the student's permanent file. Continuance of as - sistantships and/or tuition waivers is contingent upon satisfactory evaluations. Time to Degree Completion Students with undergraduate degrees in chemical or biomedical engi - neering normally complete the thesis-type master's program in four to five semesters, including one Summer semester. Although the availability of de - partmental support ultimately is subject to budgetary constraints, the Graduate Committee will not normally recommend continuation of assistantships and tuition waivers beyond a period of two years subsequent to the student's ad - mission to the master's program. Students without an undergraduate degree in chemical or biomedical engineering will be given one additional year for completion. However, these students are normally not supported financially during their first year, when they are primarily taking preparatory undergradu - ate chemical/biomedical engineering courses. Students with undergraduate degrees in chemical or biomedical engineer - ing normally complete the doctoral program within five years of their admis - sion to graduate school, with reduced time expected if the student enters the program with a master's degree. Although the availability of departmental support ultimately is subject to budgetary constraints, departmental/college commitments, and research grant availability, doctoral candidates will be recommended for departmental support only for a period of three years sub - sequent to being admitted to candidacy for the doctoral program following the successful completion of the PhD Qualifying Examination. PhD students should submit and defend a prospectus on the dissertation topic to the supervi - sory committee within five semesters from admission to the graduate program. Assistantship Duties Graduate student support is generally in the form of research or teaching assistantships (RAs or TAs), although University fellowships are also avail - able. Research assistantships derived from contracts and grants focus mainly on the performance of research leading to their degree but may be required to perform service to the department in the form of minimal teaching duties. However, research assistants who receive departmental support for tuition waivers will be required to grade, TA, or run recitation sections for lecture courses in addition to research responsibilities. Doctoral candidates will also have to satisfy the teaching requirements of the degree (TA for one laboratory course). Typical TA duties include grading homework and/or exams, conduct - ing problem-solving recitation sections, and having office hours for answering student questions. Specific duties are assigned by the course instructor. Definition of Prefixes BME\u2014Biomedical Engineering ECH\u2014Engineering: Chemical Graduate Courses Biomedical Engineering BME 5086.

Requirements Please review all college-wide degree requirements summarized in the \"College of Arts and Sciences\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . The Department offers Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and thesis- and course- type Master of Science (MS) programs. Performance of original research is a primary characteristic of the thesis MS and PhD programs, and programs of study are correspondingly highly individualized. The PhD degree requires completion of graded classwork, graded directed individual study (DIS), oral presentations in multiple years, a written and oral candidacy exam, a written thesis with an oral defense, and publication of original research. A 3.0 grade point average must be maintained in all formal chemistry coursework. The MS program represents a specialty tract in the Department. A hand - book of information for graduate students, including specific departmental requirements, is available from the student affairs office of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and on the Website. All graduate students in the Department must participate in teaching activ - ities at some time during their graduate careers. To prepare students to meet this requirement, the Department offers a course in chemical education (CHM 5945) that every graduate student is expected to take. Minimum teaching re - quirements are listed for each of the degree programs below. Inquiries regard - ing departmental teaching assistantships should be directed to the graduate student coordinator in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The ability to communicate in spoken English is a necessary component of the graduate training in chemistry. Students whose first language is not English must demonstrate competency during their first year of graduate study or participate in a course on spoken English. Requirements for the Thesis-Type Master of Science (MS) Degree The thesis-type program is designed to provide the student with advanced work in chemistry and experience in chemical research. Once students have selected a major professor to direct their research, a supervisory committee chaired by the major professor is formed. A course of study, consistent with University- and college-wide requirements, is formulated for each student by the supervisory committee and consists of a minimum of eighteen hours of graded classroom work and three hours of graded directed individual study (DIS). The program may consist entirely of courses in chemistry or may in - clude courses from related areas, depending upon the interests and goals of the student. At least one semester of teaching is required. The student conducts research in consultation with the major professor and prepares a thesis with the professor's guidance. The student presents and defends the thesis before the supervisory committee. Special Requirements for the Course-Type Master of Science (MS) Degree The course-type program is designed to provide the student with a strong technical education, but with less emphasis on research. In this program, at least twenty-one of the University-required thirty-two semester hours of credit must be taken on a letter-grade basis at the 4000 level or above. The course -work requirement includes eighteen hours of graded classroom coursework and three hours of graded directed individual study (DIS). A supervisory com - mittee must be formed to guide the student. Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree The heart of the PhD degree is research. The degree is granted to students who have mastered a definitive field of knowledge, who have demonstrated capacity to do original and independent scholarly investigation, and who have shown an ability to integrate their field of specialization with the larger do - mains of knowledge and understanding. The student will complete a minimum of eighteen hours of graded classroom work and three hours of graded directed individual study (DIS). The program may consist entirely of courses in chem - istry or may include courses from related areas, depending upon the interests and goals of the student. Within the first semester of residence in the program, students will iden - tify a major professor to direct their research activities. In consultation with the major professor, students select a supervisory committee which will guide them in selecting programs of study and will provide evaluation by conduct - ing the oral and written portions of the PhD preliminary examination and the defense of dissertation. The PhD preliminary examination consists of written and oral portions. The written portion tests the student's mastery of the major field at an ad - vanced level and consists of preparation of a research proposal outlining the student's research efforts toward completing the PhD thesis. The oral portion has two parts and consists of defense of the research proposal and the demon - stration of adequate knowledge in the student's programmatic area. All the preliminary examination requirements must be completed by the seventh term in the graduate program. At the completion of the PhD candidacy a student will receive a MS degree from the Department and become a PhD candidate. Two semesters of teaching experience are required for PhD candidates. Completion of a significant body of individual research is, of course, the chief requirement for the degree. The research results must be orally presented and defended before the supervisory committee in the defense of dissertation. In addition, a publication requirement exists in the Department for receipt of the PhD degree.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT: see Human Development and Family Sciences 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCivil and Environmental Engineering 190 Graduate Department of CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING faMu\u2014fsu C ollege Nnaji, Ping, Wekezer The department offers a Master of Science (MS), Master of Engineering (MEng), and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program with concentrations in structural, geotechnical, transportation, construction, water resources, and en - vironmental engineering. Special areas of emphasis in civil engineering are bridge design, bridge management systems, cementitious materials, construc - tion management, and wind engineering; pavements; transportation networks and multimodal systems; disaster resilience; and com - puter-aided design and decision support systems as well as the integration of physical and numerical models of civil engineering systems. In water resourc - es, the focus is on hydraulics, hydrology, hydrodynamics, groundwater, and the modeling of watersheds and coastal areas. Emphasis within environmental engineering includes water quality, drinking water and wastewater treatment, remediation, hazardous waste management, environmental systems analysis, and environmental sustainability. Centers and Laboratories The college has many instructional and research laboratories. Specific laboratories for the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering are geotechnical, environmental, hydraulic, pavement, construction materials, structures, and the transportation-engineering laboratory. Geotechnical laboratory facilities include equipment for soil classification, compaction, hydraulic conductivity, slurry evaluation, shear strength, and compressibility of soils. Electronic data acquisition systems, personal comput - ers, sampling devices, and a machine shop are also available for student use. The environmental engineering laboratories include both an undergraduate teaching lab and a graduate research lab. The facilities include equipment and instrumentation needed for physical, chemical, and microbiological analysis of water quality, sampling and filtering devices, and space for bench scale experiments. The hydraulic laboratory is used by students to reinforce the basic concepts of hydraulics and become familiar with hydraulic equipment and instrumen - tation, and to learn procedures of data collection and analysis. Students can perform experiments of hydrostatic pressure, hydrostatic forces on submerged bodies, flow measurement, friction in pipe flow, pump power, open channel flow, hydraulic jump, and wave mechanics. The materials and structures laboratory, two stories high, includes equip - ment for compression strength testing, concrete, mixer, L.A. abrasion test ma - chine, MTS test system, and electronic data acquisition systems. The lab has a three-foot reinforced concrete reaction slab with 100-kip anchorage pods spaced at four-foot intervals. This facility provides undergraduate and grad - uate students with applied instruction on specialized testing of materials and structures, support for high quality research in developing and testing innova - tive structural materials and systems for bridges, buildings, etc. The multi usage laboratory supports preparation of specimens for other laboratories. It also has an open-circuit wind tunnel with a twenty-four-inch square cross section. The department houses the Center for Accessibility and Safety for an Aging Population (ASAP), a Tier I University Transportation Center (UTC), funded by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). ASAP concentrates its efforts on Florida where it is projected that twenty-two percent of the population will be 65 or older by 2020, the highest percentage in the nation, but the Center's research is valuable in addressing transportation issues for an aging population nationwide. The Center addresses two of USDOT's strategic goals: improving highway safety and strengthening transportation planning. Providing seniors with safe and convenient access to the goods and services they need to participate fully in society is a key issue explored by ASAP personnel. The Center also focuses on transportation issues of rural and minority segments within the elderly population. The Center focuses on four interdisciplinary areas: (1) Accessibility and community connectivity among older adults; (2) Human factors affecting the older population, especially re - garding acceptance of emerging technologies; (3) Geometric design research, especially regarding elder crash mitigation; and (4) Health, wellness, and safety of seniors as it relates to multimodal transportation and emergency op -erations. ASAP also supports educational and outreach activities, including an annual Transportation Day, brown bag lunches, student research seed grants and dissertation fellowships, and annual student research colloquia. The department also houses the Resilient Infrastructure and Disaster Response (RIDER) Center. RIDER is a multi-disciplinary research center established with the mission of achieving adaptive capacity and resilience for the communities affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes and pan - demics such as COVID-19. RIDER unites engineers, social scientists, social workers, health, public policy, communication and information specialists synergistically towards developing emergency plans that can fit the distinct needs of both urban and rural communities to solve the real-world problem of \"resilience divide.\" RIDER specifically focuses on understanding the factors that foster and support the efficacy of disaster resilience in varying population settings; extending our knowledge of community-scale infrastructure limita - tions in planning for natural disasters; and developing long-term strategic ad - aptation and implementation plans to reduce community vulnerability, needed desperately by the under-served areas of the state and the country affected by natural disasters to sustain their communities. RIDER currently hosts three multi-disciplinary laboratories: (1) Resilient Materials and Structures Lab; (2) Intelligent Mobility and Emergency Logistics; and (3) Sustainable Infrastructure Management. Additionally, the department manages a large research program called TraCS Florida. This program is funded by a grant from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to provide Florida law enforcement agencies (LEAs) with a cost effective (FREE) way to collect and transmit electron - ic crash and citation data, to submit crash data electronically to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), and to sub - mit citation data to local county clerks of court. The TraCS Florida team uses TraCS to develop Florida specific forms to meet the data submission require - ments set by DHSMV . Computer and Other Resources Students have access to a large number and variety of computer systems. A network of nearly 700 computing devices is available for the academic and research efforts of the college. The college computers are connected to a high-speed, switched, fiber-optic LAN and to the Internet via the Florida State University connection to the NSF v BNS network. Other computation resources include the Department of Scientific Computing, FSU Academic Computing and Network Services (ACNS), and FAMU Computing Services. A small collection of reference works and heavily used books and journals is located in the College of Engineering Reading Room/Library Services. Students may also participate in engineering clubs such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE); Society of Women Engineers (SWE); American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE); Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE); Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi; Engineers Without Borders (EWB); and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE).

Master's Degree Requirements The MS thesis option requires twenty-four semester hours of coursework and six semester hours of thesis work. The MS thesis option requires a final oral examination in which the student defends a thesis. For the MS thesis op - tion, the general course requirements include twelve to fifteen hours in the depth area, six to nine hours in supplementary electives, and three hours of advanced mathematics or statistics. Students also must register in a non-credit graduate seminar course each semester. The MEng option requires thirty se - mester hours of coursework, consisting of fifteen hours in the specialty area, twelve hours in supplementary electives, and three hours of advanced mathe - matics, statistics, or computation. For both the MS thesis and MEng options, a maximum of six semester hours of graduate coursework, in which the student earned a grade of \"B\" or better, may be transferred from another program. Courses sponsored by other universities, taken through the Florida Engineering Education Delivery System (FEEDS) should account for no more than fifty percent of the student's coursework. Each individual program is designed with the approval of a major advisor and, for the MS thesis option, a supervisory committee. The general course requirements for the MS thesis and MEng options are given below. Course Distribution MS MEng Specialty (Depth) area 12-15 12-15 Supplemental electives 6-9 12-15 Advanced mathematics 3 3 Thesis with oral defense 6 N/A Non-thesis project with oral defense N/A N/A Graduate seminar 0 N/A Total credit hours required for the master's degree 30 30 Graduation requirements include a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better and the successful defense of a thesis (MS) for the thesis option. All of the above requirements must be met within seven calendar years. B.S. - M.Eng. Pathway This pathway provides academically talented undergraduate students an opportunity to complete both a bachelor's and a master's degree in 5 years. Upon approval, this pathway allows 6 graduate hours to be double-counted toward an undergraduate degree program. The student will earn the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree upon completion of the undergraduate program and the Master of Engineering (MEng) degree upon completion of the graduate program. The program requirements for the graduate portion of this pathway are identical to the M.Eng. program requirements shown above. The only differ - ence is that the pathway students take 24 hours of coursework instead of 30 hours, because 6 graduate hours were already taken while getting the under - graduate degree. The admission for the B.S. - M.Eng. Pathway has two parts: 1. When the student is in the undergraduate program, the student submits an on-line application to the combined degree pathway. Overall GPA of 3.2 as well as area-specific requirements must be met. To ensure smooth transition to the graduate program, it is recommended that the students apply during Terms 5 or 6 (the Junior year) according to the CEE Undergraduate Academic Map. Additional information and the online application is available at https://eng.famu.fsu.edu/cee/ bs-meng-pathway .2. During the last year as an undergraduate, the student applies to the Master of Engineering program. The admission requirements for this step are identical to the master's admission requirements shown earlier. Doctoral Degree Requirements The program of study for the PhD degree is flexible and depends on the individual student's background and objectives. The CEE department has two tracks for the PhD program. The typical track is the MS-PhD track where the applicants already have an MS degree. An alternative is the BS-PhD track where exceptionally-qualified applicants who are well prepared may enter the PhD program with only a BS degree. A student may specialize in any of the several areas that are offered in the department. In addition to the specialty courses, the student must have a minor consisting of at least nine semester hours from another department. Each student's specific program of study is uniquely tailored through consultation with an advisory committee that the student selects. The objectives of course selection are to develop a broad- based understanding of engineering and science, and to gain fundamental contemporary capabilities in an area of concentration necessary to conduct significant and original scholarly research. A student must choose a major professor by the second semester of en - rollment in the PhD program. If a student has not chosen a major professor by this time, a professor approved by the graduate committee chair will act as the student's academic advisor. The major professor is formally appointed by the department chair and will serve as chair of the supervisory committee. The supervisory committee is formally appointed by the department chair at the request of the major professor. There must be a minimum of four committee members, including the major professor. One member must be from outside the department, representing the student's minor. The committee supervises the student's work until all degree requirements are completed and is responsi - ble for an annual written assessment of the student's progress. This assessment shall be made available to the student, the coordinator of graduate studies, and the department chair. The student will prepare, with the approval of the doctoral supervisory committee, a complete plan of study to be submitted to the graduate committee within the first year of the program and to be retained on file in the department. The plan should identify the courses necessary to meet the following semester hours of course requirements and a time schedule for taking them. Degree requirements for PhD students are outlined below. The PhD course requirements include nine hours in a student's depth area, nine to eighteen semester hours beyond the master's degree in supplementary electives, up to nine semester hours in a non-departmental minor area, and twenty-four semester hours of original dissertation work. Students also must register for a noncredit graduate seminar course each semester.

Once certified, students will be permitted to take a doctoral preliminary examination. The preliminary examination will be a written and oral exam prepared by the student's supervisory committee. The exam will be administered by the committee near the end of or after completion of the student's coursework and will comply with the requirements of the college and the university in which the student is registered. The examination committee shall report the outcome to designated college and university authorities as: \"passed,\" \"failed,\" \"addi - tional work to be completed,\" or \"to be reexamined.\" Students are admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree only after passing this examination. If any student requires re-examination, the outcome can only be reported pass or fail. Any student who fails re-examination is dismissed from the program. Upon successful completion of the second trial the student may continue to register for dissertation hours. The most important element of the doctoral program is original and fun - damental research resulting in a doctoral dissertation. The research subject is selected by the student in consultation with the major professor and the student's doctoral supervisory committee. The dissertation must be completed 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCivil and Environmental Engineering 192 on a topic approved by the Committee. To be acceptable, it must comprise original research constituting a significant contribution to knowledge and rep - resent a substantial scholarly effort on the part of the student.

If the student hopes to be in - volved in advanced work in archaeology, he or she must take care to acquire a background in archaeology sufficient to meet the requirements of doctoral programs in classical archaeology. Students in this program can easily com - bine language study with courses in archaeology and history. Graduates of this program have gone on to teach in schools, however, that opportunity requires that the student acquire sufficient skill in Latin. It is also possible to pursue this degree in order to prepare for further work in fields other than classics (such as comparative literature or humanities). Students will be required to pass either one of the Master's Comprehensive Exams in Greek or Latin (GRW 8966 or LNW 8966) or the Master's Comprehensive Exam in Classics (CLA 8961). Requirements (Thirty-three semester hours total) Students are required to write master's paper (a substantial research paper that is usually an expanded version of a seminar paper) during the semester in which they are registered for CLA 5919. Required Courses Required Hours CLA 5936 Proseminar 1 Two courses in 1) Greek or Latin or 2) two courses in literature-in translation (or a combination thereof)6 Two history courses (may be substituted for by taking courses in archaeology, Latin or Greek (at the 5000 level)6 One archaeology course 3 Electives in classics 14 CLA 5919 MA paper 3 CLA 8961 or GRW 8966 or LNW 8966 Comprehensive Examination0 Translation Examinations for Classics, Latin, or Greek Students seeking an MA in Classics, Latin, or Greek will sit a translation examination. Passages will be drawn from the MA reading list in the Classics Graduate Student Handbook. All passages will be of medium difficulty. The level of competence required to pass the exam is that which might reasonably be expected of a student who has completed two years of graduate study. The exams are offered each year in late Fall and Spring. Classics: from a selection, a student will translate four passages: one in Greek prose, one in Greek poetry, one in Latin prose, and one in Latin poetry. Greek or Latin: from a selection (in the relevant language), a student will translate two passages: one in prose and one in poetry. Master of Arts (MA) with a Major in Ancient History The major in Ancient History offers students an opportunity to focus on historical authors in the original languages, achieve in-depth historical train - ing, and write an MA paper or thesis on an historical topic. Requirements (Thirty-three semester hours total) Students are required to write a master's paper (a substantial research paper that is usually an expanded version of a seminar paper) during the semester in which they are registered for CLA 5919. Required Courses Required Hours Proseminar (CLA 5936) 1 Four courses at the 5000- or 6000-level in Greek or Roman History (at least one course must be a 6000-level seminar)12 Two courses at the 5000- or 6000-level in Greek or Latin (at least one course must be a 6000-level seminar, one course must be on a historical author)6 One Archaeology course 3 Three additional courses (5000- or 6000-level) which may be based in related departments (students are en - couraged to use at least one elective for further advanced language study of a historical author)8 Translation Exams in Greek or Latin 0 Comprehensive Exam in Ancient History 0 MA paper (CLA 5919) 3Comprehensive Examinations for Ancient History All students must pass a translation exam in Greek or Latin, which will normally follow the same format as the departmental Comprehensive Exam but be based upon the Ancient History Reading Lists. All students must also pass a Comprehensive Exam in ancient history. PhD with Majors in Classics or Classical Archaeology The department offers the PhD in classics (ancient history, philology, lit - erary criticism) and in classical archaeology. Students holding the BA with sufficient training in classics and who wish to pursue doctoral-level work in the department may apply directly to the PhD program. Students holding the BA, but without sufficient training in classics, should first apply to the MA program. Students entering the MA program may, upon recommendation and review by the faculty, be admitted to the PhD program before completion of the MA. The PhD requires thirty semester hours of coursework beyond the MA, at least twelve semester hours of which must be at the 6000 level. Students should consult the Classics Graduate Student Handbook, available on the Department of Classics Website ( https://classics.fsu.edu/ ) for details of re - quirements, annual evaluations, and examinations. Each program requires a series of comprehensive examinations. The program in classics requires: reading list examinations in Greek and Latin; demonstration of proficiency, by exam or through coursework, in Greek and Roman history; detailed examinations in Greek and Latin literature; a spe - cial author examination; a special field or topic examination; an examination in an interdisciplinary topic. The program in classical archaeology requires: a reading list examination in either Greek or Latin; demonstration of proficiency, by exam or through coursework, in Greek and Roman history; examination on a topic in Bronze Age or Greek archaeology; examination on a topic in Etruscan or Roman ar - chaeology; a special field or topic examination; an examination in an interdis - ciplinary topic. Doctoral students must complete and successfully defend a dissertation that makes an original contribution to scholarship.

Master's Thesis Defense (0) (P/F grade only.) 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCognitive Sciences 198 Graduate Specialized Studies Program in the Institute for COGNITIVE SCIENCES College of arts and sCienCes Director: Michael Kaschak, Department of Psychology Specialized Studies in Cognitive Science This specialized studies curriculum recognizes interdisciplinary study encompassing linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and psychology. Cognitive science explores human cognitive processes, such as knowledge representation, inference generation, memory, planning, problem solving, language, vision, and the modeling of these processes on computers. In pur - suing specialized studies in this area, students will learn that a comparison of machine models and analogues of cognitive processes with human and animal behavior, together with a study of the philosophical implications of these com - parisons, will lead to deeper understanding of cognition and a more useful application of cognitive theory in the component fields. The program is open to students admitted to any graduate program at Florida State University. The specialized studies program itself is not a degree and is not a requirement in any degree program. A student wishing to pursue the specialized studies program should select appropriate courses from those listed below, with the advice and consent of the student's major professor or degree advisor. One course should be taken from each of the five areas below. For courses marked with an asterisk (*), consent of the instructor may substitute for stated prerequisites. It should be noted that the specialized studies coursework may vary from eleven to more than seventeen semester hours outside of the student's degree program, depending on the specific courses chosen and on overlaps in require - ments. Descriptions of the courses listed below can be found in the depart - mental listings.

The student can select from several distinct major areas of emphasis which reflect specialized programs of study pertaining to either professional or academic careers in the communication field. Whether the student is interested in the traditional fields of human and speech com - munication, in the established discipline of media studies, or in the emerg - ing areas of digital technologies, there are a variety of courses and course sequences available. The School also offers graduate-level certificates in the areas of Multicultural Marketing Communication, Digital Video Production, and Project Management. Specifically, at the master's level, programs of study are offered in com - munication with an emphasis in integrated marketing communication, media and communication studies, and public interest media and communication. At the doctoral level, a program of study is available in communication theory. Both thesis and non-thesis master's options are available. Some non-thesis master's programs are professionally oriented and assume the student will not pursue the doctoral degree in communication. Thesis master's programs are often theoretically oriented and prepare the student for doctoral work. Each major specifies entry requirements and degree requirements to meet predeter - mined educational and professional goals. While each major has its own set and sequence of required courses, every program of study is planned individ - ually with each student so as to ensure flexibility to meet individual student needs. Acceptance into each major is highly competitive and is based on stu - dent qualifications. Faculty Distinctions The graduate program in communication reflects the varied teaching and research interests of the faculty. Beyond their range of expertise in communi - cation theory and research, faculty members remain united in their dedication to teaching excellence, as demonstrated by the regularity with which they re - ceive teaching commendations and awards. Faculty members from the School of Communication have been elected and continue to serve as officers in major academic societies and professional associations. Faculty members have been and remain prominent in scholarly journals, serving as editors, associate edi - tors, and, most importantly, authors. A series of journal publications, as well as books, convention papers, and monographs, have established a number of faculty members as nationally as well as internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields. Assistantships/Scholarships The School of Communication offers teaching and research assistantships to doctoral students and to master's students (as funding is available). The number and amount of assistantships vary and are competitive. Assistantships also provide assistance with course tuition. Competitive scholarships are also offered each year. Applications and Admissions 1. The candidate should apply online to the University Graduate Admissions Office website at https://admissions.fsu.edu/ . The School application instructions are also available online at https://comm.cci.fsu. edu/. Applicants should upload their completed forms with supporting documents to the online university application. The School will accept new graduate applicants each semester. 2. Minimum criteria to be considered for admission to the master's program include a GPA of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) for the last two years of undergraduate work and completion of the verbal, quantitative, and writing sections of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The GRE requirement will be waived for outstanding Master's applicants who meet minimum criteria and who apply for the requirement to be waived; further details are found on the School of Communication website. Minimum criteria to be considered for admission to the doctoral program include a master's GPA of 3.3, an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 for the last two years of undergraduate work, and completion of the verbal, quantitative, and writing sections of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). 3. All applicants must submit three letters of recommendation and completed University and School application forms. 4. Applicants for the doctoral program may be asked to complete an interview with the doctoral program committee, preferably in person although telephone or digital video conferencing is acceptable. Under certain conditions a videotaped statement in response to a set of questions provided by the committee could be substituted for the interview. International students are required to submit GRE scores and a Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score of 600 or above or an Internet- based TOEFL score of 100 or above. Regardless of TOEFL scores, some inter - national students may be required by the International Admissions Office, the graduate admissions committee, or their advisory committee to enroll in the Center for Intensive English Studies program in order to begin in the program, regardless of the degrees that have been earned in their home countries. If an international student has demonstrated English competency, some of these requirements may be waived. Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Science (MS) Degree Supervisory Committee and Program of Study 1. Prior to or during registration for the first semester, students should meet with the coordinator for their emphasis area. The coordinator will help the student plan coursework for the first semester. 2. For non-thesis students, the area coordinator will serve as chair of the student's standing supervisory committee. Students pursuing a thesis must select a major professor or committee chair. This person is usually a specialist in the student's major area. It is the student's responsibility, after consultation with the area coordinator, to secure consent of an eligible faculty member to serve as the major professor and to work with the major professor to form a committee. Master's thesis supervisory committees and Master's creative project supervisory committees have a minimum of three members, of which two must be (all three may be) from within the School of Communication. All members on master's supervisory committees must hold Graduate Faculty Status (GFS). 3. No later than the end of the first semester, the student must submit a program of study to the committee for approval. The program must closely follow the guidelines of the selected major and must meet School and University requirements. The proposed program of study should be developed with the help and advice of the major professor. If a committee meeting is required, the program of study should be submitted to all committee members at least five days before the committee meets. At the meeting, the committee will discuss and modify the program of study as necessary. 4. If the student's undergraduate preparation is weak, out of field, or insufficient for work in the area chosen, the admissions committee or supervisory committee may require that the student complete specified undergraduate courses in areas of deficiency. These make-up courses will not normally be credited toward master's requirements. 5. Not more than six semester hours may be transferred from another graduate institution and then only with the approval of the supervisory committee. Not more than six semester hours of directed individual study (COM 5906) may be applied toward the master's degree. 6. All courses must be 5000-level or higher to count toward the master's degree. 7. The program of study must be approved by all committee members, the area coordinator, and the School director. The student should provide signed copies to all signatories, with the director's copy filed in the student's folder. Changes in the program of study or in the composition of the supervisory committee are accomplished with special forms obtained from the School. The forms are signed by all committee members, the area coordinator, and the School director and are attached to the student's original program of study. 8. A master's program normally requires the equivalent of one and one-half calendar years of full-time coursework. Students with less 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCommunication 200 background in their chosen area of specialization, or with degrees outside of communication, or who are completing a thesis should expect to spend longer to complete a master's program. 9. Graduate students are required to earn grades of \"B-\" or better in all courses in order for the courses to be counted toward the degree. A GPA of at least 3.0 must be maintained for all master's work. 10. There is no University-wide residency requirement. 11. Each master's candidate must demonstrate, by term papers or thesis, writing skills that are acceptable to the student's committee. 12. The English proficiency of domestic and international students will be evaluated by the student's supervisory committee at least by the end of the student's second semester of residency. If the committee decides that the student's English usage is deficient, the committee will recommend remedial action. If after remedial action the student's English proficiency is still considered to be below an acceptable level, the student may be dismissed. 13. There is no School-wide foreign-language requirement. If the student wishes to receive the Master of Arts degree, the University requires: a) proficiency in a foreign language demonstrated by certification by the appropriate language department, or completion of twelve semester hours in a foreign language with an average grade of at least 3.0 (\"B\"), or four years of a single language in high school; b) six or more semester hours of graduate credit in one or more of the following fields: art; classical language, literature, and civilization; communication (not to include speech correction); languages and linguistics; music; philosophy; religion; and theatre. 14. Depending on the major area in which the student is enrolled, the student may elect a thesis, a creative project, or a coursework-only program. To qualify for the master's degree under the thesis program, the student must complete a minimum of thirty-three semester hours including six hours of thesis credit. At least twenty-four of those hours must be taken on a letter-grade basis. 15. To qualify for the master's degree under the creative project option, the student must complete a minimum of thirty-three semester hours, twenty-seven of which must be on a letter-grade basis. For more information about the creative project option, please visit the school website or contact the school directly. 16. To qualify for the master's degree under the coursework-only program option, the student must complete a minimum of thirty-six semester hours, twenty-seven of which must be on a letter-grade basis, and the student may complete a residency. The coursework-only program is considered a terminal degree (i.e., the student is normally not expected to continue for the doctorate). 17. Students must complete requirements for the master's degree within forty-three semester hours maximum including thesis. Any hours taken beyond forty-three will not be credited toward the master's degree nor can they be counted in a PhD program. The student must complete the master's degree before beginning doctoral coursework. 18. A prospectus must be approved by all committee members prior to research or data collection for a thesis. Signed copies are to be filed in the student's School folder. 19. At the same time, the student should make application for graduation and the diploma. 20. The manuscript and final clearance advisor in the Graduate School must approve the form of the thesis before final preparation. It is recommended that students consult with this advisor early in the preparation stage and download a copy of Guidelines and Requirements for Electronic Theses, Treatises, and Dissertations from the Graduate School. 21. Prior to the oral defense of the thesis, an announcement must be sent to the Graduate School via the Manuscript Clearance Portal. This announcement must be published at least two weeks prior to the defense. At least one week prior to the oral defense of a thesis, the candidate is responsible for notifying all School faculty of the time and place of the defense. Graduate students may also attend the defense. The candidate is responsible for scheduling the oral defense at a time convenient for all the committee members. For creative project defense guidelines, please contact the school directly. 22. The defense should be scheduled at least two weeks after copies of the thesis or creative project have been distributed to committee members. These must be seen by the candidate and the major professor as final copies. The academic calendar in the Registration Guide specifies deadline dates for theses.23. The major professor will bring to the oral examination the School graduate exam clearance form which is to be signed by all committee members and by the School director. 24. All needed forms associated with the defense of the thesis and degree clearance are found in the Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal, and students are responsible for following the procedures and adhering to the deadlines posted by the Graduate School each semester.

Program Overview Beginning with a common set of foundational courses, students will en - counter a range of philosophical, theoretical, and methodological approaches to communication scholarship. A major goal of the program is for students to gain knowledge of and an appreciation for the complexities and interdepen - dencies within communication inquiry. To that end, students will gain a theo - retical grounding in the broad communication discipline and then will pursue more advanced study through doctoral-level seminars, directed independent studies, and supervised research experiences. Students will be actively men - tored to present the results of their work at regional and national conferences, culminating in publication in refereed outlets. Additionally, most students will have the opportunity to develop teaching and classroom management skills through our funded assistantship program. Program Objectives This program is primarily designed for students who are interested in pursuing academic teaching and research careers within the communication discipline. However, some may choose to use the degree to launch a career in one of the various communication-related industries, research, consultancy, not-for-profit organizations, or governmental affairs. Regardless of the stu - dent's chosen career path, the primary objective for all will be to become an independent and original scholar. The educational goals of the program are to provide students with ad - vanced knowledge of or experience in: 1) communication theory and inquiry; 2) selected extant communication literatures; 3) research methods applicable in either theoretical or applied settings to the study of selected communication texts, processes, audiences, systems, industries, organizations, or effects; 4) research design and data/textual analysis; and 5) teaching undergraduate stu - dents at a state-supported university. Communication Theory and Research Career Goals: Conduct scholarly research and teach in a college or univer - sity; management position within a communication or research organization; consultant in media, research, or marketing in for-profit, not-for-profit, and governmental settings. Additional Educational Goals: Knowledge of communication theories and research; training in both quantitative and qualitative research design and anal - ysis; experience with various methods for basic and applied communication research. Skills to be Developed: Ability to conduct independent, scholarly research; ability to teach at university or college level; quantitative and qualitative re - search methods; effective written communication. Supervisory Committee and Program of Study 1. A provisional advisor is assigned to the student at the time of acceptance into the program. During the student's first semester in the program, the provisional advisor will assist the student in registering for courses and may be a source of information for the student concerning choice of major professor, cognate area, program of studies, and registration for the second semester. 2. By the midpoint of the second semester, the student must designate a major professor who has consented to serve in that capacity. The major professor will take over the advising duties of the provisional advisor, will be the student's principal advisor in choosing members for the doctoral supervisory committee, and will assist the student in developing a preliminary program of study. Faculty members holding Graduate Faculty Status (GFS) with doctoral directing status are eligible to serve as major professors. 3. The doctoral supervisory committee approves the program of study, reviews and approves any proposed revisions to the program of study, and designs and evaluates the doctoral preliminary examination. Doctoral supervisory committees have a minimum of four members: three from within the School of Communication plus one outside member. All members must hold GFS. The outside member of the committee must be from a different department at FSU. This outside member serves as the University's representative-at-large who reports directly to the dean of the college and to the dean of the Graduate School; accordingly, the outside member must hold university graduate faculty status and must be tenured. 4. During the first two semesters of the student's coursework, a proposed program of study is completed. The program of study is a document detailing the courses that a student plans to take in the doctoral program, as well as a timeline for completing those courses. Before the beginning of the third semester of enrollment, the student must submit for approval a program of study to the doctoral supervisory committee, the director of doctoral studies, and the School director. Additionally, the student must submit a statement of purpose, detailing the student's major areas of interests, degree completion schedule, and career goals. 5. At the end of a student's coursework but before preliminary exams are taken, the doctoral supervisory committee will meet with the student to complete a final review of the program of study and concept paper. All changes will be reviewed and a final, corrected version of the program of study is signed and sent to the director of doctoral studies for the additional signatures. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCommunication 202 6. The doctoral program often requires six or seven semesters of full-time coursework (48 hours of coursework) beyond the master's degree and at least one year of dissertation work. Students with a master's degree from a discipline other than communication may spend more time completing the doctoral program. All courses must be 5000-level or higher to count toward the doctoral degree. Doctoral students must complete requirements for the PhD within 135 semester hours maximum, including dissertation. 7. According to University policy, all graduate students are required to earn grades of \"B-\" or better in all courses in order for the courses to be counted toward the degree. In addition, a grade point average of at least 3.4 (out of a possible 4.0) must be maintained for all PhD work. 8. All students must meet Florida State University's and the School's Scholarly Engagement Policy requirement to ensure that doctoral students are active participants in the scholarly community. To meet the Scholarly Engagement requirement, doctoral students should interact with faculty and peers in ways that may include enrolling in courses; attending seminars, symposia, and conferences; engaging in collaborative study and research beyond the university campus; and utilizing the library, laboratories, and other facilities provided by the university for the purpose of knowledge creation. Activities that contribute to scholarly engagement in the School are described in the Guide to Doctoral Studies. 9. Prior to the preliminary examinations, every doctoral student is required to submit and have accepted three original scholarly papers or works to an appropriate journal and/or a state, regional, or national convention or festival (all work must be peer reviewed). 10. The English proficiency of domestic and international students will be evaluated by the student's doctoral supervisory committee at least by the end of the student's second semester of residency. If the committee decides that the student's English usage is deficient, the committee will recommend remedial action. If, as a result of remedial action, the student's English proficiency is still considered to be below an acceptable level, the student may be dismissed. 11. There is no School-wide foreign language requirement. 12. The progress of all students in the PhD program is reviewed annually at the conclusion of the Spring semester by the student's major professor in consultation with the Director of Doctoral Studies. 13. At the end of coursework, students will enroll for and complete COM 8964, Doctoral Preliminary Examination (0). Details concerning the preliminary examination requirements can be found in the Guide to Doctoral Studies. The purpose of the preliminary examination is to determine if the student is sufficiently prepared to continue with the original, independent scholarly work required to complete a doctoral dissertation. The preliminary examination may not be taken if the student has one or more incomplete grades pending. 14. Supervisory committees in our School have been given great latitude in determining the nature and content of the preliminary exams. The content covered on the exam is determined by the full committee. Typically, the outside member of the committee provides questions covering the cognate area of study. The nature of the exam is likewise determined by the supervisory committee. The committee is given an opportunity to further examine the student's performance through the oral portion of the doctoral preliminary examination. The oral portion of the exam must occur between seven and fourteen calendar days following submission of the written portion to all committee members. 15. Successful completion of the doctoral preliminary examination must occur at least six months prior to the degree being granted. 16. All work for the doctoral degree must be completed within five calendar years after the time the student passes the doctoral preliminary examination, or the student must pass a new preliminary examination. 17. Upon satisfactory completion of the preliminary examination the student is admitted to candidacy for the doctoral degree and is eligible to enroll for dissertation credits. Upon a student's admission to candidacy, the role of the doctoral supervising committee shifts to oversight of the student's dissertation process: proposal defense and approval, guidance during dissertation completion, and defense and approval of the dissertation. Given this shift in responsibilities, the student may seek to change the composition of the doctoral supervising committee. All requirements for the committee's makeup noted above remain in effect. 18. Upon admission to candidacy, the student must register for dissertation credits (COM 6980r) each term in which a substantial amount of work is being done on the dissertation. Students must register for a minimum of twenty-four hours of dissertation credit in their program. The student must carry a minimum of two dissertation credits during every semester in which (s)he is using and requiring university facilities or requires faculty supervision. As noted above, enrollment in COM 6980r is not possible until a passing grade is recorded for COM 8964, Doctoral Preliminary Examination. 19. A dissertation prospectus must be approved by all committee members prior to research or data collection for a dissertation. The purpose of the dissertation prospectus is to provide the committee members with a description of the proposed dissertation study, so they can determine the soundness and feasibility of and the student's preparedness to accomplish the proposed project. 20. With the major professor's approval, the student must enroll in COM 8985, Dissertation Defense (0) for the semester in which the dissertation project will be completed and defended. The defense must be scheduled no later than one month prior to the final submission deadline published by the Graduate School. 21. The manuscript and final clearance advisor in the Graduate School must approve the formatting of the final dissertation. The student should consult with the clearance advisor early in the preparation stage and closely follow the formatting rules set out in the Guidelines and Requirements for Electronic Theses, Treatises, and Dissertations publication. 22. Prior to the oral defense of the dissertation, an announcement must be sent to the Graduate School via the Manuscript Clearance Portal. This announcement must be published at least two weeks prior to the defense. At least one week prior to the oral defense, the candidate is responsible for notifying all School faculty of the time and place of the defense. Graduate students may also attend the defense. The candidate is responsible for scheduling the oral defense at a time convenient for all committee members. 23. A draft of the dissertation must be sent to the outside committee member at least four weeks prior to the oral defense. The defense must be scheduled at least four weeks after final copies of the dissertation have been distributed to committee members. The major professor will bring to the oral examination the School graduate exam clearance form, which is to be signed by all committee members and by the School director. 24. All needed forms associated with the defense of the dissertation and degree clearance are found in the Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Portal, and students are responsible for following the procedures and adhering to the deadlines posted by the Graduate School each semester. Additionally, as a courtesy, the student should give all members of the supervisory committee electronic copies of the dissertation. 25. All requirements and guidelines above are described in more detail in the Guide to Doctoral Studies, which all students receive upon entry into the program. The Guide should be consulted by students regularly.

Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Communication Science and Disorders 205 Master's Degree Programs Florida State University's speech-language pathology educational pro - gram is accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. The objective of the program is to ed - ucate speech-language pathologists to function optimally in a variety of clin - ical and school settings and, if desired, to enable them to pursue the doctoral degree. Learning experiences involve an interaction of classroom instruction, research, and individualized clinical practicum under the close supervision of certified academic and clinical faculty. Students are encouraged to collaborate with faculty on research and clinical program development. The master's de - gree is offered via an on-campus program and a distance learning program. The programs offer courses of study leading to the Master of Science (MS) degree (thesis and non-thesis options). The graduate-level programs lead to meeting the American Speech-Language Hearing Association's entry level requirements for practice as a speech-language pathologist. The Florida State Board of Education requirements or The National Council on Accreditation for Teacher Education (NCATE) requirements for teaching certificates may be achieved by speech-language pathology majors. The degree requirement for the MS in speech-language pathology can be met through on campus or distance learning programs. A student's undergraduate background influences the time required to com - plete the graduate degree. Students obtaining a master's degree on campus from Florida State University generally graduate from the program in six ac - ademic semesters, which includes a semester of off-campus internship, while the distance learning master's students generally graduate from the program in nine academic semesters. Requirements The Florida State University School of Communication Science and Disorders requires an individual applying for a master's degree to hold a bach - elor's degree. A degree in Communication Science and Disorders is highly recommended but not required. Applicants from other degree areas are en - couraged to obtain prerequisites in Communication Science and Disorders. For information on prerequisites, please see the School Website: https:// commdisorders.cci.fsu.edu/ . Applicants for admission to the master's degree programs must meet the University's minimum standard of a 3.0 upper divi - sion GPA and completion of the verbal, quantitative, and writing sections of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) before an application will be con - sidered by the School. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guaran - tee acceptance for graduate study in the School as admission is competitive. Prospective students must apply to the University and pay the University ap - plication fee before their file will be reviewed at the School level. Applicants must submit copies of official transcripts from all post-secondary schools at - tended and official GRE scores from the Educational Testing Service to the Office of Graduate Admissions. Typically, admission is for the Fall semester for both the on-campus program and the distance learning program. There are additional requirements and procedures for admission to the program. Please see the department Website at https://commdisorders.cci.fsu.edu/ for submis - sion dates of application materials and additional information. Students in the master's degree programs are required to complete a re - search project (i.e., thesis or directed research activity). All graduate students completing a thesis are required to present a program of study acceptable to the major professor and supervisory committee. The program of study should be approved before the conclusion of the first semester of course work. In general, a minimum of six semesters is typically required for the completion of the on-campus master's degree; completion of the distance learning master's degree is typically a minimum of nine semesters. Doctoral Degree Admission to the doctoral program is contingent upon meeting the Florida State University policy on admissions. Academic standards, residence, and transfer credits are in accordance with regulations of the University. Normally, admission is during the Fall semester. Application for the following academic year should be submitted by March 1st. The student must hold a bachelor's degree for consideration of entry into the doctoral program. A minimum overall GPA of 3.0 (on a scale of A = 4.0) maintained in the student's junior and senior years of undergraduate education is required. A minimum of a 3.5 GPA in the student's major area of study in undergraduate and graduate education is required. An exception to the GPA requirement may be made by the doctoral admission committee if strong ev - idence of academic potential is presented. This evidence must include com - pletion of the verbal, quantitative, and writing sections of the GRE. There are additional requirements and procedures for admission to the program. Please see the department Website at https://commdisorders.cci.fsu.edu/ for addition - al information.Upon acceptance into the doctoral program, the School director will ap - point the major professor. The appointment must be mutually agreeable to the student, major professor, and School director. By the end of the first year of the program, the student should invite selected faculty to form a doctoral supervi - sory committee. The doctoral supervisory committee shall be composed of a minimum of four members, including the major professor, who will serve until the student is advanced to candidacy. All committee members must hold doc - toral directive status, and one member with this status must be selected from a different department (University Representative). At least two members must be from within the School of Communication Science and Disorders. Students may choose to include up to two members from other departments in light of the interdisciplinary course work taken by students in the department. The first three to five semesters of enrollment in the program should be devoted to completion of the core requirements. By the end of the first year of the program, the student must present an approved plan of study to fulfill all requirements for the PhD. The plan of study should include all graduate-level courses previously completed. The program of study should include a narra - tive statement of the student's career goals, all graduate level courses previ - ously completed, and all courses that the student is planning on taking to meet the core requirements and additional requirements, as delineated below, as well as a timeline for completion. The doctoral supervisory committee must approve the program of study in writing and may approve any course(s) al - ready completed to apply toward meeting the core requirements. The student is encouraged to ask the major professor for samples of programs of study completed by former students. Requirements The doctoral program in Communication Science and Disorders is indi - vidualized to meet the student's needs and interests based on his/her career goals. The student must demonstrate knowledge beyond the master's level in three areas: 1. Research Methods (fifteen semester hours) 2. Communication Processes in Normal and/or Disordered Populations (nine semester hours) 3. A Related Specialization area (twelve semester hours). Students must also meet three additional requirements: a. The student must demonstrate teaching competencies by taking major responsibility for teaching at least one undergraduate lecture course. The student must enroll in three to five semester hours of SPA 5940, Supervised Teaching. b. The student must demonstrate research competencies by participating in different roles in ongoing research of the major professor or more advanced doctoral students and taking major responsibility for initiating a research project. The student must enroll in three to five semester hours of SPA 5910, Supervised Research. c. The student must enroll in the departmental Doctoral Research Colloquium and Doctoral Seminar on Teaching and Supervision (SPA 6804; both are variable credit ranging from zero to three semester hours, repeatable to twelve hours) for a minimum of two semester hours each during the Fall and Spring semesters totaling four semesters over the first two years in the program and before advancing to candidacy. Candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree Advancement to candidacy for the PhD degree is contingent upon the stu - dent successfully passing a preliminary examination. The preliminary exam is designed to demonstrate competency in a topic area(s) pertinent to the stu - dent's field of interest as well as the ability to write and critique scholarly papers. The student's committee must approve the format and content of the specific products before the student initiates the preliminary exam. It is rec - ommended that the three written products be completed within one to two semesters. 1. Written Response to Committee Question(s). The student must write extensively on a topic(s) selected and approved by the committee. The question(s) will come from a pool of questions submitted by the student to his/her advisor and agreed upon by the committee. The student must complete the question(s) within two days, thus, the expectation is not for a fully polished product. Instead, the response should demonstrate a command of research, reflected in an ability to compile and critically analyze a body of literature (or salient aspects of a complex question) in a relatively short time span. The written response should be no more than ten pages, double spaced (excluding references). During the writing time, the student may not consult with anyone, but may utilize 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityCommunication Science and Disorders 206 any other resources available to him/her (books, articles, presentations). The student will designate the start date for completing the written response, with approval of the major professor. 2. Journal Article Critique. The student will critique a prepublication manuscript or published article as if it was submitted to a journal for publication with the student serving as a guest reviewer. The major professor will choose the article with input from committee members with the student's area of interest and future research objectives in mind. The article critique typically is no more than four pages single- spaced; often, it is shorter. The student will designate the start date for completing the article critique. Where possible, the research design of the journal article will differ from that of the design in the creative product. 3. Creative Product. The third written product may take one of two forms, depending on the student's interests and future employment objectives: a. The student may write a traditional research grant proposal following Public Health Service or other appropriate guidelines. The scope of the work proposed should entail multiple years; thus, it might include multiple projects or at least a multi-faceted project. b. The student may write a manuscript that is suitable for submission to a journal. The manuscript should entail original research that the student has designed and carried out (e.g., a report of an experimental research study, a program evaluation, a policy analysis, or another original product). The manuscript should not have any fatal flaws in regard to support for the need and rationale for the study, threats to validity, appropriate statistical analysis, appropriate interpretation of results, and clarity/organization of writing. The student is expected to work fairly independently on the creative prod - uct. The student should submit a final draft to the major professor. The major professor may make suggestions one time regarding content that is missing or superfluous, the organization of the product and synthesis of information, and APA writing style. The major professor will be the gatekeeper of the products and decide if the products are ready to send to the committee and if the student is ready to schedule the oral examination. Upon notification from the major profes - sor, the student will send three written products to the committee at least two weeks prior to the scheduled oral examination. The student should provide each committee member with a hard copy of the preliminary exam, unless a committee member prefers an electronic copy. If the major professor believes, after providing feedback to the student for the creative product, that the prod - ucts are not passable and should not be sent to the committee, the advisor will advise the student. At that point, the student has the option of either moving forward with a full committee review or pulling the manuscript and suggesting an alternative creative product. This latter option will be offered only once. Dissertation Upon advancement to candidacy, the student should begin working on the dissertation. The dissertation is the final requirement for the doctoral degree. A student must be admitted to candidacy at least six months prior to the grant - ing of the doctoral degree. All requirements for the doctoral degree, including filing an approved dissertation, must be completed within five calendar years from the time the student is advanced for candidacy.

Wang, Whalley, Yu, Yuan, Z. Zhang; Associate Professors: Medeiros, Jones, Lacher, Levitz, III: Emeriti: Baker, Hawkes, Lacher, Levitz In Computer Science education, whether graduate or undergraduate, being current is essential. Computer Science is an exceptionally fast-moving field, where knowledge is subject to rapid obsolescence and ideas progress swiftly from research to practice. The department, therefore, seeks to offer techni - cal instruction that keeps on the cutting edge of new developments, while simultaneously providing each student with a core of intellectual tools that will never become obsolete. The department views skills in communication, mathematics, and algorithmic reasoning as central and the understanding of underlying principles as more important than familiarity with specific techni - cal products. Still, direct hands-on experience is essential to mastering these skills and principles. If students are to be adequately prepared for careers in Computer Science, they should have extensive experience with machines and software that are state-of-the-art. The Department of Computer Science offers graduate programs leading to the Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees. The department has a number of active research programs in core disciplines such as programming languages, compilers, storage systems, networks, parallel computation, databases, fault tolerance, and foundations: scientific and engi - neering applications areas, including scientific problem-solving environments and large-scale scientific computation and databases; offensive and defensive security for computers and networks, trusted computing, cryptography; and other areas including but not limited to: random number generation, software maintenance, cloud computing, big data, mobile programming, deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, expert networks and fuzzy sets and systems. These research programs enjoy external support from agencies rang - ing from the National Science Foundation to the private sector. The Department of Computer Science has a full range of computing fa - cilities available for a variety of instructional and research needs. Faculty and graduate students share high-performance workstations, file servers, and compute servers. Students and faculty whose research requires higher compu - tational power have access to a variety of state-of-the-art machines, including supercomputers and computer clusters, across the University. Other affiliated research laboratories include the following: The Center for Security and Assurance in Information Technology (C-SAIT) Laboratory was established in 2000. Its mission is to serve as a focal point for members of different academic disciplines, government, and industry to carry out world-class research and to advance the practice and public awareness of information technology security and assurance through education and public service. C-SAIT is dedicated to the synthesis of education and research through combined focus on the theory and applications of Information Security.

Each option has a specific number of required courses as well as other requirements, as described below.Thesis Option In any major, a student under the thesis option must take seven courses (twenty-one semester hours) at or above the 5000 level, plus at least nine se - mester hours of CIS 5970r, Thesis. At most, nine semester hours of CIS 5970r may be counted toward the required thirty semester hours for the Master of Science (MS) degree. Approved CIS 5930/6930 courses are counted among these, but supervised teaching, supervised research, seminars, directed indi - vidual study (DIS), and CIS 5915 may not be included. The thesis is defended by registering for CIS 8976, Master's Thesis Defense (0). The student in the thesis option is required to propose and create an in - dividual thesis topic of appropriate focus, size and complexity and to write a document discussing it. The thesis is to be written in accordance with the University standards. Upon completion, a thesis must be defended success - fully to the department in an open forum and be approved by the major pro - fessor and supervisory committee. An electronic version of the thesis must be submitted to the Graduate School, the CS graduate coordinator, and the CS webmaster. Project Option In any major, a student under the project option must take eight courses (twenty-four semester hours) at or above the 5000 level, plus at least six se - mester hours of CIS 5915r, Graduate Software Project. At most six semester hours of CIS 5915 may be counted toward the required thirty semester hours for the Master of Science (MS) degree. Approved CIS 5930/6930 courses are counted among these, but supervised teaching, supervised research, seminars, directed individual study (DIS), and CIS 5970 may not be included. The stu - dent also must register for CIS 8974, Master's Project Defense (0), to defend the project. An electronic version of the project must be submitted to the CS graduate coordinator and the CS webmaster. Course-Based Option In any major, a student under the course-based option must take ten cours - es (thirty semester hours) at or above the 5000 level. A student must earn a \"B+\" or higher for at least six of the ten courses in order to graduate under the course-based option. Approved CIS 5930/6930 courses count toward the ten-course requirement, but supervised teaching, seminars, directed individ - ual study (DIS), supervised research, CIS 5915, and CIS 5970 may not be included. A student must also register for CIS 8966, Master's Comprehensive Examination (0), the semester of graduation. Supervisory Committee For the thesis and project options, it is the student's responsibility to form a supervisory committee regardless of his or her selected major. No later than the beginning of work on the thesis or project, the student must secure the consent of an eligible computer science faculty member to serve as the major professor. In consultation with the major professor, the student must secure the consent of at least two additional graduate faculty members to serve as the supervisory committee, chaired by the major professor. Doctoral Degree The Doctor of Philosophy is regarded as a research degree and is awarded on the basis of accomplishment in a recognized specialty in computer science. Such accomplishment should include scholarly mastery of the field, signifi - cant contributions to new knowledge in the field, and written and oral commu - nication skills appropriate for the field. The requirements for the PhD include the following: passing CIS 8962, the qualifying examination (portfolio defense), and CIS 8964, preliminary ex - amination (area survey); satisfaction of the course requirements; successfully defending a dissertation prospectus; and successfully defending a dissertation. All candidates for doctoral degrees in the department are required to partic - ipate in teaching activities at some time during their graduate careers unless waived by the department chair. Additionally, each doctoral student must com - plete at least one oral research presentation which is critiqued by at least one faculty member. This can be at the departmental research conference or any discipline-related conference. Each candidate must also meet the Publication Requirement, where the student is required to be the primary (e.g., first) author for at least one accepted or published regular paper (six or more pages) in a conference or journal that is ranked B or higher by the Computing Research and Education Association (CORE) [ https://www.core.edu.au/ ]. Course Requirements Doctoral students must complete four core courses (twelve hours), one course in each of the three areas (Software, Systems, and Theory) plus one ad - ditional core course from any of the three core areas. Equivalent courses taken at other institutions must be approved by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee (PEC).Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Computer Science 211 Students entering the program after earning a master's degree in Computer Science or related area must take at least four additional courses (twelve hours) beyond those taken for the MS degree, at the 5000 or 6000 level, as advised by the student's major professor and supervisory committee. These courses must be taken at FSU and a maximum of two courses (six hours) may come from outside of the department that were not previously used in the completion of a previous degree. Core courses can also be used to meet this \"four additional courses\" requirement provided they are taken at FSU and were not completed as part of an MS program. Supervised teaching, supervised research, DIS, and courses with prefix CGS do not count towards this requirement. Students entering the program after earning a bachelor's degree in com - puter science or related area must take at least nine courses (twenty-seven hours) at the 5000 or 6000 level, as advised by the student's major professor and supervisory committee. Four of these courses (twelve hours) must meet the PhD core course requirement. The four courses (twelve hours) must be taken at FSU and cannot be part of an MS degree program outside of the FSU Computer Science Department. A maximum of two courses (six hours) may come from outside of the Computer Science Department. Supervised teaching, supervised research, DIS, and courses with prefix CGS do not count towards this requirement that were not used in the attainment of a previous degree. The student's PhD committee can require the student to take more than the aforementioned number of courses. The student must receive a grade of \"B-\" or better on all graduate courses taken to satisfy the minimum course require - ments of the degree. Once these minimum requirements are met, however, it is permissible to take any subsequent courses on an S/U basis. The doctoral student must also complete at least twenty-four hours of CIS 6980r, Dissertation. A student may enroll in CIS 6980r only after being admit - ted to candidacy. Once admitted to candidacy, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two dissertation hours each semester until completion of the degree. The student must graduate with the doctoral degree within five years of being admitted to doctoral candidacy. Major Professor and Supervisory Committee As early as is feasible in the student's program, the student should identify an area for dissertation research and secure an informal agreement with a fac - ulty member to serve as the student's major professor. This agreement should include an understanding as to the area and timeline of the dissertation re - search. This agreement is formalized when the department chair appoints that faculty member to serve in this capacity. In a similar manner, the student must secure agreements with, and the chair must approve, the remaining members of the student's supervisory committee. This committee must consist of one additional faculty member of the department and one member of the graduate faculty in another department as the University Representative. In addition, the chair will appoint a member to serve as departmental representative. All members must hold graduate faculty status and the University Representative must be a tenured member of the faculty. The supervisory committee is responsible for approving an individual program of study, possibly including additional course requirements, and ver - ifying that the student satisfies the following departmental requirements. The area examination, prospectus, and dissertation defenses must be unanimously approved by the major professor and supervisory committee. Qualifying Examination (Student Portfolio Defense) The PhD Portfolio is intended to provide the department with a complete view of the student's accomplishments and abilities that relate to likelihood of success as a PhD professional. The portfolio is reviewed regularly by the Portfolio Evaluation Committee to determine whether the student is making suitable progress towards the degree and must be completed with a list of the satisfactory grades (\"B\" or higher) for the four core graduate courses when the student takes the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. Based on the completion of the portfolio, a student can enroll in CIS 8962, Doctoral Qualifying Exam. A passing grade \"P\" for the CIS 8962, Doctoral Qualifying Exam, is one of the two required components of admission to candidacy. The student should be enrolled in CIS 8962 (Doctoral Qualifying Exam) when he or she has completed the four core graduate courses, completed the portfolio, and both the student and major professor agree that the student is ready to take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. (Doctoral Qualifying Exams may be scheduled for Fall or Spring semester, but not Summer semester). The Portfolio Evaluation Committee will schedule and conduct the Doctoral Qualifying Exam during the semester. The exam will be oral and will cover the four core graduate courses taken by the student. The student will be tested on the four core graduate course topics. The student is strongly advised to study the core course topics well in advance in preparation for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam. Students that obtain an \"A or A-\" in any of the core subjects will be exempt from that portion of the oral exam. If a student gets all \"A or A-\"s in the four core classes used for the Qualifying Exam, that student will still need to submit a copy of the portfolio to the Portfolio Review Committee. All students admitted to the program but not yet admitted to candidacy, are required to compile and keep current a portfolio containing information rele - vant to the student's progress in the program. Required contents of the portfo - lio, submission dates, and guidelines for preparing the portfolio are found at https://www.cs.fsu.edu/academics/graduate-programs/portfolio . A student cannot take the Doctoral Qualifying Exam if he or she has not completed the four core graduate courses. However, there is one exception to this rule. A student who has received satisfactory grades with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher for all but one of the core courses can take the Qualifying Exam in the Spring term in which the last core course is being taken, assum - ing that the Qualifying Exams take place after spring break. In that case, the student is expected to be able to answer questions about all of the four core courses, including the core course currently being taken. If the student passes the oral, the exam is not recorded as passed until after the end of the term and the chair of the Portfolio Evaluation Committee has verified that the remaining core course has been passed with an acceptable grade. The portfolio of any student not yet in candidacy is reviewed annually by the departmental Portfolio Review Committee (PRC). This committee con - sists of a core that is appointed by the Department Chair and normally meets in the Spring. Feedback to the student on the contents of the portfolio and on progress toward admission to candidacy is provided after each review. The final review occurs in conjunction with the defense of the portfolio. Thus, when a student and his or her major professor agree the portfolio is com - plete, the student should register for the Doctoral Qualifying Exam, CIS 8962 (0), for the next semester. At most, students can take the Qualifying Exam twice. A student either passes or fails; there is no conditional pass. Preliminary Examination (Area Survey) The preliminary examination (area survey), CIS 8964, covers the student's intended area of research. It has both written and oral parts. Both parts of the examination are conducted by the student's supervisory committee, which may delegate the responsibility to a larger area committee. It is strongly rec - ommended that the student write an area survey paper as part of this exam. The oral part is open to all department faculty members having doctoral status who elect to participate. The oral part of the examination is held in an open forum that other students are invited to attend and is followed by a closed session if the committee so desires. Satisfactory completion of a preliminary examination shall be required for admission to candidacy for the PhD degree. No student may register for dissertation hours prior to the point in the semester in which the preliminary examination was passed. An admission to candidacy form must be completed and filed in the Office of the University Registrar prior to registration for dis - sertation hours. After completion of the admission to candidacy process, the student may retroactively add dissertation hours for that semester in which the preliminary examination was completed. Retroactive changes are only permit - ted if the preliminary examination is passed by the end of the seventh week of the semester. For term specific deadline dates, please refer to the \"Academic Calendar\" in the Registration Guide. The preliminary examination is designed to test scholarly competence and knowledge and to afford the examiners the basis for constructive recommen - dations concerning the student's subsequent formal or informal study. The form and content of this examination will be determined by the department, college, school, or examining committee (typically, but not necessarily the same composition as the supervisory committee) administering the degree program. Prior to the examination, the student's examining committee will determine whether the student 1) has a 3.0 average, and 2) has progressed sufficiently in the study of the discipline and its research tools to begin inde - pendent research in the area of the proposed dissertation. The chair of the Computer Science department, the academic dean, and the Dean of The Graduate School may attend any session of the supervisory or ex - amining committee as nonvoting members. A member may be appointed to the examining committee at the discretion of the academic dean or Dean of The Graduate School or on recommendation of the major professor. Normally, the examining committee will be identical with the supervisory committee. The examining committee will report the outcome of the examination to the aca - demic dean: passed, failed, additional work to be completed, or to be re-exam - ined; the report following the reexamination must indicate the student either passed or failed. The results of the examination will be reported to the Office of the University Registrar for inclusion in the student's permanent record. If a student fails the preliminary examination before being admitted to candidacy, a re-examination may be offered by the student's supervisory com - 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityComputer Science 212 mittee or other relevant decision making body within each department or unit, per that department or unit's doctoral student handbook. The Academic Dean's office should be notified of the outcome of any preliminary exam attempt. Students can take the preliminary examination for admission to candidacy only two times. A second failure on the preliminary exam makes the student ineligible to continue in the degree program. The second attempt at the pre - liminary exam shall occur no sooner than six full class weeks after the results of the first attempt are shared with the student. For the purpose of this policy, a \"full class week\" is defined as a week with five days during which classes are held at FSU. Students must be registered separately for their first and sec - ond attempt, if necessary within the same semester, and must receive either a \"pass\" or a \"fail\" grade for each attempt. An exception request regarding the timing of the re-examination can be submitted for consideration to the Academic Dean's Office by either the stu - dent or the supervisory committee. Students who allege that academic reg - ulations and/or procedures were improperly applied for the re-examination of their preliminary exam may have their grievances addressed through the general academic appeals process. The full preliminary exam policy as listed here must be added to all doctoral student handbooks. Admission to Candidacy In order to be advanced to candidacy for the doctoral degree, the student must: pass CIS 8962, the qualifying examination, which consists of passing the defense of the portfolio and completion of the four core courses with a grade of \"B\" or better pass CIS 8964, the preliminary exam, which consists of passing the area examination. Once completed the Graduate Coordinator will submit the admission to candidacy form located at the registrar's Website ( https://registrar.fsu.edu/forms/ admission_to_candidacy.pdf ) to the Dean's office for approval and processing. A student who has passed the preliminary examination and has been certified by the Office of the University Registrar (with an admission to candidacy form) is considered a candidate for the doctoral degree and is eligible to register for dissertation credits. A student must be admitted to candidacy at least six months prior to the granting of the degree. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure a minimal lapse of time for effective work on the dissertation after acquisition of the basic competence and after delineation of the problem and method of attack. More realistically, the student should expect to spend a year or more of work on the dissertation. Prospectus After passing the preliminary examination, the student is required by the Computer Science department to submit to the major professor, supervisory committee, and departmental chair a prospectus which consists of much of the background work for the dissertation, including: a thorough literature review, preliminary computational results, and/or bases for the feasibility of the re - search, and a proposal for research to be completed for the dissertation. Students are reminded to seek Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval prior to commencing any research involving human or animal subjects. The student's name must appear on the IRB approval and/or application form as a PI or associate/co-investiga - tor for the period of time when the student's research was conducted (i.e., data collections and analyses). Students must be listed on an ACUC protocol in order to conduct any animal research. Failure to be listed or obtain the required approvals may result in the dissertation being permanently embargoed and unpublishable in any form. In addition, as an appendix to the prospectus, publication plans should be presented. The research proposed should make clear and substantial advanc - es in the state of knowledge in computer science, and the publication plans should be designed to affirm the quality and nature of the research. Publication should be in nationally recognized conferences and journals in the field. The prospectus must be successfully defended before the student's supervisory committee in an open meeting. Dissertation After completing the research proposed in the prospectus, the student must write a dissertation. The dissertation represents the fulfillment of the propos - als made in the prospectus. The dissertation document must comply with all current University standards for style. The dissertation must be successfully defended before the student's committee in an open meeting. The dissertation must be successfully defended within five years of passing the preliminary exam (CIS 8964). To be acceptable it must be an achievement in original research consti - tuting a significant contribution to knowledge and represent a substantial scholarly effort on the part of the student. It is the responsibility of the major professor to supervise the preparation of the prospectus and the dissertation. The manuscript must be prepared according to the style and form prescribed by the department and must conform to the University requirements regarding format. The dissertation should be in the hands of the major professor and the examining committee at least four weeks before the date of the defense. At the same time, the dissertation should be submitted electronically to the Manuscript Clearance Advisor in The Graduate School so that the clearance advisor can provide the student with a critique of the manuscript with respect to the Graduate School's formatting requirements. Electronic submission instructions can be found on The Graduate School's website under Thesis, Treatise and Dissertation. A student who has completed the required coursework, passed the Preliminary Examination and submitted an Admission to Candidacy form to the Office of the Registrar, and continues to use campus facilities and/ or receives faculty supervision, but has not been cleared by the Manuscript Clearance office shall include in the required full-time load a minimum of two credit hours of dissertation per semester, including Summer term, until com - pletion of the degree. A student must be enrolled in a minimum of two hours of dissertation in the semester of graduation. Those with underload permission must register for at least two credit hours of dissertation per semester (or term). Underloads must be approved by the student's academic dean. Before regis - tering for dissertation hours, the student must consult the major professor as to the proportion of time to be devoted to dissertation work. Prior to degree conferral, all doctoral students must have completed a min - imum of twenty-four credit hours of dissertation. Doctoral students, after com - pletion of the preliminary exam and twenty-four credit hours of dissertation, must be enrolled for a minimum of three credit hours per semester (of which at least two must be dissertation hours) until completion of the degree. For more information on the full-time load for doctoral students, see the \"Student Course Load\" section of this Graduate Bulletin. For more specific information on final-semester registration, see the section \"Registration for Final Term.\" As a condition of undertaking a dissertation program, the student agrees that the completed dissertation will be archived in the University Libraries system. The student will make the electronic dissertation available for review by other scholars and the general public by selecting an access condition pro - vided by The Graduate School.

The School of Dance offers graduate work leading to the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in dance and the Master of Arts (MA) degree in dance with a major in American Dance Studies or Studio and Related Studies. The mission of the Florida State University School of Dance is to provide an environment conducive to the highest caliber of dance training, art making, and scholarship. Our approach encourages fluidity between the processes of making art, honing craft, and deepening intellectual explorations. We cultivate the individual cre - ative voice with exposure to diverse technical and philosophical approaches. Such an environment nurtures exceptional dance practitioners, allows us to make creative and intellectual contributions to the larger dance community, and fosters collaborative endeavors within and beyond our field. Outstanding artists, teachers, and scholars serve on the dance faculty and are committed to the individual mentoring of each graduate student's course of study. The emphasis of the Master of Fine Arts in dance includes choreography, performance, dance sciences, dance production design, and dance technology, complemented by required work in dance history and theory. The curriculum for each candidate culminates in a graduate creative project designed by the student in consultation with a mentor. Elective work may include dance ad - ministration, community engagement, and/or more advanced studies in the core curriculum. The creative project reflects each student's focus in any one or a combination of these areas of study. The emphasis of the Master of Arts in dance with a major in American Dance Studies is on the preparation of the historian or theorist. This program is based in research that investigates a wide range of dance practices, from the vernacular and religious to stage forms. Dance is examined within broad cultural contexts in order to understand the ways in which it both reflects and influences American identity. This major offers a scholarly focused option to complement the existing major in Studio and Related Studies, which offers a more practice-based emphasis of study. The major in American Dance Studies prepares the student, among other options, to continue study towards a PhD degree in Dance. The American Dance Studies major will also prepare stu - dents for careers or continued studies in diverse areas of the dance field that may include, but are not limited to: dramaturgy, dance administration, muse - um or dance archival studies, or arts library science. The emphasis of the Master of Arts in dance with a major in Studio and Related Studies entails investigation into one or more of the diverse areas within the field of dance that extends studio practices beyond performance and choreography. This degree is ideal for the focused pre-professional or returning professional whose interest is in broadening their preparation for areas of the field that may include, but are not limited to: community engage - ment, dance sciences, dance production design, dance pedagogy, and dance technology. Visiting artists, guest choreographers, and an outstanding dance lecture and film series are regular enhancements of the curriculum. Ongoing performance and repertory projects bring exceptional dance masterworks to campus for performance by the Florida State University dance majors, linking the artistic and technical development of dancers to their understanding of the cultur - al and historical context of the art. The Maggie Allesee National Center for Choreography (MANCC), a dance and choreographic research center affiliat - ed with the School of Dance, also hosts numerous internationally recognized dance artists. The program's facilities include spacious studios and the Nancy Smith Fichter Dance Theatre . Florida State University is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance.

Center members represent the disciplinary perspectives of sociol - ogists, planners, economists, geographers, and other social scientists, as well as behavioral, public health, and medical scientists. The Center's research and training programs are supported by grants and contracts from private and pub - lic entities concerned with the health and well-being of human populations. The Center offers a master's degree in demography and, in association with the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, a joint graduate pathway for both a planning and a demography master's degree. The Center also co - operates in the graduate programs of departments in the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, wherein candidates for doctoral degrees may elect demography as an area of concentration. Graduate students and faculty in oth - er colleges and schools within the University are also welcome to participate in the Center's research and training activities. Center faculty members maintain active research programs and serve as consultants to national and international agencies and as officers or directors of professional organizations in demography and allied fields. As part of the Center's training mission, faculty members often invite students to participate in research projects. Students affiliated with the Center have access to work - space equipped with desktop computers and statistical software, and to the Center's data and document archives. Each Fall, the Serow Scholarship and the Nam Scholarship are awarded to two students to help cover tuition in the Master of Science in Demography program. Each Spring, the Center awards the William J. Serow Prize to an outstanding student in the degree program. Combined BA/BS and MS-Demography Pathway Qualified students in any undergraduate major may count up to twelve graduate-level credit hours toward both their bachelor's and a master's in Demography. Students in a combined bachelor's/master's pathway have the advantage of being able to apply undergraduate tuition assistance (e.g., Bright Futures, Florida Pre-Paid) to graduate courses and to explore graduate course - work as an undergraduate student, easing the transition to graduate school. Students accepted into the master's degree program who have completed the twelve credit hours of required coursework as undergraduates may finish the degree with just fifteen hours of additional coursework and satisfactory com - pletion of a three-credit hour Master's Research Paper. Candidates must have: ninety credit hours of completed coursework (Honors Program students need just sixty credit hours; transfer students must have completed at least twenty-four credit hours at FSU) and an earned grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 or higher or a GPA of 3.0 and scores of at least 152 on the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning sections of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE).

OCEANOGRAPHY A graduate program in oceanography has existed at Florida State University since 1949. The department offers both the Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in oceanography with specializations in biological, chemical, geochemical, and physical oceanography. The oceanog - raphy program has earned both national and international recognition. Our faculty members often chair sessions at national and international scientific conferences, and their research is reported in the best professional journals. Oceanography faculty members have been elected Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Meteorological Society, and the American Physical Society. An Emeritus faculty member has also been a recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Award and has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and a current faculty member (Professor Allan Clarke) received the Nansen Medal from the European Geosciences Union. Current research projects are funded by the National Science Foundation, NOAA, NASA, U.S. Department of Energy, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, Office of Naval Research, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This combined research includes ocean modeling with supercomputers, direct EARTH, OCEAN, AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE Graduate Programs College of arts and sCienCes Website: https://eoas.fsu.edu/ Chair: Staley, Sturges, Thistle, Weatherly, Winchester, Wise Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science In 2010, the departments of Geological Sciences, Oceanography, and Meteorology merged to form the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science (EOAS). While retaining their respective programmatic focus, the geology, oceanography, and meteorology faculty offer a new level of interdisciplinary integration. This creates fresh opportunities for under - graduate and graduate education in the geosciences. The department provides students with an opportunity for holistic study of Earth's physical environment in preparation for professional careers in government, private, and academic sectors. Due to concerns about climate change, environmental sustainability, availability of natural resources, and environmental pollution and degrada - tion, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects an overall 5-7% increase in geoscience-related occupations between 2019 and 2029, which is similar to the growth rate for all U.S. occupations. Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science offers graduate degrees in aquatic science, geology, oceanography, and meteorology. The opportunities for study and the degree requirements are described below. GEOLOGY Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science offers post-baccalaureate studies leading to both the Master of Science (MS) and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in geology through a wide variety of specialties. The doctoral degree program is intended to develop independent research abilities for those students who have the talent and motivation for original and creative work. The FSU Geology program was formed in 1949. The Geology PhD pro - gram was initiated in the early 1960s. Faculty interests encompass many specialties, including geochemistry, micropaleontology, marine geology, hydrogeology, sedimentology and coastal processes, structure and tectonics, geochronology, petrology, and environmental geology. Geology majors, as well as students from other disciplines with a strong background in natural sciences, may enter the program. Research programs may be conducted within the program, or they may involve collaborative work with members of the departments of Physics and Chemistry, the College of Engineering, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute, the Department of Scientific Computing, and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Within EOAS, Geology conducts cooperative programs with the Florida Geological Survey, Northwest Florida Water Management District, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and the United States Geological Survey. The department's main geochemistry laboratories are at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Instrumentation available for research in - cludes inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers, thermal ionization mass spectrometers, light isotope mass spectrometer, spectrometers, gravimeter and magnetometer, recirculating sediment transport flume, automated settling tube, electrozone particle counter, computerized image capture and analysis system, and facilities for hydrologic studies of surface and ground waters (sat - urated and unsaturated). A number of research microscopes, image analysis system, GIS laboratory, and field vehicles, as well as geochemical sample and thin-section preparation equipment, also support the program. In addition to holding faculty positions at major universities around the world, graduates of the program have outstanding records in government and industry. In Florida, large numbers of graduates are employed by the Water Management Districts of the state, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Florida Geological Survey, the phosphate and clay mining in - dustry, and numerous geologic and engineering consulting companies. Outside the state, a large number of graduates hold scientific and executive positions with major petroleum, mining, and high-tech industries. Other geology grad - uates hold civil service positions with the United States Nuclear Regulatory 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityEarth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science 224 observations of ocean currents with current meters, analysis of environmen - tal pollution, studies of microbial and zooplankton populations, and benthic ecology. Frequently utilized external resources include the FSU Coastal Marine Laboratory (FSUCML) at Turkey Point, forty-five miles away from Tallahassee on the Gulf of Mexico; the Department of Scientific Computing; the Geochemistry Program at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, and the Electron-Microscopy Laboratory. Internal facilities include labo - ratories for radiochemistry, trace-element analysis, benthic ecology, water analysis, phytoplankton ecology, numerical modeling, and fluid dynamics. Extensive use is made of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet as well as the Florida Institute of Oceanography ves - sels, R/V Bellows and R/V Weatherbird , which are berthed in St. Petersburg. The FSUCML has recently obtained the 65' RV Apalachee , which is suitable for research and teaching throughout the NE Gulf of Mexico. The department's students and professors routinely participate in research cruises in oceans and seas around the globe. Admission Requirements Please review all college-wide degree requirements summarized in the \"College of Arts and Sciences\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin.

ECOLOGY: See Biological ScienceGraduate Department of ECONOMICS College of soCial sCienCes and PuBliC Website: Sherron ; Rockwood, Schlagenhauf The Department of Economics offers programs leading to the Master of Science (MS) in Applied Economics, the Master of Science (MS) in Economics, and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Economics degrees. The department has a history of emphasizing research and publication. Department graduates have found a ready market in academe, in government at all levels, and in business. The department offers students an opportunity to specialize in ten different fields, in addition to core areas of study. At least two professors have expertise in any given field of specialization. These factors, along with a highly favorable student-faculty ratio, permit much personal in - teraction between students and professors and allow for considerable flexibil - ity in the program of study a student might choose. In addition to listed fields of study, the department offers students the op - portunity for interdisciplinary work. A variety of interdisciplinary programs is available, including demography, gerontology, economics of education, law and economics, urban economics, and economic policy and government. Specialties in other fields outside the department, particularly statistics, fi - nance, and other areas in the social sciences, are also available. A detailed description of graduate work in economics appears in the Guide for Graduate Students in Economics . The Guide may be obtained by visiting the department Web page at https://coss.fsu.edu/economics . Admission Requirements The Department of Economics accepts applications for two programs: Master of Science (MS) in Applied Economics and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Economics. Both programs begin in the Fall semester. The Master of Science (MS) in Economics degree is only available to students admitted to the Department of Economics at the PhD level. A score of at least 148 on the verbal aptitude portion and 148 (MS) or 151 (PhD) on the quantitative aptitude portion of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and an upper division undergraduate grade point average of at least 3.0 are required for admission. Prior graduate training must show a minimum grade point average of 3.4. Applicants should provide the department with official transcripts from all prior institutions, a statement of purpose, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or curriculum vitae, and at least two (MS) or three (PhD) letters of recommendation addressing the appli - cant's potential for graduate study. Academic recommendations are preferred. International applicants, whose native tongue is not English, must achieve a minimum score of 90 on the IBT Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). With the approval of the University Office of Graduate Admissions, an exception to this rule can be made for those who have a degree from an English-speaking country. Applied MS applicants are required to complete Principles of Macroeconomics and Microeconomics, one semester of calculus, and one se - mester of statistics prior to starting the program. In addition, applicants need to have sufficient upper-level economics courses to demonstrate a thorough understanding of economics. Such an understanding is best demonstrated by doing well in Intermediate Microeconomics, Intermediate Macroeconomics, and Econometrics. PhD applicants are required to complete all of the afore - mentioned courses prior to starting the program, as well as a second semester of calculus and one semester of linear algebra. All new PhD students should arrive on campus four to five weeks prior to beginning of the Fall term for mandatory math review. Application Deadlines Completed admission applications for U.S. citizens should be submitted no later than two months prior to the Fall term; foreign nationals should apply no less than three months ahead. All application materials are to be submitted via the online application ( https://admissions.fsu.edu/apply ); no hard copies of documentation will be accepted by the department. It is recommended that 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityEconomics 230 those interested in being considered for a departmental research or teaching assistantship have a completed application on file with the Department of Economics by February 15 for fall entry into the graduate program. Departmental Teaching and Research Assistantships Departmental funding is awarded competitively, not only to provide finan - cial assistance but also to afford outstanding students a structured experience in teaching and research. All applicants are considered for departmental fund - ing and the strongest applicants may be nominated for University fellowships. Students can expect departmental funding to continue for up to four years (although it is awarded on a year-by-year basis), assuming timely progression on degree requirements, success in the academic program, adequate funding allocations to the department, and satisfactory performance of assistantship duties. Graduate assistants with qualifying appointments will receive a salary and a tuition waiver. Master of Science (MS) Degree Programs Master of Science (MS) in Applied Economics The Applied Economics MS degree at FSU is designed to be a self-con - tained program which gives the successful student valuable skills as an applied economist. Graduates with such skills are in demand by both the public and private sectors. This is intended to be a terminal degree and not preparation for entry into a doctoral program. Most full-time students will complete the program in a calendar year (Fall-Summer). There are six required courses (eighteen semester hours) for the Applied MS degree that must be completed with a minimum GPA of 3.0; two each in microeconomics (ECO 5114 and ECO 5117), macroeconomics (ECO 5206 and ECO 5208), and econometrics (ECO 5420 and ECO 5434). Students following the project-track of this program complete at least eight hours of graduate-level coursework beyond the required core courses, which typically involves two economics electives (six hours) approved by the Program Director and two semesters of the seminar course ECO 5922, Professional Development for Economists (two hours). Completion of the applied project involves registration and attendance in ECO 5973 during the Summer B and Summer C sessions and ECO 5973L during Summer A session for three hours each. During this sequence, the student selects, writes, and presents an applied project. The project track requires a minimum of thirty semester hours of graduate credit, including the required courses. Students following the thesis-track of this program complete at least six hours of graduate-level coursework beyond the required core courses, which typically involves two economics electives (six hours) approved by the Program Director and two semesters of the seminar course ECO 5922 taken for zero hours. In addition, the student writes a thesis for which at least six hours of ECO 5971 are granted. The thesis committee consists of a major supervisory professor and two other members of the Economics Department (or, if appropriate, one other department member and one \"outside\" professor), subject to the approval of the Program Director. An oral defense of the thesis is required (ECO 8976), where all members of the Economics Department are invited to attend. All students must adhere to the rules and deadlines govern - ing thesis submission as detailed by The Graduate School. The thesis-track requires a minimum of thirty semester hours of graduate credit, including the required courses. Students may substitute graduate courses offered by other departments for the economics electives, provided they can demonstrate the relevance of the coursework to their program of study and provided they obtain prior approval of the Program Director. Master of Sciences (MS) in Economics The Master of Science (MS) in Economics is offered via the \"PhD track.\" Students interested in this degree must apply to and be admitted at the PhD program level. The thesis and applied project options are not available with this degree. A student following the traditional MS program will be awarded an MS degree after completing the doctoral core courses in microeconomics (ECO 5115 and ECO 5116), macroeconomics (ECO 5204 and ECO 5207), and econometrics (ECO 5416 and ECO 5423), plus one course in mathematical economics (ECO 5405), and at least twelve additional credit hours of elective courses. The elective courses require prior approval of the Graduate Director. Supervised research (ECO 5914), supervised teaching (ECO 5940), and work - shops do not count toward the required elective hours. The six core courses must be completed with a minimum GPA of 3.0. In the event that a student must retake one (or more) of these courses in order to satisfy the core GPA requirements, the department will use the higher of the grades earned in the two attempts when making core GPA calculations. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Program The PhD in economics is a research degree which requires that the stu - dent demonstrate an ability to understand the body of economic knowledge, to communicate that knowledge, and to contribute to it. The core courses in Economic Theory, for a total twenty-seven hours, consist of two courses in microeconomics (ECO 5115 and ECO 5116), two courses in macroeconomics (ECO 5204 and ECO 5207), two courses in econometrics (ECO 5416 and ECO 5423), one econometrics field course (ECO 5424, ECO 5427, or ECO 5428), one course in mathematical economics (ECO 5405), and one course in the history of economic thought (ECO 5305). Students must show competence by passing core examinations in the areas of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The PhD core examinations are ad - ministered in May and August. If a student fails one or both exams, a retake of the failed component is required for the following August. Students are only allowed one retake. A student who elects not to take the exam in May forgoes the opportunity for a retake, and must pass the exam on the first attempt the following August. PhD students must select both a major and minor field of specialization. In order to satisfy the field requirements, a student must complete at least two courses (per field; total of twelve hours) with a minimum GPA of 3.75 in the major field and 3.5 in the minor field. No single course may count for more than one field. The two specialized fields are to be selected from the following list or, with approval of the Graduate Director, the student may take work in one outside field: Applied econometrics Experimental economics Financial and monetary economics Industrial organization and regulation International economics and development Labor economics Law and economics Population economics Public economics Urban economics The Department offers two to four workshops (ECO 6938) each semester in which advanced research topics are critically reviewed. Participants in these workshops attend seminar sessions, prepare formal discussion comments, and present ongoing research. Participation in at least one workshop every Fall and Spring semester, graded on an S/U basis and generally taken for zero credit hours, is a requirement of the PhD program. A doctoral student must complete fifty-four semester hours of graduate coursework, including instruction in fundamental quantitative techniques, and may obtain the traditional master's degree en route. No more than six of the required fifty-four hours may be directed individual study (ECO 5906 or ECO 5907) or graduate tutorial coursework (ECO 5932). The fifty-four semester hours consists of twenty-seven hours from the Economic Theory core, twelve hours from the major and minor fields, and fifteen hours of electives approved by the Graduate Director. After passing core examinations and successfully defending a dissertation prospectus (ECO 8969), students may be admitted to doctoral candidacy with the approval of the Department Chair. In consultation with the faculty and graduate student advisor, students are expected to design a program that provides the preparation necessary for the PhD core examinations and for the analysis required in dissertation work. The dissertation entails a minimum of twenty-four hours of credit (ECO 6980), is written under faculty supervision, and must be orally defended (ECO 8985) in accordance with the deadlines and regulations of The Graduate School. University regulations require that all committee members and the student must attend the entire defense in real time, either by being physically present or participating via distance technology. The department abides by University regulations and does not impose any further restrictions.

A special feature of the Florida State University program is that students may present a body of creative work for the dissertation. The teaching apprenticeship program is a strong feature of the department's graduate program. Each year the department appoints a number of graduate teaching assistants (TAs) who normally teach two sections each semester, usually of composition (advanced graduate students in all fields also teach introductory literature and creative writing courses), in addition to enrolling in nine semester hours of coursework. Faculty supervisors support these teachers in their work. New TAs participate in a teacher-training program during the summer term preceding their appointment, for which they receive a modest stipend. Faculty specialists in rhetoric and composition conduct this program and train teachers not only for classroom instruction but also for tutorials and writing clinics in the department's Reading/Writing Center and two digital studios. Moreover, two computerized classrooms and two laptop-ready class - rooms allow graduate students to teach computer-assisted writing. The department also publishes two literary magazines, The Kudzu Review and The Southeast Review , and faculty members regularly edit scholarly jour - nals. Many students also gain journalistic experience by writing for the inde - pendent campus newspaper. The creative writing concentration program spon - sors weekly literary readings through the Jerome Stern Distinguished Writers Series. Each year, the literature faculty sponsors the English Colloquium, which features lectures by Florida State University and invited lecturers who present their most recent scholarship. Graduate students offer their scholarly research at various university-sponsored colloquia. Each year students in the department hold Legacy Fellowships, Dissertation Research Fellowships, or Kingsbury Writing Scholarships. In addition, minority students often hold the Leslie N. Wilson-Delores Auzenne Assistantship or McKnight Fellowships. The department annually recognizes outstanding achievements among its students in both teaching and scholarship with the following awards and honors: the Bertram and Ruth Davis Award for Outstanding Graduate Career; the Robert O. Lawton Award for Excellence in Teaching First Year Composition; the Fred L. Standley Award for Most Effective Teacher Among Graduate Assistants; the Marian C. Bashinski Award for Excellence in Teaching First Year Composition; the Bryan Hall Award for Excellence in Teaching First-Year Composition; the Bertram and Ruth Davis Award for Outstanding Dissertation in English Literature, Criticism, Linguistics or Rhetoric; the J. Russell Reaver Award for Outstanding Dissertation in American Literature; the John Mackay Shaw Academy of American Poets Graduate Award; the Sassaman Graduate Creative Writing Award; the Sassaman Graduate Critical Award; the Edward H. and Marie C. Kingsbury Fellowship Award and the Adam Johnson Fellowship to support a creative writer's research project. Application Deadlines Students are admitted to begin coursework in Summer C (although self-paying students typically begin in Fall). To be considered for admission, completed applications must be on file in the Department of English by the January deadline established on the English department Website. College Requirements Please review all college-wide degree requirements in the \"College of Arts and Sciences\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Master's Programs in English Admission to the program is determined by a departmental committee and normally requires: 1) an undergraduate major in English, or its equivalent, ordinarily with an upper-level average of at least 3.0; 2) Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores; 3) three letters of recommendation assessing the applicant's potential to do master's level work in English; and 4) a writing sample. These are minimum criteria and meeting them does not guaran - tee admission. A candidate for the Master of Arts (MA) in English may elect to empha - size literature, media, and culture, or rhetoric and composition. To ensure that students have ready assistance in shaping a program designed to meet their needs and in planning a course of study which will meet the requirements of their particular emphasis, all students are expected to consult their advisors every term. The Associate Chair of Graduate Studies (ACGS) in English will serve as advisor to all first-term master's candidates or until another advisor is chosen. To complete the Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in English, students must satisfy the following requirements:Graduate Department of ENGLISH College of arts and sCienCes Website: https://www.english.fsu.edu/ Chair and Pryor Professor in Shakespearean Literature: Bruce Boehrer; O'Rourke, Ortiz-Taylor, Rowe, Walker, Yancey The Department of English offers work leading to the Master of Arts (MA), Master of Fine Arts (MFA), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees. Reflecting its transformation from the Florida State College for Women into a comprehensive research institution at the close of World War II, Florida State University offered its first MA in English in 1945 and its first PhD in 1955. In the subsequent years, hundreds of Florida State University English students have taken postgraduate degrees and have filled teaching, research, administrative and post-doctoral positions in colleges and universities across the nation. Our postgraduate students have also accepted positions of respon - sibility and leadership in publishing, consulting, the public sector, private foundations, journalism and other areas of employment where research skills, rigorous analysis, and good writing are valued. During a period of rapid tran - sition and accelerated change in the fields of literary, rhetorical and cultural studies, as well as in creative arts, we retain our offerings in traditional his - torical periods, developing those in diverse world literatures, while also fully engaging with the spectrum of current theoretical approaches in literatures, media and creative arts. Florida State University is also widely recognized as a growing player in the fields of digital humanities and the History of Textual Technologies, and much of that initiative comes from faculty and graduate students in the department of English. Such efforts in contemporary and tra - ditional graduate study are overseen by an internationally renowned faculty. Trained at premier research institutions throughout North America and Europe, faculty members\u2014including one Eppes Professor and two Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professors\u2014are award winning teachers and inter - nationally recognized scholars. Over twenty-five faculty members have won University-wide teaching awards and one currently holds the title of University Distinguished Teaching Professor. In addition to prize-winning original fic - tion, poetry, and essays, creative writing faculty also produce nationally ac - claimed textbooks in both fiction and poetry that have an impact on writing students across the nation. Faculty research regularly appears in books pub - lished by distinguished university presses around the globe, as well as in the foremost professional journals, such as Publications of the Modern Language Association (PMLA), African-American Review (AAR), English Literary History (ELH), Review of English Studies (RES), Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States (MELUS), Digital Scholarship in the Humanities (DSH), American Literature (AL), The Journal of Advanced Composition (JAC), English Literary Renaissance (ELR), the Journal of English and Germanic Philology (JEGP), ), Modernism/modernity (M/m), Journal of Modern Literature (JML), and Modern Drama (MD) . Candidates for the MA, MFA, and PhD degrees emphasize literature, media, and culture; creative writing; or rhetoric and composition, but the de - partment offers coursework and degree options in a number of related fields such as popular culture, folklore, and critical theory. The English department is home to the History of Text Technologies, an innovative interdisciplinary program which combines studies in histories and theories of the book and of media cultures. Students can take the History of Text Technologies as an area of concentration for the MA and PhD. For the MA degree, students elect literature, media, and culture or rhetoric and composition concentrations. Masters students in literature, media, and culture must defend a Capstone Masters Essay. Masters students in rhetoric and composition can either defend a thesis or submit and defend a portfolio. Master of Fine Arts students submit and defend a creative thesis.

Smith, Syvrud; Assistant Lecturer: Herring; Bank of America Eminent Scholar in Finance: Ang; Wells Fargo Professor of Finance: Peterson; Christiansen; Gene Taylor/Bank of Cheng, Knill; Dean L. Cash Professors of Finance: Autore The Department of Finance faculty has diverse interests spanning all areas of finance including financial management, investments, financial institutions and markets, multinational financial management, financial modeling, and quantitative methods. The faculty possesses a commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and service activities. The fundamental responsibilities of the finance faculty are to preserve existing knowledge, to create new knowledge, and to transmit knowledge to others. To transmit knowledge to the graduate student a variety of teaching techniques and methodologies are employed, including case studies, lectures, simulations, computer modeling, oral and written presentations, discus - sions groups, study groups, co-research projects, and independent study and research. The faculty members consider their research activity important for two reasons. First, the constant search for, and testing of, new knowledge is a ba - sic foundation of economic progress. Second, as the financial and economic environment changes, current knowledge may become obsolete. The finance faculty members are involved in the development of new financial and man - agement techniques so that their students are prepared to meet the challenges they will face during their careers. The faculty's research appears in many scholarly publications. The finance faculty is dedicated to the advancement of the finance profes - sion not only through its teaching and research activities but also through its involvement with outside government, business, academic, and professional organizations.

PhD Program The doctoral program is forty-eight graduate credit hours, composed of twenty-four coursework hours and twenty-four dissertation hours: the three required courses (nine hours) of the master's degree (if not taken previously), one additional core course (three hours), at least four elective courses (twelve credit hours), and dissertation hours (twenty-four credit hours). All doctoral students must pass qualifying exams, including written and oral portions, for admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree. The supervisory committee will determine pass or fail by a majority vote. Students who fail these exams after two attempts will be dropped from the doctoral program. A student ad - mitted to candidacy is eligible to register for dissertation hours. Completion of the dissertation normally requires at least one year. The student prepares a written dissertation prospectus that demonstrates the potential to conduct original research making a significant contribution to knowledge. Once the prospectus is deemed acceptable to the major professor and the supervisory committee, the student begins the research and writing process. The final step involves an oral defense of the dissertation, which is open to public viewing. During the dissertation defense, all committee members and the student must attend the entire defense in real time, either by being physically present or participating via distance technology. Students are required to take four core courses (twelve credit hours) and earn at least a \"B\" in the following: GEO 5058 Survey of Geographic Thought (3) GEO 5118C Introduction to Geographic Research (3) GEO 5165C Quantitative Geography (3) OR GEO 6113 Qualitative Geography (3) GEO 6093 Professional Development Geography (3) A further four courses (twelve credit hours) must be chosen from approved lists and passed at a grade of \"B-\" or better. Financial Assistance The Department offers a limited number of graduate assistantships. These are initially awarded for two semesters and generally entail a stipend of ap - proximately $18,000 for PhD and Master's students, with possibility of addi - tional support for teaching summer classes. Support in following years is con - tingent on satisfactory performance academically and in assistantship duties, for a maximum of two years for master's students and four years for doctoral students. Department assistantships usually include a waiver of tuition. Department assistantships require that recipients perform instructional or research duties within the Department. Students holding assistantships are required to provide between thirteen and twenty hours of service to the Department per week. Most master's students assist faculty in the classroom or online, while most PhD students have full responsibility teaching under - graduate courses, gaining valuable instructional experience. University policy stipulates that all students receiving financial assistance in a given semester must register for nine credit hours, including summers.

GEOGRAPHY: REGIONAL see Geography; General Bulletin: Latin American and Caribbean StudiesGraduate Program in GEOPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS Administered by the Department of Scientific Computing and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute (GFDI) College of arts and sCienCes Service) The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program leads to a degree in Computational Sciences with a major in wither GFD or Fire Dynamics. It is an interdisciplinary field of study whose primary goal is an improvement in our basic understanding of fluid flows that occur naturally, including such diverse topics as climate and paleoclimate, biogeochemical processes, hydrology and Karst dynamics, air-sea interaction, wild fire dynamics, double diffusive pro - cesses, and hurricane dynamics with strong links to the Applied Mathematics Program. The approach to this understanding is through quantitative analysis of observational records and theoretical, mathematical, numerical, and exper - imenting modeling. A geophysical fluid dynamicist must have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of classical physics, knowledge of the techniques of applied mathematics, and an interest in the natural sciences. It follows that the course of study leading to a degree in geophysical fluid dynamics is a rewarding one in which the student gains an overview of the geophysical sci - ences not available from study in a single discipline. The interdepartmental graduate program of study leads to the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree; there is no master's degree offered. The program is administered by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute and has its own separate degree requirements. It differs from the regular departmental offer - ings in the earth sciences mainly by its interdisciplinary approach and empha - sis on the fundamentals of mathematics, physics, and fluid dynamics, with less emphasis on descriptive material from any one discipline. A major factor in the success of this PhD program is the strong support provided by the Departments of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science (EOAS), Mathematics, Physics, Scientific Computing, and Statistics, and the College of Engineering. In particular, these departments offer a wide range of courses from which the student in geophysical fluid dynamics constructs an individualized curriculum. Faculty members of various departments who have an active research interest in geophysical fluid dynamics form the heart of the program by serving as advisors and instructors for the students in the program. Facilities are situated in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute , whose primary function is to support and foster those theoretical, experimental, nu - merical, and observational studies of natural environmental fluid flows that transcend the traditional departmental disciplines. These facilities include a large modern laboratory for hydrodynamics ex - periments, a colloquium room and reading room (furnished with books and periodicals in fluid dynamics, classical physics, applied mathematics, geo - physical sciences, and astrophysical sciences), a photographic and illustrations laboratory, a large modern machine shop, a precision instrument-makers lab - oratory, and faculty and student offices. Institute facilities also include several precision rotating turntables, a six-meter water channel, convection tanks, temperature controlling systems, general and digital photographic systems, multi-channel data acquisition systems, laser facilities, various machine tools, and other electronic equipment. The institute houses a facility for measuring ocean turbulence as well.

College of Health and Human Sciences The Department of Human Development and Family Science's mission is optimizing human development and family well-being. The primary strategy used to achieve this mission is translational family science designed to com - press the 17-year gap between scientific finding and implementation of that finding in everyday practice. Family and Child Sciences' signature areas of graduate study within translational family science are: a) parenting and peer relationships for minimizing risky behaviors and optimizing child and adoles - cent development; b) interventions that build individual and family strengths in clinical and community contexts to prevent problems and promote quality of life; and c) methodological training to exploit the untapped potential of large existing data. A particular focus on those made vulnerable by social or legal marginalization. Our commitment to science, both in discovery and its application in practice, prepares graduate students to assume leadership roles in community-based organizations dedicated to protecting children from harm, that promote primary prevention through individual and family resil - ience, and public sector services to children and families. Doctoral students are eminently equipped to assume positions in higher education, research sci - entist positions in \"think tanks\" as well as state and federal government, and to direct program evaluations at local, state and national levels. The Department of Nutrition, Food and Exercise Sciences' mission is to contribute to the prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases through basic and applied research and strong teaching programs that prepare the next gen - eration of scholars and practitioners. The Department of Nutrition, Food and Exercise Sciences trains gradu - ate students to become well-grounded in science, to be able to rely on health and information technologies, to be equipped with critical thinking skills, to possess cross-functional knowledge and skills, and to be able to work in inter - disciplinary environments. Programs are dedicated to training researchers and practitioners in techniques necessary for effective intervention for the preven - tion and/or treatment of chronic diseases. Florida State University was the first university to develop majors in nutrition and exercise physiology at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Students are provided with in-depth study of nutrient metabolism, nutrition support in health and disease, health behav - ior, food science and technology, exercise physiology, and sports sciences. Students may pursue degrees at the master's and doctoral levels with options in nutrition and food science and exercise physiology. Master's students are trained as clinical exercise physiologists and as food scientists or technolo - gists, and are also trained in: dietetics, sports nutrition, sports sciences, fitness, nutrition education, and health promotion. Doctoral graduates are prepared for academic and nonacademic positions.

It boasts strong graduate programs in selected areas of American, European, African-American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Latin American history. In addition to the traditional MA degree that requires mastery of a major and a minor field and completion of a thesis, the depart - ment provides an MA with a major in public history that prepares students for careers such as archivists and museum curators and lays the groundwork for historically-oriented careers in governmental agencies and the private sector. Two other masters programs, an MA teaching track and MS as terminal degree provide other options. Particularly gifted students may be eligible for the fast- track MA-PhD program. The department also participates in interdisciplinary programs in women's studies, international affairs, Asian studies, and social sciences. Some of these interdisciplinary programs lead to an MA degree and others to the PhD. For information concerning these programs, refer to their appropriate entry in this Graduate Bulletin . At the doctoral level in history, students may earn the de - gree by demonstrating mastery of a major field and three minor fields and completing a dissertation. Graduate students have access to the many collections at the Strozier Library. Because Strozier is a United States government repository, it hous - es abundant governmental documents available for graduate student use. In addition, The Florida State Archives, located within walking distance of the campus, includes private collections as well as state government documents. The Florida Supreme Court library and the Florida A&M University Black Archives are also located in Tallahassee and provide valuable resources. Over the years, the department has been recognized for consistently high standards in both classroom teaching and published research. Faculty mem - bers have frequently won the annual University Teaching Award, with sever - al members having won the award more than once. Members of this faculty have also received the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Distinguished Scholar Award. Two members have been named Distinguished Teaching Professors, the highest distinction the University faculty bestows for teaching, and one has won the Florida Professor of the Year designation. Scholarly contributions by faculty are numerous and currently include over one hundred books, the development of the second largest collection of Napoleonic source materials in the country, and several major research projects, including the prestigious multi-volume Black Abolitionist Papers Project. The Institute on Napoleon and the French Revolution , as part of the his - tory department in the College of Arts and Sciences, was founded in 1990 by the Florida Board of Regents. Supported by the French Revolution and Napoleon Collection in the Strozier Library, which includes over 20,000 titles in the field, the Institute is the largest and most active of such programs in the United States. Over a dozen students from throughout the country are current - ly enrolled in the Institute and over 110 doctoral and master's students have graduated from the program. The Institute organizes international meetings, publishes appropriate volumes, holds symposia, and is one of the founding and active members of the Consortium on Revolutionary Europe. Established by the FSU History Department in 1997, the Institute on World War II and the Human Experience is dedicated to preserving the history of this global conflict. With more than 6,500 collections, the Institute maintains one of the largest archives documenting the human dimension of World War II with a special emphasis on the role of American servicemen and service - women, as well as those serving on the home front. Housed in the Bellamy Building, the Institute serves as a resource to scholars, students, teachers, and the general public. The Institute sponsors an annual Fall and Spring lecture that brings to campus distinguished scholars. It also periodically organizes conferences, from topical specialties such as Comparative Home Fronts to an annual meeting of the Society for Military History (2017). 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityHistory 270 Definition of Prefixes AMH\u2014American History ASH\u2014Asian History CLA\u2014Classical and Ancient Studies EUH\u2014European History and Historiography LAH\u2014Latin American History WOH \u2014World History Graduate Courses American History AMH 5177.

Piers Rawling Florida State University offers a program in the History and Philosophy of Science, leading to an undergraduate minor or a master's degree. The focus of the program is on the biological sciences, although we welcome applications from potential students interested in other areas of science. We take very seri - ously the importance of working on topics of relevance to the society in which we live, and we are strongly committed to an interdisciplinary approach, with involved faculty drawn broadly from across the university, especially the hu - manities and the natural sciences. As a major university, we are able to offer opportunities for study and re - search in topics of particular pertinence to our region, such as racial issues, conservation and problems of pollution, and clashes between science and reli - gion. We also have major strengths in other areas, including logic and formal methods, social philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, environmental history, history of the South, African American history, ancient science and mathematics, and evolution and ecology. FSU has attractive competitive scholarships, and there are opportunities for research and teaching assistantships that include remission of tuition. Strong library facilities exist, and we are building further on these. We are committed to helping our students when they complete their degrees, either to further graduate work or to entering the work force. The master's degree, with its multidisciplinary breadth, is appropriate for those interested in pursuing a PhD in philosophy, history, religion, or biology. It is also suitable for those undergraduates who would like to combine it with one of the traditional disci - plines in our combined bachelor's-master's program. In all cases, we will aim to tailor individual course programs to suit students' needs. The Program hosts an annual conference or workshop, supported by the Werkmeister Fund. Those interested in learning more about the degree, or in enrolling, should consult our Website and contact the office of the Director. Degree Requirements On entering the degree program, all students will be assigned an individ - ualized committee of pertinent faculty to oversee their personal program. All students enrolled in the History and Philosophy of Science Program are re - quired to take a minimum of twelve courses. All students must engage in a significant piece of independent research. There are two options, and students will be expected to choose one after con - sultation with their personal committee. One option is to write an MA the - sis (approximately seventy-five pages). A successfully completed thesis will count the equivalent of four courses. The second option is to write two research papers, with the intent to publish. There is no word limit (upper or lower), for this will depend on the topic and other factors (for instance, philosophy papers are generally shorter than history papers). A paper deemed satisfactory by the student's committee will count the equivalent of two courses. The remaining courses will be chosen in consultation with the personal committee, and can be taken in either history or philosophy (or some combina - tion thereof), or in one or more of the other associated departments (religion, classics, biology, psychology, etc.). All courses must be passed with a grade of at least \"B-\", and students are expected to maintain a \"B\" average. Note: Program is not accepting applications at this time.

Research findings are the foundation of an innovative curriculum that focuses on understand - ing the complexities of daily family life and how children and adults develop across the life span. Graduate training emphasizes translating results from rigorous research into real-world solutions that help children, adults, and fam - ilies. We believe student learning is most effective when it occurs through active engagement in research and teaching. The department offers a Master of Science degree in Family and Child Sciences. Thesis and non-thesis options are available; the thesis option typ - ically leads to subsequent pursuit of a doctoral degree, while the project op - tion is typically selected by professionals who will assume leadership roles in community agencies or governmental departments or units serving children and families. The department offers two Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs: 1) Human Sciences with a major in Human Development and Family Science, and 2) Marriage and Family Therapy. These doctoral programs are designed to produce the next generation of scholars who compete successfully for fac - ulty positions in human development and family science, marriage and family therapy, and related fields at research-intensive institutions. In keeping with college policy, there is no language requirement for doctoral students. Admission Requirements Applying to the graduate programs in Family and Child Sciences requires submission of 1) official copies of transcripts with degrees posted from all colleges/universities previously attended; 2) official Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores (verbal, quantitative, and writing); 3) three letters of recommendation; and 4) a statement of professional goals (for the master's program) or professional goals and research interests (for the doctoral pro - gram). Competitive applicants to the doctoral program must have Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores better than or equal to 50th percentile, and a 3.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale for the last two years of academic work. Only applicants for whom a designated member of the departmental graduate fac - ulty expresses willingness to mentor will be admitted to the program. In some instances, supplemental coursework (undergraduate and graduate) may be required for students entering the program from other fields of study or with - out proper requisite knowledge. Options available to the student are discussed prior to admission to the program. Students entering the doctoral program in Marriage and Family Therapy must have completed a master's degree in MFT from a COAMFTE accredited program or a closely related degree. Master's and Doctoral students are admitted for Fall only. Financial Assistance The Department of Human Development and Family Science makes every effort to provide financial assistance, including stipends and tuition waivers, for doctoral students in good standing. Students seeking a master's degree may request financial assistance.

INDUSTRIAL/APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY: see PsychologyGraduate Department of INDUSTRIAL AND MANUFACTURING Park, Vanli, Yu, Wang; Assistant Professors: Li, Sun, Sweat Emeritus: Braswell The Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering offers three graduate degree programs: the Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Industrial Engineering and the Master of Science (MS) in Systems Engineering (MSSE). MSSE is also offered as a fully online degree. Industrial Engineering is a broad discipline that encompasses education and basic/applied research concerning the design, improvement, and instal - lation of integrated systems of people, material, information, equipment, and energy. Graduate instruction and research are broadly grouped into three categories: manufacturing engineering, quality engineering, and industrial systems. Current research interests include manufacturing processes and sys - tems; statistical; quality control; failure and life cycle analysis; mathematical optimization of complex production systems; condition monitoring; reliability engineering; statistical machine learning; distributed composites and multi-scale materials; simulation for material processing; composite material processing. Systems engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering systems over their life cycles. SE studies systems, processes, and practices required to develop them. These engineers are dedicated to ensuring all stakeholder needs are met in the best, most efficient way possible. SE facilitates deep integration of tech - nical systems and helps ensure the systems developed are coherent, effective, and sustainable solutions to fulfill the system needs. SE professionals work with all facets of a system, from hardware to facilities, personnel to proce - dures. Our systems engineering program integrates engineering disciplines with industrial and management practices. Through the program, students will develop skills required in the national workforce for growing areas in the tech - nology-driven global economy. Research Facilities The Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering provides an excellent environment for instruction and research. The department has the following laboratories housed in the College of Engineering: Materials and Product Property Characterization, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Precision Manufacturing, and Quality Engineering. In addition, the students have access to the 44,000 square foot state-of-the-art labs at Florida State University's High-Performance Materials Institute (see https://hpmi.research. fsu.edu/ ), which houses the following laboratories: Mechanical Testing Lab, Chemical and Thermal Analysis, Additive Manufacturing Lab, Manufacturing Lab, and Characterization Lab. Each laboratory in the Department is equipped with state-of-the-art re - search and instructional equipment.

Master of Science (MS) The department offers a variety of Master of Science in Industrial Engineering (MSIE) program options to accommodate students' needs and specializations. Students may pursue a traditional MS or an MS with special - ization in engineering management. The traditional MS program is research based, requiring the students to write and defend a thesis in their chosen area. The Master of Science with specialization in engineering management (MSIE- EM) does not require a thesis. The department also offers a BS-MS combined pathway, which provides students with a unique opportunity to complete grad - uate education on an accelerated schedule. Additionally, the department offers an MS in Systems Engineering (MSSE), a course-based, non-thesis degree de - signed for both full-time students and full-time working professionals. MSSE is also offered as a fully online program. The Industrial Engineering Graduate Handbook , which is available from the department, provides a complete de - scription of all programs and requirements. Admissions Candidates for admission to graduate study in industrial engineering must meet university and departmental criteria. In some cases, students may be ad - mitted on a provisional basis pending successful completion of prerequisite work. In all matters concerning admission, decisions made by the departmen - tal graduate committee are final.

The research proposal must be submitted to the supervisory committee after the student passes the preliminary exam (usu - ally one year after the preliminary exam) and before beginning dissertation research. The student must also provide an oral presentation to the committee at least one week after submitting the proposal. The proposal offers the student an opportunity to convince the supervisory committee of the appropriateness of the research topic, as well as of his/her capability to pursue the projected topic to a successful conclusion. Subject to approval of the doctoral candidate's committee confirming the candidate's readiness to defend his/her dissertation, and upon meeting the department publication requirements, the candidate may proceed to defend their dissertation research. A doctoral dissertation then must be completed on a topic approved by the candidate's doctoral supervisory committee. To be acceptable, it must be an achievement in original research constituting a significant contribution to knowledge and representing substantial scholarly effort on the part of the student. The doctoral supervisory committee, depart - ment chairperson, and such other members of the faculty as appointed by the academic dean or specified by university regulations will conduct the exam - ination. Publication of the dissertation shall conform to the regulations of the university in which the student is registered. During the dissertation defense, all committee members and the student must be physically present. In cases where this is not possible, the department allows no more than one member to participate in the defense in real time via distance technology. The distance technology must allow two-way audio and visual links.

Metcalf (Social Sciences); Director of Undergraduate Studies: Whitney Bendeck Director of International Economic Education: Norrbin (Economics); Director of Internships and Professional Development: Na'ama Nagar (Political Science) International Affairs is an interdepartmental degree program leading to the degrees of Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Science (MS). Courses are to be selected from the participating programs of Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Political Science, History, Law, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Philosophy, Public Administration, Religion, Sociology, and Urban and Regional Planning. Courses from outside the participating depart - ments, for example, the College of Education, may be credited toward the degree as long as the course hours do not exceed ten semester hours. Joint Graduate Pathways are also offered in cooperation with the College of Law and the Department of Urban and Regional Planning. Most students in the degree program anticipate careers in government, business, international organizations, journalism, or teaching, although the degree program can serve as a stepping stone into more specialized doctoral programs. The program is structured so that it can be individually tailored to a wide variety of career goals. Foreign-policy oriented positions within the United States federal government are only one important possibility. State governments, particularly Florida, are increasingly involved in activities with an international component, creating a demand for those trained to deal with the international environment. Similarly, business firms, even those that do not yet rely extensively on export markets, must deal knowledgeably with international competition and other international economic forces which affect their ability to survive in the marketplace. A large number of international organizations, whether intergovernmental and associated with the United Nations, for example, or private nonprofit organizations, also rely on people who are trained in any one of several traditional disciplines, integrated with an international, interdisciplinary emphasis. Students in the master's degree program take courses with distinguished faculty members with related interests in any of the ten participating depart - ments and school. Each student's supervisory committee is also made up of faculty from the participating departments and school. These faculty members may share an interest in a particular geographic area, for example, or in a top - ical specialty such as political and economic development or national security. Applicants can compete for the department's graduate assistantships. Study Abroad Programs International affairs students are encouraged to participate in the University's intensive study abroad sessions held each summer. Programs designed for graduate students are available in Dubrovnik, Istanbul, Panama, Prague, and Moscow. The programs are designed to expose students to a wide variety of issues and resources relating to their curriculum in an international setting. Internships The Degree Program in International Affairs provides a variety of in - ternship opportunities designed to supplement coursework toward the mas - ter's degree. Some internship placements are with agencies and businesses in Florida's capital that work in the international arena. Others are available in Washington D.C. through our partnership with the Washington Center Program. Students can also apply for one of the several internships available in London where we place our students in Parliament, the American Embassy, Amnesty International, NBC, the Associated Press, the British-American Chamber of Commerce, and other significant organizations or in Panama with U.N. regional offices. All internships must be approved in advance by the pro - gram director.

Kerr Research Chair in Marketing: Cronin; Bob Sasser Professor of Marketing: Brady; Carl of Business Administration: of Madeline Duncan Rolland Associate Professor of Business: Scott Relative to other marketing departments around the world, the FSU Department of Marketing is unique in terms of composition and focus. In addition to faculty in the traditional areas of marketing strategy and consum - er behavior, the department also houses faculty in sales, public policy, and multinational business. The ability to leverage the synergies among these ac - ademic areas is a key competitive advantage and strength for the department. In addition, many of the marketing faculty (regardless of academic specialty) have a scholarly focus in services marketing. This is also a key strength of the department, in that a services focus coincides with the thrust of our national and state economies, virtually all of the placement opportunities for marketing graduates, and an established scholarly interest in the interdisciplinary nature of services. Combined Bachelor's in Marketing/Master of Businsess Administration Pathway (BS-MAR/MBA) Given the vast number of career paths that stem from marketing, it is essen - tial that students understand how they can most effectively prepare themselves for the options that lie ahead. The demand for many of the traditional market - ing career paths continues to expand as jobs like sales management, retail mer - chandising, brand management, and advertising/PR, regularly appear in job postings. Additionally, the rapid growth of big data has created the tools for more accurate consumer insight, resulting in a new facet of marketing-based jobs. Companies continue to aggressively compete to recruit recent graduates who are trained in the skills required to conduct a more in-depth customer analysis. This change has created many marketing positions, including jobs like consumer insight analyst, customer analyst, market segment analyst, and consumer insights manager. Because these career paths are all rooted in an un - derstanding of analytics, graduate programs in marketing are becoming more popular. By specializing in marketing, students can leverage the multifaceted career set they develop in our MBA program with a highly focused curriculum designed to help students understand consumer behavior, segmentation, and the application of big data. Students will need to apply for admission to the combined BS-MAR/ MBA pathway in the fall or spring of their junior year for the following fall. Admission will require an overall GPA of at least 3.4, an upper-division GPA of at least 3.2 and an upper-division marketing GPA of at least 3.2 based on at least two upper-division marketing courses at the time of application. Admitted students are then able to register during their senior year for up to nine semester hours of graduate courses that count towards both the BS-MAR and MBA degrees. Students admitted to the combined BS-MAR/MBA path - way will still be required to apply for the MBA program through the regular process in their senior year. Combined pathway students must maintain an average of 3.00 GPA or higher in graduate coursework. This program also creates a unique opportunity for students wishing to go directly to work and then enter our part-time or online MBA program. Students entering this program within four years of undergraduate graduation will still be able to use these credits as long as they are able to graduate within seven years of the first graduate course.

For more details, see the Bulletin entry for Interdisciplinary Master's Degree in Data Science. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree The PhD degree indicates knowledge of mathematics and a demonstrat - ed capacity to do original, independent scholarly investigation. Early in the doctoral program, the student will complete major concentration-area course requirements or their equivalents (including courses required for the area MS degree) and will arrange a major professor or co-director within the depart - ment to direct the doctoral research. Three to six additional members com - plete the supervisory committee so that it is mutually agreeable to the student, the major professor or co-director, and the department chair. The supervisory committee must include three or more graduate faculty members of the depart - ment as well as a University Representative appropriately drawn from outside the department. The student then satisfies the area, department, and university requirements for doctoral candidacy (MAT 8964) and writes and defends a dissertation of original and independent research. The candidate, the major professor or co-directors, two other supervisory committee members from mathematics, and the University Representative are expected to be physically present at the dissertation defense. Consensus of the supervisory committee is necessary for a pass of the dissertation defense. Studies leading to the PhD are available in Pure Mathematics, Applied and Computational Mathematics, Financial Mathematics, and Biomathematics. Each area of study specifies its own course requirements. The PhD qualifica - tion and candidacy examinations together comprise the preliminary examina - tion, MAT 8964. Course requirements are chosen to provide the student with a strong basis for research. Standard foundational material is covered in the 5000-level courses with more advanced material in topics courses and semi - nars. Some of the required courses may be offered by other departments. The student will be expected to actively participate in at least one of the seminar series offered by the department and to regularly attend the weekly mathemat - ics colloquium. The doctoral student in mathematics can be required by his/her supervi - sory committee to demonstrate proficiency in a minor; normally this is ac - complished by completing six or more semester hours in an approved mathe - matics-related subject with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0. At the discretion of the student's supervisory committee, the student may be required to demonstrate competence in research tools appropriate to the student's pro - gram of studies. Such tools may include a reading knowledge of one or more foreign languages, technological skills, a minor, or other competencies. After the student is admitted to doctoral candidacy, the writing of a dis - sertation becomes the major concern, although further coursework is usually required. The University's residency requirement must be satisfied. After ad - mission to candidacy the student must register for at least twenty-four hours of dissertation credit (MAT 6980) and also register and participate in the ap - propriate research seminar for a minimum of three semesters, as well as the mathematics colloquium for a minimum of two semesters. It is a University requirement that the defense of dissertation must be held within five years from the time the student is admitted to doctoral candidacy; if this time limit is not met, the student may be required to repeat the qualifying or candidacy examination.Definition of Prefixes MAA\u2014Mathematics: Analysis MAD\u2014Mathematics: Discrete MAP\u2014Mathematics Geometry OCP\u2014Physical Oceanography Prerequisite Courses Note: Please refer to the General Bulletin for full course descriptions.

Established in 2003, CISCOR has become a leading center in Florida for the development and implementation of technologies related to Intelligent Systems, Control, and Robotics. The multidisciplinary High-Performance Materials Institute (HPMI) performs research for emerging advanced composites, nanomaterials, multifunctional materials and devices, and advanced manufacturing. Currently, HPMI is in - volved in four primary technology areas: High-Performance Composite and Nanomaterials, Structural Health Monitoring, Multifunctional Nanomaterials Advanced Manufacturing, and Process Modeling. Over the last several years, HPMI has proven a number of technology concepts that have the potential to narrow the gap between research and practical applications of nanotube-based materials. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is the only facility of its kind in the United States. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the largest and highest-powered magnet laboratory in the world, headquartered in a sprawling 370,000-square foot complex near Florida State University. The lab also includes sites at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and at the University of Florida. Together these three institutions operate the lab, collaborating in a unique interdisciplinary way to advance basic science, engineering, and technology in the 21st century. The Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC), a research division of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, was established to advance the sci - ence and technology of superconductivity and particularly superconductivity applications by investigating low temperature and high temperature models. The Energy and Sustainability Center (ESC) has been established to address our most challenging energy issues through the development of innovative alternative energy solutions for consumers and industry. The center will de - velop a portfolio of pre-commercial research programs to explore reliable, affordable, safe, and clean energy technologies. A key objective of ESC is to encourage future commercial application of the technologies that flow from the research. ESC has a number of specialized facilities for technology de - velopment and implementation including: a fuel-cell testing laboratory, a wa - ter-electrolysis electrode testing laboratory, a solar-thermal system component testing facilities, small-scale electrical power systems laboratory, and other facilities through collaborations with the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, the Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS), and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). The Institute for Energy Systems, Economics and Sustainability (IESES) at Florida State University will be an essential component of Florida's leadership in sustainable energy. The Institute is a public resource. We carry out scholarly basic research and analysis in engineering, science, infrastructure, governance, and the related social dimensions; all designed to further a sustainable energy economy. The Institute unites researchers from the disciplines of engineering, natural sciences, law, urban and regional planning, geography, and economics to address sustainability and alternative power issues in the context of global climate change. Our goal is scholarship that leads to informed governance, economics, and decision making for a successful Florida sustainable energy strategy. The Active Structures and Microsystems Laboratory is focused on the me - chanics and physics of adaptive materials and their integration into structures and devices. This includes exploring fundamental field-coupled behavior (electric, magnetic, photomechanical, chemical), device and structural dy - namics research, and the development of advanced and control designs for broadband performance and precision tracking. This requires synergies be - tween materials science, engineering, and mathematics. We collaborate with several researchers that range in backgrounds that include physics, mathemat - ics, experimental fluid dynamics, and materials science to advance the field. The Cryogenics Laboratory, located in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, is a fully developed facility for conducting low-temperature ex - perimental research and development. The laboratory, which occupies about 400 square meters, supports in-house development projects as well as scien - tific work. The experiment apparatus within the lab include the following: 1) Liquid Helium Flow Visualization Facility (LHFVF): This facility consists of a 5 m long, 20 cm ID horizontal cryogenic vacuum with vertical reservoirs at each end. A variety of experimental test sections can be installed in the facility for measurements of flow and heat transfer including flow visualiza - tion studies. The LHFVF is currently being used for PIV studies of forced flow superfluid helium. 2) Cryogenic Helium Experimental Facility (CHEF): This facility consists of a 3 m long, 0.6 m ID cryogenic vessel with N2 and He temperature thermal shields. CHEF is equipped with a high-volume flow bellows pump capable of up to 5 liters/s. Currently, CHEF is being used to study high Reynolds number liquid helium flow through orifice plates. 3) Liquid Helium Research Test Stands : Numerous conventional vertical access dewars and insert cryostats are available for smaller scale experiments on heat transfer and flow. These include dewars between 10 cin ID with depths to 2 in. 4) Additional equipment: The laboratory contains all necessary equipment to carry out modern cryogenic experiments. Modern instrumentation for data Graduate Department of MECHANICAL ENGINEERING faMu\u2014fsu C ollege C. Ord\u00f2\u00f1ez, Sciver The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers two graduate degree programs: the Master of Science (MS) and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). The graduate program in mechanical engineering is designed to provide stu - dents with the necessary tools to begin a productive career in engineering practice or research, a career that probably will span a period of three to five decades. Although it is not possible to teach everything that one needs to know in the graduate program, the program provides the student with the skills, knowledge, and philosophy that will enable the student to continue to grow throughout his/her career. The graduate training a student receives emphasizes a fundamental approach to engineering whereby the student learns to identify needs, define problems, and apply basic principles and techniques to obtain a solution. This philosophy is incorporated in classroom lectures, laboratory activities, design projects, and research. It is essential that a successful department cultivates and maintains a di - verse and dynamic program that is nationally recognized. The department is actively involved in basic research, which expands the frontiers of knowledge, as well as applied research designed to solve present and future technological needs of society. The major research activities are focused in three primary areas: fluid mechanics and heat transfer, solid mechanics and materials sci - ence, and dynamic systems and controls (including mechatronics and robot - ics). State-of-the-art laboratories are associated with each of these areas. In addition, much of the research is conducted in cooperation with the National High Field Magnetic Laboratory (NHMFL), the Department of Scientific Computing, the Center for Materials Research and Technology (MARTECH), and the Center for Nonlinear and Non-equilibrium Aero Science. A complete description of the mechanical engineering graduate program, including recent changes, may be found at https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/me . Research Programs and Facilities The Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion (FCAAP) has been estab - lished to ensure that the State of Florida remains at the forefront of the aero - space industry and maintains a highly skilled workforce to develop, test, tran - sition, and manufacture the next generation of aerospace technologies. The center is a partnership between four state universities, with FSU as the leading institution. The Advanced Aero-Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL) , also located at FSU, is the primary experimental and research facility. AAPL contains testing and diagnostic facilities not commonly available at university research centers. These include: a new Hot Jet Anechoic Facility capable of operating superson - ic hot jets - up to 2000 Fahrenheit, a STOVL Test Facility, an optical diagnos - tic development lab, and a supersonic and a large subsonic wind tunnel. In addition to AAPL, the center is home to several state-of-the-art research lab - oratories led by an experienced team of internationally recognized scientists, researchers, and engineers. In collaboration with government and industry, FCAAP will serve as a technology incubator to promote innovative research and encourage a rapid transition of technologies to market. FCAAP plays a vital role in shaping the next generation of air and spacecraft designs, space transport systems, and aviation safety. FCAAP's current research is focused on Active Flow, Noise and Vibration Control, Aero-optimization, Advanced Propulsion and Turbomachinery Systems, Sensor and Actuator Development, Advanced Diagnostics, Aero-Thermodynamics and Aeroacoustics, High Performance Computation, Smart Materials, Systems and Structures, and oth - er related fields. The vision of the Center for Intelligent Systems, Control, and Robotics (CISCOR) is to use state-of-the-art technology to develop practical solutions to problems in systems, control, and robotics for applications in industry and government. CISCOR is a cooperative research effort in the automated systems area across four departments (Mechanical, Chemical, Electrical, and Civil) in the College of Engineering. The center's goal is to provide a means for the state of Florida to achieve national prominence in the area of automated systems and to assume a leadership role in the state of Florida's technology Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Mechanical Engineering 307 acquisition is available to support experiments. High vacuum equipment in - cludes a mass spectrometer leak detector and two portable turbo pump systems that provide thermal isolation. A high-capacity vacuum pump (500 liter/s) is used to support sub-atmospheric liquid helium experiments as low as 1.5K. The Advanced Materials Processing and Applications Laboratory (AMPAL) is focused on the processing, characterizing, and testing of materials in con - junction with micromechanical modeling. Materials of interest include, but are not limited to, super plastic alloys (Niobium, Copper, Aluminum), structural steel, and high-strength conductors such as Copper-Silver. These materials are employed in a number of scientific and engineering applications ranging from superconducting and electronic applications (radio frequency cavities, mag - netic materials, etc.) to structural applications. Processing involves the devel - opment of various sever plastic deformation methods such as tri-axial forging, equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE), rolling, swaging, and wire drawing suitable for producing bulk quantities of ultra-fine-grained material. Also, cur - rently being explored is a novel case hardening technique for both stainless steels and low carbon steels. The laboratory is equipped with various tools for characterization and testing. Some of the equipment include a high-res - olution analytical transmission electron microscope, field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with dual beams capable of perming in-situ ion-milling (ion beam), and 2D/3D-electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements (electron beam). The micromechanics modeling efforts provide an opportunity to correlate the material properties with microstructure. The mechanical modeling effort is being used to explain tension, nano-indenta - tion, shear, and super-plasticity of advanced materials including composite. AMPAL collaborates with various other research groups and institutions both nationally and internationally to achieve our research goals. The Scansorial and Terrestrial Robotics and Integrated Design (STRIDe) Laboratory is dedicated to the design, analysis, and manufacturing of novel and dynamic robotic systems. In order to imbue robotic systems with the agility and functionality akin to their biological inspirations, it is critical to understand the interplay between the structures' underlying passive dynam - ics and the control systems that enervate them. Research in this lab involves working closely with biologists to understand the underlying functional principles behind successful animal locomotion. These principles are then encoded in simplified dynamic models. The analysis of these models leads to insight regarding the roles of passive and active elements in creating self-sta - bilizing dynamic systems. Innovative manufacturing processes, such as Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) and other rapid prototyping techniques, are then applied to build robots capable of moving in a dynamic and agile manner over difficult terrain. To analyze and build these robots, the lab is equipped with dynamic motion analysis equipment as well as a suite of state-of-the-art manufacturing tools. Graduate students participating in research are provided office space in the laboratories and have access to substantial staff support from their research group.

After approval by the oral examining committee, the stu - dent should submit the final version of the thesis electronically (the so-called \"ETD\" format) to the Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Advisor by the Final Manuscript Submission and Forms Deadline of the semester in which they intend to graduate. Please see the departmental Graduate Studies Handbook available on the Department's website for further details. Requirements for the Master of Arts (MA) in Spanish For the MA in Spanish, students may choose either a thesis-type program or a course-type program. For the thesis -type program, the student must com - plete a minimum of thirty semester hours of credit including thesis credit. At least eighteen of these hours must be taken on a letter-grade basis (A, B, C). The minimum/maximum number of thesis hours for completion of a master's degree shall be six hours. For the course -type program, the student must complete a minimum of thirty semester hours of coursework. At least twenty-one of these hours must be taken on a letter-grade basis (A, B, C). For both the thesis and course-type MAs in Spanish, students may choose from three tracks for specialization: 1) Iberian and Latin American Literatures and Cultures; 2) Linguistics; and 3) Linguistics and Literature. Regardless of specialization, all students must complete LIN 5744 Introduction to Language, Language Learning, and Language Instruction (3) during the Fall semester of their first year. Upon recommendation by the graduate advisor, graduate students may be required to take SPN 5900, Advanced Spanish Composition and Translation (3), which will not count toward the course-area requirement but will count toward the hour requirements for graduation. No graduate credit can be transferred from another school to count toward the MA degree at FSU. In general, undergraduate courses taken at FSU will not apply toward gradu - ate credit. However, on approval by the minor professor (see below Master Comprehensive Examination), some courses at the 4000-level (no more than six semester hours) may be counted toward the minor field of the MA degree. Specialization in Iberian and Latin American Literatures and Cultures Students pursuing the track in Iberian and Latin American Literatures and Cultures must complete a minimum course requirement of five courses in var - ious areas. At least two of these courses must be in Iberian Literatures and Cultures (from different time periods, such as Medieval Literature, Golden Age, 18th and 19th Centuries, and 20th and 21st Centuries) and two in Latin American Literatures and Cultures (from different time periods, such as Colonial, 19th Century, and 20th and 21st Centuries). Courses corresponding to each area can be found on the Spanish program's website. In addition, all students must complete SPW 6806, Research Methods and Bibliography in Literary and Cultural Studies (3). Specialization in Hispanic Linguistics Students pursuing the track in Hispanic Linguistics must complete a mini - mum course requirement of five courses in various areas. At least two of these courses must be in Formal Linguistics (in areas such as Spanish Phonetics and Phonology, and Spanish Syntax) and two in Applied Linguistics (in areas such as Psycholinguistics, Second Language Acquisition, and Sociolinguistics). Courses corresponding to each area can be found on the Spanish program's website. In addition, all students must complete LIN 5932, Quantitative Research Methods in Language Studies (3). Specialization in Language and Literature Students pursuing the track in Language and Literature must complete a minimum course requirement of five courses in various areas. At least one course must be in Iberian Literatures and Cultures, one in Latin American, one in Formal Linguistics, and one in Applied Linguistics. In addition, all stu - dents must complete either SPW 6806, Research Methods and Bibliography in Literary and Cultural Studies (3), or LIN 5932, Quantitative Research Methods in Language Studies (3). Master's Comprehensive Examination (for both thesis-type and course-type program) The examination in the Literatures and Cultures areas is based on course - work and the MA reading lists; in Linguistics the examination is based on coursework and reading lists prepared in consultation with the examining professor(s). The Examination Panel will be composed of all Spanish and Portuguese program faculty members from the corresponding areas with Graduate Faculty Status, as well as the minor professor (if any) who must also hold Graduate Faculty Status. The Comprehensive Examination will cov - er three areas from the areas listed above for each specialization. Each area will be covered in one exam. Students in the specialization in Iberian and Latin American Literatures and Cultures must take at least one exam in Iberian and one exam in Latin American literature and cultures. Similarly, students in the specialization in Hispanic Linguistics must take at least one exam in Formal and one exam in Applied Linguistics. Students in the specialization in Linguistics and Literature must take at least one exam in Linguistics and one exam in Literature. MA Thesis Students who choose the thesis-type program need to take their Master's Comprehensive Examination as described above. For the thesis, the student needs to constitute an MA Supervisory Committee made up of a major profes - sor, two other faculty members from the Division of Spanish and Portuguese, and the minor professor (if any). The composition of the Supervisory Committee must be communicated to the Graduate Program Coordinator or to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies for registration with the Graduate School no later than the second week of classes in the semester that the stu - dent intends to graduate. All members of the Supervisory Committee must hold Graduate Faculty Status. A prospectus of the thesis must be approved by the Supervisory Committee before registering for SPW 5971, Thesis. It is the responsibility of the major professor to supervise the preparation of the prospectus and the thesis. A copy of this prospectus, bearing the signatures of all committee members, must be submitted by the student for inclusion in the student's folder. The student must register for SPW 8976, Thesis Defense in the semester the defense is to take place. Copies of the thesis must be submitted to the Supervisory Committee at least two weeks before the Oral Defense of the thesis. The initial version of the thesis must also be submitted to the Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Advisor by the Initial Format Submission Deadline of the semester they intend to graduate. After approval by the oral examining committee, the student should submit the final version of the thesis electronically (the so-called \"ETD\" format) to the Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Advisor by the Final Manuscript Submission and Forms Deadline of the semester in which they intend to graduate. Please see the departmental Graduate Studies Handbook available on the Department's website for further details. Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in French The Doctor of Philosophy in French is a research degree designed to foster mastery of the language together with advanced knowledge and analytical and critical skills in appropriate areas of French and Francophone studies. The student is expected to become familiar with past and current achievements in the field and demonstrate the ability for original scholarly research. Course requirements: A minimum of three academic years of graduate study (at least sixty semester hours) beyond the baccalaureate degree (or equivalent) is normally required in the doctoral program. Credits acquired at the master's level count towards this. On progressing beyond the master's level, candidates for a PhD in French will be expected to take ten three-credit courses and thereby fulfill requirements in three categories, consisting of four, four, and two courses respectively as follows: a major/minor category that will consist of four courses, a Distribution category (see below) that will also consist of four courses, and two courses in an unrelated field that will serve as Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Modern Languages and Linguistics 317 an Elective category. Although students will be required to adhere to the four- four-two pattern in fulfilling the requirements, there is considerable flexibility in the exact choice of courses. Some courses may help to fulfill requirements in more than one category (e.g. both the \"major/minor\" and \"Distribution\" cat - egories), thus enabling students to take additional courses in areas of particular interest to them while remaining within the ten-course total overall. Course selection will be made by the student in consultation with the major advisor and the program's graduate advisor. Major/minor requirements: In fulfilling these requirements, students will typically take two to three courses in the major and one to two courses in the minor. Distribution requirements: Students will be required to take four courses across the fields represented by the French faculty. Specifically, students will be required to take two pre-1800 courses and two post-1800 courses to be determined in consultation with the major advisor and the graduate advisor. Courses taken to satisfy the distribution requirement can also be counted to - ward the major or minor. By the same token, additional courses could be taken in the major/minor or distribution fields while respecting the ten-course total overall. Unrelated Field (Electives): Based on the overlapping four-four-two dis - tribution system, two of the student's courses will be in unrelated fields, hence electives. In choosing electives students should keep in mind the need for intellectual coherence. No more than two courses can be taken outside of the department, and all courses in the first semester must be taken within the department. If acceptable to the Graduate Advisor, some courses on the 4000-level in both the major and minor field may be counted as graduate credit toward the PhD degree provided no comparable 5000-level course is avail - able. No more than six semester hours of 4000-level courses in French may be counted towards the degree and no more than six semester hours of 4000-level courses may be taken in the minor field without the permission of the Graduate Advisor. The doctoral student is expected to include two 6000-level courses. Please see the departmental Graduate Studies Handbook available on the Department's website for further details. Language Requirement: Prior to the Doctoral Preliminary Examination, the student must demonstrate reading knowledge in one language other than French and English which is germane to the research in the student's proposed specialty area. The language is determined in consultation with the Graduate Advisor and the major professor. The requirement can be satisfied 1) by pass - ing the Reading Knowledge Examination offered for several languages by the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics (such as SPA 5069, GER 5069, etc.); or 2) by completing a 2200-level course in that language with a grade of B or better (please note: the College of Arts and Sciences does not allow tuition waivers to cover undergraduate courses); or 3) through docu - mentary evidence of the candidate's personal experience in and exposure to the language, for instance by having accomplished a period of work in the language, or by having resided during a substantial period in a country where the language is widely used. In the latter case, the Graduate Advisor and major professor determine whether the evidence is sufficient or if further assessment of competence is needed, and of what nature. Courses taken in high school do not satisfy the requirement. The language requirement must be satisfied before taking the Preliminary Examination. Doctoral Supervisory Committee: Five faculty members constitute the pre - ferred minimum, four faculty members the required minimum. The Supervisory Committee shall include the major professor, minor professor and a University Representative, who may also be the minor professor, and an additional two or three other faculty members from the French faculty. All of the minimum constituency of the Supervisory Committee must hold Graduate Faculty Status and three of them - major Professor, Representative of the Graduate Faculty, as well as one other member - must hold Doctoral Directive Status. The University Representative must be a tenured professor. The Graduate Advisor will approve the composition of the student's proposed Supervisory Committee and forward the list to the Graduate Program Coordinator or to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies who will register the committee with the Graduate School. The definite composition of the Supervisory Committee has to be communicated to the Graduate School no later than the second week of classes in the semester that the student intends to graduate. Doctoral Preliminary Examination: The examination is prepared by the Supervisory Committee in coordination with the Major Professor. The Doctoral Preliminary Examination will take place in the third or second to last week of the Spring semester. It will consist of four essay-style questions each to be answered in an in-class written exam taking place in a four-hour time slot on four separate days during the course of one week. The four questions will be: 1) on the dissertation topic (in the major area); 2) on the minor area; 3) on the unrelated field; and finally 4) on a subject satisfying the distribution requirement or, if this has already been satisfied, a further question on the ma - jor area or a question on another field in which the student has taken courses. If any one question of the written examination is considered unsatisfac -tory by any member of the committee, an oral exam may be required to reexamine the student in that area. If the student does not pass two or more questions, the entire written examination must be retaken at least four months after the original examination. All requirements for the doctorate must be completed within five calendar years from the time the student passes the Preliminary Examination or the exam must be repeated. The formal status of candidate for the doctoral degree (the so-called \"ABD\" status) is granted after the student has passed the Doctoral Preliminary Exam and an \"admission to candidacy\" form has been filed with the Office of the University Registrar (please see the Graduate Program Coordinator for this form). No student can register for dissertation hours prior to the point in the semester in which the preliminary examination was passed. After completion of the \"admission to candidacy\" process, a student may retroactively add dissertation hours for that semester, but only if the preliminary examination was passed by the end of the seventh week of the semester. A minimum lapse of at least six months between achieving \"admission to candidacy\" and the granting of the PhD de - gree is required. Prospectus of Dissertation: After completing the Preliminary Examination but no later than the end of the semester following the Preliminary Examination, the candidate must submit an acceptable Prospectus of Dissertation to the Supervisory Committee and orally defend the prospectus. The Committee members must receive the prospectus two weeks in advance of the oral de - fense of the prospectus. A copy of the Prospectus bearing the approval signa - tures of all the members of the committee must be submitted by the student for inclusion in the student's file. Please see the departmental Graduate Studies Handbook available on the Department's website for further details. Dissertation: The doctoral Dissertation must be on a topic connected with the major field and must constitute a significant research contribution to knowl - edge. The candidate must register for FRW 6980r, Dissertation, during each term in which he or she works substantially with the Supervisory Committee or uses the research facilities of Florida State University (minimum of two dissertation hours per term). The student must be registered for at least two semester hours of dissertation during the term in which the defense is held. A minimum of twenty-four semester hours of FRW 6980r for credit is required. There is no fixed limit for the maximum. In case the dissertation research con - cerns human subjects, the student must include a copy of the IRB (Institutional Review Board) Approval Letter and sample copies of any Informed Consent Forms in the appendices of his/her manuscript. Oral Defense of Dissertation: The student must register for FRW 8985, Dissertation Defense, in the semester the defense is to take place. Copies of the dissertation with an abstract of 350 words must be submitted to the Supervisory Committee at least four weeks before the Oral Defense of the dissertation. Responsibility for suggesting the date, time, and place of the oral defense of the dissertation rests with the major professor. Further requirements for the oral defense, as well as the submission of the dissertation to the Graduate School's Manuscript Clearance Adviser, are entirely those imposed by the Graduate School. The date, time, and place of the Oral Defense of Dissertation must be announced by memo from the major professor at least two weeks in advance to the Supervisory Committee, the Candidate, the Coordinator and the Advisory Board, the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies, the Chair of the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics, the Dean of the College, and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Please see the departmental Graduate Studies Handbook available on the Department's website for further details. Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Spanish A minimum of thirty semester hours of graduate credit in Spanish and/or approved related fields beyond the MA degree at or above the 5000 level is normally required in the doctoral program. The two tracks for specialization are: A) Iberian and Latin American Literatures and Cultures (Early, Modern, Contemporary); and B) Language and Linguistics, (Formal Linguistics, Applied Linguistics, Second Language Acquisition). Minimum area requirements for students in the Iberian and Latin American Literatures and Cultures track are: twelve hours in the major area, six in the secondary area, three in the remaining area, and nine for electives. Minimum area requirements for students in the Language and Linguistics track are: six hours in Linguistic Theory, three in Applied Linguistics (socio - linguistics, psycholinguistics, etc.), six in Second Language Acquisition, six in Research Methods and Statistics, and nine for electives. All coursework should be arranged with the Graduate Advisor or, after the first year at the latest, with the major professor. Courses taken for the MA degree may be used to satisfy this distribution requirement. Permission from the Spanish and Portuguese program is required to use courses taken for the BA to satisfy this requirement. All PhD candidates are also required to take: 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityModern Languages and Linguistics 318 LIN 5932 Quantitative Research Methods in SLA (3) (only for linguistics specialists); LIN 5744 Introduction to Language, Language Learning, and Language Instruction (3); FOW 5025 Critical Theory and Its Applications to Non-English Literatures (3) (only for literature specialists). These courses should be taken as early in the student's program as possible and must be taken before the Preliminary Examination. After students have earned the MA degree in Spanish or thirty semester hours of graduate credit in Spanish, they must spend on the Florida State University campus a period of continuous enrollment of at least twenty-four graduate semester hours of credit in any period of twelve consecutive months. Language requirement: The language requirement for the doctoral de - gree consists of reading knowledge in two languages other than Spanish and English which are germane to research in the student's proposed specialty area (one language if the language is not a Romance language, such as Russian or Chinese, and the student demonstrates advanced proficiency as indicated by coursework or a degree). The student's Supervisory Committee determines which languages are germane. The requirement can be satisfied by 1) passing the reading knowledge examination offered by the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics (FRE 5069, GER 5069, etc.) or 2) completing a 2200-level course with a grade of \"B\" or better (please note: the College of Arts and Sciences does not allow tuition waivers to cover undergraduate cours - es). Courses taken in high school do not satisfy the requirement. The language requirement must be satisfied before taking the Preliminary Examination. Doctoral Supervisory Committee: The Supervisory Committee will consist of a minimum of four members with Graduate Faculty Status. It will consist of the major professor and at least two members of the Spanish graduate faculty, plus a University Representative who must be a tenured professor, and the minor professor (if any). The University Representative may also be the mi - nor professor. Any other members of the Committee will be chosen from the Spanish faculty and must have Graduate Faculty Status. The committee must include a representative from each area in which the student is to be exam - ined on the Preliminary Examination. The Graduate Advisor will approve the composition of the student's proposed Supervisory Committee and forward the list to the Graduate Program Coordinator or to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies who will register the committee with the Graduate School. The composition of the Supervisory Committee has to be communicated to the Graduate School no later than the second week of classes in the semester that the student intends to graduate. Doctoral Preliminary Examination: Before taking the preliminary examina - tion, the student must have a Major Professor and Supervisory Committee, an approved Program of Studies form, have completed the language requirement, and have taken any required courses (see above). The PhD examination in Iberian and Latin American Literatures and Cultures will consist of three sections. Two parts will be from the following areas of specialization: Early, Modern, and Contemporary. The third part of the examination will be on the student's dissertation topic. In consultation with the major professor, the student will create a substantive reading list for the dissertation area. The examination questions, based on this reading list, will relate generally to the dissertation topic. The exam format is to be deter - mined by the Major Professor and will either be an in-class written exam or a take-home written exam. The in-class exam is a twelve-hour examination consisting of four hours on three separate days during the course of one week. Questions should be written in consultation with all faculty members with expertise in the area. Questions will be specific in nature and may include identifications, essays, problem-solving questions, etc. The use of a dictionary is not permitted during the in-class exam. Each take-home exam will be com - pleted over the course of a week (seven days). All three take-home exams must be taken within a one-month period.

Definition of Prefixes COM \u2014Communication ENC\u2014English Composition MOB \u2014Molecular BiophysicsGraduate Program in MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS College of arts and sCienCes Website: https://biophysics.fsu.edu/ Program Director: Hong Li Molecular biophysics involves the application of the principles and techniques of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics to the study of biomolecular systems. Studies are aimed at advancing our understanding of fundamental biological structures and processes, information needed for the understanding of disease, and for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. In general, these studies require a multidisciplinary approach that may include techniques derived from molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics. Biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and other spectroscopic methods are common components of this work. The development and application of physical techniques to study biological systems requires training in disciplines that have been traditionally divided into separate departments. To foster the development of a fully integrated research training program, the Institute of Molecular Biophysics was constructed in 1962 with funds from the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Institutes of Health, and the State of Florida. In this institute, students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty associated with different departments share expertise and lab space. It is within this unique environment that the Molecular Biophysics Graduate Program is centered. The program offers an interdisciplinary core of courses leading to the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Molecular Biophysics or Computational Structural Biology. To this end, students are required to participate in a curric - ulum that will provide them with a strong background in both the physical and biological sciences. The program is designed to produce researchers and schol - ars with a broad understanding of the fundamental processes of biomolecular systems and a deep understanding of one or more experimental or theoretical approaches for the study of such systems. Research facilities available for the development of the graduate thesis include those located in the Institute of Molecular Biophysics; the departments of Biological Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics; and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. No master's degree is offered. Admission Application for admission to the Molecular Biophysics graduate program is made through the University Office of Admissions using an online applica - tion and routed to the Program Coordinator. The admissions committee will consider all applicants with a strong background in any areas of physical, bio - logical science, chemistry, mathematics, or engineering studies with a demon - strated aptitude for quantitative analysis and problem solving. All applicants must meet the minimum criteria of a 3.0 undergraduate grade point average (GPA) in all upper-division undergraduate coursework and provide three cur - rent letters of recommendation from individuals who are able to assess the applicant's academic and research potential. Successful applicants typically score above 153 on the Verbal portion and above 154 on Quantitative portion of the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) or have a combined score of at least 307 total Verbal and Quantitative combined. We do not have a minimum GRE score for admission, but applicants with lower GRE scores need to have strong research backgrounds, a GPA greater than 3.2 on upper division cours - es, and excellent letters of recommendation. The GRE Subject test is not re - quired. Official transcripts are also required. International students must score a minimum of 600 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or 90 on the iBT version of the language exam. Applicants are asked to advise the admissions committee of their areas of interest so that applications can be circulated to the appropriate faculty members. Prospective students are en - couraged to contact the Program Coordinator at mob@sb.fsu.edu . Financial Aid Acceptance into the program is accompanied by financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships, health insurance subsidy, and tuition waivers. Additional support of up to $2,000 per student is available during the first two years to enable students to attend national meetings and workshops. Travel money is also available for advanced students presenting research at such meetings. In addition, the Donald Caspar Award and the Randolph Rill Award for Academic Achievement are available to selected outstanding applicants, providing a bonus up to $2,000 that may be paid over the first two years.

Scientific Presentations and Posters (3) . (S/U grade only). This course emphasizes the importance of learning how to give top-notch talks and posters as a young science professional because a scientists' professional reputation rests not only on their scientific contributions, but also on how well they communicate their findings. This course covers such topics as effective slide design; how to overcome nervousness; how effectively use presentation aids, including microphones, pointers, notes, props, and handouts; how to handle audience questions; how to cope with problems; how to publicize a talk; ethical issues in giving talks; and how to design and use a poster to interact with colleagues at a conference. ENC 5457. Writing in the Sciences (3) . (S/U grade only). This course enables students to work on a writing project throughout the semester (e.g., journal article, fellowship proposal, or prospectus). Students identify the audience and purpose of their writing project and then clarify the central idea of their article or proposal. From there, they draft their work section by section, figure by figure, and then peer review their sections and figures in small groups. Central to the course is the idea that writing and thinking go hand in hand and that it is only through careful revision (at least for most), including careful consideration of peer feedback, that we are able to produce a finished paper or proposal that is clear and cogent enough to be published or funded. MOB 5905r. Directed Individual Study (1-12) . (S/U grade only).

Stone, Tripp, Vargo, Williams, Winter The Master of Fine Arts (MFA) is a graduate program in narrative motion picture production that prepares students for careers in producing, directing, screenwriting, production design, cinematography, sound design, and editing. Emphases in screenwriting and production are offered, with curricula designed to furnish the conceptual framework, the professional training, and the work - ing environment for eventual participation in a profession that is a powerful influence in our culture. The goals of the College of Motion Picture Arts are to fully educate students, help them become integrated members of the academic community of Florida State University, become responsible members of the entertainment profession, and participate in a creative and artistic process. Faculty Distinctions The College of Motion Picture Arts has a strong commitment to hiring experienced, working professionals who have both teaching skills and profes - sional goals. The College's full-time faculty comprises working filmmakers with various specializations as writers, directors, producers, cinematogra - phers, audio designers, production designers, and editors in both the theatrical and non-theatrical film and television industries, many of whom have won national and international awards and honors for their work. Some of the fac - ulty also have strong records as research scholars and fiction writers, including visiting professors in the fields of motion picture law, business distribution, exhibition, and promotion. Facilities The College of Motion Picture Arts operates extensive production facil - ities for its graduate and undergraduate programs in University Center A on Florida State University's campus in Tallahassee, and in an off-campus site in Midway, Florida, known as the Torchlight Center. Considered one of the finest facilities in the world devoted exclusively to film education, it includes: professional sound stages, a green-screen/mo - tion capture stage, a cinematography and set operations teaching stage, grip and electric trucks fully equipped with industry standard G&E equipment, an ADR and Foley recording studio, re-recording stages, QC and dailies screen - ing rooms, digital animation/VFX production labs, color correction suites, a 120-seat screening room, digital animation/VFX production suites, seminar rooms, writer rooms, interactive classrooms, individual post production suites, teaching labs, and student production planning rooms. The College is equipped for and supports industry-standard acquisition in HD, 2k, 4k, 8k digital formats, and digital sound recording formats. MFA Program The goals of this professional degree are: 1. To ground students in the history, theory, and practice of narrative motion picture production 2. To provide the creative and technical environment for professional specialization to take place 3. To help graduates begin careers in screenwriting, producing, directing, camera, sound, editing, and production design 4. To provide interaction with a wide range of film and television industry professionals in order to provide information on the most recent trends and processes in the film/television business To these ends the college's approach emphasizes three kinds of learning experiences: 1) coursework in history, theory, style, technology, and tech - niques; 2) seminars in specific skill areas conducted by active professionals; and 3) independent production projects. Production students work in teams on narrative projects. These projects are written, produced, directed, shot, re - corded, and edited by Motion Picture Arts students. In addition, the students engage in the financial, legal, distribution, and exhibition aspects of the film/ television business. The program is designed and scheduled to provide training of the highest quality. It is meant to create a practicum setting in which individuals can work with accomplished professionals to hone their talents, develop a body of work, and sharpen their capacities to work in teams.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Motion Picture Arts 327 After required coursework, students are encouraged to complete their pro - gram of study by enrolling in the program's apprenticeship class to apply their learning in a real-world setting in the industry. This capstone experience will position students for greater chances of success in their careers. Financing and Ownership of Student Films The College of Motion Picture Arts pays for all student laboratory, work - shop, and thesis project production expenses, on both graduate and undergrad - uate levels. So far as is known, it is the only film school in the United States to do so. The College has an agreement with the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) of America whereby SAG performers may work on graduate student projects on a deferred-salary basis. Should such films be distributed commercially, SAG actors involved will be the first to be paid their appropriate salaries from the gross revenues. Under State of Florida law, regulations, and rules, all films and videos pro - duced by Motion Picture Arts students become the property of Florida State University and are copyrighted in the name of Florida State University. The same regulations and rules provide that in the event of the commercial ex - ploitation of these films, any net revenues derived from a particular film will be split in a proportion to be determined by Florida State University (currently 50/50) between the College of Motion Picture Arts and all of the graduating student workers on the film including, but not limited to, the writer, director, producer/production manager, sound designer, editor, cinematographer, art director, and musical score composer. State law provides that any stand-alone screenplays created by students will remain the student's property and may be exploited commercially by them; however, screenplays, scripts, and story ideas that are proposed and in - corporated by students into their workshop courses or thesis films become the property of Florida State University and will be copyrighted in the University's name. State law requires that all entering students be provided with a copy of the relevant regulatory rule and that applicants for admission to Motion Picture Arts sign a statement acknowledging their receipt and understanding of the rule prior to official admission and enrollment. Admission Admission to the College of Motion Picture Arts graduate program is limited access with twenty-four production and six to eight writing students admitted each year, making admission selective and competitive. Prospective students must submit an application to and meet the requirements of the Florida State University Graduate Admissions Office, and also must submit supporting application materials as described online at: https://film.fsu.edu/ admissions . Required supporting materials for production applicants include: a 500-1000-word statement of purpose describing their artistic work, creative influences, relevant background, and career goals; three letters of recommen - dation; a professional/creative r\u00e9sum\u00e9; a writing sample adhering to the given prompt; a creative portfolio; a video pitch; and transcripts. Screenwriting ap - plicants must submit three samples of their written work as specified support - ing materials, as well as a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and statement of purpose. Detailed informa - tion is available online at https://film.fsu.edu/admissions . Enrollment Requirement Because of the integrated and intensive nature of the program, all students will be required to enroll as full-time students; while enrolled in the program, students are not permitted to hold outside employment. Students who must withdraw for any reason will be reevaluated by a faculty committee for future readmission. Students may enter the program only in the Fall semester. MFA Requirements The MFA degree requires completion of a minimum of 90 semester hours for production students, or 61 semester hours for screenwriting students and must be completed in six consecutive full-time semesters. To fulfill the requirements of the MFA Program in the College of Motion Picture Arts, a student must: 1. Possess sufficient mobility, strength, and dexterity in both hands and legs to lift, carry, and operate filmmaking equipment 2.

Possess the ability to adequately communicate orally, in English, with others Probation and Dismissal Motion Picture Arts majors will adhere to the University Academic Honor System, Student Conduct Code, Summons to Responsible Freedom, and the College of Motion Picture Arts Professional Code of Conduct. Each semester, the faculty will meet to discuss the work, behavior, grades, and progress of students in the major. At any point in the semester, if the faculty determines that a student's behavior fails to adhere to the College's Professional Code of Conduct, the student may be issued a verbal warning or a written remediation plan. Failing to satisfy the terms of a remediation plan may result in dismissal from the program. Behavior so negative, disruptive, or destructive as to compromise the work of fellow students or the effectiveness of the faculty may constitute grounds for immediate dismissal without any prior period of warning or remediation. Peer evaluations may be considered in this evaluation process. Any unauthorized use, possession, or willful destruction of College of Motion Picture Arts equipment, facilities, media, or finished film will result in immediate notification to the proper authorities. The outcome of their de - cisions will determine the actions of the College of Motion Picture Arts with respect to the student(s) involved. If the cumulative GPA falls below 3.0, it will result in academic probation. Students will be reinstated in good standing if the cumulative major GPA rises to 3.0 by the end of the following semester. Failure to raise the GPA may result in dismissal from the program. Financial Aid A limited number of graduate assistantships are awarded by the College of Motion Picture Arts each year. Highly qualified students are nominated by the College for university-wide fellowships and minority fellowships. For more information regarding the availability of other sources of financial aid and potential scholarships, please visit the Financial Aid Website at https://www. financialaid.fsu.edu/ .

Program faculty members are based in four depart - ments: biological science, biomedical sciences, mathematics, and psychology. There is no master's degree in neuroscience, but MS degrees with a concen - tration in neuroscience are available through the participating departments for work completed with neuroscience program faculty. The program was established to promote basic research and to provide graduate education in neuroscience via a close mentoring relationship between students and facul - ty. Students entering the program choose a faculty advisor and enroll in that advisor's department. Students are able to begin hands-on research imme - diately while discovering modern neuroscience through courses covering a broad range of approaches, from molecular to behavioral. The requirements for the neuroscience degree are uniform across departments so changing advi - sors and departments later is possible, for example, to begin specialized PhD dissertation research. Interdisciplinary research training is available involving molecular, cellular, physiological, and behavioral approaches to the study of a broad array of research areas, including sensory systems, ingestive behavior, human neuroscience, animal models of cognition, molecular genetics, pro - teomics, membrane biophysics, neurobiology of brain injury and disease, neu - roendocrinology, social behavior, stress, and drug addiction. Fellowships and positions on two NIH-funded training grants are available on a competitive basis to students in the program. The program maintains specialized research support services and personnel and provides special courses and symposia on contemporary neuroscience issues.

The department is strongly committed to graduate education and supports it by maintaining a strong, well-funded, and diverse research program. A basic goal of the program of graduate education is to prepare students for careers in research and related fields. It is intended that graduates will have the education and training necessary to enable them to make fundamental contributions to knowledge in physics or their chosen field. Further, it is antic - ipated that they will be peers with the next generation of technology leaders in industry, government, and academia. The faculty believes that the quality of teaching, at all levels, is en - hanced by a strong research program. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows participate in all aspects of research in physics at Florida State University. In fact, most undergraduate physics majors par - ticipate in research projects and many are co-authors on publications. This research includes strong programs in the area of computational physics and both experimental and theoretical studies in high energy, nuclear, condensed matter, astrophysics, and atomic and molecular physics. There are also many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, particularly in the Integrative NanoScience Institute (INSI), the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), the Department of Scientific Computing, and the Institute of Molecular Biophysics (IMB). Available experimental facilities include the following: a 9.5 MV Super FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator with superconducting post accelerator, the RESOLUT radioactive beam facility, a state-of-the-art gamma spectros - copy array, electron spin resonance and electron double nuclear resonance spectrometers, a detector development laboratory for high-energy particle detectors, liquid helium refrigerators, thin film preparation facilities including sputtering and laser ablation, ultrahigh vacuum instrumentation including sur - face analysis (LEED, Auger, optical) and molecular beam epitaxy, synthesis and characterization facilities for novel materials, three X-ray diffractomers with various sample stages for high and low temperature studies, multi-sam - ple analysis and small angle studies, scanning electron, tunneling and optical microscopies with image analysis, SQUID and vibrating sample magnetom - eters, a helium atom surface scattering facility, and a modern astronomical observatory, including 17-inch primary science-grade telescope housed in a 10-foot fiberglass dome. The NHMFL provides a modern infrastructure en - abling research in magnetic fields including the highest-powered DC fields in the world, mainly used for materials science research, and facilities providing the highest fields in the world for nuclear, ion cyclotron, and electron magnetic resonance spectometers, as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Computational resources are an integral part of scientific research in the department and play an increasingly important role in preparing students for careers in both commercial and academic fields. Recent advances in data ac - quisition, algorithm development, and computer hardware have made high performance computing fundamentally necessary to remain competitive. The Physics Department has been actively involved in high performance com - puting for many years. Researchers in the department are responsible for the design, acquisition, installation, and operations of many computing clusters with an aggregate of over 1000 CPUs and over 100 terabytes of disk storage. The University has acquired a wide array of computing facilities to meet its research needs and maintains an ambitious plan to continually upgrade cur - rent shared supercomputing facilities. Since 1993, FSU has maintained high performance computing facilities on campus, which have consistently put the University on the \"Top 500 Supercomputer\" site ( http://www.top500.org/ ).

PHYSIOLOGY: see Biological Science; MedicineFlorida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Political Science 351 cants may be nominated for college or University funding and will be consid - ered for departmental fellowships. Students can expect departmental funding to continue for up to five years (although it is awarded on a year-by-year basis) given timely progression and success in the academic program and satisfacto - ry performance of assistantship duties. Graduate assistants receive a salary and a tuition waiver for Fall and Spring semesters with Summer stipends awarded separately. Fellowships are usually awarded for the full academic year. Master's Degree Students are eligible for either the MS or the MA degree. The requirements for these are governed by University standards and are listed in the \"Graduate Degree Requirements\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Major in Political Science The master's program is a general one, intended to develop a broad famil - iarity with the concepts, methods, and findings of political science. When stu - dents do not expect to go on for a PhD, they are encouraged to distribute their coursework over the various fields while focusing their major effort on those areas that fit their career plans. Hours taken outside the department should be used to develop specific professional skills. While the PhD program is con - sidered preparation for a particular profession, the master's program is not so explicitly aimed. It is important that individual students define for themselves what knowledge and skills they expect to develop during their master's work. A non-thesis master's program includes thirty-three semester hours of coursework, with at least twenty-seven of them on a letter-grade basis. A thesis program comprises thirty semester hours, twenty-four hours of course - work and six thesis hours, with twenty-four total hours on a letter-grade basis. Master's candidates may take up to nine hours outside the department. Up to six semester hours may be transferred from another accredited institution, in accordance with all Graduate School regulations regarding transfer of aca - demic credit. Students must take one core seminar in two of the department's major fields: American politics, public policy, comparative politics, and international relations. All master's candidates must take six semester hours of methodolo - gy. The department's POS 5736 and 5737 are required for those continuing on to a PhD. Those in a terminal master's program may substitute PAD 5700 and 5701 offered in the School of Public Administration and Policy, with permis - sion from the Graduate Director. Major in Applied American Politics and Policy Students can also fulfill requirements for a master's degree by undertaking the applied American politics and policy curriculum, designed for students interested in training for careers in political and governmental organizations that relate to public policy and active politics. This is a thirty-six-semester hour non-thesis program, including twenty-four semester hours of coursework and a twelve semester-hour internship or practicum. Twelve of the twenty-four semester hours are in required courses; the remaining twelve semester hours are chosen from a list of approved electives. There is an option of traditional face-to-face or online modes of instruction available. Additional details on these policies are provided in the Political Science Applied Master's Program Handbook. Doctoral Degree The doctoral program in the Department of Political Science is a five-year program designed to provide the highest quality of professional training in the discipline of political science and a mastery of the methods of research. With the advice of the graduate director, students design their own programs of study by selecting two major fields. Up to six semester hours may be trans - ferred from another accredited institution, in accordance with all Graduate School regulations regarding transfer of academic credit. Coursework requirements typically add up to fifty-seven semester hours: twenty-four total semester hours in two major fields, eighteen semester hours in required methods and research courses, three hours for the research practi - cum, and twelve semester hours of electives, although waivers of some re - quirements are possible for students with equivalent prior coursework. Once students have completed all their coursework requirements (typically in the Spring of their third year), they are eligible to take the doctoral prelim - inary examinations. Students are expected to defend their dissertation prospectus in the Fall semester of their fourth year, and to make substantial progress on their disser - tations during their fourth and fifth years in the program. Twenty-four semes - ter hours of dissertation work are required. Once the dissertation is completed and accepted by the major professor, it must be defended, in person or with approval via Internet conferencing software, in an oral examination conducted by the dissertation committee.

Deeb Eminent Scholar & Marian D. Irish Professor: W. Berry; Professors: Jackson, Souva, W. Weissert; Professors Emeriti: Atkins, Crew, Dye, Flanagan, Glick, Gray, Kim, Palmer, Scholz The Department of Political Science offers graduate programs leading to the Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees. Instruction is offered in the following fields: American politics, comparative politics, international relations, public policy, methods of political analysis, and formal theory. Admission Students pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) or Master of Science (MS) in political science are admitted to the graduate program to begin study in the Fall semester only. Decisions about admission are usually based on the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores and undergraduate and grad - uate work already completed, as well as letters of recommendation and the applicant's own statement of interests and goals. The department seeks a tar - get score of 155 or higher on the Quantitative section, 160 or higher on the Verbal section, and 4.0 or higher on the Analytical Writing section of the GRE. Applicants scoring below 146 on the Quantitative section, 156 on the Verbal section, and a 3.5 on the Analytical Writing sections of the GRE will generally not be considered by the Departmental Admissions Committee, except under exceptional circumstances. The program requires that international students complete the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with a minimum score of 600 (250 computer-based, 100 Internet-based). Admission to this major requires a grade point average (GPA) of better than \"B\" (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) on the second half of undergraduate coursework and a 3.5 on graduate level work already completed. Three letters of recom - mendation and the applicant's personal statement are required. Occasional deviations from these standards are allowed for applicants who possess ex - ceptional qualities that are not reflected in these criteria. Because admission is competitive, no particular GRE and GPA guarantees acceptance. All materials must reach the department by January 15th to guarantee consideration for de - partmental assistantship awards. All admissions application materials should be submitted to the department electronically via the University Admissions application system. Master's students pursuing the Applied American Politics and Policy ma - jor are admitted in the Fall, Spring, or Summer term. Admission to this major requires a 3.0 GPA on the second half of undergraduate work. Applicants must also take the GRE and have official scores submitted prior to being accepted into the program. Target scores for the GRE are a 149 on both the Verbal and Quantitative sections. LSAT scores of 151 or above may be accepted in lieu of GRE scores with permission of the department. The applicant's statement of goals and interests (approximately 500 words) also is required. No letters of recommendation are required for application to the applied master's degree program. In circumstances where more appli - cations are received than there are available positions in the major program, the department may make its final admissions decisions based on standards above the minimum admissions requirements. All admissions application ma - terials should be submitted to the department electronically via the University Admissions application system. Placement Most students in the doctoral program expect to pursue a career as part of a university faculty. The department provides placement services to assist stu - dents in obtaining such positions or other employment the student may desire. With alumni in professional positions on university faculty and in various government and research agencies in over twenty states and several foreign countries, the department is well-represented in the discipline. Departmental Assistantships Departmental funding is awarded competitively, not only to provide finan - cial assistance but also to afford outstanding students a structured experience in teaching and research. Such awards are generally granted only to those stu - dents who plan to complete their PhD in the department.

Clinical Psychology The PhD program in clinical psychology has been continuously accredited by the American Psychological Association since 1954 ( AP A Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation, 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002- 4242, 1-800-374-2721 ). The clinical psychology program is focused on train - ing clinical scientists for academic and research careers. Students interested primarily in clinical practice are not a good match for our program. Based on a clinical science model, the PhD program in Clinical Psychology promotes a scientifically-based approach to understanding, assessing, and ameliorating cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and health problems and seeks to produce students who can contribute to and apply the relevant scientific knowledge. We provide concurrent, integrative training in clinical science and clinical service delivery so that our graduates are prepared not only to apply current knowledge, theories, and techniques, but are able and motivated to remain at the cutting edge of the field. All students are expected to master the basics of psychology in general and of clinical psychology in particular. This is accomplished primarily through a curriculum of required courses taught by both clinical and non-clinical faculty. We consider students' exposure to our first-rate neuroscience, cognitive, de - velopmental, and social psychology faculty, in addition to our clinical faculty, to be one of our program's strengths. Although there are no formal \"tracks,\" students can pursue specialization beyond the required courses through fo - cused activities in research, advanced coursework, and clinical practice. The program conforms to a mentorship training model. Students are ac - cepted into the graduate program in part based on the match between their interests and those of our clinical faculty. Since research is a cornerstone of a good clinical science program, students work closely on research with the faculty mentor who recruited them starting in their very first semester. They are further encouraged to be continuously involved in ongoing research throughout their tenure in our program, and it is common for some to pursue collaborations not only with their mentors, but also with other clinical and non-clinical faculty and with fellow graduate students as well. Our commitment to clinical science leads us to integrate clinical practice and science at every opportunity. We administer our own Psychology Clinic and the Anxiety & Behavioral Health Clinic. These clinics provide state- of-the-science treatment to the community while simultaneously serving as clinical training and research venues for our graduate students and faculty. Our Psychology Clinic has been recognized by APA for Innovative Practices in Graduate Education in Psychology for its accomplishments in integrating training in service and science. Additional clinical training/research oppor - tunities are available at practicum sites in the community. Finally, students complete a required one-year pre-doctoral internship at an APA accredited site. Our students have established a long history of success in competition for preferred internships across the country. Cognitive Psychology Cognitive psychology is the study of the mental processes involved in perception, thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, and performance. Florida State's program in cognitive psychology features active research pro - grams in attention, visual processing, cognitive aging, cognitive neuroscience, expert performance, memory, psycholinguistics, reading, and skill acquisition. The goal of our program is to train students to be rigorous scientists, preparing them for careers as researchers in academic settings, government, and private industry. Graduate students will work closely with one or more faculty during their time at FSU. Students begin developing a research program right away, embarking on a \"first year project\" during their first semester on campus. Through formal coursework and informal mentorship, students are taught the skills needed to do cutting-edge research in cognitive science. Our faculty members conduct research on many of the central themes of cognitive science: What makes an expert? We all find the performances of expert athletes and musicians to be spellbinding. Challenging the idea that high achievers in music, sports, and other such domains are born with special abilities, research within the cognitive area examines how training and deliberate practice leads to the acquisition of mental representation and physiological adaptations that mediate expert-level performance. How do we understand and navigate complex visual environments? The visual system plays an essential role in our ability to gather information from our environment. Research within the cognitive area uses a combination of Graduate Department of PSYCHOLOGY College of arts and sCienCes Website: https://psy.fsu.edu/ Chair: Frank Johnson; Hajcak, Teaching Faculty: Hansen, O. Stephan, Torgesen, Weaver The primary goal of graduate study in psychology at Florida State University is to produce scholars with sufficient breadth and depth to per - mit independent and significant research. While the major emphasis is on the preparation for research, students are also given the necessary background for teaching and/or application of psychological science. Only students whose in - tentions are to achieve the doctoral degree during full-time study are accepted for the graduate programs in psychology. Research opportunities are abundant in the Department of Psychology. Faculty members attract a high level of research grant support from federal and state agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Total grant expenditures on an annual basis currently ap - proximates $7,500,000. Information about the Department of Psychology, its graduate programs and faculty is available on our Website at https://psy.fsu.edu/ . Facilities The Psychology Department moved into its state-of-the-art building com - plex in August, 2008. The complex consists of three connecting wings, each four stories tall, and a separate 220-seat auditorium. It features over forty re - search laboratories, wireless communication, a spacious courtyard, a clinical training and research clinic, a center for studies in reading, a neuroscience research center and state-of-the-art vivarium, and undergraduate and gradu - ate student computer rooms, incorporating the entire department into a single home. Visit our Website at https://psy.fsu.edu/ for more details. The Department's technical staff and support facilities are some of the best in the country. The facilities are operated by experts in biomedical, electri - cal, and structural engineering; computer hardware and software support; and graphics design and include fully equipped computer, electronic, machine, graphics, and instrument design shops. Instruction in behavioral, physiolog - ical, and neuroanatomical techniques is provided both in formal coursework and in laboratory settings. A molecular neuroscience laboratory provides equipment and training for studies of gene cloning and gene expression, as well as techniques to measure levels of hormones and neurotransmitters. The department administers an on-campus psychology clinic that offers outpatient assessment and therapy services to members of the Tallahassee community and surrounding areas. This facility provides excellent clinical and research training for clinical students, who render services under close supervision of clinical faculty. Financial Aid The Department of Psychology makes every effort to provide financial as - sistance, including stipends and tuition waivers, to graduate students in good standing in the department. Students who request financial assistance typically receive some kind of support throughout their graduate education. Sources of funding include the following: fellowships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships, departmental assistantships, minority program fellowships, and community agency placements. Doctoral Programs The Department of Psychology is organized into five specialized programs for graduate instruction that reflect the mainstream emphases in the field. The programs are in clinical psychology (the assessment, treatment, and study of the determinants of pathological behavior in children and adults with empha - sis on biological, cognitive, and environmental factors), cognitive psychology (the study of how humans process complex information received by the sens - es), developmental psychology (the study of physical, cognitive, and social Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Psychology 355 students with in-depth training in the areas of personality and social psychol - ogy, focusing on basic and applied social psychological research. The goal of the program is to prepare students for future positions as researchers and educators. Coursework provides students with an education in a broad range of areas including classic and contemporary issues in social psychology and methodological and statistical approaches to psychological research. In-depth seminars are offered in prejudice and stereotyping, the psychology of intimate relationships, and the self. Graduate students develop further expertise in a specific area or areas of social psychology through hands-on research in col - laboration with one or more faculty members in the social program. Students also may have opportunities to collaborate with faculty in the other psycholo - gy programs whose interests and expertise are relevant to social psychology. The broad areas of research interest and expertise of the Social Psychology program's faculty provide several possible directions for interested graduate students to pursue. These broad areas of research include: Self and Identity: Specific research includes self-control, self-knowledge, accuracy and error in self-judgment, self-deception and defense mechanisms, self-presentation and impression management; how the self operates in so - cial interactions; how people respond to blows to their pride or \"threatened egotism,\" including effects on decision-making and aggression; the \"need to belong\" as a basic motivation, including what happens when people are reject - ed or excluded. Prejudice and Stereotyping: Specific research includes the regulation of prejudice and the prejudice reduction process; the causes and consequences of negative affect and aggression in intergroup interactions; the implications of race for responses to criminal suspects. Emotion: Specific research includes emotional influences on judgment and decision-making, risk-taking, and social cognition; the self-regulation of emotional states; emotional experiences in the context of social interaction; psychophysiological processes and emotion. Interpersonal Relationships: Specific research includes examination of factors predicting the maintenance of relationship satisfaction over time, in - cluding, but not limited to, attributions, behavior, forgiveness, physical attrac - tiveness, sexual relations, personality, self-esteem, expectations, and intimate partner violence. Evolutionary Psychology: Specific research includes examination of evolved social cognition in areas such as romantic attraction and long-term relationships and social affiliation and rejection; hormonal processes involved in social behavior. Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience Students in the doctoral Program in Neuroscience receive broad training in the study of the brain and nervous system function. Areas of emphasis include chemical senses, ingestive behavior, human neuroscience, animal models of cognition, molecular genetics, neurobiology of brain injury and disease, neuroendocrinology, social behavior, stress, and drug addiction. This interdis - ciplinary program provides a solid foundation with courses covering topics ranging from molecules to behavior. The Program places a heavy emphasis on laboratory research in a collegial and interactive atmosphere. Students may gain experience in the labs of Neuroscience faculty in Psychology, Biological Science, Mathematics, and the College of Medicine. Students work with faculty mentors in exceptionally well-equipped research facilities located in recently constructed buildings. An active colloquium series in neuroscience and special topic symposia/courses bring students into contact with world leaders in the field of neuroscience. In addition, students receive training in a variety of professional skills including public speaking, teaching, and grant writing. Neuroscience is a PhD program, but students may pursue a master's degree in one of the participating departments with the approval of the faculty supervisor and training committee. Detailed information about the Program in Neuroscience and research of the faculty may be found at https://neuro. fsu.edu/ . College Requirements Please review all college-wide degree requirements summarized in the \"College of Arts and Sciences\" chapter of this Graduate Bulletin . Admissions New students are accepted for enrollment only in the Fall semester of each year. Completed applications are due between December 1st and January 15th, depending on the program. Applicants should visit the department website (https://psy.fsu.edu/ ) for deadlines. Applicants must satisfy all admission requirements and policies set by the department and University. Admission to graduate study is based upon a com - bination of factors, including undergraduate and graduate grade point average, Graduate Record Examination scores, letters of recommendation from former psychophysical and eye-tracking measures to study how we make sense of the visual world, learn and categorize objects, and find the things for which we are looking. How does the cognitive system change as we age? It is undeniable that our cognitive systems undergo change as we get older. Research within this area aims to understand these changes, and to develop novel ways of using technol - ogy to buffer individuals against the natural effects of aging. How are various perceptual and cognitive processes instantiated in the brain? How does the brain change as we learn, and how is information repre - sented by neural systems? Faculty in the cognitive area use a variety of tech - niques (EEG, MRI, TMS) to study brain function and structure, and how these relate to cognition. How do we understand language? The comprehension of language is the keystone against which human experience is built. The cognitive area explores the comprehension process, from the processes involved in extracting infor - mation from the written page to the use of our perceptual and motor systems to internally simulate the content of the language. We also use behavioral ex - periments, eye-tracking, and electrophysiology to explore how language skills develop in children. How do we learn to read? The development of literacy skills is critical to one's ability to succeed in academic and employment settings. Research within this area aims to understand why some children are more successful learning to read than others, and to understand how best to detect and reme - diate reading problems when they arise. This research is affiliated with the Florida Center for Reading Research. How do we remember? The ability to remember, and to gauge how well we will remember something, is key to learning and succeeding in every aspect of our lives. Cognitive area faculty explore the factors that lead some things to be remembered better than others, and that lead people to be more accurate in their assessment of how well they will remember something later. How do we think and solve problems? The study of thought processes is difficult with traditional methods of data collection, such as recording reaction times, eye-fixations, EEG, and fMRI. Research within the cognitive area ex - amines how one can instruct participants to think aloud and then analyze their verbalizations to identify evidence for strategies, mental representations, and learning processes, which can later be validated by experimental manipula - tions and tests. The Florida Center for Reading Research (https://www.fcrr.org/ ) pro - vides exciting opportunities for basic and applied research in reading. See Developmental Psychology for additional information. Developmental Psychology Developmental psychology is the study of the processes by which humans develop and potentially lose competencies in domains ranging from sensation and perception to personality. Developmental psychology as a field of study is growing, as new methods of study have developed, and as the realization that just about any picture of human functioning is but a snapshot of an ongoing process of change. Developmental psychology is an integrative discipline that has implications for other areas of psychology including cognitive psycholo - gy, neuroscience, social psychology, and clinical psychology. Students in developmental psychology receive in-depth training with op - portunities for both basic and applied research. The goal of the program is to prepare students for future positions as professors in universities and colleges, researchers in government and private-sector laboratories, and as educators. The program is guided by the view that the best way to become a research - er is to carry out research, so continuous involvement in research projects is stressed. The curriculum has core course requirements but maximizes op - portunities for specific seminars and individual research opportunities that fit a training program designed by the student and his or her major professor. Students also are encouraged to develop competencies that will broaden their job prospects beyond the university and research laboratory settings. Examples include program evaluation, test development, and data analysis. The Developmental Program also has a strong relationship with The Florida Center for Reading Research ( https://www.fcrr.org/ ), which supports both basic and applied research in reading, and has ongoing studies of reading instruction and assessment in pre-school and elementary aged children as well as adults. The mission of the Center is to contribute both to the basic science of reading and to conduct research and evaluation projects that have policy implications for public schools in Florida. Funds are available for graduate student stipends and post-doctoral fellowships. The director of the Center is Dr. Don Compton. Associate directors are Drs. Richard Wagner, Christopher Lonigan, and Chris Schatschneider. Social Psychology The social psychology program involves the scientific examination of how people think about, influence, and relate to each other. The program provides 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityPsychology 356 professors, prior experience, and the applicant's personal statement. Students who have demonstrated an interest in research prior to applying to the doctoral programs will be given priority. Departmental Degree Requirements The general requirements of the department are kept to a minimum in order to encourage students to be educated in accordance with each program area's own interests and goals, as well as those of the students. The basic require - ments are outlined below; these and other requirements are more completely described in the department's Graduate Student Handbook . Doctoral Program Incoming students are admitted into one of the five doctoral programs. First-year students work ten hours per week with a faculty member who is conducting research in an area of interest to the student. This collaborative work often evolves into a master's thesis. During the first two years, students complete one advanced statistics course. A basic statistics course is also re - quired if the student has not previously taken an introductory statistics course. Most students are required to complete an empirical thesis and obtain an \"in-flight\" master's degree en route to completing the doctoral degree. The student's supervisory committee and program area guidelines are used to de - termine whether a student must complete the master's degree. Following completion of the master's degree (or bypassing this require - ment), students begin their doctoral studies. Students with master's degrees from other institutions begin their doctoral studies after they have completed the advanced statistics course required within the first two years, and after their previous graduate work and empirical theses have been evaluated and approved by the faculty. The following are required for the doctoral degree: 1. Two of the 6919 (Cross-Area Seminar). 2. Completion of the preliminary doctoral-examination requirements for the program area. 3. A dissertation research project. Program Area Requirements Program areas have minimum requirements beyond those established for the department; these must be completed prior to the doctoral degree and a time sequence is specified for some requirements. In addition, students work closely with their supervisory committees to develop an optimum combination of coursework, research experience, and applied training to meet their pro - fessional goals. Coursework requirements by program area are listed on the following departmental Website: https://psy.fsu.edu/php/graduate/students/ resources/resources.php . Program requirements are reviewed periodically by the faculty and may change. Master's Degree in Applied Behavior Analysis (Panama City Campus) The Department of Psychology offers a terminal Master of Science (MS) degree in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) at the Panama City campus. Graduates of this program are prepared for employment in the public and pri - vate sectors as behavior analysts. The program of studies prepares students to sit for the Board Certification exam (BCBA). In contrast to the Tallahassee campus programs described above in which students obtain their master's degree en route to the doctorate, the degree offered at Panama City is a termi - nal master's and a thesis is not an option. A comprehensive exam is required toward the end of the program. Thirty-nine semester hours of psychology courses are required, including nine semester hours of practicum. A listing of required coursework can be found online at https://pc.fsu.edu/aba/ . For further information about admission and degree requirements for the master's program in Panama City, contact the: Graduate Office, Department of Psychology, 1107 W.

PSYCHOLOGY FOR COUNSELING: see Educational Psychology and Learning SystemsReubin O' D. Askew School of PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY Graduate Programs College of soCial sCienCes and PuBliC PoliCy Website: https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/ professional study in public administration prepares students for a wide variety of careers in management and policy analysis. Graduates work in such settings as government agencies, legislatures, courts, domestic not-for- profit organizations, international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and in numerous for-profit businesses that work closely with governments. Several empirical studies, the most recent in 2014, have ranked the Askew School faculty in the top ten nationally and top twenty globally in frequency of publishing in the top journals of the field. The Askew School offers two graduate degree programs: the Master of Public Administration (MPA) and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Public Administration. The fully accredited MPA program prepares students to be - come managers and policy analysts. The doctorate is a research degree designed to prepare students for college and university teaching, advanced research in policy and management, and the highest levels of administrative practice. Qualified advanced undergraduate students may begin graduate studies in public administration that count toward both their undergraduate degrees and the professional MPA degree. The school also offers joint graduate pathways with the College of Law (Master of Public Administration/Juris Doctor [MPA/ JD]), the College of Social Work (Master of Public Administration/Master of Social Work [MPA/MSW]), the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice (Master of Public Administration/Master of Science in Criminology [MPA/ MSC]), and the Department of Urban and Regional Planning (Master of Public Administration/Master of Science in Planning [MPA/MSP]). Certificates in public financial management, general public administration, emergency man - agement, application of unmanned aircraft systems, U.S. intelligence studies, civic and nonprofit leadership, and Florida city and county management are also available. Additional information is available on the Askew School's website: https://coss.fsu.edu/askew/ . Combined BA or BS and Master of Public Administration (MPA) Pathway Qualified students in any undergraduate major may use up to twelve hours of free electives to take graduate courses in public administration that will count for completion of both the bachelor's degree and the professional MPA degree. Completion of graduate courses through the combined bachelor's/ master's pathway will also count for completion of an undergraduate minor in public administration. Qualified undergraduates who take public administra - tion courses to satisfy major requirements in the bachelor's degree programs in either political science, interdisciplinary social science, international affairs, or any other major that accepts PAD coursework may take up to twelve hours of graduate credit that will be counted for completion of both their bachelor's degree major and the MPA degree. In addition, undergraduate students who take the PAD 3941 Public Service Internship course may waive the graduate internship course requirement. Normally, for inexperienced students, the MPA degree requires completion of forty-five graduate credit hours following re - ceipt of a bachelor's degree. Students in the joint bachelor's/master's pathway who complete twelve graduate credits and the undergraduate internship course prior to receipt of their bachelor's degree will only need to complete thirty additional graduate credits to receive the MPA degree. Acceptance to this pre-graduate program is competitive. Applications will only be considered from undergraduates who are entering their senior year, or who are honor students with junior status, and who have a cumulative un - dergraduate grade point average of at least 3.2 in all prior studies at FSU. Application forms are to be submitted to the School's academic program spe - cialist. Accepted undergraduates may then enroll for up to six credit hours per semester, or up to twelve credit hours total, in graduate courses that are either core or elective courses in the MPA program. Students accepted to the pre-graduate program should subsequently make formal application for ad - mission to the graduate school during their senior year. Acceptance and suc - cessful completion of the pre-graduate program does not guarantee admission into the graduate MPA program.Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Public Administration and Policy 359 The certificates are also available to MPA students as a part of their degree coursework and courses may count toward both the degree electives and the certificate; however, students pursuing multiple certificates, should not double count courses between certificate programs.

Interdisciplinary specializa - tions related to student career goals are also possible. Diagnostic Review The school's PhD committee will examine the performance of each student after the completion of each year in the program. The performance review shall include a review of grades and, where appropriate, seminar papers and other evidence of potential to complete both the written and oral preliminary examination and the dissertation. Preliminary Examination, Supervisory Committee and Program of Studies, Dissertation Prospectus and Defense All doctoral students will take the written qualifying examination after taking all core coursework. After completing all coursework, a student must form a supervisory committee, file an approved program of studies, and then pass the preliminary examination, which is an oral defense of a publishable paper. The passing of the preliminary examination establishes the student as a doctoral candidate. A prospectus for the dissertation is then completed and must be approved by the supervisory committee. Following completion of the dissertation, the defense will be scheduled.

Many of the critical problems facing society can only be solved by teams of individuals from a variety of disciplines. Integral to these teams are computational scientists, who provide the simulation, optimization, and visu - alization algorithms used to solve problems on computers. The main activity of scientific computing is the development of computational tools that have applicability over a range of scientific disciplines. The Department of Scientific Computing consists of faculty interested in the invention, analysis, implementation, and application of computational al - gorithms that can be applied to problems arising in several new and traditional disciplines. Examples include biology, chemical engineering, chemistry, com - puter science, fire dynamics, geology and geophysics, material science, math - ematics, mechanical engineering, medicine, and physics and astrophysics. An increasing number of algorithms involve machine learning and data science. Faculty and graduate students are supported in their research by several feder - al, state, laboratory, and commercial organizations. Further breadth and depth are added to the research and educational missions of the department through faculty from other departments at Florida State University and individuals from several national laboratories who interact closely with our faculty. These faculty members ensure that the department is ideally positioned to offer inno - vative degree programs that impart a synergy between the mathematical and applications-driven aspects of scientific computing, thus providing the student with extensive interdisciplinary training. Students are trained and do research in a truly interdisciplinary envi - ronment. The graduate programs offered by the Department of Scientific Computing are designed to provide broad training in the core methods of com - putational science across disciplines, followed by in-depth specialization in areas of particular interest to students. Even within specializations, the focus remains on interdisciplinary approaches to solving science and engineering problems. The Department of Scientific Computing offers degree programs leading to the Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computational Science and to a Master's degree in Data Science. Please refer to the Department of Scientific Computing Website at https://www.sc.fsu.edu/ for the latest information about these programs, including new courses. The degree in Computational Science subdivides further into majors in Computational Science, Fire Dynamics, and Geophysical Dynamics. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program leads to a doctoral de - gree in Computational Sciences with a major in either GFD or Fire Dynamics. It is an interdisciplinary field of study whose primary goal is an improve - ment in our basic understanding of fluid flows that occur naturally, including such diverse topics as climate and paleoclimate, biogeochemical processes, hydrology and Karst dynamics, air-sea interaction, wild fire dynamics, double diffusive processes, and hurricane dynamics with strong links to the Applied Mathematics Program. The approach to this understanding is through quanti - tative analysis of observational records and theoretical, mathematical, numer - ical, and experimenting modeling. A geophysical fluid dynamicist must have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of classical physics, knowledge of the techniques of applied mathematics, and an interest in the natural sciences. It follows that the course of study leading to a degree in geophysical fluid dynamics is a rewarding one in which the student gains an overview of the geophysical sciences not available from study in a single discipline. Facilities associated with the GFD major are situated in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute ( https://gfdi.fsu.edu ). Computational Resources The Department of Scientific Computing oversees a diverse computing infrastructure in support of research and education. Computing resources in - clude clusters and computational servers, a bioinformatics server, and more. To best accommodate research, education, and application development, the Department maintains a heterogeneous desktop and workstation environment, as well as a state-of-the-art computer classroom. In addition, the department's Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Scientific Computing 375 These degrees require a total of thirty semester hours. Required for the MS in Computational Science are ISC 5305 and ISC 5315 (totaling seven semes - ter hours), a minimum of nine hours from remaining computational science courses with prefix ISC, a minimum of six hours from approved courses from other departments, and a minimum of two hours of seminars. The remaining six semester hours must be satisfied through additional approved course work, thesis hours, seminars, etc. Furthermore, a student must write and defend a thesis or project if the thesis or project option is selected. Detailed, up to date information about the MS degree in Computational Science can be found in the Graduate Handbook available on the Department of Scientific Computing website at https://www.sc.fsu.edu/graduate/hand - book . More information on the MS in Data Science can be found in the Data Science program chapter of this Graduate Bulletin. Doctoral Degree Major in Computational Science The doctoral degree is awarded in recognition of the student's broad knowledge of computational science and the student's ability to conduct orig - inal, independent research in computational science. To complete the require - ments for a doctoral degree, the student must 1) complete the requisite course work, 2) satisfactorily complete preliminary examinations for admission to candidacy, 3) choose a major professor and supervisory committee, 4) sub - mit and defend a dissertation prospectus to their supervisory committee, and 5) complete independent research in computational science culminating in a written dissertation which must be successfully defended to their supervisory committee. The doctoral degree in Computational Science has several tracks that allow students to specialize in a specific applied science or engineering discipline. All tracks require the same number of total semester hours and the same core courses. To obtain a specialization in a particular area a student must take a minimum of nine semester hours (approved by his/her supervisory committee) in the area. Current areas of specialization include: atmospheric science, bio - chemistry, biological science, fire dynamics, materials science, fluid dynam - ics, geophysical fluid dynamics, and physics. Detailed, up to date information about the PhD degree in Computational Science can be found in the Graduate Handbook available at the Department of Scientific Computing website. Major in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics The interdepartmental graduate program of study leads to the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree; currently there is no master's degree offered. The program is administered by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute, and has its own separate degree requirements. It differs from the regular departmental offerings in the Earth sciences mainly by its interdisciplinary approach and emphasis on the fundamentals of mathematics, physics, and fluid dynamics, with less emphasis on descriptive material from any one discipline. Major in Fire Dynamics The doctoral degree is awarded in recognition of the student's broad knowledge of fluid dynamics and the student's ability to do original, indepen - dent research in fire dynamics. To complete the requirements for a doctoral degree, the student must 1) complete the requisite course work, 2) satisfacto - rily complete preliminary examinations for admission to candidacy, 3) choose a major professor and supervisory committee, 4) submit and defend a disser - tation prospectus to his/her supervisory committee, and 5) complete indepen - dent research culminating in a written dissertation which must be successfully defended to the student's supervisory committee. The well-prepared student will have a strong background in mathematics and physics. The program director may, in some cases, admit students lacking formal credit in some areas, provided the deficiencies are overcome by subse - quent coursework or study at Florida State University. Coursework Required courses across the three majors are ISC 5305 and ISC 5315. The remaining courses are a function of the three majors in the department: Computational Science, Fire Dynamics, and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics. Major in Computational Science In addition to the two required courses, students are required to take ISC 5316, a minimum of twelve semester hours from remaining computational science courses with the prefix ISC, a minimum of nine semester hours from approved courses from other departments, a minimum of 6 seminar semester hours, plus a minimum of 24 semester hours of dissertation.

The primary goals of the department are to (a) provide excellence in instruction in preparing qualified professionals; (b) pursue research and other scholarly endeavors that advance the theory and practice in sport settings; and (c) provide high quality leader - ship and service that advance professional organizations in the three programs, as well as benefit Florida State University. Programs of study in the department lead to the Master of Science (MS) or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Sport Management. The department offers a Combined BS/MS Pathway that provides an opportunity for students to complete Sport Management graduate courses that will be counted toward fulfillment of the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree requirements and toward fulfillment of the MS degree requirements. The department offers two Joint Graduate Pathways in Law and Sport Management, a JD/MS and a JM/MS, in conjunction with the College of Law. Sport Management Combined Bachelors/Master's Pathway The combined Bachelor of Science (BS)/Master of Science (MS) degree pathway in Sport Management provides an opportunity for academically tal - ented students to complete graduate Sport Management courses (12 credit hours) that will be counted toward fulfillment of the BS degree requirements, and also toward fulfillment of the MS degree requirements. With the competi - tive nature of the sport industry, graduates increasingly are expected to have a higher level of training, and to compete for more than an entry-level position must already have some practical work experiences. The non-thesis Master's degree includes service learning hours, requires completion of practicum hours, and provides additional training and instruction to position students for positions in the sport industry beyond the entry level. In a highly competitive industry, the combined degree provides an option for students seeking more than entry level jobs. In an industry where having a Master's degree does pro - vide a competitive advantage, a combined pathway is expected to be a viable option for undergraduate Sport Management students. Master's Program The Master of Science (MS) degree in Sport Management emphasizes principles of business as applied in the sport industry (e.g., marketing, finance, management, law), as well as research-oriented courses befitting a graduate program. In addition, an array of electives reflects prominent career paths in the industry (e.g., collegiate athletics, professional sport). The non-thesis track MS program consists of thirty-six credit hours; a thirty-four-hour thesis-track option is also available for those who wish to pursue a research project in a particular sport issue, or to prepare for doctoral-level work. This degree program is designed to provide students with an advanced un - derstanding of Sport Management and the various components that comprise this area of study. Although course content will focus on the applied aspects of Sport Management, students will be required to become knowledgeable of the current literature, both applied and research based. In order to enhance the student's practical experiences, appropriate internships are a required element of the program of study. This specialization prepares individuals with the ap - propriate background for employment in an entry or mid-level position. Doctoral Program The department offers the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree with a major in Sport Management. The program has a seminar series emphasizing research in core areas of Sport Management, as well as a substantial research method and an analysis component. The degree will consist of a minimum of eighty credit hours, including all examinations and the twenty-four dissertation hours. The program is designed to prepare individuals for employment in univer - sities and colleges as researchers and teachers, as well as for administrative leadership positions in a variety of settings, including private business, profes - sional and college athletics, and administration in higher education.

Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Theatre 407 School of THEATRE Graduate Programs College of fine arts Website: https://theatre.fsu.edu/ Reynolds Eminent Scholar Chair in Theatre: TBA; Hoffman Eminent Scholar Chair in Theatre: TBA; Professor Emeritus: Fallon The School of Theatre is one of the largest and most comprehensive the - atre-training programs in the United States. The first program in Florida to hold such distinction, the school is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre and is a founding member of the University/Resident Theatre Association. At Florida State University, actors, directors, designers, technicians, managers, teachers, and scholars learn by working with gifted faculty in a professionally oriented school environment. In realizing its educa - tional mission, the school contributes to the cultural life of the University, the Tallahassee and Sarasota communities, and the state by creating an array of productions reflecting the full range of dramatic literature. From Shakespeare to Chekhov to Rogers and Hammerstein to world premieres, performances give audiences and participating students the opportunity to share the unique experience of the living theatrical event. Classroom experiences are enriched by the challenge of faculty, students, and visiting artists working side-by-side to create fine theatre. The School of Theatre's graduate FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training is located in Sarasota at the Florida State University Center for the Performing Arts. This exemplary Master of Fine Arts (MFA) program in acting is oper - ated in conjunction with the Asolo Theatre Company, a LORT professional theatre. The conservatory and the Asolo Theatre Company are both housed in a beautiful facility, which features a 500-seat proscenium theatre, a 160-seat proscenium theatre, dance studios, classrooms, and rehearsal spaces. In addition to its degree programs, the School of Theatre has created the Theatre Academy of London, an extraordinary, year-round curriculum in London for select theatre majors. The emphasis of the program is on classical theatre training and includes theatre-going, backstage tours, classes with lead - ing theatre artists, special internships, and performance opportunities. Students earn a full semester of academic credit while participating in a program that will make a real difference in their lives as students, artists, and human beings. Graduate credit is available by special request. Degrees Offered The Master of Arts/Master of Science (MA/MS) degrees offer a blend of academic courses and production training on an advanced level. The Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree provides training to achieve professional-level competencies in acting, directing, costume design, technical production, or theatre management. The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in theatre is a research degree that indicates the perfection of individual skills in theatre scholarship, production, and education. The School of Theatre is a fully accredited member of the National Association of Schools of Theatre, and its degree requirements are in accor - dance with the latest published regulations of that association. Retention Standards The School of Theatre reserves the right to refuse admission or termi - nate enrollment at any time if a student fails to maintain the standards of the program.

The Fine Arts Annex Theatre , located at 117 Fine Arts Annex , is a small pro - scenium space with flexible seating. The room is used as a classroom space, rehearsal space, and as a performance space for student productions. Master of Arts/Master of Science The Master of Arts/Master of Science (MA/MS) program in theatre at Florida State University offers students the opportunity to work with outstand - ing faculty in a flexible curriculum that combines scholarship and production work. Classes at the graduate level are small, enabling students to have direct contact with professors, contribute extensively in discussion, and do signifi - cant projects, reports, and papers. The MA/MS program has been designed for both students who desire a foundation for the PhD, and are interested in teaching at the secondary school or junior college level, or for those students desiring a general graduate theatre education but are uncertain about pursuing the MFA or the PhD. The MA is recommended for students who may wish to pursue a PhD, while the MS program is intended for the working theatre educator. The MA provides the option of writing a thesis, and has a foreign language requirement. In addition, the MS for Theatre Educators is a three-summer program designed with working theatre educators in mind. Students enrolled in this program take coursework in performance, technical theatre, design, literature, and history. Admission Admission to the MA/MS program in the School of Theatre is based upon the following criteria: undergraduate GPA, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, three letters of recommendation, a scholarly writing sample, and a statement of purpose. Any exemption from these requirements must be requested in writing from the Director of Graduate Theatre Studies and the Associate Dean for Academic and Students Services of the School of Theatre. Master of Fine Arts The Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree is a course of study leading to a ter - minal artistic degree in theatre arts. The objective of the program is to provide students with competencies appropriate to the needs of professional theatres in America; only secondarily does this program prepare teachers. The goals of the program are to 1) ensure opportunities for mastering the application of theory and skills by practicing a professional specialization; 2) encourage on-the-job training in actual working conditions; and, 3) provide a general background in theatre history and practice. Admission Students admitted to an MFA program must meet the University admission policies for graduate studies, must have a baccalaureate degree in theatre or its equivalent from an accredited institution, and must offer evidence of a high degree of creative ability in their area of specialization. Residency A student must be enrolled full-time in graduate study for a minimum of four semesters. A minimum of sixty semester hours beyond the baccalaureate degree is required for completion of the MFA degree. However, there are no maximum limits to the time required. It is considered normal to take three school years to complete the program because of the time necessary for infor - mation, insights, and crafts to become integrated sufficiently into a student's practice to demonstrate mastery and maturity in artistry and skill. Practicum Program The unique feature of the course of study toward the MFA at Florida State University is the practicum program. Practicum acknowledges the legitima - cy of unique artistic production-oriented work not affiliated with classroom 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityTheatre 408 coursework. The practicum program allows students and their advisors to plan and execute an individualized track to meet students' particular needs and desires. The specific content of each practicum is determined in advance and entered on the student's progress check list. This contractual agreement is evaluated by the MFA faculty each semester. Review A faculty committee meets with each student every regular semester to evaluate the student's progress. Individual program advisors report on their students in terms of attitude, class work, production assignments, projects, artistic growth, conduct, and professional potential. Any faculty members who have worked with MFA students may submit relevant information. The results of the review are part of the student's file. Internship Internships provide students with the opportunity to gain experience in their particular field by working under the supervision of recognized professionals. Resident internships must be arranged with the student's program director. The student is responsible for providing progress reports and a full evaluation from the internship supervisor before grades can be assigned. Internships may be arranged to a maximum of thirty semester hours. Specialization in Acting The MFA acting program is located in Sarasota at the FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Professional Actor Training in conjunction with the Asolo Repertory Theatre Company.

Upon graduation and at any time within the following five years, all MFAs are eligible for membership in the Actor's Equity Association. Specialization in Directing The mission of the program is to provide students with training in the process and practice of directing. The program is designed to give students the skills they will need to continue their own development and growth as directors in professional theatre. The curriculum provides a careful balance of academic classes, studio work, and production experience. Specialization in Costume Design The mission of the program is to provide students with training in the pro - cess and practice of costume design. The program is designed to give students skills needed to continue their own growth as costume designers in American theatre. Students graduate with an in-depth knowledge of all aspects of cos - tume design for the stage. Design work in opera, dance, and film is also ex - plored. Costume technology is stressed as well, including skills in millinery, fabric modification, costume crafts, and patterning. Each MFA costume design student will design from three to six productions. Design work in dance and film is also available on occasion. Opportunities to teach are also available. Specialization in Technical Production The mission of the technical production program is to train students in the process and practice of technical design, technical management, and produc - tion management. The program is designed to provide new and strengthen ex - isting skills and aid the student's growth as a technical director or production manager in professional or educational theatre. Organization and management and technical skills such as rigging, welding, hydraulics, pneumatics, ad - vanced woodworking, and motion control will be covered in detail. Structural analysis and design for the stage is emphasized. Each MFA technical pro - duction candidate will have technical direction or assistant technical direction responsibilities for at least three productions. Teaching opportunities also are available. Specialization in Theatre Management The mission of the theatre management program is to help enhance the professional management of theatre and arts organizations in America by de - veloping future theatre managers. Students are provided with practical train - ing and hands-on experience in the process and practice of managing theatre and arts organizations. Our goal is to give students an in-depth knowledge of all aspects of producing theatre, as well as an understanding of management principles, personnel, finance, marketing and fundraising management, and working knowledge of computer applications in arts management.Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The PhD is a generalist program in theatre studies with opportunities for specialization. A rigorous course of study, the PhD program operates within an active performance-oriented school, nationally recognized as one of the leading theatre-training schools. There are three types of requirements for the doctoral degree: Formal coursework Comprehensive examinations Dissertation The doctoral degree in theatre studies prepares students to become: Scholars in theatre history, criticism, literature, and theory Dramaturgs in a professional or academic environment Publishable critical writers Experienced teachers on a university level Classes at the doctoral level are small and intensive, enabling doctoral stu - dent to have close interaction with the faculty. Doctoral students also contrib - ute extensively to the intellectual environment of the program and the School of Theatre as teaching or research assistants. Requirements The doctoral program normally requires at least four years of full-time study beyond the master's degree, two years of coursework, a year for com - prehensive exams and dissertation prospectus writing, and at least a year for the dissertation. At least one year must be spent in full-time residence (defined as twenty-four semester hours within any twelve-month period once a student has reached thirty graduate semester hours or a master's degree.) The doctoral curriculum requires seventy semester hours beyond the mas - ter's degree (forty-six semester hours of coursework and at least twenty-four dissertation hours). For students on assistantship, nine hours per semester con - stitutes a full-time load. Students who are not funded and those on fellowship must register for twelve hours per semester. Admissions Admission to the doctoral program is based on Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores, academic record, professional background, state - ment of purpose, letters of recommendation, and a critical-scholarly writing sample. The highest-rated applicants are often interviewed in person or by telephone. The faculty then determines whether an applicant can be admitted, placed on a waiting list, or declined.

THEATRE PERFORMANCE AND TRAINING: see Theatre THEATRE PRODUCTION AND ADMINISTRATION: see Theatre TOPOLOGY AND GEOMETRY: see Mathematics TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC ENGINEERING: see Civil and Environmental Engineering TRANSPORTATION PLANNING: see Urban and Regional PlanningGraduate Department of URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING College of soCial sCienCes and PuBliC PoliCy Website: https://coss.fsu.edu/durp Deyle, Miles, RuBino, Thompson The Field of Planning The profession of Urban and Regional Planning encompasses all aspects of the development of human settlements, including the use of land, protection of the environment, economic productivity, and the future allocation of phys - ical and social public resources. Planning's initial concern with the form and structure of cities continues, but it has grown to include all aspects of the for - mulation and implementation of public policy, at all levels of society. Today, the field is diverse and interdisciplinary, incorporating many issues developed over the past decades and expanding to include new areas of concern. This has resulted in the establishment of new priorities and the emergence of new policy directions, including environmental sustainability, social-ecological re - silience, human service delivery systems, affordable housing, attention to job growth, global competitiveness, and access to health services, as well as more traditional activities such as the provision and financing of roads, infrastruc - ture, and public services; urban design; guiding real estate development; and implementing public transportation systems. As an institutional and professional activity, planning is now practiced in the public sector at all levels of government and in the private sector through firms that service local governments, development interests, and community groups. At each stage in the development of the profession new skills and knowledge have been called for, creating new employment opportunities and an expansion of the backgrounds held by professionals in the field. Today, planners have ties to the various social sciences, natural sciences, law, engi - neering, business, the design professions, and others. Consequently, majors from throughout the University have been attracted to the field and have thrived in a discipline that welcomes individuals with backgrounds in science, policy, design, and computer applications. What unites persons from these various backgrounds into the professional field of planning is a commitment to making the world a better place through collaboration, consensus building, and enlightened and informed public policy. While both the problems and the means for dealing with them may differ, all planners are concerned with systematically studying problems and opportuni - ties, assessing probable future directions, and formulating appropriate policies and programs to address them. Moreover, unlike many other problem-oriented professions, planning is distinguished by its concern with coordinated policy responses. Planners have adopted a broad view that focuses on the interrela - tionships between problems and the necessary interrelatedness of solutions. Above all, planners are committed to a particular concern: improving the \"quality of life\" in the places they work. This extends to employment, schools, health, housing, community facilities, transportation systems, commercial and business development, parks and green space - everything to do with physical, social, and natural environments. While any single professional may focus on a narrower range of issues, the field as a whole focuses on the entire set of issues affecting the livability of the built and natural environment. Planners attempt to address these issues in ways that recognize the differing and legit - imate concerns of many diverse and partisan interests. Accordingly, planning is a demanding and exciting field. It is beset by challenges that are created by the difficulties in finding solutions to thorny problems and in obtaining a consensus among diverse interests on policies and programs to address these problems. At the same time, it is a rewarding field. Planners know that they can and do make significant contributions to the well-being of their cities, states, and nations. The Department of Urban and Regional Planning The Department of Urban and Regional Planning was created in 1965 in response to both the growing national demand for persons trained in plan - ning, urban affairs, and policy analysis, and the rapid population and econom - ic growth occurring within the Sunbelt. Florida has been one of the fastest growing states in the nation. This growth has raised important issues about land development, housing, transportation and infrastructure, environmental protection, health care, and others, and the state has adopted a comprehensive series of laws that mandate planning at all levels of government. This has put 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityUrban and Regional Planning 412 Florida in the forefront of the national planning movement and has provided the Department with a strong, exciting, and supportive environment within which to offer a professional program. The Department offers the following degree programs: Master of Science in Planning (MSP), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), joint graduate pathways in planning and law (MSP/JD), planning and international affairs (MSP/MS or MA), planning and public administration (MSP/MPA), planning and demog - raphy (MSP/MSD), and planning and public health (MSP/MPH). Because of the breadth and diversity of the field, graduate study is considered essential for assuming professional positions and for advancing within the profession. The standard professional degree is the master's degree, and master's graduates in planning now hold the overwhelming majority of planning positions. The doctoral degree serves as preparation for academic, research, or high-level policy and administrative positions. The Joint Graduate Pathways prepare pro - fessionals to work in positions at the nexus of their component professions as they culminate in the acquisition of two degrees. All of the programs respond to the educational challenge of recognizing the breadth and diversity of the field and, at the same time, providing students with training in the common aspects, concerns, and approaches of the field. They offer the student an opportunity to study the central core of knowledge that is common to all planning activities and to develop specialized knowledge in particular problem and issue areas. Graduates of the programs are equipped to function both in generalist and specialist roles and to adapt to new challenges as the nature of the issues and preferred policy responses change. The master's degree program is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board. Located in Florida's state capital, the Department offers students many opportunities to interact with the key executive, legislative, and judicial offic - es of the state. The Department maintains close ties with state, regional, and local planning agencies, the state legislature, and the governor's office. These agencies provide substantial support services to the Department in the form of internships and field placements, data and research reports, visiting lecturers and adjunct faculty, and permanent employment positions. Students come from across the nation and from many foreign countries and U.S. territories. Women and persons of color are well represented in the program. Student backgrounds are highly diverse; many come from the so - cial sciences, engineering, architecture and the design arts, social work, or the physical sciences. The program is able to accommodate students from a wide variety of disciplines that are relevant to the issues addressed by the planning field. The total number of graduate students in residence at any time varies between 100 and 120. With eleven permanent faculty, plus adjunct in - structors, this produces a favorable faculty-student ratio. At the same time, the Department is sufficiently large to reflect the diversity of the field and to allow students the opportunity to study a number of different problem and policy areas. More than 1,600 students have graduated from the Department's graduate programs. These graduates are now employed in forty-eight states and territo - ries and twenty-seven foreign nations as professional staff in private consulting firms; for major developers; in law firms, universities, research organizations, business, and industry; and in local, state, regional, and national governments. Master's Program The principal aim of the master's program is to train students for profes - sional careers in planning, allowing them to function in both generalist and specialist roles. The program consists of forty-eight credit hours of course - work organized into the following curriculum components: Core curriculum: fifteen credit hours Methods for policy and planning decisions: six credit hours Collaborative and participatory methods: three credit hours Elected specialty area: nine credit hours Electives: twelve to fifteen credit hours Capstone requirement: three to six credit hours Core Curriculum URP 5101 Planning Theory and Practice (3) URP 5125 Plan Implementation (3) URP 5211 Planning Statistics (3) URP 5316 Land-Use Planning (3) URP 5847 Growth and Development of Cities (3) URP 5930r Professional Topics in Urban and Regional Planning (0) (2 semesters) Methods for Policy and Planning A student must take a minimum of six credit hours of coursework:URP 5201 Planning Research Methods (3) URP 5222 Planning Alternatives Evaluation (3) URP 5261 Forecasting for Plan Development (3) Collaborative and ParticipatorY Methods A student must take a minimum of three credit hours of coursework: URP 5059 Community Involvement and Public Participation (3) URP 5122 Planning Dispute Resolution (3) URP 5123 Collaborative Governance: Consensus Building for Planners (3) Specializations The Department currently offers five pre-designed specializations. They are: Environmental Planning Neighborhood Planning and Community Design Planning for Developing Areas Real Estate and Economic Development Transportation Planning All specializations are composed of two required courses and one elective chosen from a specified list. Students are encouraged to design and pursue alternative specialization programs that respond to their particular interests and career goals. In addition, all students have the opportunity to take coursework in com - puter applications for planning, including geographic information systems (GIS). Both the Geography and Urban and Regional Planning departments offer GIS coursework. GIS is supported in a forty station College of Social Sciences and Public Policy lab. General computer applications (including spreadsheets, statistical software, word processing, and GIS) are supported in a ten station departmental lab, a GIS research lab, the Department's planning studio facility, and College of Social Science computer labs. Internship Experience in the field is an important aspect of professional education. The Department requires all students to be employed in a planning or plan - ning-related agency for the equivalent of 400 hours. Most students satisfy this requirement with full-time employment during the summer between the two academic years; others work part time during the school year. This require - ment can be waived with prior relevant experience. Capstone Requirement Students are required to complete a capstone research paper, project, or master's thesis during their second year of study. Under the research paper op - tion, the student prepares a paper on a topic of professional interest, addressing the topic in a professionally competent manner. This option is pursued as three semester hours under URP 5910, Directed Individual Research. Under the project option, students complete work on a project for a client. They may do so individually or as part of a larger project team. The individual option is completed under URP 5910, Directed Individual Research, for three semester hours. The team option is completed under URP 5342, Advanced Planning Problems, for three semester hours. The master's thesis option requires the completion of a major paper that is of both professional and academic interest. This option is completed under URP 5971, Thesis, for six semester hours. Joint Law and Planning Graduate Pathway In the fields of planning and law, there is a growing need for sophisti - cated professionals who can understand and tackle the challenges created by an increasingly complex legal context for land use, environment, and urban development. With both degrees in hand (JD/MSP), planners and lawyers will have the ability to navigate this terrain with great agility. Planners often have to develop policy language for comprehensive plans, land use codes, and oth - er regulatory or quasi-regulatory programs and policies. Environmental, land use, and urban justice lawyers greatly benefit from not only understanding the legal terrain of these subareas of law, but also the professional context of planning in these areas to enhance their ability to advocate for their clients' in - terests and understand procedural and substantive constraints on government and non-governmental planning professionals. The joint graduate pathway between the FSU College of Law and FSU Department of Urban and Regional Planning provides the opportunity for Interdisciplinary study that will help students develop an intellectual agility that is critical in the changing legal marketplace and dynamic legal environ - ment of urban and regional planning. Earning the degrees together through a Florida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Urban and Regional Planning 413 joint graduate pathway both saves student resources of time and money while also allowing the student to benefit from the intellectual and pedagogical inter - twining of course content and interpersonal networking opportunities. The Master of Science in Planning (MSP) is a professional master's degree program intended to prepare urban and environmental planners to work in va - riety of settings in government, private planning firms, and nonprofit advocacy organizations. The MSP program is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board. The Juris Doctor (JD) program is accredited by the American Bar Association Section on Legal Education. The College of Law provides a so - phisticated program of study that prepares students to enter the worlds of law, business, and government at the highest possible level. The Department of Urban and Regional Planning and the College of Law offer a Joint Graduate Pathway that allows students to qualify for both the Master of Science in Planning (MSP) and the Juris Doctor (JD) degrees in substantially less time than would be necessary to achieve each independently. Total semester hours required are one hundred twelve, of which thirty-three are taken in planning and seventy-nine in law. Joint graduate pathway students need not select a planning specialization (in effect, law becomes their specialization), but they must continue to meet all other requirements for the planning degree, including the internship and the capstone project. The Department of Urban and Regional Planning will award the MSP degree only if the student's cumulative grade point average in MSP degree courses is 3.0 or higher. This requirement is in addition to, and does not replace, any other University or departmental academic standing require - ments. A member of the law faculty replaces one member of the urban and regional planning faculty on the advisory committee for the capstone project. Both programs adhere to the university minimum requirements for ad - mission to graduate study. To be considered for the Joint Graduate Pathway, students must be evaluated and admitted by the Admissions Committees of each of the two participating units. In general, students must apply to the Law School and note their interest in the Joint Pathway with planning. Those cur - rently enrolled in either degree program and have not completed twenty-four semester hours of study may apply to the second unit. Admission to that unit shall constitute admission to the Joint Graduate Pathway. Students entering the program for the Joint Pathway must start with a year in Law School before taking coursework in planning. Joint Planning and Public Administration Graduate Pathway The professions of planning and public administration are intertwined in numerous ways. Many positions in government can best be filled by persons who possess the knowledge and skills of both administrators and planners. Planners in local governments often aspire to become administrators of gov - ernments and planning organizations. Conversely, administrators, especially in rapidly growing governments, may be hampered if they cannot exercise the skills necessary to frame and implement plans. Very few persons achieve professional competence in both fields; those who do gain substantial career flexibility and attractiveness to prospective em - ployers. The Joint Graduate Pathway at Florida State University is one of only a handful in the nation. It permits the mastery of core knowledge and skills in both areas in three years or less, instead of the four years or more that would otherwise be required. It does so by eliminating duplicative coursework in analytical methods and general electives. Applicants to the MSP/MPA Joint Graduate Pathway should make formal application through the admissions office of either the Department of Urban and Regional Planning or the School of Public Administration and Policy. To be admitted to the Joint Graduate Pathway, each of the two units must sepa - rately admit the applicant to its respective degree program. Those currently enrolled in either degree program, and who have not completed twenty-four semester hours of study, may apply to the second department. Admission to that Department shall constitute admission to the Joint Graduate Pathway. Total degree hours required for the joint graduate pathway is sixty-six. The student completes the core course requirements of each degree with these ex - ceptions: the student completes either the methods requirements of the MSP program or the MPA program, not both. The student selects and completes both an urban and regional planning specialization and a public administration concentration. A single internship is required and counts for the requirement for both degrees. A single capstone/project or paper meets the requirements of both degree programs and is completed under either URP 5910/5342 or PAD 6908. If completing the paper, the committee shall consist of faculty from each of the units. Students complete the internship and professional paper re - quirements in the opposite department from which the research sequence is completed.Each of the two units will award a degree only if the cumulative grade point average for courses with that unit's prefix is 3.0 or higher. This requirement is in addition to, and does not replace, any other University or departmental academic requirements. It is expected that the student will spend two semesters of full-time study in each department, and then divide remaining coursework between the two departments. Departmental advisors will provide guidance on the proper se - quence of courses for each program. Students who attend one semester of summer school and who complete the internship requirement may be able to complete all degree requirements in two and one-half calendar years. Joint Planning and International Affairs Graduate Pathway The joint graduate pathway in Urban and Regional Planning and International Affairs enables students with an interest in international plan - ning, particularly in developing areas, to earn credit in both master's programs and obtain a master's degree for both programs. The MSP program currently requires a specialization in one of six areas, including planning for developing areas. The planning curriculum provides practical conceptual and analytical skills in program and policy design, project management, population and pol - icy analysis, and plan-making as well as grounding in urban and planning the - ories that will enable international affairs students to enhance their skills and capacities in delivering urban services in international contexts, especially in developing countries. The Planning for Developing Areas specialization pre - pares students for the challenges of guiding economic and social development in the context of increasing globalization, commonly defined as the increasing interconnectedness of people, places, and institutions worldwide. Development planners work in urban and rural developing areas around the world. Participating in the joint graduate pathway will allow URP students to increase their course content in internationally focused course material and better contextualize their studies in broader international affairs and relations theories. Meanwhile, IA students will benefit by having the option of pur - suing a professional, accredited (Planning Accreditation Board) degree that will increase their opportunity to obtain employment in international affairs or planning, including service in Peace Corps. Consequently, the joint pathway will greatly enhance the educational and career benefits enjoyed by students in each of the two master's programs. Applicants to the MSP/MS or MA in International Affairs should make formal application through the admissions office of either the Department of Urban and Regional Planning or the International Affairs Program. A full copy of all application materials should be sent to the second unit's admissions of - fice simultaneously. To be admitted to the Joint Graduate Pathway, each of the two units must separately admit the applicant to its respective degree program. Those currently enrolled in either degree program and who have not completed twenty-four semester hours of study may apply to the second unit. Admission to that unit shall constitute admission to the Joint Graduate Pathway. Total degree hours required for the Joint Graduate Pathway is sixty-four and may be slightly more depending on whether the student selects the thesis or non-thesis (international studio) option. Each of the two units will award a degree only if the cumulative grade point average for courses taken to meet the degree requirements of each unit is 3.0 or higher. The student completes the core course requirements of each degree, and then selects an urban and regional planning specialization. All students complete an internship of 400 hours in a planning or international affairs related agency or organization. The internship should have planning or public policy-related content. Students must complete a capstone in each program. The student will take courses in at least two other departments participating in the International Affairs program. The student must also fulfill the requirement for a focus on developing countries. If the student takes the Planning for Developing Areas specialty, this will fulfill the developing areas focus, but if the student opts for a different specialization in Urban and Regional Planning, s/he will need to take three other International Affairs courses to fulfill this requirement. All students must satisfy the foreign language requirement for a Master of Arts (MA) degree even if they choose a Master of Science (MS) degree. Proficiency may be demonstrated by satisfactory performance on the Graduate School Foreign Language Tests of the ETS, by certification by the language department, by taking twelve hours of language with an average grade of \"B\", or four years of language in high school. Up to six hours of graduate level courses in a for - eign language may be used to fulfill the degree requirements as International Affairs electives. Joint Planning and Public Health Graduate Pathway Florida State University is one of only a handful of universities offering a joint graduate pathway in planning and public health. 2021-22 General Bulletin Florida State UniversityUrban and Regional Planning 414 This joint graduate pathway at Florida State University reflects the recent resurgence of interest in what civic stakeholders, local communities, and glob - al society are doing to ensure that urban and urbanizing landscapes are healthy and desirable places for today's world. There is a rich historical tradition link - ing public health and urban planning. The emergence of urban planning as a profession and academic discipline had its basis in nineteenth-century public health initiatives, including tenement housing reforms, the construction of urban water supply and sewerage systems, and the design of parks and play - grounds. The work of professionals in these two fields diverged over much of the twentieth century, with public health focusing on the medical model and planning emphasizing land-use and the physical environment. Since the 1970s however, it has been recognized that major improvements in health can result from improving places and the planning processes that shape them, and changing our personal and collective lifestyles, rather than simply investing further in the health (sick) care system. The city and the communities where people live and work provide a useful focus for these concerns because more than half the world's population now lives in urban areas. Students complete all requirements for the MSP and MPH degrees. The four years it would take to earn these degrees if pursued separately is reduced to three years through the cross-counting of selected courses. The total pro - gram of study for joint pathway students to complete both degrees is sixty-six hours. All students complete a 400 hour internship in a planning or public health related agency or organization. The internship should have planning or public health policy-related content. This may be a paid or unpaid position. The in - tent of the internship is to give students a unique learning opportunity, allow - ing them to put many of the concepts and methods learned in the classroom into practice in a realistic professional setting. The internship also serves to help students focus their interest area and coursework for the remainder of their studies, and provides a maturity gained from relevant work experience. Typically, the internship is completed during the summer between the first and second year of study. Many students, however, fulfill this requirement through part-time employment during the school year. Students are not limited to the local area alone for a position. Internships must be approved by the student's advisor and the MSP and MPH program directors. Students also choose to complete either a research paper, thesis, or studio for MSP capstone credit. Both programs adhere to the university minimum requirements for ad - mission to graduate study. To be considered for the Joint Graduate Pathway, students must be evaluated and admitted by the Admissions Committees of each of the two participating units. Students apply to one program or the other and note their interest in the Joint Pathway. Those currently enrolled in either degree program and who have not completed twenty-four semester hours of study may apply to the second unit. Admission to that unit shall constitute admission to the Joint Graduate Pathway. Joint Planning and Demography Graduate Pathway Demographers study the characteristics and dynamics of human popula - tions. They use tools to collect and analyze data and make forecasts about the size, economic characteristics, and spatial distribution of those populations. Governments, researchers, businesses, and planners are frequent consumers of demographic analysis. Demographic coursework and training is an important complement to graduate education in planning, and planning coursework and training provide important professional opportunities to students in demogra - phy. The Joint Graduate Pathway between planning and demography deepens the professional preparation and maximizes the professional prospects for graduate students in both disciplines. The joint graduate pathway requirements allow students to engage in cross-disciplinary study, emphasizing the overlap between the disciplines. Students complete a minimum of thirty-three credit hours in each program, for a total of sixty-six credit hours. Students complete twenty-four credit hours of planning core classes, nine to twelve credit hours of courses in a planning specialization, twenty-four credit hours of demography core classes, a number of elective classes, and three credit hours of capstone coursework in either discipline. Students also complete a 400 hour planning internship. Both programs adhere to the university minimum requirements for ad - mission to graduate study. To be considered for the Joint Graduate Pathway, students must be evaluated and admitted by the Admissions Committees of each of the two participating units. Students apply to one program or the other and note their interest in the Joint Pathway. Those currently enrolled in either degree program and who have not completed twenty-four semester hours of study may apply to the second unit. Admission to that unit shall constitute admission to the Joint Graduate Pathway.International Exchange Programs Students may also participate in the Department's student exchange programs with the Universiteit van Amsterdam's Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences' Master's in Metropolitan Studies or Aalborg University's Department of Development and Planning Master's Program. These programs feature many courses taught in English by faculty experts in European ur - banization and international development studies. Students wishing to pursue the exchange program should communicate with their faculty advisor early in the program so that they can design their program of study to complete all requirements ahead of their exchange experience, which usually takes place in the spring semester of their second year. Pre-Doctoral Program In order to encourage high quality master's students to go on for the PhD, the department has created a pre-doctoral program that master's students may apply to, ideally in their first year of study. If accepted into the pre-doctoral program, students may take up to eighteen hours of doctoral-level courses in their second year, which will be counted toward the doctoral degree if they are admitted to the PhD program upon completion of the master's degree. Students electing to pursue this option will therefore be able to complete for - mal coursework for the PhD with as little as one additional year of courses beyond the master's degree. Doctoral Program The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program in urban and regional plan - ning seeks to educate highly qualified students who wish to pursue careers in research and teaching concerned with urban and regional systems, planned change, and the enhancement of the ability of society to deal effectively with the future. Florida State doctoral students are oriented toward critical evalua - tion of existing knowledge and the development of new knowledge for public policy purposes. The degree program has four key components: the program statement, three required theory area courses, one required advanced research methods class, coursework in two substantive areas and in additional research methods, the preliminary examination, and the dissertation. The doctoral program is a highly individualized program of study, devel - oped under the direction of a faculty supervisory committee, and ordinarily requiring three years of study post-master's degree. Prerequisites for Doctoral Study Doctoral students in urban and regional planning must show familiarity with four topical areas covered in courses in the Department's master's core curriculum: URP 5101 Planning Theory and Practice, which is required before taking URP 6102 Seminar in Planning Theory; URP 5211 Planning Statistics, which is required before taking advanced methods courses; URP 5847 Growth and Development of Cities, which is required before taking URP 6846 in Urban and Regional Theory; and URP 5201 Planning Research Methods, which is required before taking URP 6202 Design of Policy-Oriented Research. Three other options are available for satisfying these prerequisites: 1) com - pleting these courses, 2) evidence of prior coursework that illustrates that the student has mastered the course content, and 3) a formal examination on the course content. The choice among these options lies with the faculty members teaching the courses, although students may insist on a formal examination. When prior coursework is used, a grade of at least \"B\" (3.0) is required to satisfy the prerequisite. When courses are taken to satisfy a prerequisite, these credits cannot be applied toward the forty-two-credit hour minimum doctoral coursework requirement for the doctoral degree. Program Statement The content of each student's program of study is tailored to the objectives and needs of the student and is specified in a program statement that the stu - dent prepares in consultation with a major professor and a doctoral committee assembled during the first year of study. The program statement specifies the academic objectives of the student, the two substantive areas, and the set of methods necessary to achieve those objectives. Because each student's interests are unique, it is unlikely that new doctoral students will follow exactly in the path of earlier doctoral students or each other. Coursework The doctoral program requires a minimum of forty-two semester hours of study including three required courses (nine credit hours): URP 6102: Seminar in Planning Theory URP 6202: Design of Policy Oriented Research URP 6846: Seminar in Urban TheoryFlorida State University 2021-22 General Bulletin Urban and Regional Planning 415 The program also requires advanced study in one additional advanced theory course (3 hours), research methods (nine credit hours), and two sub - stantive fields to be defined by the student in consultation with committee members (twelve credit hours in one and nine in the other). Preliminary Examination Upon completion of courses and development of an approved graduate course syllabus, the student takes his or her Preliminary Examination. This includes written and oral exams in the areas of planning theory, urban and regional theory, and the substantive areas set forth in the student's program statement. Dissertation Upon passage of the Preliminary Examination, the student is advanced to candidacy and prepares a dissertation. The dissertation's scope is laid out in a prospectus, finalized and approved by the student's supervisory com - mittee by the end of the semester in which the student takes the Preliminary Examination. The prospectus may include a statement of the problem that the student is addressing, a discussion of the literature pertaining to that problem, a set of hypotheses that the student intends to test, and a research design for testing the hypotheses. Once the prospectus is approved, the student carries out the research design and completes the dissertation, defending it publicly prior to graduation. Admissions Application for admission is usually made for the Fall term. Because of the sequencing of courses, admission for Fall is preferable, but applications are considered for Spring term admission as well. No students are admitted for first enrollment in the Summer term. The deadline for receipt of all mate - rials for admissions applications is July 1 for Fall admission and November 1 for Spring admission. Earlier deadlines apply for financial aid candidates and for applications from non-U.S. students. Financial aid applicants applying for Fall admission must submit all materials by February 15 (January 15 for University and Presidential Fellowships). The deadlines for non-U.S. students are described below. Persons applying after the appropriate deadline will be considered on a space-available basis only. Applications for admission to the MSP program are welcomed from per - sons holding a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution of higher learning in the United States, or the equivalent from an institution abroad. No specific major is required, but persons contemplating planning graduate stud - ies are encouraged to earn their undergraduate degree in the humanities (in - cluding English or history), a social science (including economics, geography, political science, or sociology), or a design profession (including architecture or engineering). Other majors may be appropriate for persons who intend to specialize in particular fields, such as natural or physical science (biology, chemistry, or geology) for environmental planning or a business major (real estate or finance) for housing, economic development, or growth management. Applications for admission to the doctoral program are welcomed from persons holding a graduate degree in planning, urban studies, environmental studies, policy sciences, law, the various social sciences, and related fields. Persons with graduate work outside of these areas will also be considered, but, depending on qualifications and previous preparation, may be required to undertake additional graduate coursework prior to beginning doctoral work. Master's students currently enrolled in the Department may apply for admis - sion to the doctoral program and be admitted after having completed sub - stantially all of the coursework required for the master's core and an elected specialty, but without necessarily having completed the master's degree. The purpose of the admissions process is to judge the applicant's basic intellectual resources, motivations for seeking the degree, probability of suc - cessfully completing the program, and the appropriateness of the department's faculty and course offerings to the student's program and career interests. A complete admission application consists of a Florida State University application for graduate study, a supplementary questionnaire for applicants to the MSP or PhD program, official transcripts for all previous college or uni - versity work, an official transcript of scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), and letters of recommendation. Persons unfamil - iar with the GRE exam should consult the testing or placement office at a U.S. university, the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, New Jersey, or a U.S. consulate abroad. Application forms and information materials may be obtained from the department's website: https://coss.fsu.edu/durp . Letters of recommendation should be requested from those best able to accurately assess the scholastic abilities and potential accomplishments of the applicant. These letters should speak directly to the applicant's ability to com - plete graduate study in urban and regional planning. Two letters are required for MSP admissions, three for PhD admissions. We endeavor to keep these letters confidential within the limits of federal and state law. In order to max - imize confidentiality, letters may be destroyed after the admissions process is complete. The admissions committee conducts a thorough review of all available credentials in its deliberations. This review includes examination of work ac - complishments, extracurricular and civic activities, and other non-quantifiable information. Effort is made to ensure that our class reflects diversity in back - ground and perspective both because this improves the level of discourse in our classrooms and because women and persons of color have been historical - ly underrepresented in the profession of urban planning. Ultimately, admission is based on the committee's assessment that the applicant is capable of suc - cessful graduate work and that the applicant will become a planner who will utilize the degree to contribute meaningfully to the profession and the society. Non-U.S. Applicants should complete their applications by February 15 for Fall term admission and by September 1 for Spring term admission. These applications must include a confidential financial statement necessary for visa purposes that is normally supplied with the international admissions applica - tion forms. Applicants whose native language is not English (and who have not received a degree from a college or university in an English-speaking nation) must submit Official English Language Proficiency results from one of the following testing agencies: Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), with a minimum score of 550 (paper-based), 213 (computer-based), or 80 (Internet-based); Michigan English Language Assessment Battery (MELAB), with a minimum score of 77; International English Language Testing System (IELTS), with a minimum score of 6.5. The test of the English language is required before admission will be considered. Questions concerning certifi - cation of financial independence and health status relevant to the issuance of a U.S. immigration form I-20 should be addressed to the Center for Global Engagement, Student Services Coordinator, Florida State University, 945 Learning Way, P .O Box 3064240, Tallahassee, FL 32306-4240 U.S.A. In addition to the required written application, applicants are encouraged to come to Tallahassee for a personal interview. This permits a clearer exchange of information, provides the department with a firmer sense of the applicant's goals, and allows the applicant to evaluate resources available first hand. The admissions assistant will arrange an interview on request. Definition of Prefix URP\u2014Urban and Regional Planning Graduate Courses Planning Theory and Practice URP 5059.

Introduction to Development Planning (3) . This course analyzes the prob - lems of developing countries as integral parts of a more general process of the devel - opment of human societies on a global scale. The approach to the issues and problems of development is spatial. Such an approach permits consideration of the economic, social, political, and cultural aspects of the development process within an interdis - ciplinary framework focusing on urban and regional development as embodiment of concerns with the general quality of human life and the natural environment. The pro - cess of development as it goes on in all countries is examined by a focus on the set of conditions leading to problems of development in most societies and on the nature of development paths which have been pursued by other nations as they seek to transform their national spatial structures. URP 5611. Strategies for Urban and Regional Development in Less Developed Countries (3). This course provides an overview of the evolving development policies concerned with the spatial location of people and economic activities.
