This type of leukemia is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Although AML can occur at any age, adults aged 60 years and older are more likely to develop the disease than younger people. For more information about AML in children, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS booklet Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Children and Teens. Over the past several decades, advances in AML research have resulted in new treatments, but much work remains to be done. New therapies are needed to increase cure rates and extend survival, and LLS is leading the charge. One quarter of LLS's annual research funding is dedicated to AML. This booklet provides information about AML, explains tests and treatments for the disease. It also includes brief descriptions of normal blood and bone marrow, as well as a glossary of health terms related to AML.

The abnormal cells multiply and can spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can start almost anywhere in the body. Leukemia is a cancer of blood cells. It starts in blood-forming tissue such as the bone marrow. There are three main types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. White blood cells help fight infections. Platelets help stop bleeding by clotting (clumping together) at the site of an injury. Blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue in the center of most bones. The bone marrow contains immature cells that eventually develop into blood cells. Leukemia is a blood cancer that begins in an immature cell in the bone marrow. When one or more mutations (changes) occur in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of the cell, it becomes a type of cancer cell called a \"leukemia cell.\" Leukemia cells do not mature into healthy functioning blood cells. They grow more quickly and live longer than normal blood cells. They divide and copy themselves to make more and more leukemia cells. Over time, the leukemia cells crowd out and suppress the development of normal healthy blood cells in the bone marrow. As a result, the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. When this happens, the body's organs and tissues may not receive enough oxygen to work properly. Also, the body may not be able to fight infections or form blood clots when they are needed. There are four major types of leukemia. They are: Doctors classify leukemia based on: {The type of blood cell. Leukemia is classified by the type of blood cell that becomes cancerous. Blood cells begin as hematopoietic (blood) stem cells in the bone marrow. A blood stem cell may become a lymphoid stem cell or a myeloid stem cell. Lymphoid cells develop into white blood cells called \"lymphocytes.\" Myeloid cells can develop into red blood cells, platelets or certain other types of white blood cells (basophils, eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils). Leukemia is classified as \"lymphocytic\" (\"lymphoblastic\") if it originates in a lymphoid cell or \"myeloid\" (\"myelogenous\") if the cancerous change originates in a myeloid cell. See Figure 5 on page 49. 4 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org {Disease progression (meaning how quickly or slowly the leukemia grows). Leukemias can be \"acute\" or \"chronic.\" Acute leukemias develop and progress rapidly and usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Chronic leukemias usually progress more slowly. Acute Myeloid Leukemia AML is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many immature blood cells called \"myeloblasts.\" In AML, a mutation or a series of mutations in the DNA (genetic material) of a single myeloid stem cell results in the formation of an abnormal myeloblast. This abnormal myeloblast does not develop into a healthy, functioning myeloid cell. It becomes a leukemia cell (also referred to as an \"AML cell\" or a \"leukemia blast cell\"). These genetic errors in the mutated cell cause the leukemia cell to keep growing and dividing, whereas a healthy cell would stop dividing and eventually die. Every cell that arises from the initial leukemia blast cell also has the mutated DNA. As the leukemia cells multiply uncontrollably, they quickly accumulate in the bone marrow. This slows down or stops the production of normal, healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. As a result, there are too many leukemia blast cells (immature cells) and not enough mature, functional red and white blood cells and platelets. Over time, the leukemia cells spill out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. This can cause the number of white blood cells in the blood to increase, but most of these white blood cells are leukemia cells that do not protect against infection. Once they are in the bloodstream, the leukemia cells can spread to other parts of the body such as the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). By the time AML is diagnosed, the number of healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in the blood is usually lower than normal. Low levels of blood cells may result in anemia, infections and excessive bleeding or bruising. Medical Term Definition Anemia Low red blood cell count Thrombocytopenia Low platelet count (\"thrombocyte\" is another word for platelet) Neutropenia Low neutrophil count (a neutrophil is a type of white blood cell)Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 5In rare instances, AML cells collect outside the bone marrow and form a solid mass (a tumor). This type of tumor, called a \"myeloid sarcoma\" can form in almost any part of the body. Other names for a myeloid Surgery and therapy are not effective ways of treating myeloid sarcomas, so myeloid sarcomas are generally treated with the systemic chemotherapy regimens used for AML (even if the bone marrow and blood do not appear to be involved). \"Systemic chemotherapy\" is a treatment with anticancer drugs that travel through the bloodstream to cells all over the body. In some cases, treatment for myeloid sarcomas may also include allogeneic stem cell transplantation. For more general information about AML, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to see the free LLS booklet The AML Guide: Information for Patients and Caregivers. Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms are changes in the body that may indicate the presence of disease. A \"sign\" is a change that the doctor sees during an examination or in a laboratory test result. A \"symptom\" is a change that a patient can notice and/or feel. A person who has signs and/or symptoms that suggest the possibility of leukemia is referred to a specialist called a \"hematologist-oncologist.\" This is a doctor who has special training in diagnosing and treating blood disorders and blood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. In some large medical centers, there are hematologist-oncologists who specialize in treating acute leukemias such as AML. It is common for someone with AML to feel a loss of well-being because of the lack of normal, healthy blood cells. This happens when the leukemia cells in the bone marrow crowd out the normal blood-forming cells. As a result, patients with AML may not have enough mature red blood cells, white blood cells and/ or platelets, so they often have signs and/or symptoms related to low blood cell counts. Symptoms of anemia (a low red blood cell count) include: {Fatigue {Weakness {Shortness of breath during faintness {Headaches {Pale complexion 6 I of neutropenia (a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that is important in fighting infections) include: {Frequent infections {Fever Symptoms of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count) include: {Bruising easily {Pinhead-sized red or purple spots on the skin, called \"petechiae\" {Prolonged bleeding from minor cuts {Frequent or severe nosebleeds {Bleeding gums {Heavier or more frequent menstrual periods in females Other general symptoms of AML include: {Loss of appetite {Unexplained weight loss {Discomfort in bones or joint {Fullness or swelling in the abdomen, due to an enlarged spleen or liver The signs and/or symptoms of AML may be similar to those of other blood disorders or medical conditions. Speak with your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. Testing for AML While certain signs and/or symptoms may indicate that a person has AML, laboratory tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to have an accurate diagnosis because it helps the doctor to: {Estimate how the disease will progress {Determine the appropriate treatment Talk to your doctor about: {The diagnostic tests that are being done {What the results mean {Getting copies of the results Some tests may be repeated, both during and after treatment, to evaluate its effectiveness. Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 7Medical History. Your doctor will take a thorough medical history. This may include information about past illnesses, injuries, medications and other treatments. Some illnesses run in families, so the doctor may also ask about the health of your blood relatives. Your doctor should find out whether you have a family history of blood cancer. Certain gene mutations present at birth may increase a person's risk of developing AML, creating an inherited predisposition to the disease. If you have either a personal history of cancer or a family history of leukemia and/or other cancers in closely related relatives or recent generations, the doctor should evaluate you for an inherited predisposition syndrome; this information will help the doctor to best manage your treatment. Physical Examination. The doctor will want to know about your current symptoms and will conduct a physical examination. During the physical examination, the doctor may listen to your lungs and heart and carefully check your body for any signs of infection and disease. To check your internal organs, the doctor may feel different parts of your body. For example, the doctor may feel your abdomen to see if you have an enlarged spleen or liver. Your doctor may also check the lymph nodes in your neck, armpits and groin (the top inner part of the thigh) to see if they are enlarged. Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential (diff). This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a blood sample. It also measures the amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells and the percentage of red blood cells in the sample. The CBC should include a \"differential,\" which measures the numbers of the different types of white blood cells in the sample. People with AML often have a high number of white blood cells, but most of these are leukemia cells that do not protect against infection. These patients are \"immunocompromised,\" meaning they have a weakened immune system because they do not have enough mature white blood cells. They may also have low numbers of red blood cells and platelets. Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy. Leukemia starts in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside the center of most bones. When blood tests show cytopenias (low blood counts) or the presence of blast cells (immature blood cells), your doctor may recommend a test of the bone marrow to see whether your bone marrow is healthy and if it is making normal amounts of blood cells. Doctors use the findings from bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to diagnose and monitor blood and bone marrow diseases, including leukemia. {A bone marrow aspiration is a test to remove a small sample of liquid bone marrow. {A bone marrow biopsy is a test to remove a small sample of intact bone marrow.8 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.orgMany patients will have both tests done at the same time, but sometimes people just have a bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are often performed at the doctor's office or in the hospital. Both samples are usually taken from the large hip bone in the lower back. You will likely lie on your stomach or side. This is a painful procedure for many patients, so you will receive medicine to numb the skin and the surface of the bone. You may also have the option to take medicine before the procedure to help you relax. Some patients may be given a sedative so that they will feel less pain and have no memory of the procedure. For a bone marrow aspiration, a special, hollow needle is inserted through the hip bone and into the bone marrow to aspirate (remove) a liquid sample of cells. For a bone marrow biopsy, a wider needle is used to remove a sample of solid bone that contains bone marrow. Both needles are inserted through the skin, generally in the same area. The bone marrow samples (the aspirate and the biopsy) are sent to the laboratory where they are examined under a microscope. See Figure 1 below for an illustration of the bone marrow tests. Figure 1.

Right: Where the needles go inside the bone to collect the liquid sample for aspiration (the needle on the left) and the bone sample for biopsy (the needle on the right). The needles are different sizes for each of these tests.Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 9 Cell Assessment. At the laboratory, a hematopathologist examines the blood and bone marrow samples. A \"hematopathologist\" is a doctor who has special training in identifying blood diseases by studying cells under a microscope and performing other specialized tests on these blood cells. The hematopathologist examines the cells under a microscope to determine their size, shape and type, and to identify other cell features (see Figure 2 below). The percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow and blood is another important finding. In individuals without leukemia, there are typically no blast cells in the blood, and no more than 5 percent of the cells in the bone marrow are blast cells. In some types of AML, a diagnosis requires finding at least 20 percent myeloblasts in the bone marrow. In certain cases, AML can also be diagnosed, when the percentage of myeloblasts is less than 20 percent if the myeloblasts have a chromosomal change or genetic mutation that is typically found in a specific type of AML. The hematopathologist will conduct additional tests on the samples to determine the subtype of AML. Figure 2. Normal Cells versus AML Cells Panel A Panel A shows normal marrow cells seen through a microscope. The darker shapes are the nuclei of the cells. Some of the nuclei are circular and some are horseshoe shaped, reflecting the different developmental stages and the different types of cells. Panel B shows AML blast cells seen through a microscope. These cells are \"arrested\" in an early stage of development. In panel B, all the AML cells have a similar appearance, in contrast to the varied appearance of the normal cells in panel A. Panel B10 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Immunophenotyping (Flow Cytometry). This laboratory test identifies cancer cells based on markers called \"antigens.\" These antigens are proteins found either on the surface of or within white blood cells. Finding (or not finding) certain proteins can help determine the type of leukemia. Immunophenotyping is done with an instrument called a \"flow cytometer.\" A flow cytometer measures the number of cells in a sample, as well as specific characteristics of the cells, including their size and shape, and identify specific markers on the cell surface. A sample of cells from blood, bone marrow or other sample is tagged with a panel of antibodies that are specific to areas on the cell. The cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye and are passed through a laser beam in the flow cytometer. If they have an antibody-specific surface marker, the cells light up and are counted. Leukemia cells can have different antigens on their surfaces, depending on the type of leukemia. Certain antigens, called \"cluster of differentiation (CD)\" proteins, help identify the type of leukemia cells. While the specific pattern of antigens varies among different AML subtypes, most AML cells express CD13, CD33 and/or CD34. In addition to its use for diagnosis, flow cytometry is also used after treatment for evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD), also called \"measurable residual disease.\" This term refers to the small number of cancer cells that may remain in the body after treatment. Flow cytometry can find one cancer cell among 10,000 to 100,000 normal bone marrow cells. Testing for MRD helps doctors plan additional treatments. It is also used to find out how well treatment is working or if the cancer has come back. Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping). In this test, a hematopathologist uses a microscope to examine the chromosomes inside of cells. In patients with AML, karyotyping is used to look for abnormal changes in the chromosomes of the leukemia cells. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Each pair of chromosomes is a certain size, shape and structure. In some cases of AML, the chromosomes of the leukemia cells have abnormal changes that can be seen under a microscope. Cytogenetic testing is done with either a bone marrow sample or a blood sample. The leukemia cells in the sample are allowed to grow in a laboratory and then are stained prior to examination. The sample is then examined under a microscope and photographed to show the arrangement of the chromosomes. This is called a \"karyotype.\" The karyotype shows if there are any abnormal changes in the size, shape, structure or number of chromosomes in the leukemia cells (see Figure 3 on page 11).

These abnormalities can be \"numerical\" or \"structural.\" A \"numerical abnormality\" is when there is a different number of chromosomes in the cells than is usually found. For example, instead of the typical 46 chromosomes in each cell of the body, there may be 45 or 47 chromosomes. A \"structural\" abnormality occurs when the chromosome's structure has been altered in one of several ways including: {Translocation, which occurs when a piece of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome. Sometimes pieces from two different chromosomes trade places with each other. 12 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org {Inversion, which occurs when a part of a chromosome breaks off, turns upside down and then reattaches in that position. {Deletion, which occurs when a part of the chromosome is missing. {Duplication, which occurs when part of the chromosome is copied too many times, resulting in extra genetic material. In some cases, cytogenetic analysis provides important information for doctors determining a patient's treatment options and prognosis (outcome). For example, a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, abbreviated t(15;17), is associated with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This AML subtype has a more favorable prognosis and requires a different treatment approach than that of other AML subtypes. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). This very sensitive test is used to examine genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Doctors use FISH to detect certain abnormal changes in the chromosomes and genes of leukemia cells. Pieces of DNA that contain special fluorescent dyes are prepared in the laboratory and added to the leukemia cells on a glass slide. The pieces of DNA that bind to certain genes or areas of chromosomes light up when the slide is viewed under a specialized \"fluorescence\" microscope. Not only can FISH identify most abnormal changes that can be seen with karyotype testing under a microscope, but it can also detect some changes that are too small to be seen with karyotype testing. It is not, however, used as a general screening tool. FISH has one disadvantage\u2014before the test is performed, the doctor must select the specific chromosomes or genes that are going to be examined. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This very sensitive test is used to detect and measure certain genetic mutations and chromosomal changes that are too small to be seen with a microscope. PCR essentially amplifies (increases) small amounts of specific pieces of either RNA (ribonucleic acid) or DNA to make them easier to detect and measure in a cell sample. It can find a single leukemia cell in approximately 100,000 normal cells. This test is used to measure minimal/ measurable residual disease (MRD) in patients because it can identify a small amount of cancer cells that may remain in the body after treatment. Biomarker Testing. Biomarker testing, also called \"molecular testing\" or \"genomic testing\" refers to a number of different laboratory tests that examine the exact sequence (order) of DNA or RNA. This makes it possible to identify a variety of genetic changes in a patient's cancer cells. These changes are important in guiding risk assessment and prognosis and may also inform treatment decisions. The information it provides can help doctors to determine which patients are at high risk and may need more intensive treatment or may benefit from treatment with novel therapies. There are targeted sequencing tests (also called \"multigene panels\") that look for specific mutations in the cancer cells. These tests focus on specific sets of Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 13 genes or areas of DNA. There are also broad DNA sequencing tests (genomic screening tests) that analyze the sequence of large regions of DNA, rather than looking for mutations of specific genes. Doctors may also order sequencing of all the DNA in your entire genome. This test is known as \"whole genome sequencing.\" The term \"next-generation sequencing (NGS)\" is a catch-all term used to describe a number of different modern sequencing technologies. These technologies allow for sequencing of DNA and RNA much more quickly and cheaply than sequencing methods that were used previously. Since the introduction of DNA sequencing, the number of mutated genes that can be detected in AML patients has increased considerably. Standard protocols combine cytogenetic analysis with testing for mutations of a number of such as PML-RAR or BCR-ABL when indicated. These markers are important in guiding risk assessment and prognosis, and are also used to guide treatment decisions. For example, some patients may be eligible to receive drugs called \"inhibitors\" that target specific gene mutations expressed by leukemia cells, such as FLT3, IDH1 and IDH2. These inhibitors may be taken alone or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, but they only work against leukemia cells with these specific mutations (see Targeted Therapy on page 21 for more information). Generally, biomarker testing should be done when the cancer is first diagnosed and again after a relapse. This is because patients may acquire additional genetic abnormalities after they complete their initial, \"first-line\" treatment. If this is the case, it is important to know about these additional genetic abnormalities because the presence or absence of mutations in leukemia cells affects treatment options both at the time of the initial diagnosis and again at the time of relapse. Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS booklet Understanding Genetics for more information about genetics and genetic testing. Pre-Treatment Tests. Before you start treatment, your doctor will perform tests to learn more about your overall health and your disease. Doctors use this information for treatment planning. Some of these tests are summarized below. Blood Chemistry Profile. This blood test measures the levels of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. These substances include electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium and chloride), proteins, glucose (blood sugar), creatinine, uric acid and liver enzymes. The test findings indicate how well a person's kidneys, liver and other organs are working. Although a blood chemistry profile is not used to diagnose leukemia, if the results show that there is an abnormal amount of a particular substance in the blood, it may be a sign of disease or some other health problem. A blood 14 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org chemistry profile also provides helpful information about any potential organ damage caused by leukemia cells or cancer treatments. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Typing. This blood test is done to identify certain proteins, called \"human leukocyte antigens (HLAs),\" found on the surface of most cells in the body. These proteins make up the body's tissue type, which varies from person to person. They also play an important role in the body's immune response to foreign substances by helping the body distinguish its own cells from foreign cells. An HLA test is done before allogeneic stem cell transplantation to find out if there is a tissue match between a potential donor and the patient receiving the transplant. While HLA typing is not used to diagnose leukemia, it is an important test for newly diagnosed AML patients if allogeneic stem cell transplantation is being considered as a treatment option. See Stem Cell Transplantation on page 22 for more information. Heart Tests. Some chemotherapy drugs, such as the class of drugs called \"anthracyclines,\" can damage heart tissue. Because of this your doctor may want to test your heart function before starting each new cycle of chemotherapy. Examples of heart tests that may be given to AML patients include: {Echocardiogram. In this test, a computerized image of the heart is created by bouncing sound waves off internal tissues or organs in the chest. An echocardiogram shows the size, shape and position of the heart, as well as its internal structures. It also shows if the heart is beating and pumping blood normally. {Multigated Acquisition (MUGA) Scan. For this test, patients receive a shot containing a radiotracer into a vein, and pictures of the heart are taken with a special camera. The pictures show the radiation being released by the radiotracer, making it possible to see how much blood the heart pumps with each heartbeat. Key Questions to Ask Your Treatment Team: {What tests are necessary before I start treatment? {When will the tests take place? {Where will the tests take place? How long will the tests take? {Will my insurance pay for all of my tests? If not, is there someone who can assist me with getting my tests covered? {What are my options if my insurance plan does not cover the tests that are needed? {Will the tests need to be repeated after the end of first-line (initial) treatment?Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 15 Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS booklet Understanding Lab and Imaging Tests for more information about these tests. Visit www.LLS.org/3D to view interactive 3-dimensional illustrations of some laboratory and imaging tests. Diagnosis AML is a diverse group of diseases, and it is classified into many subtypes. Knowing your AML subtype is very important, as it can affect both your prognosis (outlook) and your best treatment plan. If you are not sure of your AML subtype, ask your doctor what it is and to explain how it may affect your treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is the main system used to classify AML into subtypes (see Table 1 on page 16). The subtypes of AML are based on the genetic abnormalities (gene or chromosome changes) in the myeloblasts (leukemia cells) and the percentage of myeloblasts present in the bone marrow and blood. In some types of AML, a diagnosis requires finding at least 20 percent myeloblasts in the bone marrow. In certain cases, AML can also be diagnosed, when the percentage of myeloblasts is less than 20 percent if the myeloblasts have a chromosomal change or genetic mutation that is typically found in a specific type of AML. There is another group of blood cancers called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). MDS can also have increased myeloblasts in the bone marrow. MDS with 10 percent to 19 percent myeloblasts is called \"MDS/AML.\" The latest WHO classification also has a list of \"diagnostic qualifiers\" that should be used after diagnosis. They include: {Therapy-related AML. Certain treatments for other cancers such as prior chemotherapy and radiation can cause AML. {AML progressing from MDS. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can transform into AML. MDS are a group of blood cancers in which the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells. {AML progressing from MDS/MPN. Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is a type of blood cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets. Certain MPNs may become AML. {AML with germline predisposition. Some people with AML inherited DNA mutations from a parent that increased their risk of developing AML. These diagnostic qualifiers are not separate subtypes of AML, but doctors use these qualifiers when they are planning treatment.16 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Table 1.

Blood. 022;140(11):1200-1228.Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 17 Treatment Planning Choosing a Hospital and Doctor. When you find out that you have cancer, you want to get the best possible medical care and treatment. AML is an aggressive blood cancer that can be difficult to treat, and a diagnosis of AML is associated with a wide range of possible outcomes. So, it is essential to seek treatment in a center with hematologists-oncologists who have significant experience in the care of patients with AML. Typically, AML patients need to start treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. However, if time allows, you may want to seek a second opinion from another doctor, as it may help you feel more confident about the recommended treatment plan. The second opinion should come from another hematologist- oncologist, preferably one who treats AML. These doctors will usually have the most knowledge and experience about the latest treatment options for patients who have AML. If you are either unsure about getting a second opinion or feel uncomfortable about how to tell your doctor you are seeking one, call our Information Specialists at (800) 955-4572, to discuss an approach that makes you feel comfortable. You may also want to check with your insurance company to be sure that your plan covers the cost of getting a second opinion and to see if specific doctors or centers are recommended. Fertility. If you are of child-bearing age, you should be aware that some cancer treatments can affect your fertility (the ability to have children in the future). Before you begin treatment, it is important to talk with your doctor about whether the treatment could affect your fertility. You may also want to speak with a fertility specialist, a doctor who has special training helping people who have trouble conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. This specialist can talk to you about possible options for preserving your fertility. You may be able to take steps to preserve your fertility. However, delaying treatment to address fertility options may not always be recommended. You may need to start treatment right away. Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS booklet Fertility and Cancer for more information about fertility preservation. Prognostic Factors. Certain factors can affect a patient's prognosis\u2014the probable outcome of the patient's cancer. These are called \"prognostic factors.\" Doctors use prognostic factors to help predict how a patient's disease is likely to respond to treatment. These factors help doctors plan the most appropriate initial treatment regimen for each patient. In addition, they help determine whether stem cell transplantation should be considered as a treatment option for the patient, and if so, when to perform the transplant. 18 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org The following prognostic factors are taken into account for adults with AML: AML Subtype. Chromosomal and genetic abnormalities are the most significant prognostic factors in people with AML. Table 2, on page 19, lists some of the more common genetic abnormalities by their risk category. Patient's Age. AML occurs mostly in older adults; the median age at diagnosis is 67 to 70 years. AML patients are considered to be \"young\" if they are younger than 60 years old. Usually, the older the patient, the poorer the prognosis. Unfavorable genetic abnormalities increase with age. Additionally, older patients sometimes have comorbidities (other medical conditions) that can make it difficult for them to tolerate intense chemotherapy treatments. Response to Induction Therapy. Patients who do not achieve a remission after one cycle of induction therapy (the first phase of treatment for AML) have a poorer prognosis. Therapy-related AML. People who received chemotherapy in the past to treat a different type of cancer may develop AML. This is known as therapy-related or treatment-related AML. In these cases, the disease is more resistant to treatment and is associated with a poorer prognosis. Prior Blood Cancer. In patients who have had a prior blood cancer, such as a myelodysplastic syndrome or a myeloproliferative neoplasm, AML is associated with a poorer prognosis. High White Blood Cell Count. A high white blood cell count (40,000/mcL or more) at the time of diagnosis is an adverse risk factor for long-term remission.

Not everyone with AML receives the same type of treatment. Your doctor will plan your treatment based on your AML subtype and other factors, such as your age and overall health, as well as your preferences. Your treatment may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or stem cell transplantation, and may be given in a hospital (inpatient treatment) or a clinic (outpatient treatment). 20 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Supportive Care. Supportive care is health care that relieves symptoms caused by cancer and by cancer treatment. The goal of supportive care is to improve the patient's quality of life and to relieve discomfort as much as possible. Supportive care for AML should be given whenever a person has symptoms that need to be controlled. For patients with AML, supportive care may include blood transfusions, antibiotics, antiviral drugs, growth factors, pain medications and specialized nursing care. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy works by either stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Different types of chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to eliminate leukemia cells or stop new leukemia cells from forming. So, more than one chemotherapy drug is usually used. Chemotherapy may be given in many ways including orally (in pills, capsules or liquids that you take by mouth and swallow) or intravenously (directly into a vein). Cancer cells tend to grow and multiply much more quickly than most cells in the body. Chemotherapy drugs affect cells that divide quickly, which is why they work against cancer cells. But they also affect some of the fast-dividing healthy cells such as the cells in the skin, hair follicles and lining of the intestines. This means normal cells are damaged along with the cancer cells, causing side effects. Chemotherapy is typically given in \"cycles.\" Each cycle is made up of a number of days of treatment, followed by a certain number of days of rest. The rest days allow the body time to recover before the next treatment cycle begins. Cycles vary in length, depending on which drugs are used. See Table 3, starting on page 44, for each drug's prescribing information. Antimetabolites. These chemotherapy drugs interfere with the normal division and function of cells. Some of the antimetabolites used drugs damage and disrupt the making of DNA and cause cell death in both cancer cells and healthy cells. Anthracyclines can damage the heart muscle and blood vessels, increasing the risk of developing heart disease. Some of the anthracyclines used I 21 Hypomethylating Agents. These drugs work by blocking the DNA that helps cancer cells grow. They also help genes that are involved in cell growth and differentiation work the way they should. Using one of these drugs may help improve blood cell counts, which, in turn, may lead to fewer blood transfusions and improve quality of life. They may also slow the progression of AML. These drugs are, in general, less likely to produce severe side effects. Some of the hypomethylating agents used Therapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells but cause less harm to normal, healthy cells. Not all cancers have the same targets. Each type of targeted therapy works a little bit differently, but they all interfere with the growth and survival of cancer cells. To find the most effective treatment, your doctor may run tests to identify the genes, proteins and other factors in your cancer cells. This helps the doctor to choose the most effective treatment for you based on the specific factors of your disease. Targeted therapy may either be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Some types of targeted therapy include: FLT3 Inhibitors. Approximately one-third of AML patients have a mutation in the FLT3 gene that can increase the growth and division of AML cells. FLT3 inhibitors are drugs that target these gene mutations. For these patients, the following targeted treatments are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA): {Midostaurin (Rydapt\u00ae) {Gilteritinib (Xospata\u00ae) Other FLT3 inhibitors being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of AML include sorafenib (Nexavar\u00ae), quizartinib (AC-220) and crenolanib. IDH Inhibitors. In some people with AML, the leukemia cells have a mutation in the IDH1 or IDH2 gene. These mutations cause cells to remain immature and divide and multiply too quickly. For these patients, the following targeted treatments used to treat AML include: {Ivosidenib (Tibsovo\u00ae) I www.LLS.org BCL2 Inhibitors. Overexpression of the BCL2 protein allows cancer cells to evade \"programmed cell death,\" meaning it helps them live longer than they should. BCL2 inhibitors target the BCL2 protein. This helps reestablish \"apoptosis,\" a process of natural cell death that is disrupted when you have cancer. It restores the body's natural ability to tell cancer cells to die. Once apoptosis is restored, your body can begin to kill cancer cells. With fewer cancer cells, there is room for healthy blood cells to grow in the bone marrow. Venetoclax (Venclexta\u00ae) is an oral BCL2 inhibitor taken by mouth each day. It binds to the leukemia cells and triggers apoptosis, the process that causes the cells to die. CD33 Targeted Therapy. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (MylotargTM) is a targeted therapy linked to the chemotherapy drug calicheamicin. It binds to and then enters cells that have the CD33 protein on their surface. Once inside, it releases the toxin that kills the cells. More than 90 percent of AML cells have CD33 on their surface. Low blood cell counts are a significant side effect of this treatment. Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor. The hedgehog pathway is essential for normal embryonic development. In adults, however, abnormal activation of this pathway is thought to contribute to the development and proliferation of cancer stem cells. Research studies have shown that disruption of this pathway can decrease the number of these cancer stem cells in the bone marrow. Glasdegib (DaurismoTM) is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor that is used to treat AML. Stem Cell Transplantation. For some patients whose disease is in remission and can tolerate intensive chemotherapy, the doctor may recommend stem cell transplantation during the consolidation phase of chemotherapy. The goal of stem cell transplantation is to cure the patient's cancer. The process typically involves administering intensive chemotherapy, followed by an infusion of healthy stem cells. There are two main types of stem cell transplantation. They are: {Allogeneic, in which a patient receives stem cells either from a matched or a partially matched donor, either related or unrelated to the patient. This type of transplant, typically done for patients who have AML with higher risk features, relies on the donor's immune system cells to fight off any residual leukemia within the recipient. Simply put, allogeneic stem cell transplant can be regarded as a form of immunotherapy. {Autologous, in which a patient's own stem cells are collected before chemotherapy and stored. Then, after the patient has completed chemotherapy, these cells are reinfused into the patient's bloodstream. This type of transplant is not typically used for treating AML. Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 23 Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation. This is the most common type of stem cell transplantation used to treat AML. In preparation for the transplant, patients receive a \"conditioning therapy.\" This consists of intensive chemotherapy, either with or without radiation, to kill the leukemia cells remaining in their bodies. Importantly, it is also given to suppress their immune systems, so that their bodies do not reject the donor stem cells. After the conditioning therapy, patients receive donor stem cells by intravenous infusion. Allogeneic transplantation uses healthy blood-forming cells from an HLA-matched donor. The cells can come from a family member, an unrelated person, or from a donated umbilical cord. The donated stem cells restore the bone marrow's ability to form new blood cells. Ideally, an allogeneic stem cell transplant will generate a new immune system for the patient, one that helps the body fight infections and other diseases. The new immune system also has the potential to recognize and attack any remaining cancer cells in the body. The transplanted immune cells (the \"graft\") perceive the leukemia cells in the body as foreign and destroy them. This is called the \"graft- versus-leukemia (GVL)\" effect. Compared to other treatment options, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is associated with a higher rate of side effects and mortality. However, it may be considered for patients with higher-risk AML, based on their cytogenetic and molecular test results and other prognostic factors. The decision to perform an allogeneic transplant also depends on other factors, including the patient's age, physical fitness, comorbidities (other coexisting medical conditions) and social supports (from family members, caregivers, friends, etc), as well as the patient's understanding of the potential benefits and risks. One possible serious side effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is graft- versus-host disease (GVHD). This occurs when the transplanted immune cells (the graft) from the donor identify the normal cells in the recipient's body (the host) as foreign and attack them. Most patients need to be closely monitored for acute GVHD for at least the first 100 days after the transplant, and for chronic GVHD for many months after the transplant. Research to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from stem cell transplantation after their first complete remission is evolving. Studies show that allogeneic stem cell transplantation may benefit fit patients with high-risk or intermediate-risk AML who have an HLA-matched stem cell donor. Timing of is one of the most important factors influencing allogeneic transplant outcomes. In most cases, it is very important to start a donor search as soon as possible after an AML diagnosis in order to identify a suitably matched, related or unrelated donor and to plan for the best time to perform a transplant safely and successfully. 24 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Reduced-Intensity Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation. This type of transplantation may be a treatment option for older patients who cannot tolerate the high doses of chemotherapy used in preparation for a standard allogeneic stem cell transplant. The conditioning therapy in a reduced-intensity transplant uses lower doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation. With a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, the patient's blood counts may not fall as low as they would with high-dose chemotherapy. Additionally, the less toxic regimens put less strain on the patient's organs, making this regimen safer and more tolerable. The success of reduced-intensity transplantation depends on the graft-versus- leukemia effect of the donor stem cells, rather than on high-dose treatments to kill the cancer cells. This therapy reduces the number of cancer cells, but it does not completely destroy the patient's bone marrow. The goal is to have the donor stem cells become established in the patient's bone marrow and produce white blood cells that will attack the patient's remaining cancer cells. As with standard allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the risk of GVHD is an important consideration and a potentially disabling side effect. Talk to your doctor about: {Stem cell transplantation and ask whether it is a treatment option for you See the free LLS booklets Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation, Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Facts and Graft-Versus-Host Disease for more information about stem cell transplantation. Treatment New treatments may have been approved since this booklet was printed. Check www.LLS.org/DrugUpdates or call (800) 955-4572. Before you begin treatment, you and your doctor will discuss your treatment options. One option may be a clinical trial. Like all treatment options, clinical trials have possible risks and benefits. By considering all your treatment options, including participation in a clinical trial, you will be taking an active role in a very important treatment decision that affects you. In the past, a diagnosis of AML was generally considered a medical emergency, and treatment usually started as soon as the diagnosis was made. This often did not allow time for doctors to obtain the specific genetic profile of a patient's leukemia prior to making treatment decisions. Preliminary research has recently found that in many cases of AML, waiting up to 7 days, in order to obtain genetic data and other laboratory test results on the AML cells, may be safe for most Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 25 patients. This is an important consideration when assigning patients to the best available treatment option before starting therapy. Not everyone with AML receives the same treatment. The choice of therapy for AML depends on a series of factors, including: {The status of the disease (measured by the genetic profile of the leukemia cells and other prognostic factors) {The patient's age, overall health and general level of fitness (called \"performance status\") {Consideration of the patient's goals for treatment and eligibility to undergo stem cell transplantation Doctors often give the most intensive chemotherapy regimens to people younger than 60 years of age. However, this age limit is just a guideline. Some older patients in good health may also benefit from intensive regimens or slightly less-intensive treatments. For example, an AML patient aged 63 years with no other health issues and someone younger than 60 years old may be treated in a similar way. Likewise, a person aged 57 years with serious health issues may get the sort of treatment usually given to someone aged 60 years and older. There are always risks associated with treatment. Talk with your doctor about how the treatment may affect your quality of life and length of life. Therapy for Patients Younger Than 60 Years of Age and \"Fit\" Patients Aged 60 Years and Older. For this group of patients, the goal of treatment is to increase long-term survival with the possibility of a cure. Treatment is more intensive and may have more serious side effects. It typically consists of multidrug chemotherapy given in two phases: induction and consolidation. Some patients may also receive a third phase of treatment called \"maintenance.\" The specific drugs, the dosages used and timing of administration depend on several factors, including the genetics of the leukemia cells, the patient's age and the overall health of the patient. Induction. The first phase of therapy is called \"induction.\" The goal of induction is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible in order to induce (achieve) a complete remission and restore normal blood cell production. Although obtaining a remission is the first step in controlling AML, it is also important for patients to emerge from the induction phase physically fit enough to tolerate the intensive treatments given during the consolidation phase. The most common induction regimen for AML includes cytarabine and an anthracycline drug, such as daunorubicin or idarubicin. This is called the \"7+3 regimen,\" because cytarabine is most often given by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 7 days, while the anthracycline drug is given by an IV infusion in a single dose for 3 days during the first week of treatment. 26 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org The induction therapy is usually given in the hospital and lasts about a week. However, patients typically remain in the hospital for an additional 3 to 5 weeks for a total of 4 to 6 weeks while their blood counts recover following 7+3 therapy. In addition to the chemotherapy, patients may receive targeted therapies during induction. These the 7+3 regimen including: {CPX-351 (Vyxeos\u00ae), a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine. A liposomal medication contains the active drug inside small, fat-like particles. This special fatty preparation allows more medication to reach its target (the bone marrow) and stay in the bone marrow to kill leukemia cells. {High-dose cytarabine with colony- stimulating factor (G-CSF) See Table 3, starting on page 44, for each drug's prescribing information. Fourteen to 21 days after the start of induction therapy, bone marrow tests are done to see how well the treatment is working and whether a second round of induction therapy is needed. If there are less than 5 percent blasts in the bone marrow, the leukemia is generally considered to have a good chance of entering a remission with the single round of induction therapy. Patients then receive supportive care until their blood counts recover. A follow-up bone marrow biopsy is performed to confirm that a remission has been achieved prior to moving on to consolidation therapy. Some medical centers, however, give all medically-fit patients a second cycle of induction therapy even if they have achieved optimal cytoreduction (ie, less than 5 percent blasts in the bone marrow at day 14). If the first round of induction therapy does not achieve optimal cytoreduction, the therapy can be repeated, either with the same drugs or with a new chemotherapy regimen. Patients who continue to have a high level of blasts in their bone marrow after the second round of induction therapy, should be considered as candidates for a clinical trial, allogeneic stem cell transplantation or drug regimens for relapsed or refractory AML. Patients who achieve a remission are given a few weeks to prepare for consolidation, the next phase of treatment. The large doses of chemotherapy given during induction destroys most of the leukemia cells, as well as healthy bone marrow cells. Most patients develop dangerously low blood cell counts and some may become very ill. Following the induction phase, patients typically Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 27 remain in the hospital while blood cells start recovering in the bone marrow. Patients often require transfusions of red blood cells and platelets. In order to reduce the risk of infection, antibiotics are given to prevent and treat bacterial and fungal infections. Blood cell growth factors can help bring a patient's white blood cell count back more quickly, which may increase the chances of a faster recovery (particularly in patients who develop an infection). Even when a complete remission is achieved, some leukemia cells that cannot be seen with a microscope still remain in the bone marrow. This is referred to as \"minimal residual disease (MRD),\" also called \"measurable residual disease.\" Patients who achieve remission after initial treatment but have MRD are at increased risk of disease relapse. Testing for MRD may help doctors identify patients who may benefit from further treatment with intensified therapies. Even when patients test negative for MRD, some residual leukemia cells that cannot be detected even with very sensitives tests are believed to remain in the body after remission. Therefore, to optimize the chances of a cure, consolidation therapy (additional intensive therapy) is generally recommended. Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS booklet Minimal/Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) for more information. Consolidation. In many patients, blood cell production should return to normal several weeks after induction therapy is completed. Blood cell counts gradually approach acceptable levels, and AML blast cells cannot be detected in the blood or bone marrow. The cancer is now said to be \"in remission.\" If there are a small number of residual AML cells, they will not generally interfere with normal blood cell development. However, they do have the potential to multiply and cause a relapse. Even when a patient achieves a complete remission, more treatment is always needed to destroy any residual leukemia cells in the body. Without additional therapy, the leukemia will relapse within weeks or months. To prevent a relapse, intensive consolidation therapy is given after the patient recovers from induction therapy. Consolidation therapy is treatment given after cancer is in remission following the initial therapy. The goal of consolidation therapy is to \"consolidate\" the remission by lowering the number of residual leukemia cells in the body or eliminating them entirely. There are two basic treatment options for post- remission therapy: {Additional intensive chemotherapy {Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (See Stem Cell Transplantation on page 22)28 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Patients with favorable risk factors are often given intensive chemotherapy with intermediate or high-dose cytarabine and other drugs for their consolidation therapy. In the consolidation phase, patients generally receive multiple cycles of chemotherapy. The number of chemotherapy cycles varies from patient to patient. Patients may be hospitalized or receive post-remission therapy in an outpatient setting, depending on the type of treatment and other factors. Patients with high-risk AML, based on their prognostic factors, receive more aggressive therapy, such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation (see Stem Cell Transplantation on page 22 for more information), during the consolidation phase of treatment. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a complex treatment that can cause serious, life-threatening side effects. So, it is important to discuss the benefits and risks of this procedure with your doctor. Whether or not to have an allogeneic stem cell transplantation after the first remission is an important treatment decision for a patient. Often, this is when transplantation offers the best chance of preventing AML from recurring. However, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is associated with higher treatment-related morbidity and death compared to other treatment options, especially in older patients. Patients who are candidates for an allogeneic stem cell transplant should begin a search for an HLA-matched stem cell donor as soon as possible, ideally while they are receiving induction therapy. Talk to your doctor about: {Stem cell transplantation and ask whether it is a treatment option for you Maintenance. The third phase of treatment is called \"maintenance.\" The main objective of maintenance therapy is to deliver a less toxic therapy to prevent relapse after intensive chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy is often an extended course of treatment. Not everyone with AML will receive maintenance therapy. Your doctor may recommend maintenance therapy depending on your subtype of AML, your consolidation treatment and your risk of relapse. For some adult patients, the doctor may prescribe an oral formulation of azacitidine (Onureg\u00ae) as maintenance therapy. See Table 3, starting on page 44, for each drug's prescribing information. Therapy for Patients Aged 60 Years and Older. AML occurs more frequently in older adults; adults aged 60 years and older are more likely to develop the disease than younger people. Treatment approaches for these patients range from standard intensive induction chemotherapy to less-intensive therapies, or the best supportive care. Additionally, there are a growing number of new treatment options available for older adults. The treatment of AML in older patients is a challenge. Genetic abnormalities in the leukemia cells occur much more frequently in older patients than they Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 29 do in younger patients. This makes the disease more resistant to standard chemotherapy in older patients than it is in younger patients. Also, as people age, they can have more difficulty tolerating more intense cancer treatments. Older patients are also more likely to have comorbidities (other medical problems), including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and heart disease. They may also have a history of stroke or lung disease. These comorbidities can limit treatment options. Many older patients are not offered standard treatment options with intensive chemotherapy because they are considered unlikely to survive the rigors of this treatment. In some cases, intensive chemotherapy can actually shorten their lives. There are, however, treatments for patients of all ages. Remission is still possible with lower-intensity treatments. The choice of therapy for older patients with AML also depends on the specific genetic profile of the leukemia cells; a patient's genetic profile is also the best way to predict how the disease will respond to chemotherapy as some specific genetic mutations may lead to poorer outcomes. In addition, consideration needs to be given to whether patients have available support from friends and family during treatment. You should discuss your treatment goals with your doctor. The doctor should explain the risks and benefits of your different treatment options and also provide realistic expectations about the likely results of each of them. Older patients who are physically fit and have no serious health problems may benefit from intensive treatment (See Therapy for Patients Younger Than 60 Years of Age and \"Fit\" Patients Aged 60 Years and Older on page 25). Fit older patients may even be candidates for reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation (See Reduced-Intensity Stem Cell Transplantation on page 24 for more information). Not all patients can tolerate intensive therapies or even want them. Patients whose comorbidities and performance status make them poor candidates for intensive chemotherapy may still be able to participate in clinical trials. Or they may benefit from lower-intensity therapies which may relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and potentially extend survival. The National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) Guidelines has compiled a list of lower-intensity treatment strategies for AML induction. In the list below, treatments with \"azacitidine\" refer to azacitdine (Vidaza\u00ae), and treatments with \"decitabine\" AML an and azacitidine for AML with FLT3 mutation See Table 3, starting on page 44, for more information about FDA-approved indications for these therapies. Assessing Treatment Response. After the completion of induction therapy, blood and bone marrow tests are done to check for a remission and to look for minimal/measurable residual disease. A complete remission is achieved when no more than 5 percent of the cells in the bone marrow are blast cells. For patients who are tolerating and responding to treatment, the doctor will generally continue the treatment indefinitely as maintenance therapy. If there is no response or the cancer progresses, patients may want to consider participating in a clinical trial or trying other treatments for relapsed or refractory disease. Patients may also want to consider only supportive care to improve quality of life and alleviate discomfort. Special Treatment Considerations Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). This aggressive subtype of AML is associated with potentially life-threatening simultaneous bleeding and clotting complications. While in the past APL was nearly always fatal, it is now one of the most curable subtypes of AML in adults, if it is diagnosed early and treated appropriately. APL accounts for approximately 10 percent of all AML cases and occurs primarily in middle-aged adults, although it can occur at any age. It can also develop after a patient receives chemotherapy for another disease. In people with APL, immature white blood cells called \"promyelocytes\" build up in the bone marrow. The overproduction of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. People with APL are particularly susceptible to bruising and excessive bleeding. This occurs, in part, Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 31 because of the low number of platelets in the blood and also because the leukemia cells release substances that alter the balance between bleeding and clotting. APL is due to a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, abbreviated t(15;17). A translocation is a genetic change in which a piece of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome. In APL, an abnormal fusion gene called \"PML/RAR \" forms as a result of the translocation. This mutated gene leads to the production of a protein that causes blood cells to get stuck in the promyelocytic stage, unable to develop into mature white blood cells. A diagnosis of APL depends upon confirmation of t(15;17) in the patient's AML cells. Treatment for APL differs from the treatment of the other AML subtypes described in this booklet. Many people with APL are treated with the non- chemotherapy drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA, Tretinoin, Vesanoid\u00ae) in combination with arsenic trioxide In high-risk cases, chemotherapy such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) is also added. See Table 3, starting on page 44, for each drug's prescribing information. Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS booklet Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Facts to learn more about this disease. Central Nervous System (CNS) Involvement. AML cells can spread to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that flows around the brain and spinal cord. CNS involvement occurs in less than 5 percent of AML patients. Because CNS involvement is rare in cases of AML, doctors usually do not test for it at the time of diagnosis unless the patient is experiencing neurologic symptoms, such as headaches or confusion. If neurologic symptoms are present, the doctor may order an imaging test, such as a computed tomography (CT) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to evaluate the symptoms further. The doctor will also obtain a sample of the patient's CSF by lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture (also called a \"spinal tap\") is a procedure that is used to collect CSF from the spinal column. A thin needle is inserted between two bones in the spine and into the fluid. A sample of the fluid is removed and examined under a microscope to look for leukemia cells. If leukemia cells are found in the CSF, the patient will be given \"intrathecal chemotherapy.\" In this treatment, chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into the spinal fluid. Intrathecal chemotherapy needs to be administered 2-3 times per week until the leukemia cells are eliminated, followed by weekly or monthly treatments to prevent disease recurrence in the CNS. Treatments with intrathecal chemotherapy can be administered at the same time that the patient is receiving other chemotherapy treatments for AML. Visit www.LLS.org/3D to view interactive 3-dimensional illustrations of these procedures.32 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Relapsed and Refractory AML Some patients have AML that returns after remission. This is referred to as a \"relapse\" of the disease (or \"relapsed AML\"). Some patients are unable to achieve a remission after two cycles of induction therapy. In these cases, the disease is referred to as \"refractory\" (or \"refractory AML\"). Relapsed and refractory disease is generally more difficult to treat. But there are treatment options available. Treatment for relapsed and refractory AML is usually more intensive or more complex than the treatment used following initial diagnosis. For these reasons, it is particularly important to consider getting opinions on treatment options from someone with expertise in managing relapsed and refractory AML. At the time of relapse, genetic testing of the leukemia cells may be performed. The mutational pattern at the time of relapse may be different from the pattern that was seen when the disease was first diagnosed, and this can affect treatment decisions. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only potential curative option for patients with relapsed AML. Patients, however, must be considered fit enough to undergo the procedure. But recent FDA approval of several new treatments may help patients who cannot undergo a stem cell transplant to live longer with high quality of life. Treatment options for patients with refractory or relapsed AML include: {A clinical trial (see Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers on page 34). Treatment in a clinical trial should be considered first for all patients with refractory or relapsed AML. LLS offers help for patients and caregivers in understanding, identifying and accessing clinical trials. Patients and caregivers can work with Clinical Trial Nurse Navigators who will help find clinical trials and personally assist them throughout the entire clinical-trial process. Visit http://www.LLS.org/CTSC for more information. {Re-treatment with the same induction regimen that produced the patient's first remission. This is an option if a relapse occurs 12 months or more after remission. {Chemotherapy followed by Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation. In fit patients, salvage chemotherapy can be used to induce a remission before stem cell transplantation. This is an option for patients younger than 60 years of age and patients older than 60 years who are physically fit. Note: In the list of treatments on page 33, \"azacitidine\" refers to azacitdine (Vidaza\u00ae), and \"decitabine\" refers to decitabine (Dacogen\u00ae).Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 33 {Targeted Therapy. Some targeted therapies recommended by the National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) Guidelines, that may be used include: {Therapy for AML with FLT3-ITD mutation CD33-positive AML * Gemtuzumab ozogamicin See Table 3, starting on page 44, for each drug's prescribing information. Research is ongoing to determine optimal drug combinations, doses and administration schedules. The drug combinations listed below are some commonly used aggressive and less aggressive treatment regimens for refractory and relapsed cases of AML. Aggressive treatments for fit patients, suggested by the NCCN Guidelines, include: {Cladribine, cytarabine and granulocyte or {High-dose cytarabine, cytarabine or and cytarabine, either with or without mitoxantrone {Clofarabine either with or without cytarabine and either with or without idarubicin Less aggressive treatments, suggested by the NCCN decitabine) or low- dose cytarabine See Table 3, starting on page 44, for each drug's prescribing information.34 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers Every new cancer drug goes through a series of carefully controlled research studies before it can become part of standard cancer care. These research studies are called \"clinical trials,\" and they are used to find better ways to care for and treat people with cancer. In the United States, the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) requires that all new drugs and other treatments be tested in clinical trials before they can be used. At any given time, there are thousands of cancer clinical trials taking place. Doctors and researchers are always looking for new and better ways to treat cancer. Researchers use cancer clinical trials to study new ways to: {Treat cancer using {A new drug {An approved drug to treat a different kind of cancer {A new combination of drugs {A new way of giving a drug\u2014by mouth (pill), intravenously (IV) {Manage cancer symptoms and ease treatment side effects {Find and diagnose cancer {Keep cancer from coming back after treatment {Manage long-term side effects By taking part in a clinical trial, patients can see doctors who are experts in their disease, gain access to new, cutting-edge therapies and provide helpful information for future patients. The treatments and information we have today are due in large part to patients being willing to join clinical trials. Anyone interested in being part of a clinical trial should talk to their hematologist- oncologist about whether a clinical trial might be right for them. During this conversation it may help to: {Have a list of questions to ask about the risks and benefits of each trial (visit www.LLS.org/WhatToAsk for lists of suggested questions). {Ask a family member or friend to go with you to your doctor visit\u2014both for support and to take notes.

Also, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS booklet Understanding Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers. Related Diseases Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a very rare, fast-growing blood cancer. It is similar to AML. But, unlike AML, BPDCN can affect other organs such as the lymph nodes, spleen, central nervous system and skin in addition to the blood and bone marrow. In fact, most patients with BPDCN have skin lesions, and the disease is often diagnosed through a skin biopsy. It may also be diagnosed through a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Most patients with BPDCN are older, with a median age of 65 to 67 years at diagnosis, and it is more common in men than women. A diagnosis of BPDCN requires a finding of at least 4 of the following 6 antigens on the cancer cells: CD123, CD4, CD56, TCL-1, CD2AP and CD303/BDCA-2. In addition, BPDCN should seek treatment at a cancer center with doctors who have experience treating patients who have this disease. Treatment may include the drug tagraxofusp-erzs (Elzonris\u00ae). Tagraxofusp-erzs targets the CD123 36 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org protein on the surface of BPDCN cells and leads to cancer cell death. See Table 3, starting on page 44, for prescribing information. Patients in first remission may undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation, if appropriate. Other treatment options include induction regimens used for AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or lymphoma. Recent clinical trials with agents targeting some of the BPDCN cell surface markers have shown great promise. Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL). MPAL is a subtype of acute leukemia, which is also known as \"biphenotypic leukemia\" or \"mixed lineage leukemia,\" and has an ambiguous lineage. It is a combination of two forms of leukemia: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It accounts for 2 to 5 percent of all acute leukemia cases, affecting patients of all ages, and there are several different subtypes. Since MPAL is a rare form of blood cancer, patients with MPAL should seek treatment at a cancer center that has experience treating patients who have this disease. The best treatment approach for MPAL has not yet been determined. There is no standard therapy for the disease and, in general, it is associated with a poor prognosis. This is due to the difficulty in correctly identifying this type of leukemia, its low incidence, the lack of experience in treating it, and its tendency to be resistant to both ALL and AML therapies. The reasons for this resistance are not yet clear, but may be related to the high percentage of high- risk chromosomal abnormalities found in patients with MPAL. A variety of factors are involved in determining the best treatment for patients with MPAL. These include the patient's age, medical history (and other relevant medical conditions), and the characteristics of the leukemia cells as determined by immunophenotyping and genetic tests. It is also important to determine whether the patient has the Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) subtype, which accounts for about 25 percent of all cases of MPAL. Treatment for Ph+ MPAL usually consists of a chemotherapy regimen for ALL, based on the patient's age, in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This may be followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, if needed. For patients with a Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) subtype of MPAL, the treatment typically consists of either an ALL-treatment regimen, or a combination of ALL and AML therapies. Ideally, this treatment would be followed by consolidation therapy with an allogeneic stem cell transplant when a donor is available. Side Effects and Complications AML and its treatment often cause side effects. In addition to treating the cancer, an important part of care is relieving a person's symptoms and side effects resulting from treatment. Most side effects in patients with AML are temporary Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 37 and subside once the body adjusts to therapy or when therapy is completed. If side effects become severe, patients may need to be hospitalized. Low Blood Cell Counts. Cancer and cancer treatments often cause drops in blood cell counts. This can result in a severe deficiency in the patient's number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients almost always need transfusions of red blood cells and platelets for several weeks during treatment. After that, the blood cell counts usually return to normal levels. White blood cell transfusions are generally not used for AML patients, so doctors sometimes use growth factors to help increase a patient's white blood cell count. Growth factors stimulate the bone marrow to make new white blood cells. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs), such as filgrastim (Neupogen\u00ae) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta\u00ae), stimulate the production and release of neutrophils into the bloodstream. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GMCSFs), such as sargramostim (Leukine\u00ae), stimulate the production of different types of white blood cells including neutrophils and macrophages. However, growth factors are used only in special circumstances, and routine use of these agents is not recommended. For patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), growth factors are also not recommended during induction therapy because they can increase the risk of \"differentiation syndrome.\" Patients with this condition may experience symptoms such as unexplained fever, weight gain, labored breathing, pleuropericardial effusion (fluid around the lungs and heart), hypotension (low blood pressure) and renal (kidney) failure. (For more information on differentiation syndrome, see page 38). Infections. During treatment for AML, the deficiency of white blood cells can lead to infections from bacteria and fungi that are normally present in the environment, on the skin, in the nose and mouth, on the gums or in the colon. The risk of infection may be increased because chemotherapy damages the cells lining the mouth and intestines, making it easier for bacteria to enter the bloodstream. After starting a course of chemotherapy, patients commonly receive antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection, as well as other drugs that prevent fungal and viral infections. Because of the increased risk of infection, medical staff and all family and friends need to practice frequent and vigorous handwashing and take other precautions to avoid exposing patients to bacteria, viruses and other infection- causing agents. Caregivers of patients who have central lines or ports need to be meticulous when cleaning insertion sites and catheters. Patients at home should seek medical attention immediately if any signs of infection develop. A temperature of 100.4\u00b0F or higher or the onset of chills may be the only sign of infection in a patient who has a very low white blood cell count. Other signs and/or symptoms of infection may include persistent coughing, sore throat, pain during urination, or diarrhea. 38 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Patients with AML are advised to receive certain vaccinations. For adult patients, these include vaccinations for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia and the inactivated (dead) vaccine for the herpes virus, called Shingrix. Vaccines using live organisms or high viral loads, such as the herpes zoster/shingles vaccine zoster vaccine live (Zostavax\u00ae), should not be given to AML patients. If a family member or friend of the patient receives a live vaccine, they should not go near the patient for a period of time. Covid-19 vaccines are also recommended. Speak to your doctor for more information. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). Patients with AML may be at high risk of developing TLS. This condition occurs when a large number of cancer cells die within a short period of time, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. TLS can be a severe complication during the early phases of AML treatment, especially for patients who have very high white blood cell counts before they start induction therapy. Dying leukemia cells break apart releasing chemicals into the bloodstream. Uric acid is one of the chemicals released by the dying cancer cells. Very high levels of uric acid and other chemicals can cause severe damage to the kidneys and heart. If untreated, TLS can lead to heart arrhythmias, seizures, loss of muscle control, acute kidney failure and even death. Patients with AML are constantly monitored for the development of TLS and are given drugs such as allopurinol (Zyloprim\u00ae) or rasburicase (Elitek\u00ae) to prevent or lessen the effects of TLS. Differentiation Syndrome. This is a potentially life-threatening side effect of treatment with differentiating agents, such as all-trans retinoic (Tibsovo\u00ae). It usually occurs within 1 to 2 weeks after the patient starts treatment, but it can occur later. It is caused by a large, fast release of cytokines (immune proteins) from leukemia cells that are affected by the anti-cancer drugs. Signs and symptoms of differentiation syndrome include fever, swelling in the limbs and trouble breathing. Patients may also experience a drop in blood pressure and have fluid build-up around the lungs or heart. Treatment must begin as soon as the patient experiences the very first signs and/or symptoms. Treatment consists of corticosteroid therapy or the administration of the antimetabolite drug hydroxyurea and other chemotherapy drugs to decrease the number of white blood cells, which are the source of differentiation effects. In severe cases, use of differentiating agents is stopped. Other Side Effects. Chemotherapy drugs affect cells that divide quickly, which is why they work against cancer cells. But they also affect healthy cells in the body that also divide quickly, such as cells in the skin, hair follicles and lining of the intestines. Common side effects of chemotherapy may include:Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 39 {Mouth ulcers loss {Rashes {Itchy skin {Nausea {Loss appetite and weight loss {Fatigue {Neuropathy (pain, numbness, tingling or muscle weakness, usually in the hands or feet) Inform your doctor about any side effects that you experience. Your doctor may prescribe medications that will prevent or relieve your side effects, change dosages of the medicines you are taking or adjust treatment schedules to prevent side effects from getting worse. Your doctor may also suggest other ways to prevent or minimize them. Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view the free LLS series Side Effects Management (filter for Side Effect Management) for more information. Sometimes drugs or drug combinations cause side effects that continue for a period of time after treatment ends. Some of these effects may be long-lasting (see Long-term and Late Effects of Treatment on page 41 for more information). Follow-up Care Your medical care for AML does not stop once active treatment has finished. Your doctor will continue to check on you to make sure that your leukemia has not returned, manage side effects and monitor you for late effects of treatment. This is called \"follow-up care.\" Monitoring for Recurrence of AML. After a patient completes treatment for AML and is in remission, follow-up tests are done to check how well the treatment worked and to look for signs of relapse. Tests are also done to check how well the patient's organs are working. Patients undergo frequent follow-up tests during the first year after treatment, but tests are done less often during the second and third years. Testing and checkups may be required less often as times goes on, but scheduled follow-up visits should continue indefinitely. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends that AML patients should have a complete blood count every 1 to 3 months for the first 2 40 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org years after completing consolidation therapy, then every 3 to 6 months thereafter up to 5 years. Bone marrow tests should be performed only if blood test results are abnormal. If you have been treated for AML you are encouraged to: {Maintain your regular follow-up appointments with your hematologist- oncologist. Your doctor will monitor you for any signs and/or symptoms of disease relapse. Your doctor will also be able to detect any side effects from treatment or the onset of other medical problems. {Keep a record of your cancer diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care needs. This is often called a \"survivorship care plan.\" Ask your doctor for a written survivorship care plan. Share this information with any new healthcare providers you see. The plan should include the following information: {A list of all your healthcare providers {A diagnosis summary with specifics such as the subtype and/or genetic markers {A treatment summary with specifics such as the names, dates, and dosages of chemotherapy or other drugs, site of radiation treatment, surgery and/or transplantation information, response to treatment, and side effects {Maintenance treatment information, if applicable {A list of possible late effects {A schedule for ongoing monitoring with recommended tests, frequency and coordinating provider {Health and wellness recommendations, such as nutrition and exercise {Records of other disease screenings and vaccinations {Receive periodic screening and monitoring for skin, gastrointestinal, kidney, blood, bladder, prostate, breast, lung, head and neck cancers, as well as other types of cancer because of the increased risk of a second cancer that is associated with AML and its treatment. {Seek medical and psychosocial support for fatigue, depression and other long-term effects, if needed. {Consider cancer risk-reduction strategies, such as stopping smoking, skin protection against prolonged sun exposure, healthy eating and exercising. You may experience difficulties when you return to your daily routines after a long period of treatment. Getting support throughout this time, and using it for as long as needed, is important.

Some treatments for AML can cause significant long-term or late effects. Long-term effects of cancer treatment are medical problems that last for months or years after treatment ends. Late effects are medical problems that do not appear until years, or even decades, after treatment ends. People who have been treated for AML may be at increased risk for heart damage, other cancers and neurologic or cognitive problems. They should be seen by a primary care doctor for general health examinations at least once a year and should also be examined regularly by an oncologist. It is important to know about the potential for long-term effects of treatment so that any problems can be identified early and managed. Various factors can influence the patient's risk of developing long-term or late effects, including their: {Type and duration of treatment {Age at the time of treatment {Gender {Overall health Many AML patients are treated with an anthracycline, such as daunorubicin. Anthracyclines have been associated with increased risk for heart muscle injury or chronic heart failure. However, heart disease may not become apparent until many years after treatment ends. Certain long-term and late effects have been associated with stem cell transplantation. These include infertility, thyroid dysfunction, chronic fatigue, and risk for developing a secondary cancer (although the number of patients who develop a secondary cancer is small). These and other possible long-term and late effects can be managed. For more information, visit www.LLS.org/survivorshipworkbook. Each workbook has information about long-term and late effects of blood cancer treatment. Talk to your doctor about: {Possible long-term and late effects follow-up care Treatment Outcomes AML is a difficult disease to cure. Just a few decades ago, almost no adults with AML could be cured. However, today, advances in understanding of the genetic features of the disease and the use of targeted therapies have resulted in improved remission and cure rates for AML patients.42 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Incidence, Causes and Risk Factors Incidence. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Older people are more likely than younger adults or children to develop AML. See Figure 4 below. Figure 4. AML: Age-Specific Incidence Rates 2014-2018 051015202530 28.5 26.2 23.6 17.6 12.1 7.7 5.0 1.6 1.3 1.1 1.2 0.9 0.8 0.4 1.0 shows 5-year age intervals. The vertical axis shows the frequency of new cases of AML per 100,000 people, by age-group. Source: SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2018. National Cancer Institute; 2021. Causes and Risk Factors. Although in most cases it is not clear what causes the genetic changes that lead to AML, there are some known risk factors. A \"risk factor\" is anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease. However, having a risk factor does not mean that a person will develop the disease. Some people with several risk factors never develop a disease, while others with no known risk factors may develop the disease. AML is not contagious. The factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing AML include: {Age. The risk of developing AML increases with age. While AML can occur at any age, it typically affects older adults. The risk for developing AML increases about 9-fold from aged 30 to 34 years (1.3 cases per 100,000 people) to ages 65 to 69 years (about 12.1 cases per 100,000 people). The risk continues increasing with incidence peaking in people between the ages of 80 and 84 years (28.5 cases per 100,000 people). See Figure 4 above. {Sex. Males are more likely than females to develop AML. {Exposure to dangerous chemicals. Long-term exposure to high levels of certain chemicals, such as benzene, is linked to a greater risk of AML. Although benzene is found in certain industrial settings, strict regulation of its use has decreased benzene exposure in the workplace. {Smoking. AML is linked to exposure to tobacco smoke, which contains benzene and other cancer-causing substances. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, half of the total exposure to benzene in humans in the United States comes from cigarette smoke. This is true Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 43 despite the fact that petroleum products contribute to most of the benzene in the atmosphere. {Previous cancer treatment. People who received radiation therapy or chemotherapy (especially with platinum drugs, alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and busulfan, or topoisomerase II inhibitors such as etoposide and doxorubicin) have an increased risk of developing AML. When AML develops as a result of treatment for another disease in the past, it is often called \"treatment-related\" or \"therapy-related\" AML. {Exposure to very high doses of radiation. People exposed to very high levels of radiation are at increased risk of developing AML (for example, survivors of an atomic bomb blast or a nuclear reactor accident). {Other blood cancers. People who have certain blood disorders are at greater risk of developing AML. These include myeloproliferative neoplasms (polycythemia myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which in some people can evolve over time into AML. {Genetic disorders. Certain genetic conditions, present at birth, seem to increase the risk of AML, including: {Down syndrome {Neurofibromatosis type syndrome {Familial risk/germline predisposition. Certain gene mutations, present at birth, may increase the risk of developing AML.44 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org Drug Name Type of Drug AdministrationFDA-Approved Indications All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA, Tretinoin, Vesanoid\u00ae) Chemotherapy OralIs indicated for the induction of remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the PML/RAR gene who are refractory to, or who have relapsed from, anthracycline chemotherapy, or for whom anthracycline-based newly-diagnosed low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) whose APL is characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR gene expression. {For induction of remission and consolidation in patients with APL who are refractory to, or have relapsed from, retinoid and anthracycline chemotherapy, and whose APL is characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR gene expression.

Normal Blood and Bone Marrow Blood. Blood is the liquid that flows through a person's arteries and veins. It carries oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. It also carries away waste products. Blood is composed of proteins within a liquid called \"plasma,\" as well as cells, such as red blood cells. Plasma. Plasma is largely made up of water, in which many chemicals are dissolved. These chemicals each have a special role. Factors found in plasma include: {Proteins {Albumin, the most common blood protein {Blood-clotting proteins (coagulation factors) made by the liver {Erythropoietin, a protein made by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production {Immunoglobulins, proteins that help the body fight infection {Hormones, such as thyroid hormone and cortisol {Minerals, such as iron and magnesium {Vitamins, such as folate (B9) and vitamin B12 {Electrolytes, such as calcium, potassium and sodium Blood Cells. Blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, a spongy tissue where blood cells grow and develop. Blood cells start as stem cells. The process of stem cells maturing into blood cells is called \"hematopoiesis.\" The blood cells are suspended in the plasma. See Figure 5 on page 49. Once the stem cell is created, it will develop into one of the three types of blood cells: 1. Red blood cells (RBCs) are the cells that carry oxygen. These cells: {Make up a little less than half of the body's total blood volume. 48 I 800.955.4572 I www.LLS.org {Are filled with hemoglobin, the protein that picks up oxygen from the lungs and takes it around the body. It binds with carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and removes it from the cells and then brings it back to the lungs. When a person exhales (breathes out), the CO2 is removed from the lungs. 2. Platelets (the cells that help blood to clot) {These are small cells (one-tenth the size of RBCs). {They help stop bleeding from an injury or cut. {They stick to the torn surface of the vessel, clump together and plug up the bleeding site. They form a clot with the help of proteins, such as fibrin, and electrolytes, such as calcium. 3. White blood cells (WBCs) are the cells that fight infections. They include: {Neutrophils and monocytes. These cells, called \"phagocytes,\" ingest and destroy bacteria and fungi. Unlike RBCs and platelets, monocytes can leave the bloodstream and enter tissues to attack invading organisms and fight off infection. {Eosinophils and basophils. These WBCs respond to allergens or parasites. {Lymphocytes. These WBCs, found mostly in the lymph nodes, spleen and lymphatic channels, are a key part of the immune system. Some enter the bloodstream. There are three major types of lymphocytes: * T lymphocytes (T cells) * B lymphocytes (B cells) * Natural killer cells (NK cells) Bone Marrow. In healthy people, stem cells in the bone marrow produce new blood cells continuously. When blood cells are fully developed, they enter the bloodstream as it passes through the bone marrow and then circulates throughout the body. In babies, all bones have active marrow. By the time a person reaches young adulthood, the bones of the hands, feet, arms and legs no longer have blood-forming bone marrow. In adults, marrow is only found in the spine (vertebrae), hip and shoulder bones, ribs, breastbone and skull. Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the marrow and have the ability to form the different mature blood cells found in circulation. These stem cells are important because they can be used for transplants. Some stem cells enter the bloodstream and circulate. Doctors know how to stimulate the growth of these cells in the marrow and make them migrate into the bloodstream. Then a special technique called \"apheresis\" is used to separate them from the circulating blood so they can be collected and stored. Stem cells from the placenta and the umbilical cord of a newborn infant can also be harvested and used for future transplantation. Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Adults I 49 Figure 5. Blood Cell & Lymphocyte Development Most blood cells start as hematopoietic (blood) stem cells in the bone marrow. Hematopoietic stem cells are the most immature blood-forming cells. They must mature (go through many stages) to become a red blood cell, white blood cell or platelet. Some blood cells mature in the bone marrow. Other blood cells leave the bone marrow and travel to other parts of the body to develop into mature blood cells.
