Under the eNLC, nurses are able to provide care to patients in other eNLC states, without having to obtain additional licenses. Nurses with an original NLC multistate license will be grandfathered into the eNLC. In 2014, the BON executive officers convened a summit to update and enhance the NLC. The newly enhanced compact or eNLC was approved by the BONs on May 4, 2015, as a licensure model of the future. It replaces the original NLC and adds extra protections. The original NLC states are currently enacting state legislation enabling them to transition into the eNLC. New states, not previously members of the original NLC, are also enacting state legislation to become members of the eNLC. The Iowa Board of Nursing is in favor of requiring a nurse who has not held an active license in any jurisdiction within the previous five years of the date of application for endorsement, reactivation or reinstatement, to complete a nurse refresher course. This requirement is intended to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The Iowa Board of Nursing will require the nurse refresher course to have a theory component and a clinical component. The nurse must complete the course before they will be issued a license.

The following scenarios and information provided by the eNLC Commission and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the eNLC! A nurse currently holding an active Iowa multistate license will be grandfathered into the eNLC; however, if you move to another state that is a member of the eNLC, you will need to meet the Uniform Licensing Requirements (ULRs) to obtain a multistate license. Likewise, all nurses applying for licensure and declaring Iowa their state of residency will need to meet the ULRs. A nurse who does not meet the ULRs may be issued a single state license.A nurse currently holding an active Iowa multistate license may practice in the following states: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida (new to compact), Georgia (new to compact), Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Main, Maryland, Mississippi, Missiouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia (new to compact), Wisconsin, Wyoming (new to compact). As with the original Nurse Licensure Compact, if you practice in other states on your multistate license, you must adhere to the laws and regulations of the state where the patient is located.

Given the changing landscape of marijuana, including the legalization of recreational marijuana in some states, we want to ensure licensees understand how the use of recreational marijuana may impact their Iowa nursing license. Recreational marijuana remains illegal under federal law and under Iowa law. Use of recreational marijuana, regardless of the location of use, may result in disciplinary action against your Iowa nursing license or privilege to practice. Note that employers and potential employers frequently forward the results of positive drug screens to state licensing boards in states where you have a nursing license. When we receive such a report, a complaint may be opened, even if a positive drug screen was the result of your use of recreational marijuana in a state where recreational marijuana is legal. We encourage all nurses to think about the potential consequences of using recreational marijuana prior to engaging in such conduct.A NOTE FROM THE BOARD page 9CONTINUING EDUCATION RULE CHANGES - EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 By Laura Hudson, Associate Director - Continuing Education/W orkforce The Iowa Board of Nursing, on July 11, 2017, adopted new continuing education rules applicable to all Iowa licensed nurses and Iowa board approved providers of nursing continuing education. Changes to the Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) 655 Chapter 5, Continuing Education chapter became effective January 1, 2018. The new rules may be found at this link: bit.ly/Iowa-Legislature-Rule-Listings. This information was first announced in the November, December 2017, January 2018 edition of the Nursing Newsletter. The following table summarizes the changes and pertinent details for nurse licensees: TOPIC RATIONALE The Iowa Board of Nursing and staff recognizes the chapter 5 changes will require a period of transition and education. W e are committed to working with all parties to assure the new rules are followed and met. If you have questions, please email laura.hudson@iowa.gov. page 10Definitions section Contact hour change from 50 to 60 minutes Contact hours are defined in both the approved provider and licensee sections of the rules Requirement that all licensees (e.g. 2 or 3 year license) need to have 36 contact hours of CE Requirement to Reactivate Licenses CE credit may be earned through the entire renewal period Clarified and added definitions for better descriptions of concepts. This change brings Iowa rules in line with the American Nurses Credentialing Center's (ANCC) unit of measurement. ANCC is an exemplar agency from which the IBON rules were developed. Effective 1/1/2018, Iowa approved providers of nursing continuing education (CE) will award one contact hour for 60 minutes of instruction. Licensees should count the hours on all certificates of completion for the value issued on the certificate prior to and after 1/1/2018. Adding the contact hour measurement to both sets of rules clarifies it for all audiences. The term \"CEU\" will not be used by Iowa providers to award credit. Approved providers will award contact hours. However, licensees will still be able to use certificates with the term \"CEU\" listed that were earned prior to the rule change. Eliminates the confusion of 24 contact hours for the first licensure period and then 36 contact hours for all subsequent renewals. Effective 1/1/2018, all licensees need 36 contact hours of CE to renew. Licensees, audit staff, enforcement staff, providers, and educators will find this continuity easier to remember and follow. To reactivate an Iowa nurse license, 36 contact hours of continuing education, taken within the previous 36 months, must be documented and submitted along with other reactivation paperwork. Licensees have their full renewal period to complete CE requirements. The law still requires licensees to have all CE done before renewing one's license. No carry over credits are allowed to the next license renewal period. RESOURCES: American Nurses Credentialing Center. (2015). 2015 ANCC Primary Accreditation Approver Application Manual. Silver Spring, MD: American Nurses Credentialing Center.TOPIC RATIONALE page 11Expanded the list of acceptable approved providers Added that ANCC providers without Iowa approval may offer coursework in Iowa without co-sponsorship of an Iowa approved provider Removed the restriction that webinars from out of state must be co-sponsored by Iowa approved providers Provided specific lists of acceptable courses and certifications by which to earn CE Increases the agencies from which licensees may earn their CE credit. Awarding of credit is no longer limited to Iowa-only agencies. See the 655 IAC chapter 5 rule for what is allowed. Licensees may earn credit for precepting other nurses. Please work with your education department to document the time you spend as a preceptor. The rules are specific about the requirements. Licensees who take part in a nurse residency program may use completion of the residency program towards license renewal requirements. A certificate of completion of a residency course is required for documentation. Licensees who hold certification for a practice role may use their certification documentation for their license renewal. The certification must be current at the time of license renewal. (Note: An ACLS class is not a practice role certification. An example of a practice role certification is Med/Surg Certified Nurse, Emergency Room Certified Nurse, Wound/Ostomy Certified Nurse, Nurse Educator Certified, etc.). Most ANCC certification requirements are extensive. By accepting current certifications related to practice roles, the Board believes these adequately meet the CE requirements of the law. This change removes the restrictions that out-of-state providers who are approved by ANCC also need to go through the steps of finding an Iowa approved provider to hold coursework in the state. Iowa nurse licensees will now be able to count their ANCC credits, earned in Iowa, towards their license renewal. This will also simplify and improve the audit process. Providers who are ANCC certified should still work with Iowa BON providers to arrange for courses that will be held in Iowa facilities. With internet access the norm, instead of the exception, this change brings the rules in line with acceptable CE delivery methods and allows ANCC providers approved in other states to offer CE credits to Iowa nurses. Additionally, any webinars that are approved by other boards of nursing in other mandatory CE states may also be used by Iowa licensees towards license renewal requirements. Removed basic life support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from acceptable courses to earn CE. BLS and CPR are seen as basic training. CE content should be education that is above that learned in basic nursing training. Advanced life-saving courses may be offered for nursing CE, at the approved provider's discretion. Licensees should check with their education departments to see what will be offered for credit. The Iowa Board of Nursing is in favor of requiring a nurse who has not held an active license in any jurisdiction within the previous five years of the date of application for endorsement, reactivation or reinstatement, to complete a nurse refresher course.This requirement is intended to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The Iowa Board of Nursing will require the nurse refresher course to have a theory component and a clinical component. The nurse must complete the course before they will be issued a license. In order for a nurse, who does not hold an active Iowa license, to complete the clinical component of a nurse refresher course they must have authority to practice nursing in a clinical setting. The proposed legislation is an amendment to Iowa Code, Chapter 152.9 which would give the nurse authority to complete the clinical component of the nurse refresher course. Board staff is aware of 18 other states who require some type of course or remediation for nurses who have not held an active license for a certain period of time. Rules will be promulgated in the future to address the requirements of the Nurse Refresher Course once the proposed legislation has been passed. Proposed legislation is as follows:152.9A Limited nursing authorization. The board may issue a limited authorization to a nurse to complete the clinical component of a nurse refresher course. The board shall determine the length of time a limited nursing authorization shall remain effective. Speak to your legislator concerning the passage of 152.9A. Passage of this legislation will assist the nursing profession in promoting competent nursing practice while protecting the public.

Watch the news, pay attention to the Iowa Legislature website ( www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation), check with your professional association, and watch the Board of Nursing's website (nursing.iowa.gov - What's New) for bills of interest to nurses and other healthcare professionals. The topics of prescribing opioids safely, Iowa's Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP), mental health and substance abuse are just a few areas where legislation will be introduced this session. Nurses should take an active role in the legislative process. Find your legislator at this site: www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find. When you see something that impacts your work and your patients/clients, let your legislators know how you feel about the topic! page 12IV THERAPY SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSESNEW ENHANCED NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT CHANGES FOR NURSES WITH CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS Amendments to Iowa Administrative Code, Chapter 6 \"Nursing Practice for Registered Nurses/Licensed Practical Nurses\" went into effect in 2011. The amendments revised the limited and expanded intravenous therapy scope of practice for the Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). Limited scope of practice of intravenous therapy may include: \u00b7 Addition of intravenous solutions without adding medications to established peripheral intravenous sites. \u00b7 Regulation of the rate of non-medicated intravenous solutions to established peripheral intravenous sites. \u00b7 Administration of maintenance doses of analgesics via the patient-controlled analgesia pump set at a lock-out interval to established peripheral intravenous sites. \u00b7 Discontinuation of peripheral intravenous therapy, and \u00b7 Administration of a prefilled heparin or saline syringe flush, prepackaged by the manufacturer or premixed and labeled by a registered pharmacist or registered nurse, to an established peripheral lock, in a licensed hospital, a nursing facility or a certified end-stage renal dialysis unit. A Licensed Practical Nurse working in an Iowa healthcare facility and practicing the expanded intravenous therapy must complete the Iowa Board of Nursing approved expanded intravenous therapy course. At this time, there are two courses that provide content on the expanded intravenous therapy scope of practice for the LPN. These are available in some Iowa community colleges. Course one has been developed for the LPN taking the course for the first time. This course incorporates content covering intravenous therapy via a peripheral intravenous catheter, midline catheter, and PICC line. Course two has been developed for the LPN who has taken the initial course prior to the revisions made in 2011. This course includes content in the management of intravenous therapy via a midline catheter and PICC line. Please note that these courses must be offered by an approved Iowa Board of Nursing provider of nursing continuing education. For additional information on the limited and expanded intravenous therapy scope of practice for the LPN, please visit the Iowa Board of Nursing website under Iowa Law and Administrative Rules.On July 20, 2017, the new Enhanced Nurse Licensure Compact was passed in Iowa. The new compact states that any nurse who has been convicted of, or found guilty of any felony, may not have a multi-state license, unless that felony has been deferred, expunged, or otherwise disposed in a way in which it is no longer considered a conviction. The new compact also states that any nurse who has been convicted of, or found guilty of, a misdemeanor that the Board has determined is related to the practice of nursing, may also not possess a multi-state license, unless it was deferred, expunged or otherwise disposed of so as to not be considered a conviction. Nurses whose criminal convictions were already reviewed by the Board before July 20, 2017, may consider themselves \"grandfathered\" by the old review standards and retain a multi-state license, unless their license is revoked, surrendered, or becomes inactive. Under these circumstances they will need to have their criminal convictions reviewed again as part of the licensure process, and crimes that may have been grandfathered may now prevent them from holding a multi-state license. An exception to these crimes preventing a licensee from holding a multi-state license is if the licensee can supply official court documentation showing the crimes in question were deferred, expunged or otherwise disposed as a non-conviction. Proof of this should allow the licensee to maintain their multi-state privilege. It is the licensee's responsibility to provide this documentation, and their license will be single state until the Board receives and reviews it. Any felony conviction after July 20, 2017, that does not receive a deferred judgment or other non-conviction disposition will prevent a license from holding a multi-state license. Any misdemeanor conviction received after July 20, 2017, that does not receive a deferred judgment or other non-conviction disposition may prevent someone from receiving a multi-state license if the Board determines the misdemeanor is related to the practice of nursing. Crimes are reviewed on a case by case basis after all the needed information has been provided. If you have any questions about this please call our office at 515-281-3255 and ask to speak to someone in Enforcement. page 13As a licensed nurse you are responsible for following the law, rules and regulations which govern your profession. The following are reminders of what you need to do to retain your license and suggestions to involve yourself in the nursing profession. 1. Routinely check your wallet card or the Online Verification System to determine your license expiration date. 2. A licensee may renew a license beginning 60 days prior to the license expiration date on their wallet card.3. At the time of renewal make sure you have completed your continuing education requirements.4. For renewal of a three year license, the requirement is 36 contact hours of continuing education.5. For renewal of a license that has been issued for less than three years, the requirement is 36 contact hours of continuing education. 6. Maintain records of the continuing education you have received in your licensing cycle. 7. If you are chosen for a random audit of your continuing education, complete the audit following the directions. 8. Do you regularly examine, attend, counsel or treat dependent adults or children in Iowa? If the answer is yes, have you completed the Mandatory Training course for dependent adults and children within the last 5 years? This course must be completed every 5 years. 9. At the time of initial licensure or renewal, answer all questions honestly, specifically relating to your continuing education and criminal history. 10. Does the board office have your current address on file? If not, submit your current address in writing to the board office or submit by email. 11. Do you know the address for the Iowa Board of Nursing's website? It's nursing.iowa.gov . Mark it as a favorite and refer to it often!12. Do you know where to find the Iowa Administrative Rules for nursing, 655IAC? 13. Do you know who your legislator is?14. Have you explored the option of joining a professional nursing organization and asked yourself how you can become involved in your profession? 15. Become familiar with the rules of the Nurse Licensure Compact. Do you know what is meant by your Primary State of Residence? 16. Board staff is here to help answer your questions, it is always better to ask than to assume you have the correct answer. The main number to the board office is 515-281-3255. Specific to the Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP): 1. ARNPs must hold an active RN license. 2. For an Iowa ARNP license you must submit a copy of current certification card from the applicable national certifying body and documentation of your RN license if from another compact state. 3. The continuing education required by the national certifying body is deemed to meet the continuing education requirement mandated by law for license renewal. Documentation of current certification in itself verifies compliance. 4. ARNP's who regularly examine, attend, counsel or treat children or adults in Iowa are required to complete the Mandatory Training course for dependent adults and children every 5 years. In summary, nurses are accountable and responsible to follow the rules and regulations which govern their licensure and practice. I encourage you to stay informed and to follow the steps necessary to continue your nursing practice.

Otherwise, all license related processes begin with user registration, including updating contact, employment or educational information. Secured Access and ordering a roster also require the visitor to register. The main menu displays the following option: If you click on \"Create a New Account,\" you will be taken directly to the registration page and tab that you need in order to register: This registration site is maintained by the state's technology division as a global login for the entire state enterprise. Enter your first and last name: The registration automatically combines first and last names into a suggested user i.d., and appends \"@iowaid.\" But if the first name/last name combination already exists, the i.d. field will appear blank, and you will need to create your own account i.d. In either case, anything can be substituted ahead of the \"@\", but the i.d. that is created is permanent so it will need to be memorable. Enter your email address twice in the screen pictured above, and click \"Save Account Details.\" A popup box gives a final caution. If you created an i.d. with your first name.lastname as your i.d., and someone else with the same first and last name has already registered to do any kind of business with the State of Iowa, you will receive the following error message.After successfully selecting an i.d., entering the email address twice and clicking \"continue,\" you will see the following screen advising you that an email has been sent with information to complete the registration. Note that there is a time limit of 48 hours to complete the registration. The email will include a link to come back to the registration site. This is done as verification that the email address is a real one. Clicking the link in the email returns the user to the following screen at the EAA website to complete the registration by selecting security questions and answers. The next screen requires the user to create their password: The registration is complete, and the user is taken to the screen where they can actually log in. Note that the above registration process should only be required once. Thereafter, the licensee would use the existing account. Also note that on most screens there is a \"Help\" button. This will take you to a help library maintained by the state's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), and may take you to the relevant portion of an extended FAQ system. It is only on the login screen itself, that you will find a link to report an issue to the OCIO Help Desk.
