Read on for guidance on how to protect yourself and others. Prevention Vaccination - Students, faculty, and staff who provide patient-facing health care must provide documentation of a COVID-19 primary series and a booster or obtain a religious or medical accommodation. - Tufts recommends that all faculty, staff, students, vendors, and affiliates review CDC [COVID-19 vaccine guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)and discuss with their health care provider the benefits of remaining up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters. - Review the university's complete [COVID-19 vaccination policies and requirements.](https://healthy-tufts-covid.pantheonsite.io/public-health/vaccination-policies) Masking Tufts suggests wearing KN95 masks indoors as an effective strategy to prevent transmission of respiratory illness, including COVID-19. - To protect our patients who may be vulnerable, masking is required in all health care settings, including designated areas of the School of Dental Medicine, Student Health Service, the Counseling and Mental Health Center, and Tufts Occupational Health Services (OHS). - Masks are available at pharmacies and online. - Additional information on the use of masks can be found on the [CDC's website](https://t.e2ma.net/click/7w2xxd/jeobk71/rkix0n).

COVID-19 VACCINE FAQs Patient-facing faculty and staff, as defined above, who do not provide a record of having received a COVID-19 primary series and a booster (or if previously unvaccinated, one bivalent dose) or obtained a religious or medical accommodation, will not be allowed to work in-person on campus. Managers will work with Human Resources and those not in compliance to determine if other work arrangements are possible, as identified in the Flexible Work Options Policy. However, if the job function requires the employee to work on-site, further action for non-compliance will be taken. This may include unpaid leave, suspension or other discipline, up to and including termination. If you have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine, you can contact [Student Health Service](https://students.tufts.edu/health-wellness/medical-services/about-health-service), [Occupational Health Services](https://ohs.tufts.edu/), or your PCP. If you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency, call 9-1-1. If you have symptoms that need evaluation during non-office hours and do not have other options, you should go to the nearest emergency room.
