We already know meditation offers a multitude of benefits for your mind, body, and spirit. But on those especially chaotic days, it can be hard to unwind and destress. When you find yourself struggling to have a deep and meaningful meditation, look to crystals to provide some assistance. Since ancient times, crystals have been regarded for their powerful energies and healing properties. Crystals and stones are used to balance your chakras, which are the energy centers within your body. The 7 body chakras are: the root chakra, the sacral chakra, the solar plexus chakra, the heart chakra, the throat chakra, the third eye chakra, and the crown chakra. When meditating, you are cleansing and activating the energies of these pathways, which is important for your physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. Using crystals during meditation helps to enhance these benefits. The crystalline structure of certain gemstones amplify your healing intentions and rebalance the energies of each chakra. Best Crystals for Meditation Amethyst A highly regarded spiritual stone, amethyst is known as the \"All Purpose Stone.\" Associated with the energies of the crown and third eye chakras, amethyst is used for many different reasons. In meditation, amethyst allows us to achieve deeper intuitive insights. Amethyst has a calming energy that helps to reduce stress and clear the mind, which is very powerful during meditation. Quartz Quartz is one of the most powerful meditation crystals because it amplifies the energy of other surrounding crystals. Known as the \"Master Healer,\" quartz crystals help heal energy blockages and dispel unwanted energy within the mind, body, and spirit. Clear quartz is known to bring clarity to the mind, helping you to become more focused. Rose quartz lowers stress and tension, opening your heart to love and dispelling feelings of anger, jealousy, and resentment. Smoky quartz is used to ward off anxiety and negative thinking. Clear and rose quartz are associated with the higher chakras, while smoky quartz resonates with the root chakra. When in need of a quick recharge, simply sit quietly with two quartz towers. Hold one in your left had pointing inwards and one in the right hand pointing outwards. This creates an energy circuit and allows energies to flow freely within you. Black Tourmaline Black tourmaline is a protection stone that transforms negative energy into positive energy. This particular stone is commonly associated with the root chakra due to its grounding properties; however, black tourmaline can be used to balance all of the chakras. If you're looking for a double whammy, check out black tourmalated quartz, like the one pictured below. You receive the energy of black tourmaline and quartz all in one stone. Labradorite In connection with the throat chakra, labradorite is used during meditation to calm the mind and stimulate the imagination. This creates the perfect state of mind for creativity and new ideas to flow. Labradorite is also known to enhance your consciousness, stimulating your inner awareness to help you unfold your true purpose and destiny. Carnelian Associated with the sacral chakra, carnelian is known as the \"Stone of Motivation.\" When meditating, carnelian keeps you motivated, inspired and confident. Its energy instills perseverance and positivity, eliminating impure energies and the feeling of being \"stuck.\" Carnelian harnesses an empowering force that enables you to move forward during tough situations. How to Meditate with Crystals There is no right or wrong way to meditate with crystals. Some ideas include holding crystals in your hands, laying stones around your body, placing stones directly on your chakras, and creating a crystal grid. If you find a practice that is most comfortable and beneficial for you, stick with it. For additional therapeutic benefits, try burning incense, palo santo (pictured above), or sage during your meditation practice. Inhale positivity, exhale negativity, and allow the crystals to work their magic. Remember- crystals aren't absolutely necessary for successful meditation. They are simply a helpful resource to deepen your meditation and guide you into a more tranquil state of mind. It can't hurt to "}
