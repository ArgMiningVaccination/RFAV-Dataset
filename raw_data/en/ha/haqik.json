Other types of treatment should not replace these medicines if you are going to try them.| Some people have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the placebo effect. Some complementary therapies don't attempt to treat the disease itself, but they affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier, which may not be a bad thing. Whatever you do, if you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. We are not trying to influence your choice, but rather we want you to be careful and make and informed decision. Talk to your doctor about if it's safe, if it works, its cost and if it will improve your general health. You may be tempted to jump at the promise of an effective treatment, just be cautious about trying any unproven treatments. Just remember Snake Oil and its promise that it could treat or cure anything. There are some out there that will say that their product will do anything, but always look out for yourself and get the proof. The [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)](https://nccih.nih.gov/), a part of the [ National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/), defines Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine Medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) degrees and by their allied health professionals such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Conventional medicine, which is also called Western or allopathic medicine, is medicine that is practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) and D.O. ( doctor of osteopathic medicine Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.s) are fully licensed physicians and provide a full range of services, from prescribing drugs to performing surgery, and have a \"whole person\" approach to health care. D.O.s focus special attention on the musculoskeletal system, a system of bones and muscles. ) degrees and by allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. The boundaries between CAM and conventional medicine are not absolute, and specific CAM practices may, over time, become widely accepted. \"Complementary medicine\" refers to use of CAM together with conventional medicine, such as using acupuncture in addition to usual care to help lessen pain. Most use of CAM by Americans is complementary. \"Alternative medicine\" refers to use of CAM in place of conventional medicine. \"Integrative medicine\" (also called integrated medicine) refers to a practice that combines both conventional and CAM treatments for which there is evidence of safety and effectiveness. CAM practices are often grouped into broad categories, such as natural products, mind-body medicine, and manipulative and body-based practices. Although these categories are not formally defined, they are useful for discussing CAM practices. Some CAM practices may fit into more than one category. | | | Types of Complementary and Alternative Medicine: | | | Natural Products This area of CAM includes use of a variety of herbal medicines (also known as botanicals), vitamins, minerals, and other \"natural products.\" Many are sold over the counter as dietary supplements. (Some uses of dietary supplements\u2014e.g., taking a multivitamin to meet minimum daily nutritional requirements or taking calcium to promote bone health\u2014are not thought of as CAM.) Mind-Body Medicine Mind-body practices focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior, with the intent to use the mind to affect physical functioning and promote health. Many CAM practices embody this concept\u2014in different ways. Meditation and acupuncture would fall into this category. Manipulative and Body-Based Practices Manipulative and body-based practices focus primarily on the structures and systems of the body, including the bones and joints, soft tissues, and circulatory and lymphatic systems. Two commonly used therapies fall within this category: Spinal manipulation and massage therapy. Other CAM Practices CAM also encompasses movement therapies\u2014a broad range of Eastern and Western movement-based approaches used to promote physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. | A More Natural Way| As with all diseases or conditions, many people feel that they would like their treatment to be more natural or homeopathic. The majority of these methods are accepted and often agreed upon by the main-stream community. These alternative methods, however, must be discussed with your doctor prior to starting any of them. Some of these methods involve simply taking vitamins and minerals, which many people do to supplement what they eat. A proper supply of daily vitamins and minerals are an important part of your nutritional needs. It's important that you maintain your mind as well as your body and there are many methods to take care of these. From meditation to other relaxation techniques, it's a good way to get away from all that is around you and try to calm yourself down. Letting go of all the extra things in your mind and focusing on the ones that are truly important is a good way to obtain a bit of \"peace\" in your life. Activities such as yoga and Tai Chi not only relax your mind, but also help strengthen your body. The slow methodical movements will stretch out some spasticity and will also help strengthen your muscles. Exercise is an important part of everyone's life no matter how little you may be able to do. | | | | | Complementary and Alternative Medicine | | | | ||Acupuncture & Acupressure | | ||Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs | | ||Marijuana | | | | Physical and Mental Well-Being | | | | ||Reducing Stress Methods | | ||Relaxation Techniques | | ||Meditation | | ||Tai Chi | | ||Yoga | Medical Marijuana Herbs are also used and the one that might grab your attention is the use of medical marijuana or cannabis. We must emphasize strongly that the legality of this varies from state to state. As of June 2016, 25 states and Washington D.C. have legalized cannabis for medical use as voter or legislative driven initiatives bypassing the normal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) testing for safety and efficacy. As of May 2016, 3 states have pending legislation or ballot measures. There is also considerable variation in medical marijuana laws from state to state. In the United States, there are important legal differences between medical cannabis at the federal and state levels. At the federal level, cannabis per se has been made criminal by implementation of the Controlled Substances Act, but as of 2009, new federal guidelines have been enacted. According to U.S. Attorney General has stated that it \"will not be a priority to use federal resources to prosecute patients with serious illnesses or their caregivers who are complying with state laws on medical marijuana, but we will not tolerate drug traffickers who hide behind claims of compliance with state law to mask activities that are clearly illegal.\" With all of the legalities placed aside, it has been suggested that it helps to alleviate spasticity, pain, and tremors for those with MS. These claims, however, have not been tested using all acceptable clinical trial methods. If you choose any alternative method of treatment, remember that it's your decision, but you need to inform your doctor whether or not you have his or her consent to use what ever it may be. Again, we can't advocate the use of any substances or methods that have not been full tested. There might be a few volunteers that will gladly line up for this one. As with anything, there are risks involved with taking medical marijuana. Some short-term side effects may include an increased heart rate, slower reaction time, coordination and balance problems, dizziness, dry mouth, and sleepiness. As for some of the possible long-term risks, they may include trouble doing complex thinking, anxiety, and mood swings. Vitamin D Biochemistry shows that Vitamin D appears to be an essential component to how people heal from the inflammation injury of MS. Measurements of Vitamin D in MS patients statistically are significantly lower than patients without MS. It's believed that low levels of this don't cause MS, but could reduce the resistance to MS. There have been no conclusions as of yet stating that anyone with MS should take Vitamin D as a treatment, but rather everybody should be sure to consume it along with all of their necessary vitamins and daily supplements. If its effectiveness is determined for MS, then it would be specifically encouraged as a treatment. Many experts have different opinions about the use of Vitamin D. Some say go ahead and take a reasonable amount, since it won't hurt you. It's generally recommended to keep the dosage under 10,000 IU a day since supplements with high dosage levels can be risky. Omega-3 Omega-3 fatty acids, commonly found in fish oils, have been associated with anti-inflammatory antioxidant properties. Cytokines are circulating proteins that are associated with inflammation. Omega-3 as a dietary supplement has been found to suppress the cytokines, reducing inflammation. The Bee That Stings There is also another therapy worth mentioning that has had some popularity, and that is the process of allowing bee's to sting you. Bee venom therapy is used by some allowing a bee to sting them. It's felt by some that the venom can help ease their symptoms. Researchers feel that compounds in the venom, adolapin and melittin, will reduce pain, inflammation, muscle weakness, and assist with coordination. It's believed that is assists the body with the release of natural healing compounds. There, however, have not been any clinical studies done to verify any of the findings. Your doctor must be made aware if this is an option you wish to pursue. Diet Your diet can also have an impact on progression. Along with keeping your fat intake down dramatically, you should use natural fish oils such as cod liver oil in your diet. Some fish are a good low-fat source of protein and are also a heart health food. Dropping the saturated fats, animal fats, and hydrogenated oils out of your diet can have a significant impact on your overall health and possibly your MS health. A good well-balanced diet is always a better option for your body, but remember to discuss this with your doctor as well. Tea has also long been used as a medicinal herb since its beginnings in Asia over 3000 years ago. Since its discovery, green tea has become renowned for its pharmacological properties. While green tea is not classified as a medicine, it does contain medicinal substances. It is ranked as a leading health-giving substance in traditional Chinese medicine. Scientific research is now proving these benefits are due to the antioxidants present in green tea which have shown to be effective in a variety of areas. | A Note About Safety and Effectiveness | Rigorous, well-designed clinical trials for many CAM therapies are often lacking; therefore, the safety and effectiveness of many CAM therapies are uncertain. NCCAM is sponsoring research designed to fill this knowledge gap by building a scientific evidence base about CAM therapies\u2014whether they are safe; and whether they work for the conditions for which people use them and, if so, how they work. As with any medical treatment, there can be risks with CAM therapies. These general precautions can help to minimize risks: | ||Select CAM practitioners with care. Find out about the practitioner's training and experience. | | ||Be aware that some dietary supplements may interact with medications or other supplements, may have side effects of their own, or may contain potentially harmful ingredients not listed on the label. Also keep in mind that most supplements have not been tested in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or children. | | ||Tell all your health care providers about any complementary and alternative practices you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. For tips about talking with your health care providers about CAM, see |[NCCAM's Time to Talk campaign](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/decisions). | A Note About Government Regulation | Dietary Supplements The Federal Government regulates dietary supplements A product that contains vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, and/or other ingredients intended to supplement the diet. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has special labeling requirements for dietary supplements and treats them as foods, not drugs. . primarily through the FDA. The regulations for dietary supplements are not the same as those for prescription or over-the-counter drugs. In general, the regulations for dietary supplements are less strict; for example, a manufacturer does not have to prove the safety and effectiveness of a dietary supplement before it is marketed. Once a dietary supplement is on the market, the FDA monitors safety and product information (label claims and package inserts), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) monitors advertising. Practitioner-Based Therapies There is no standardized, national system for credentialing CAM practitioners. The extent and type of credentialing vary widely from state to state and from one CAM profession to another. For example, some CAM professions (e.g., chiropractic) are licensed in all or most states, although specific requirements for training, testing, and continuing education vary; other CAM professions are licensed in only a few states or not at all. | Plasma Exchange (Plasmapheresis) | | Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis, is a way to \"clean\" your blood and is similar to kidney dialysis. The treatment involves your plasma (the liquid part of your blood) which gets replaced with new plasma from a donor or with a plasma substitute.| There are some with MS that use plasma exchange to manage sudden or severe attacks (relapses). The thinking is that their plasma may have certain proteins that are attacking their own body. So when their \"bad\" plasma is removed, they will get rid of those \"bad\" proteins, and therefore their symptoms may get better. The side effects and/or risks during plasma exchange is that your blood pressure is lower than usual causing you feel weak, dizzy, or nauseous. It may also cause bleeding and allergic reactions, and it can make your chance of getting an infection higher. In rare cases, a blood clot could form in the machine. The Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the Academy of Neurology (AAN), reviewed the medical literature from 1995 through 2009 to reassess the role of this strategy for treating neurologic disorders, and revised the previous set of AAN guidelines to include recommendations for MS. [ The guidelines](http://www.neurology.org/content/76/3/294.full.pdf+html) recommend that clinicians consider using plasma exchange for a number of conditions for which it has been shown to be beneficial. In people with relapsing forms of MS, the guidelines suggest it may be effective as a secondary therapy for exacerbations that have not responded to treatment with corticosteroids. The guidelines say that plasma exchange may also be useful for severe, rapidly progressive MS and similar disorders (acute fulminant demyelinating CNS disease). The treatment was not found to be effective for progressive forms of MS. The vast majority of people experiencing acute attacks respond well to the standard high-dose corticosteroid treatment. According to the guidelines, plasma exchange should be considered a treatment alternative only for the few who do not, and only for a short time. | Gene therapy is an experimental way to treat some diseases without traditional drugs or surgery. It basically would replace a gene that doesn't work with one that does. A genetic mutation that confers a 70% chance of developing MS could point the way for new therapies.| Scientists from the University of British Columbia [ studied the DNA of hundreds of families affected by MS](http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)30126-X), finding two families and 11 individuals (seven with MS) who carried the mutation. Further studies in mice demonstrated that knocking out the function of the same gene, NR1H3, caused neurological problems and decreased myelin production. The mutation in NR1H3 - a simple one-letter type that completely alters the protein made by the gene - only occurs in 1 in 1,000 people with MS, leading some scientists to dispute how relevant this discovery will be for most patients. \"I would be very surprised if it turns out to be true,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Patsopoulos, a neurologist and MS geneticist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, [ speaking to STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/01/multiple-sclerosis-gene/). NR1H3 also has a role to play in the metabolism of blood lipids, like triglycerides and cholesterol, prime targets for current drug development. As a result, lead researcher Dr Carles Vilarino-Guell is optimistic that existing potential drugs could be repurposed and developed for MS therapy. \"These are still early days and there is a lot to test,\" said Dr Vilarino-Guell. \"But if we are able to repurpose some of these experimental drugs, it could shorten the time it takes to develop targeted MS treatments.\" The mutation found in NR1H3 consists of a one-letter \"misspelling,\" a biological typo sufficient to hobble the protein made by the gene. The protein is a transcription factor, the molecular equivalent of a 19th-century lamplighter who walked the streets turning gas lamps on. Transcription factors roam the genome turning genes on. NR1H3's transcription factor activates several genes, including those that control inflammation or are involved in other aspects of immunity. Without that activation, those genes stay as \"off\" as a gas lamp whose lighter is AWOL, with the result that inflammation runs amok and the immune system destroys myelin. The specific misspelling Vilari\u00f1o-G\u00fcell and his colleagues initially found in NR1H3 is present in only about 1 in 1,000 people with MS, however \u2014 raising doubts about how relevant it will be for most patients, cautioned Dr. Brian Weinshenker of the Mayo Clinic. \"It accounts for only a very, very small proportion of MS cases,\" he said. There are times when someone gets a disease because they were born with a \"faulty\" gene that doesn't make a specific protein the body needs. Gene therapy would allow a \"new correct\" gene into a person's DNA. It's thought that once the body has the protein that was missing, the disease will be fixed. Not that more difficult part is that gene therapy typically uses custom-made viruses to put the working gene into you. Just like every other virus, they work by infecting cells and slipping their own genetics into your DNA. This way it tricks the cell into becoming a virus \"good\" factory. "}
