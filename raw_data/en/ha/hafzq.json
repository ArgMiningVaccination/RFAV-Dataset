Despite tremendous advances in clinical care, there is currently no cure for AMD. This review aims to evaluate the published literature on the therapeutic roles of natural antioxidants in AMD. A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 2011 and 31 October 2021 was undertaken. A total of 82 preclinical and 18 clinical studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. We identified active compounds, carotenoids, extracts and polysaccharides, flavonoids, formulations, vitamins and whole foods with potential therapeutic roles in AMD. We evaluated the integral cellular signaling pathways including the activation of antioxidant pathways and angiogenesis pathways orchestrating their mode of action. In conclusion, we examined the therapeutic roles of natural antioxidants in AMD which warrant further study for application in clinical practice. Our current understanding is that natural antioxidants have the potential to improve or halt the progression of AMD, and tailoring therapeutics to the specific disease stages may be the key to preventing irreversible vision loss.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-01-14", "cleaned_text": "Discovering the Potential of Natural Antioxidants in Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15010101](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15010101) [Bioactive Compounds Foods with Pharmaceutical Interest 2022]( /journal/pharmaceuticals/special_issues/bio_plants )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. It was one of the major causes of blindness globally in 2020 [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] among individuals aged 50 and older, after cataract and glaucoma. The population-based longitudinal Beijing Eye Study revealed that visual impairment due to AMD was relatively uncommon in the adult Chinese population in rural and urban regions [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Disease (SEED) Study reported that the prevalence of early-stage AMD in Singapore was similar to that of Australia, although Singaporeans had a milder spectrum of early AMD lesions (soft distinct drusen and noncentral location) compared to Australians [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. According to a population-based cross-sectional study conducted by Cheung et al. [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], early-stage AMD is more common in Chinese and Indians than in Malays, whereas no apparent racial differences were observed in the prevalence of late-stage AMD. [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised on potential ocular complications and systemic side effects of these treatments. 1.1. Pathogenesis of AMD [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Oxidative damage and inflammation are the key features shared by these events, as well as the driving forces in the pathogenesis of AMD. This is supported by Abokyi et al. [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], who highlighted the central role of oxidative damage in the retina that contributes to inflammation and angiogenesis. [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], culminating in the breakdown of the blood-retina-barrier and retinal degeneration. These changes occur in the macula and proceed through various stages (early, intermediate and advanced) over time. [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The characteristic lesions are aggregations of lipid-containing extracellular particles in the RPE/BrM complex (drusen and basal deposits) that ultimately impact RPE and photoreceptor integrity. Drusens appear clinically as focal white-yellow deposits deep to the retina. They are divided into two main phenotypes, i.e., \"hard\" and \"soft\", that are discernible by their edges and the level of risk they confer on progression of AMD [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. 1.1.1. Features of Choroidal Neovascularization abnormal vascularization causing exudation in eyes with PCV is consistently observed between an elevated RPE and BrM. The clinical manifestation includes multiple recurrent serosanguineous or hemorrhagic detachment of RPE and retina, usually around the optic nerve or in the central macula. CNV is one of the leading causes of irreversible severe loss of vision among the elderly. In younger adults (age 50 years and below), CNV can be idiopathic or secondary to underlying hereditary and acquired conditions, including angioid streaks, high myopia, and traumatic or inflammatory disorders. Assessments of CNV involve imaging the macula with optical coherence RPE or retina, and/or disciform scars are typical findings [ [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. OCT is routinely used to assess the clinical response to anti-VEGF or PDT. [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-15-00101-f002)shows two representative eyes with and without clinically detected CNV. 1.1.2. Features of Geographic Atrophy [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. 1.2. Standard Treatment Options for Wet AMD [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Photodynamic therapy was first introduced in the late 1990s [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] and involves the intravenous administration of Verteporfin (a photosensitizing agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ophthalmic use) at a dose of 6 mg/m2 of body surface area. Verteporfin is then activated with a monochromatic laser light (range, 689-691 nm) in the presence of oxygen, which shifts it to an electronically excited state [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. This is followed by the generation of reactive oxygen radicals that cause local damage to the vascular endothelium to destroy new abnormal vessels. There have been major breakthroughs in the development of therapies targeting VEGF since the early 2000s. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF is performed using a 30-gauge needle at 3.5 to 4 mm posterior to the limbus under local anesthesia. The injection site is compressed by a cotton swab to avoid reflux [ [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The fundus is then examined to rule out any complications and to check the perfusion of the central retinal artery. The subsequent inhibition of VEGF blocks the formation of new abnormal vessels, resulting in vessels becoming porous, and in turn, ranibizumab has been shown to clinically improve visual acuity significantly [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The efficacy and safety of ranibizumab and PDT with verteporfin were evaluated in 423 patients with neovascular AMD in a phase III clinical trial: The Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ANCHOR). The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.3 or 0.5 mg of ranibizumab on a monthly basis or active verteporfin therapy administered intravenously at 3-month intervals for 12 months. The proportion of patients who gained 15 letters from baseline to 12 months in the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) test was 40.3%, 35.7%, and 5.6% in the 0.5 mg and 0.3 mg ranibizumab and verteporfin groups, respectively. The rates of serious adverse events after ranibizumab injections were reported to be low [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Combination therapy of ranibizumab and [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] or bevacizumab and PDT [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] has been found to be more effective than monotherapy. In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials conducted by Wei et al. [ [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], there were no statistically significant differences in the parameters of BCVA, central retinal thickness (CRT), proportions of patients gaining 15 letters, incidences of ocular and systemic adverse events between patients who received a combination of bevacizumab and PDT, and patients who were treated with bevacizumab monotherapy. However, the need for monthly injections with bevacizumab was significantly lower in the combination therapy group compared to the monotherapy group. This is in line with the findings of Ito et al. [ [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] who reported that a combination of ranibizumab or aflibercept and PDT was effective in preserving or improving visual acuity and anatomical structures in patients with PCV evidenced by noticeable effect on choroidal thickness at a one-year follow-up. [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The complexity in the neurochemistry of AMD suggests that there may be multiple therapeutic targets. Patients are usually reassured that progression of AMD is usually slow and they are likely to retain their independence even if reading vision is compromised. Other useful interventions may include smoking cessation, rehabilitation and low vision aids. Moreover, pharmacological breakthroughs have yet to be fully translated into clinical benefits for patients and medical practice, given the limited research on animal models. 1.3. Adverse Events following Standard Treatment for Wet AMD [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] evaluated the occurrence of complications following PDT with verteporfin for subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD and pathologic myopia in a retrospective case series. In general, PDT was well tolerated in patients with CNV secondary to AMD and in patients with pathologic myopia. However, moderate and transient adverse reactions were observed in some patients, including infusion-related back, chest or body pain, dyspnea and flushing during infusion, dyspnea alone, elevated blood pressure, and general pruritus. In addition, transient visual disturbances with haziness, blurriness, and flashing lights were experienced by 27.8% of patients. These complications lasted for about 3 days and were resolved spontaneously within days to weeks. [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] demonstrated functional and morphological changes of the retina detectable for up to 9 months in a primate model of cynomolgus monkey following a single PDT treatment. The eye in this primate model is morphologically and functionally identical to the human eye, and has been shown to be responsive to PDT treatment [ [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Intermittent increase in subretinal fluid level, foveal thinning and loss of RPE can be present in the same area, causing clinical long-term effects in some patients. The incidence of damage to the neural retina overlaying the PDT-treated areas has been reported clinically [ [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Newman [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] revealed a higher incidence of adverse events with PDT when sealing the leakage site close to the fovea, including damage to the normal choriocapillaris and RPE leading to choroidal ischemia, RPE atrophy and secondary CNV. [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The complications that are unrelated to underlying ocular disease include endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, intraocular pressure elevation, ocular hemorrhage and systemic adverse events, whereas those that are related to underlying ocular disease (diabetic retinopathy, retinal vascular occlusions, AMD and other retinal diseases) include vitreoretinal fibrosis, development of tractional retinal detachment, central retinal artery occlusion, retinopathy of prematurity and development of secondary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment [ [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Furthermore, intravitreal injection of ranibizumab has been shown to have greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease [ [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. In a study conducted by Singer et al. [ [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], the increase in complication rates is proportional to the number of injections required for two years or more. [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. While it stabilized vision and reduced subretinal fluid and foveal thickness, anti-VEGF monotherapy was ineffective at choroidal and at 12 to 30-month follow-up [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], which could lead to recurrence of exudative maculopathy. 1.4. Role of Natural Antioxidants for AMD [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Oxidative damage is an imbalance between pro- and antioxidant species, resulting in molecular and cellular damage. Excessive production of intracellular free radicals, namely the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can react with and denature biological macromolecules (nucleic acids, lipids and proteins). Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation initiates oxidative DNA damage and inflammatory response in RPE. Taken together, these events cause overproduction and accumulation of lipofuscin and formation of toxic aggregates of amyloid- (A) peptides. Under physiological conditions, the cellular waste that includes lipofuscin, drusen and unnecessary proteins are eliminated in RPE through ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. Impaired autophagy in RPE may contribute to further accumulation of such aggregates. Such alterations are typically observed in drusen of AMD patients, denoting abnormal lipid- and protein-rich [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Moreover, postmortem fundus examination and histopathology of samples from AMD patients revealed clinical signs of extensive free radical damage [ [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Exogenous antioxidants sources. Primary antioxidants include phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids, tocopherols, phospholipids, acids, phytic acid, ascorbic acid, sterols and pigments. Phenolic compounds act as free radical terminators to upregulate the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Consistently, antioxidant-enriched diets have been shown to reduce the progression from dry to wet AMD [ [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy 2.2. Eligibility Criteria 2.3. Data Extraction and Analysis 3. Results Study Selection 4. Discussion 4.1. Active Compounds (RPE65), monocarboxylate transporter factor 1 (AIF1) [ [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] contributing to the effects of allicin and berberine. Zingiberene and Curcumene. There is ample evidence from in vitro tests based upon the human ARPE-19 cell line [ [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [73](#B73-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], as well as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived RPE cells [ [90](#B90-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], to demonstrate the protective effects of curcumin against the development of AMD. Muangnoi et al. [ [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] pioneered the investigation on a ester designated as damage induced in human ARPE-19 cells. Modulation of multiple molecular targets has been found to be associated with its protective effects, namely the p44/42 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and NQO1. This discovery may make it possible to overcome challenges related to the poor solubility of curcumin resulting in low bioavailability. [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] highlighted an emerging strategy for the treatment of neovascular AMD. A curcumin supplement consisting of 95% curcuminoids, Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) components, astaxanthin and resveratrol, in combination with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF, was shown to improve functional outcomes in a retrospective case-control study. Curcuma, used in an adjuvant setting, would be necessary to reduce the need for ongoing injection therapy. However, recall bias occurs most often in case-control studies. These studies may prove an association, but they do not demonstrate causation; this can be overcome by cohort studies. Despite promising findings, further evidence is needed to evaluate the impact of curcuma in human clinical trials of AMD. A lack of clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the adjuvant setting can be a point of concern for evidence-based research in alternative medicine. 4.1.3. Ginsenoside [79](#B79-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] revealed the efficacy of ginsenoside-Rb1 in triggering cell proliferation and reducing the secretion of VEGF in human ARPE-19 cells. This could be mediated by estrogen receptor signaling mechanisms based on a report indicating that high levels of estrogen decreases extracellular level of VEGF in the retinal capillary cells of rhesus monkey. The observation could further support the clinical application of ginsenoside-Rb1 in reducing the frequency of anti-VEGF injections. On the other hand, Lee et al. [ [80](#B80-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] demonstrated an improvement of hydraulic and diffusional transport across BrM by ginsenosides. BrM and RPE form a serially coupled transportation system for nutrients and waste products. Aging causes gross anatomical changes in these compartments, and further exaggerated in AMD. Therefore, direct targeting of transport systems serves as a therapeutic intervention in delaying the progression of AMD. However, the findings have not been validated in clinical trials. 4.1.4. Other Active Compounds [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], astragaloside Curcuma comosa FLZ (a novel Annona (a from dried fruit of Forsythia suspense) [ [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], rosmarinic acid isolated from Rosmarinus officinalis [ [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] and saponins isolated from rhizomes of Paris polyphylla [ [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] also demonstrated promising protective effects against oxidative damage in preclinical models. [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] revealed that gypenosides may have potential for the treatment of patients with early-stage AMD by enhancing the ability of efflux pathways to remove cellular cholesterol from RPE cells. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), cholesterol efflux genes and cholesterol accumulation beneath the RPE cells have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD [ [92](#B92-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. However, definitive proof remains elusive on how cholesterol efflux influences the accumulation of lipids in lipid-soluble pigments promote stabilization function with respect to the plasma membrane and modification of diffusion barrier to and across the membrane. The conjugated polyene chromophore determines not only the light absorption properties, but also the photochemical properties of the molecule and consequent light-harvesting and photoprotective action. The polyene chain is responsible for the chemical reactivity of carotenoids toward blue light absorption, quenching of excited singlet and triplet states by molecular oxygen and free radical scavenging, and hence for any antioxidant role. [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. In a recent study by Orhan et al. [ [93](#B93-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] using an animal model of light-induced retinal degeneration, -cryptoxanthin was shown to attenuate oxidative damage to mitochondria and inflammation through the inflammatory cytokine, modulation of apoptotic pathways and mitochondrial stress markers. Several studies have been performed to investigate the association between -carotene, -carotene, and lycopene; and risk of AMD. However, their results were inconsistent [ [100](#B100-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [101](#B101-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [98](#B98-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The yellow coloration of the macula lutea is attributed to the presence of macular pigment in the photoreceptors [ [102](#B102-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Cho et al. [ [103](#B103-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] reported an inverse association of lutein/zeaxanthin with advanced AMD. These results are in accordance with clinical trials conducted by Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) Research Group (2013) [ [104](#B104-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [105](#B105-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Nevertheless, observational data from AREDS2 did not achieve sufficient evidence to demonstrate the beneficial effects of lutein and zeaxanthin when added to the original Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation in reducing the risk of progression to advanced AMD. 4.3. Extracts and Polysaccharides uliginosum tamarind extract [ [118](#B118-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] have been revealed to prevent the oxidative damage involved in the development of AMD. These findings have generated interest in botanical substances with antioxidant capabilities associated with the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, downregulation of hypoxia response element (HRE) sequence and modulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response. Importantly, activation of transcription factor NF-B and inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) has been linked to apoptosis, which could provide insight into the critical effector pathways regulating the therapeutic intervention in AMD. Interestingly, these pathways often intersect with the mechanism of action of numerous botanical substances, namely asiaticoside [ [110](#B110-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], carotenes, triterpenes, steroids, and saponins [ [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [129](#B129-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] demonstrated the remarkable protective effects of synthesized gold nanoparticles of Saudi O. vulgare extract in the prevention of early-stage or dry AMD by inhibiting angiogenesis and apoptosis, and increasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nanotechnology has the potential to make a significant impact on pharmacological and surgical interventions. Nanocarriers are designed to overcome the difficulties associated with anatomical and physiological barriers limiting the access to retina. [106](#B106-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], C. asiatica [ [110](#B110-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], and S. V. [ and extract [ [119](#B119-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] displayed cytoprotective effects against A2E oxidation induced by blue light in ARPE-19 cells. [107](#B107-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], G. cambogia extract [ [118](#B118-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], purified E. officinalis [ [113](#B113-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], lactoferrin [ [120](#B120-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], red wine extract [ and Saudi O. vulgare extract-mediated gold nanoparticles [ [130](#B130-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] have been shown to downregulate VEGF in preclinical models. VEGFA is the most potent mediator of both retinal and choroidal angiogenesis, and its inhibition through the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)/VEGF axis indicates the role of HIF in maintaining cellular homeostasis in response to changes in the oxygen status. HIF-1 is a major regulator of angiogenesis and is expressed ubiquitously to control various genes such as VEGF, BCL2 interacting 3 shown reduce VEGF expression. Intriguingly, Dithmer et al. [ [114](#B114-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] revealed a novel antiangiogenic approach of fucoidans in preventing the secretion of VEGF in ARPE-19 cells, primary porcine RPE cells RPE/choroid perfusion organ culture incubated with bevacizumab. Therefore, fucoidans can be developed as VEGF antagonists in the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases as in CNV. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating the regulation of VEGF has not yet been entirely elucidated. [134](#B134-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The polysaccharides of L. barbarum have revealed potent preclinical efficacy against AMD [ [122](#B122-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [124](#B124-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. of repair gene [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 14 (PARP14)] and restoration of antipyroptosis activity contributed to the protective effect of polysaccharides against photoreceptor apoptosis in preclinical models. [135](#B135-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Silvan et al. [ [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] also demonstrated the protective effects of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside through the inhibition of MAPKs (JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK) phosphorylation. These observations support the hypothesis that dietary supplements rich in anthocyanins may prevent AMD progression through antioxidant mechanisms. [136](#B136-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [142](#B142-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), regulation by activator protein-1 (AP-1) [ [144](#B144-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] have been shown to play important roles in the progression of AMD. AP-1 is a dimeric complex that is composed of heterodimers of the Fos and Jun family of proteins. Activation of AP-1, particularly the c-Jun transcription factor has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis activated by extracellular stimuli, whereas and MAPK expression [148](#B148-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Notch signaling is essential for vascular morphogenesis in response to ischemia by laying down primary vascular plexus for arterial specification [ [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Activation of MAPKs are implicated in RPE cell homeostasis following oxidative damage [ [150](#B150-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [151](#B151-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Moreover, resveratrol has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, migration and network formation of activated choroidal endothelial cells through the activation of p53 and inactivation of Akt in choroidal endothelial cells, leading to its antiproliferative and antimigratory properties [ [146](#B146-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [146](#B146-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Intriguingly, resveratrol has shown inhibit secretion in ARPE-19 cells incubated with resveratrol and bevacizumab [ [145](#B145-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The findings pave the way for future research design to explore the synergistic effects of resveratrol and anti-VEGF for patients with neovascular AMD in an anticipation to minimize the complications of anti-VEGF treatment regime. [137](#B137-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], inhibition of transcription factor NF-B activation [136](#B136-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], Formulations [Table 5](#pharmaceuticals-15-00101-t005). [168](#B168-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] standardized a clinical protocol in 2000, giving rise to a formulation catering to patients with moderate- to advanced-stage AMD. The aim of this prospective multicenter nonrandomized study was to re-appraise the concept of antioxidants in the prevention and management of AMD. Subsequently, the original formulation was re-examined and completed in 2012 as AREDS2. The goal was to evaluate the effect of adding omega-3 fatty acids, replacing beta-carotene with lutein-zeaxanthin, and eliminating or lowering the zinc in AREDS. AREDS2 demonstrated a 10% reduction in the progression of intermediate dry AMD to advanced forms of atrophic and neovascular AMD compared to placebo [ [104](#B104-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [152](#B152-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] presented the combined effects of AREDS and nontraditional antioxidants (rosemary or its active compounds, carnosic acid or ursolic acid) in delaying the progression of AMD in an animal model of light-induced retinal degeneration. Chronic administration of the combination may be a useful adjunct to the therapeutic benefit of AREDS in slowing the loss of photoreceptor cells and the progression of AMD to advanced disease by regulating retinal gene expression, and increasing rhodopsin, rod S-antigen, cone opsin and cone arrestin. [169](#B169-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Consistent with the theory, the clinical efficacy of milk-based formulation designated as Lacto-Wolfberry [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] and whole fruit of L. barbarum [ [170](#B170-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] have been evaluated in randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled involving healthy elderly subjects and patients with neovascular AMD, respectively. The 90-day supplementation showed a striking ability to sustain visual function and delaying macular degeneration associated with soft drusen and areas of hypopigmentation. Recently, RESVEGA\u00ae has been revealed to promote disruption of antiangiogenic action targeting on VEGF and its receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) [ [162](#B162-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The formulation contains trans-resveratrol and omega-3 fatty acids, among other nutrients. The observation highlights the importance of AP-1 transcription factors in the regulation of VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels, and disrupting the dissociation of VEGF-R2/caveolin-1(CAV-1) complex into lipid rafts following VEGF stimulation for the therapeutic efficacy. [171](#B171-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [172](#B172-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. In an open-label pilot study in patients with dry AMD, a liquid formulation of omega-3 concentrate has been reported to enhance visual function following 6 weeks of supplementation [ [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Nevertheless, there was no evidence from randomized trials to justify the effectiveness of the interventions. [158](#B158-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], and ZQMT, a traditional Chinese Patent Medicine have been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of intravitreal injection of ranibizumab in patients with neovascular AMD. Likewise, combination of Fufang Xueshuantong with ranibizumab reduced the thickness of RPE-Bruch's membrane complex thickness in neovascular AMD [ [154](#B154-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The preparation consists of astragali, S. and Radix Scrophulariaceae. ophthalmic preparation known as Chuanqi ophthalmic microemulsion in situ gel. Topical administration of the preparation, which consists of Ligusticum chuanxiong and A. membranaceus var. mongholicus, can be transported from conjunctival/cornea surface to the retina by three different routes; the transvitreal, uvea-scleral and periocular routes in an animal model of dry AMD induced by sodium iodide. Additionally, a patented pharmaceutical composition (Patent No: WO2012079419) demonstrated a positive impact on the course of CNV based on animal and human trials. Its main ingredients include A. membranaceus, [ [161](#B161-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Shihu Yeguang, a formulation consisting of 24 herbs has been revealed to prevent the development of bright light-induced photoreceptor degeneration by suppressing photo-oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [ [164](#B164-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. This approach greatly bridges the gap between TCM and modern medicine by encouraging further studies into the synergistic actions of TCM. [156](#B156-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], nanomicellar drop formulation of curcumin [159](#B159-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], ophthalmic drop formulation that contains nanoparticles of diosgenin extracted from the tubers of Dioscorea wild yam [ resveratrol formulation [ [163](#B163-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] and Triphala, a polyherbal Ayurvedic of 6](#pharmaceuticals-15-00101-t006). Early clinical and epidemiological studies predicted associations between vitamins and AMD [ [100](#B100-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [173](#B173-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. A diet rich in multivitamins may prevent or delay progression to advanced-stage AMD, particularly the CNV. In addition, the effects of vitamin B6 was recently verified in preclinical models of oxidative damage [ [174](#B174-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. As a component of rice bran, vitamin B6 was shown to suppress retinal neovascularization through the inhibition of HIF and decreased mRNA expression of VEGF. HIF promotes an adaptive transcriptional response to hypoxia, and as such, is a major regulator of immune cell survival and function. HIF is an oxygen-sensitive dimeric transcription factor that promotes an adaptive response to hypoxia by regulating essential inflammatory functions of immune cells. 4.7. Whole Foods [Table 7](#pharmaceuticals-15-00101-t007). [176](#B176-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] and a patented saffron [ [182](#B182-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] show the key role of MMP-3 in the protection against photoreceptor apoptosis in animal models of light-induced retinal degeneration. Moreover, activation of ERK1/2 by crocetin has been found to demonstrate a protective role in a cellular model of Tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative damage through the are the major sources of adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) production. Indeed, nonspecific oxidative damage induced by excessive mitochondrial ROS production are observed together with increased protein aggregation and inflammation in AMD. [184](#B184-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], accompanied by a significant increase in the average visual acuity on Snellen eye chart. The crossing over of AMD patients was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined by Maccarone et al. [ [185](#B185-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. fERG is a tool for diagnosis, analysis of pathogenesis, prediction of prognosis and estimation of retinal flicker sensitivity in patients with early-stage AMD. A fERG can be recorded from the macular region in response to a continuous flickering of the straylight source in the periphery. [180](#B180-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], mild to moderate- [ [177](#B177-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [181](#B181-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] and advanced-stage AMD [ [179](#B179-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Di Marco et al. [ [182](#B182-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] postulated that saffron is superior to AREDS in delaying the progression of AMD. Considering that these findings were based on a relatively well-nourished American population, recommendations should be based on risk factors and demographic data. [186](#B186-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], as well as the substitution of serine for alanine at codon 69 (A69S) in age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) gene positioned at a locus on chromosome 10q26 [ [187](#B187-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], are associated with AMD. Interestingly, Marangoni et al. [ [178](#B178-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] revealed that the functional effects of long-term saffron supplementation in improving visual function were not influenced by genetic polymorphisms associated with risk of AMD. 4.7.2. Other Whole Foods [128](#B128-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] studied the synergistic properties of an admixture of rosemary oil and zinc oxide (ZnO) in an animal model of light-induced retinal damage. The mineral supplementation was adjusted based on the recommendation of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 1 (AREDS1) Research Group. The combination was found to be effective in preventing the progression of advanced-stage AMD by restoring the level of rhodopsin, cone opsin and cone arrestin, and decreasing the level of carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) adducts. Furthermore, the inflammatory response was regulated by HO-1, a potent antioxidant. Cone phototransduction and survival are essential for color vision and visual acuity. As the rods and cones degenerate under a variety of pathological conditions including AMD, biomarkers are the most reliable prognostic indicators of disease progression. CEP adducts, derived from fragmentation of docosahexaenoate (DHA)-containing lipids, have been [ [174](#B174-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] in apoptotic RPE cells that release VEGF were regulated through the inhibition of HIF and Prospects [188](#B188-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [189](#B189-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Synergistic therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in herbal formulations and TCM [ [190](#B190-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [191](#B191-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The safety and effectiveness of some of these formulations, especially complementary and alternative medicines, are uncertain because no relevant, well-designed clinical trials or pharmacovigilance studies have been undertaken. Most of the prescribed formulations and herbal remedies used in primary health care have not been officially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, ophthalmologists should consider the potential risks and adverse effects before recommending these formulations to their patients [ [192](#B192-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [193](#B193-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [194](#B194-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The therapeutic efficacy of plant-derived phytochemical compounds with high molecular weight is also of great concern due to their poor permeation through lipid bilayers and reduced bioavailability in humans [ [195](#B195-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The possible steroidal activity of TCM herbs and supplements in their raw and finished forms has been questioned, as they can lead to adverse reactions such as adrenal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Some herbs could contain compounds that are structurally similar to steroids, which could interfere with steroid metabolism or bind to steroid receptors [ [196](#B196-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Therefore, analytical and high-throughput screening of the purified natural antioxidants is needed to understand the mechanisms of action of these natural products or traditional medicines [ [193](#B193-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [197](#B197-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. In this respect, nanotherapeutics could be developed to facilitate the delivery of drug treatments for CNV by enhancing bioactivity, improving bioavailability at the target sites and allowing sustained drug release with prolonged action [ [198](#B198-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Although the use of nanomicellar and ophthalmic drop formulations may have therapeutic advantages for AMD [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [160](#B160-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)], clinical trials are still needed to assess potential nanoparticle toxicity in the ocular surface, lens, retina and optic nerve. [199](#B199-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. However, primary RPE cells cultured from different donors are genetically and physiologically different. Moreover, primary RPE cells tend to lose their RPE characteristics and their re-differentiation capacity after several passages [ [200](#B200-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Although there are a few commercially available continuous RPE cell lines, one limitation is that they lack their original pigmented phenotype, especially melanin [ [201](#B201-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [202](#B202-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Nevertheless, ARPE-19 cells can be repigmented using isolated melanosomes from porcine RPE, which promotes higher drug binding affinity and accumulation [ [203](#B203-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Furthermore, long-term appropriate culture and differentiation of low passage human ARPE cells can develop phenotypic characteristics and express genes specific to native RPE cells [ [204](#B204-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [199](#B199-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Laser-induced CNV in transgenic mice with expression or knock-out of gene variants can be used to test short-term hypotheses such as the involvement of environmental factors and external stress in AMD [ [205](#B205-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Moreover, rabbit models have the advantage of larger eyes, which is beneficial for the administration of subretinal injections and vectors for gene therapy [ [206](#B206-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. However, laser-induced damage in the Bruch's membrane and injection of proangiogenic factors are not applicable in rabbits, thus injection of Matrigel containing proangiogenic factors has been used to produce CNV lesions and disrupt Bruch's membrane to resemble AMD [ [207](#B207-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [206](#B206-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [208](#B208-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Some nonprimate models are useful for AMD studies, including rhesus, cynomolgus and Japanese macaque monkeys that can have early-onset drusen, and African green monkeys that can have induced neovascularization by intravitreal injection of DL-alpha-aminoadipic acid [ [208](#B208-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [209](#B209-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [210](#B210-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Besides the difficulty in breeding and handling these animals, there are cost and ethical issues associated with their usage in AMD studies [ [211](#B211-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Before any animal study can be translated to a human study, it is crucial to consider the risk-benefit analysis, informed consent procedures, ethical review, and monitoring processes in order to develop a safe and effective treatment for AMD [ [212](#B212-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [205](#B205-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Considering the prevalence of AMD is different among populations in different regions, the design of clinical studies should be standardized to allow consistent results for comparisons. A standardized grading system of AMD lesions should also be adopted in clinical studies such as the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System, Age-Related Eye Disease Study System of Classifying AMD, the International Classification and Grading System for AMD, or the Clinical Classification of Age-Related Macular Degeneration [ [213](#B213-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Additionally, no validated clinical endpoints are accepted by all regulatory agencies. The only accepted primary endpoint in AMD clinical study is the best-corrected visual acuity (BVCA) that requires high contrast and high luminance, but it is not sensitive enough to detect the functional deficits in early or intermediate AMD [ [214](#B214-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [215](#B215-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Therefore, there is a need to develop and validate novel clinical endpoints or appropriate tools that are acceptable to regulatory agencies for clinical trials on early and intermediate AMD [ [216](#B216-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [217](#B217-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] and one retrospective study of AMD [ [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)] have been revealed. One major disadvantage of retrospective studies is the small sample size, which may have selection bias, suboptimal handling of missing data and loss to follow-up. Although retrospective studies can reflect the results in the clinical setting compared to a randomized study, it does not accurately represent real world population outcomes [ [218](#B218-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [219](#B219-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Retrospective studies are also limited by their geographical reach, as the results cannot be applied to larger populations or other regions [ [220](#B220-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The signaling pathway of Lycium barbarum used in AMD is well elucidated in preclinical models. On the other hand, only two randomized controlled trials conducted in healthy older subjects and neovascular AMD patients have been reported [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-15-00101), [170](#B170-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Although randomized studies are often viewed as the gold standard for clinical evidence of the true relative efficacy of an intervention, there might be unknown or immeasurable confounding variables that can lead to a biased estimation of the treatment effect. Randomized studies are also time-consuming and expensive compared to other types of study [ [221](#B221-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. [222](#B222-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. The \"virtuous cycle\" of bidirectional translation studies in AMD could be started by discovering and observing the human phenotype in AMD patients. Preclinical animal models could then be conducted to understand the pathophysiology and explore potential therapeutics. Finally, knowledge and potential therapeutics from preclinical studies need to be further tested and validated for their efficacy and tolerability in AMD patients [ [223](#B223-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. Besides exploring other treatment options for wet AMD, there is a need to explore new treatments for dry AMD, as many potential therapeutic approaches targeting dry AMD have failed. Future therapeutic protocols will require treatments that target different aspects of AMD pathobiology, which will require concerted effort to discover potential therapies [ [224](#B224-pharmaceuticals-15-00101)]. 6.
