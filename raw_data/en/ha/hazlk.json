According to reports an ACA spokesperson for the organization stated: \"From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the [ACA] has reached out to the federal government to make it clear that the chiropractic profession, one of the largest portal-of-entry healthcare groups in the country, is willing and qualified to provide assistance to a healthcare system being stretched to its limit. As a result of ACA's efforts, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in March 2020 included doctors of chiropractic on its listing of the essential critical infrastructure workforce.\" [\"One year later in March 2021, when the Department of Health and Human Services was working to rapidly provide vaccines to the public by expanding its list of healthcare professionals qualified to provide vaccination services, ACA wrote to HHS to point out that DCs meet the criteria put forward and should therefore be included. During this health crisis, ACA supports inclusion of doctors of chiropractic in public health efforts to meet the special needs of communities nationwide.\"](http://chiropractic.prosepoint.net/176680) [CLICK HERE for more on that story](http://chiropractic.prosepoint.net/176680) The news should come as no surprise as the ACA has led the charge to turn chiropractors in medical providers for decades while abandoning the profession's unique role.

Chiropractors in Colorado can sign up to give the injections following training.
