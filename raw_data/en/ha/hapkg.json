Since 2006, Laura has helped thousands of people heal issues and restore wholeness - mentally, physically & spiritually. Her mission is to help others rediscover the power that lies within and become their own superhero by addressing root issues, transforming pain, bridging science, research and the practical magic of sacred, ancient traditions... with honor and integrity. She does this while also advocating for holistic health, domestic violence survivors, and policy changes. Laura also finds that those with a history of trauma, dementia, or are faced with end-of-life challenges, need someone who is compassionate and understanding of their needs and has the tools to guide them through these difficult challenges that many times traditional healthcare is not fully equipped to understand or assist.
