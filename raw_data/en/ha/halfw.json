She is a women's health, stress, and anxiety relief expert that can help you shift into a more balanced life. You deserve for your life to feel less chaotic and more calm, for your body to move without pain and for your cycles to be more predictable. Her journey to this profession began when she was working as a nurse and in school for pre-med. She was tired, anxious, and dealing with endometriosis, but was also young and felt that she should be thriving. She tried everything allopathic medicine could offer and then started to explore herbal medicine, nutrition, and exercise as treatment options. After years of self-study with herbs and exploring traditional medicines, she finally tried acupuncture and was prescribed Chinese herbal medicine. It absolutely changed her life and she's excited to help you change yours. She's been a Registered Nurse for over a decade and still maintains an active nursing license. She earned her Master of Science degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine from the Colorado School of Traditional Chinese Medicine. She is licensed in acupuncture in Colorado and nationally certified in acupuncture and herbal medicine. Her background in nursing helps bring balance to her work as an acupuncturist. Part of bringing balance into her life is making time for the things she loves outside of the clinic. She's an avid skier, hiker, reader, and traveler with her husband Ryan.
