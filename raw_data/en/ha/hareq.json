He didn't have a really good sense of balance. At the time we didn't know it was [Sensory Processing Disorder](https://thekishaproject.com/sensory-processing-disorder/). He started [doing Occupational therapy](https://thekishaproject.com/occupational-therapy-for-autism/) to help him improve his ability to process sensory information and develop coping strategies to manage sensory input in the environment. Some of his favorite therapy activities involved a balance board. And I am the parent that buys the same toys he uses in therapy at home too. So I was on a mission to find the best wobble board for toddlers. What is a wobble board? A wobble board (also called a balance board) is a type of balancing toy designed to improve balance, stability, and coordination. It typically consists of a flat board with a small dome or sphere on the underside, allowing it to wobble or rock back and forth. Why are wobble boards good for autistic people? Children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often struggle with balance, coordination, and sensory processing issues. This can affect their ability to participate in daily activities. Rocker boards provide a unique way to address these challenges by helping to improve motor skills, body awareness, and cognitive function. To use a wobble board, you stand on a flat surface while trying to maintain your balance as the board moves. This engages the muscles in your legs, core muscles, and feet, as well as the proprioceptive system, which helps you maintain awareness of your body's position in space. How do we use wobble boards for occupational therapy? Wobble boards can be beneficial for children with autism for several reasons: Sensory stimulation: Many children with autism have sensory processing difficulties and may seek out or avoid certain types of sensory input. The wobbling motion of the board provides proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation, which can help regulate the sensory systems and improve sensory integration. Balance and coordination: Children with autism often struggle with balance and coordination, which can impact their ability to participate in physical activities and affect their confidence. Using a wobble board is a great way to help improve these skills and increase their overall physical fitness (like their core strength.) It's also a great option to help with your child's posture. Focus and attention: The challenge of balancing on a wobble board can help improve focus and attention span in children with autism. It can also provide a calming effect and reduce anxiety levels. Fun and engaging: Wobble boards can be a fun and engaging way for children with autism to participate in physical activities and improve their motor skills. It can also be a way to encourage social interaction and play with others. It's an activity that the whole family can enjoy. What should you consider when choosing the best wobble board for toddlers?
