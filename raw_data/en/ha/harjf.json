History The NHMRC has been engaged by the Department of Health (Department) to update the evidence underpinning the 2015 Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Heal th Insurance (2015 Review) (1). The seven natural therapies to be reviewed in the first tranche are naturopathy , Pilates, Rolfing, shiatsu, Tai Chi , Western herbalism and yoga. These therapies are among those excluded from the private health insurance rebate as of 1 April 2019. To support the NHMRC in their evidence review , Health Technology Analysts (HTAnalysts) has been engaged to conduct a systematic review of the evidence of clinical effectiveness of shiatsu . Eligible studies received from the Department's call for evidence , the Natural Therapies Review Expert Advisory Panel (NTREAP) and the Natural Therapies Working Co mmittee (NTWC) will also be included in the evidence evaluation. This Research Protocol has been developed by HTAnalysts, in conjunction with the NHMRC , the NTWC and the NTREAP to provide a framework outlining the methodology that will be used to supplemen t evidence statements made in the 2015 Review of shiatsu . It is intended that all associated materials will be developed in a robust and transparent manner in accordance with relevant best practice standards (2, 3) .

The 2015 Over view was underpinned by an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) that focused solely on shiatsu and were published in the Engl ish language between 2008 and June 2014. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that were reported within included SRs and assess ed shiatsu delivered to treat any clinical condition were eligible for inclusion ; however, no evidence was found (4, 5) . SRs that assessed acupressure as a sole intervention were not eligible for inclusion. The 2015 Overview informed the 2015 Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Private Health Insurance for Natural Therapies , which resulted in shiatsu and 15 other natural therapies being excluded from private health insurance rebatesa. In this 2020 review , the evidence evaluation will build upon the 2015 Overview but will not be limited by publication date and a broader range of study types will be eligible for inclusion (inclusive of nonrandomised studies of interventions [NRSIs]). The updated revie w will also include studies that assess shiatsu for primary prevention. Evidence from eligible primary studies of shiatsu will be supplemented with evidence identified from an Overview of Reviews (a systematic review of systematic reviews) of acupressure, a core component of shiatsu. Similar to the 2015 review, eligible comparisons will be shiatsu versus control (but further delineated to shiatsu versus placebo and shiatsu versus no intervention) and shiatsu versus other interventions. Studies not published in the English language will not be translated, and databases in languages other than English will not be searched. The process for conducting the review is built upon the following framework: source the clinical evidence by performing a systematic literature search of the literature, identify eligible studies published in English and indexed in English language databases , incorporate additional literature identified through non -database sources received from the Department's public call for evidence, NTREAP and NTWC , critically apprais e and present the evidence, and determin e the certainty in the evidence base for each question, using a structured assessment of the body of evide nce in accordance with GRADE methodology (6). a https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/private -health -insurance -reforms -changing Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 8 1.1 Description of condition and setting Shiatsu therapy ha s been practiced in Australia since the early 1970 s and is used by people of all ages for a wide of range of reasons (7). A 2016 workforce survey of 121 shiatsu therapists working in Australia found the most common reasons for providing shiatsu therapy were to alleviate or treat a broad range of clinical and preclinical conditions including stress , mental health , pain , musculoskeletal problems, as well as rehabilitation and management of chronic health conditions including cancer care and disability care (7). Other conditions that practitione rs report benefit from shiatsu therapy include headaches, migraine, sciatica, respiratory illnesses , fatigue, menstrual problems, circulatory problems, and rheumatic and arthritic complaints (8). The current review is not limited to any particular condition or setting (see 3.1.2 Types of participants ) and therefore a concise description of each condi tion or problem , and the relevant setting, will be provid ed after conduct of the full text review . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 9 1.2 Description of intervention Shiatsu Shiatsu therapy is a complex, whole -system intervention that is based on the philosophy and theory of traditional Chines e (oriental ) medicine (9). Shiatsu was popularised in the West following the legislation in Japan of \"Anma -Shiatsu -Massage\" in the mid-20th Century. The word 'shiatsu' originates from the Japanese word meaning 'finger pressure', through which the therapist applies pressure to the acupuncture (tsubo) points on the body . Practitioner or self -administered acupressure is believed to assist with alleviating a variety of symptoms associated with health conditions (10). In Australia, shiatsu therapists work in a range of settings: solo or group shiatsu clinics, multidisciplinary health clinics, at their home or in a mobile practi ce that allows for home or office visits (7). Shiatsu treatment is traditionally performed on a futon on the floor with the recipient fully clothed or covered by a sheet in a sitting or lying position (11). Shiatsu therapists working in Australia may have differing qualifications (including some that also receive training in acupuncture and other oriental therapies) and be registere d as a shiatsu therapist and/or oriental massage therapist with one or more of the Australian natural therapy associations (7). The Shiatsu Therapy Association of Australia (STAA ), a national peak body representing shiatsu therapists , requires practitioners to hold a Diploma in Shiatsu and Oriental Therapies HLT52215 (or equivalent), to undertake a minimum of 20 hours continuing professional education annually and hold a current f irst aid certificate (12). The same ( HLT52215 ) course may also be recognised by other associations as qualifying for Oriental (TCM) Remedial Massage Therapy . The HLT52215 curriculum covers onal oriental/Chinese medicine modalities . Whil e the curriculum focuses on the application of acupressure and massage, students are also trained in traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and the application of moxibustion, cupping , self -acupressure, orient al diet, corrective exercises, lifestyle, relaxation, breathing techniques and meditation (7). Shiatsu draws on traditional Chinese philosophies and theories such as Yin and Yang , the energy meridians, the five elements and the concept of Ki . The therapist aims to identify and correct imbalances in the flow of Ki, or energy in a recipients meridians to promote self -healing (11, 13) . A shiatsu session typically begins with a clinical history followed by an examinat ion to formulate a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis that is used to individualise the therapy (11, 13, 14) . Examination methods include palpation (ampuku ) of the hara (abdomen) or back , pulse , tongue and face diagnosis to assess t he relative constitutional and energetic quali ties of the internal organs and their related meridians (11). Shiatsu massage is a derivative of traditional Japanese ( Anma or Amna ) massage that has its origins in traditional Chinese (Tuina) massage. There are various styles of shiatsu practiced in Australia and include: barefoot (macrobiotic) shiatsu, healing shiatsu, Jin Shin Do, ohashiatsu, shiatsu, watsu (water shiatsu) . Like A nma and Tuina massage, shiatsu massage employs a wide range of traditional techniques. Some are vigorous (e.g. kneading, rubbing, tapping and shaking ) whil e other techniques involve slow and firm or quick and gentle movements (e.g. pressure, stroking, stretc hes, rotations of the limbs and joints, simple structural alignments and muscle release techniques ) (9, 11) . All styles , however, Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 10 have common ality in their underpinning traditional Chinese medicine and the use of body weight and physical pressure in one way or another when delivering a shiatsu massage (15). Under standard terminologies published by t he WHO (16), 'Traditional Chinese Tuina ' is the term used when referring to massage therapy that has its foundations in traditional Chinese medicine , including shiatsu . The term shiatsu, however, is also listed as an alternate word for acupressure , demonstrating that the two terms may be used interchangeably within the literature . Terminology is also specified for a number of components of practice used by shiatsu practitioners in Australia (see Table 1). Table 1 Description of common components of practice used in shiatsu therapy Component of practice taught and used by certified Australian shiatsu therapists ( HLT52215 )a Corresponding WHO traditional medicine terminology (TRM)b WHO TRM Codes Shiatsu massage Traditional Chinese Tuina: the branch of traditional Chinese medicine concerned with the principles and clinical use of Tuina (massage) therapy 0.0.18 Shiatsu massage techniques Massage: rubbing, kneading, or percussion of the soft tissues and joints of the body with the hands, usually performed by one person on another, esp. to relieve tension or pain 4.2.326 Manipulation: the term used when describing a wide range of manual therapy techniques (see manual for details) 4.2.327 - 4.2.344 Tapping technique: a manipulation performed by tapping with the tips of fingers held together 4.2.346 Acupressure Finger Pressure: a manipulation performed by pressing acupuncture points with the finger or thumb instead of needling, also known as shiatsu 4.2.347 Moxibustion Moxibustion: a therapeutic procedure involving ignited material (usually moxa) to apply heat to certain point s or areas of the body surface 5.2.0 - 5.2.39 Cupping Cupping: suction by using a vacuumi jar 5.3.0 - 5.3.11 Organi zation international standard terminologies on traditional medicine in the Western Pacific Region (16) Acupre ssure Acupressure is the application of pressure on the traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture (tsubo) points (10, 17) . Acupressure is applied to specif ic points by the use of finger, hand, elbow, foot, and/or acupressure band or bead (10). Like shiatsu , acupressure ha s its roots in traditional Chinese medicine . However, acupressure is only one component of shiatsu therapy. Some authors note that while similar, there are differences in both the technique and philosophy of shiatsu and acupressure (10, 14, 17) . While others, including the WHO International Standard Terminologies for Traditional Medicine in the Western Pacific Region (16), use the terms interchangeably (7, 17, 18) . For the purpose of this review, individualised acupressure refers to the selection of one or more acupressure (tsubo) points tailored to the individual recipient that is i nformed by a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis. It may be delivered in the context of a shiatsu treatment (or alongside Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 11 other traditional Chinese medicine treatment). Most individualised acupressure is administered by the therapist, however, there may be instances when the therapist provides instructions for self - administration or administration by a lay caregiver. Standardised (non -individualised) acupressure refers to one or more predetermined acupressure points for a specific condition, symptom or s ymptom cluster. Whil e informed by the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, a traditional diagnosis of the recipient is not required for administration. The acupressure intervention may be administered by a qualified therapist, lay caregiver or self. Most self -administered acupressure is non -individualised, examples include the use of an acupressure band or large bead as a replacement for finger pressure . However, there may be some instances when a therapist uses this type of acupressure or provides i nstructions to their patient or lay caregiver for self -administration. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 12 1.3 How the intervention might work Shiatsu The exact mechanisms for how shiatsu might work for different conditions has not been elucidated . However, some of the massage techniques include d in shiatsu are similar to massage more generally. Consequently, shiatsu massage techniques may affect the body through similar mechanisms. The physical and psychological effects of m assage more generally are thought to be explained (in part) by relaxation of the nervous system and musculature and through the release of neurotransmitters and hormones (19-21). Like all human interaction, touch is believed to induce an immediate calming effect , mediated by production of the hormone o xytocin (22, 23) . Physiologically, massage may increase oxygenation to the muscles through inducing local biochemical changes that help blood and lymph flow, as well as affecting mood and pain perception through a subsequent effect on neural activity (20, 24 -26). One study suggests that by s upporting individuals to take control of their self -care , shiatsu practitioners encourage patients to make lifestyle changes (e.g. relaxing more, working less) which could impact their health (27). A limited number of exploratory studies of shiatsu applied to various anatomi c regions on healthy adults have observed mixed results on autonomic nervous system functions including changes in heart rate, blood pressure and pupil diameter (20). In shiatsu, the role of connective tissue in delive ring energy and information to the whole body is thought to be integral to correcting imbalances in the flow or energy of a recipients Ki (8). Here, t he mechanical effect of stretching and applied pressure is believed to encourage hydration and flexibility of connective tissue that has become congested or brittle t hrough inadequate circulation or after injury. Due to continuity and electromagnetic signalling properties between cells, the connective tissue is suggested to distribute and enhance communication throughout the body to promote self -healing (8). Shiatsu practitioners work directly with the energy flow along the mer idian because bioelectric flow is believed to happen more readily along meridian lines due to differing electrical resistance (8). Acupressure The mechanisms underpinning any effects of acupressure are thought to be similar to acupuncture. The practice of acupuncture may produce benefits for conditions closely associated with the nervous system (28-30). Stimulation (or pressure) applied to points connected to or located near neural structures is thought to transmit information along pathways in the nervous system, inducing various changes including pain perception, and hormonal and neurochemical changes (28-30). Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 13 1.4 Why it is important to do this review In Australia, complementary therapies, including shiatsu , are most often used in conjunction with conventional medicine and other strategies for maintaining good health and wellness. For this reason, it is important to synthesise the evidence for the effectiveness of shiatsu , to enable consumers, health care providers and policy mak ers to make informed decisions about care. The 2015 Overview identified four systematic reviews that included two RCTs; however , the effect of shiatsu could not be independently evaluated from either RCT, as shiatsu was combined with other interventions in both studies . There was no independent evidence to suggest that shiatsu may have some beneficial health benefits compared with control or active comparators . Therefore, the o verall efficacy, safety, quality or cost -effectiveness of shiatsu was not able to be assessed (4). The rationale for conducting this review is to update and enhance the evidence used to inform the 2015 Overview of shiatsu (4). That is, to identify studies published since, or not included in, the 2015 review, and address the evidence gaps noted. This is t o ensure recommendations relating to the use of shiatsu remain relevant and up to date . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 14 2 Objectives To conduct a systematic review of RCTs and NRSIs to evaluate the effectiveness of shiatsu in individual s with a described injury, disease, medical condition, or pre clinical condition. This will be supplemented with the available evidence for acupressure - a core component of shiatsu - as reported i n SRs (of RCTs and pseudo -RCTs ). The intent is to evaluate the evidence representative of the populations and conditions commonly seen by shiatsu practitioners in Australia , the intervention(s) commonly used by practitioners , and outcomes that align with the reasons why patients use shiatsu and/or practitioners prescribe shiatsu . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 15 3 Methods Met hods reported in this protocol are based on that described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (31) and relevant sections in the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's manual (32). Covidence (www.c ovidence.org), a webbased platform for producing systematic reviews, will be used for screening citations and recording decisions made. Covidence is compatible with EndNote and Microsoft Excel, which will be used for managing citations and data extraction , respectively . Where appropriate, RevMan (33) will be used for the main analyses and GRADEpro GDT software (www.gradepro.org) will be used to re cord decisions and derive an overall assessment of the certainty of evidence for each outcome guided by GRADE methodology (6). The final approved review protocol is to be registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). To identify the evidence base for the clinical question a systematic search of published medical literature will be conducted. All potentially relevant studies will be identified after applying prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined belo w. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 16 3.1 Criteria for considering studies for this review 3.1.1 Types of studies Study design Eligible studies are those designed to examine the effectiveness of shiatsu , or its core component - acupressure - compared to control ( placebo or no intervention) , or other intervention. The evidence for acupressure and shiatsu will be examined separately. For shiatsu, eligible studies are RCTs and NRSIs. For acupressure , eligible studies are SRs (of RCTs and pseudo -RCTs) . Shiatsu The primary study of interest is an RCT . Cluster -randomised trials and crossover trials are also eligible for inclusion, and will be analysed using methods appropriate to the design (see Section 3.3.9 ) (34). If the method of randomisation is not specifically stated, or not considered strictly random, then the study will be judged to be pseudorandomised. Pseudo -RCTs will be evaluated alongside RCTs, with meth ods of randomisation examined in the risk of bias assessment and any concerns about risk of bias addressed in the synthesis. Certain NRSIs with design features as outlined in Table 2 are also eligible for inclusion . For NRSIs to be eligible for inclusion, the minimum design features include : allocation to, or practice of, the intervention occurs by choice (by the participant or other) the effect of the intervention in individuals (or clusters of individuals or groups) is compared with a contemporaneous control group NRSIs in which the effect of the intervention is compared to a historical (or non -parallel or non - concurrent) control grou p are not eligible for inclusion due to concerns regarding risk of bias ( e.g. due to residual confounding or unmeasurable changes in clinical practice over time). Single arm studies with either post -test or pre -test/post -test outcomes, cross -sectional stud ies, case series and case reports are also not eligible for inclusion, as it is too problematic to assess the effect of the intervention in such studies with any confidence (35, 36) . The inclusion of NRSIs is to ensure the evidence review adequately covers the breadth of health conditions and outcomes to inform health policy, particularly in populations or settings where the intervention is either not likely, or not able, to be assessed using a randomised design, or where evidence from RCTs is incomplete for certain populations, settings or outcomes that may be more feasibly evaluated using NRSI (37). This is likely to occur when the length of follow up for the outcome is not feasible for an RCT, or the event rate of the outcome is so small that it requires a population -wide study for a measurable effect to be observed. In rare instances, it may be because of a strong preference for the intervention by prospective participants prevents the conduct of a suitable RCT (38), or the RCT evidence for a particular health condition and outcome is indirect and the question is better answered by available NRSI evidence (39). Eligible NRSIs that are assessed to be at critical risk of bias for one or more domain (see Section 3.3.6 ) will not be included in the evidence synthesis because results from these studies are likely to lead to misinformed judgements about the effect estimate. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 17 Table 2 Eligible design features of nonrandomised studies of interventions Definition / design features Design features of NRSIs included in the review An experimental study in which people are allocated to the intervention/treatment being studied or a control/placebo group and the outcomes compared. The method of allocation is by choice, availability, or chance. A study in which outcomes from a defined group of people (the cohort) are followed over time, to examine associations between exposure and no n-exposure to an intervention or factor under study. Outcome are recorded as they occur. A 'prospective' cohort study recruits participants before any intervention and follows them into the future. A study in which outcomes from a defined group of peopl e (the cohort) are identified to examine associations between exposure and non -exposure to an intervention or factor under study. A 'retrospective' cohort study identifies subjects from past records describing the interventions received and follows them fr om the time of those records. A study that uses observations at multiple time points before and after an intervention (the 'interruption') is introduced to a group of people, and then compared to the outcomes at the same time points for a group of people that do not receive the intervention. The design attempts to detect whether the intervention has had an effect significantly greater than any underlying trend over time. A study in which observations are made before and after the implementation of an intervention, both in a group that receives the intervention and in a control group that does not and compared at the same timepoint. A study that compares people with a specific outcome of interest ('cases') with people from the same source population but without that outcome ('controls'), to examine the association between the outcome and prior exposure (e.g. having an intervention). This design is particularly useful when the outcome is rare. Source: Adapted from NHMRC (36, 40) ; Chapter 24 Including non -randomi sed studies on intervention effects (37); Cochrane Childhood Cancer (41); Acupressure The primary study of interest is a SR of RCTs (and pseudo -RCTs ), with or without a meta -analysis . This is because conducting a SR of primary studies of acupressure (i.e. RCTs or NRSIs ) is not feasible given the timeframe and resources . As acupressure is a central technique used in shiatsu, evidence from SRs of acupressure will be used to augment the ev idence from primary studies of shiatsu. If the method of randomisation of a primary stud y included within a SR is not specifically stated, or not considered strictly random, then the study will be considered to be pseudorandomised . Where a SR includes p seudo-RCTs, these will be considered as eligible along with data from RCTs . Reviews that do not report study eligibility criteria or conduct a comprehensive search of the literature (i.e. searching more than one database) will not be included. These reviews do not meet the minimum criteria to be considered 'systematic' and may not accurate ly summar ise the body of evidence. Eligible review s that include a single RCT will be included , as will SRs that include both RCTs and NRSIs ; however, only evidence from the RCT s (or pseudo -RCTs) will be considered. Information on how meta -analyses from SRs will be handled where they include ineligible studies (e.g. NRSIs that are not pseudorandomised) or where they are missing one or more eligible studies is provided in Section 3.3.11 . Additional study designs will not be considered. This includes individual RCTs or pseudo -RCTs not part of a SR, nonrandomised comparative studies (i.e. nonrandomised experimental trials, cohort studies, case -control studies, interrupted times series), c ross-sectional studies and case series with Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 18 either post -test of pre -test/post -test outcomes. . Where a SR is not identified for an eligible population or intervention, this will be noted as an evidence gap . Overviews will not be eligible for inclusion and the search strategy (see Appendix A) is not specifically designed to identify them. However, Overviews identified in literature search or those submitted through the Department's public call for evidence (see Section 3.2.2 ) will be checked to identify SRs that are eligible. Publication date There are no limitations on publication date, however , studies or systematic reviews published after the lite rature search date will not be eligible for inclusion. Studies that are published (or submitted to the Department) after the literature search date will be listed within the ' Studies awaiting classification ' table of the evaluation report. These studies wi ll not be subject to a formal evidence evaluation, however, a brief statement about the study and its potential impact on the overall conclusions of the evidence review will be included under the relevant sections of the review (e.g. 'Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '). Studies published in languages other than English The literature search, as well as the Department's call for evidence, will not be limited by language of publication. Databases in languages other than English will not be s earched, however , studies in languages other than English may be identified via the English language databases. For pragmatic reasons, potentially eligible studies will not undergo full text translation or data extraction, but will be documented via a proc ess outlined in Section 3.3.1 'Studies published in languages other than English '. 3.1.2 Types of participants People of any age with any injury, disease, medical condition or pre clinical condition are eligible for inclusion. This includes disease prevention in at-risk healthy populations , which is broadly defined as those who are at increased risk of becoming ill or injured based on social, biomedical or behavioural risk factor s (42). For the purposes of this review, social risk factors include income, education, employment and social support; biomedical factors include a person's age, genetic make -up, and health status (such as obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, vitamin deficiency); and behavioural factors include a person's lifestyle choices (e .g. alcohol consumption, diet, exercise, tobacco and other drug use, etc.). Healthy participants seeking health improvement, such as general wellbeing, fitness, aesthetic improvements, resilience and cognitive or emotional intelligence are not eligible for inclusion ; however, a study with eligible and ineligible populations will be included if separate data are available for the eligible population /s. 3.1.3 Types of interventions Intervention: s hiatsu All styles and forms of massage described as shiatsu or a type of shiatsu are eligible for inclusion. Other components of practice used by shiatsu therapists in Australia (such as moxibustion, cupping , self-acupressure, oriental diet, corrective exercises, lifestyle, relaxation, breathing techniques and meditation) are only included if they are delivered in the context of whole -system/multi -component shiatsu therapy . Shiatsu may be individualised according to a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis or a predetermined standardised intervention for a specific condition/problem. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 19 Terminology specific to the Japanese language is not used in the standardised nomenclature (16). Therefore, studies using other traditional oriental terms to describe the intervention are also included in the review. This includes, but is not limited to, shiatsu massage, Anma (or Amna ) massage, An mo massage, Tsubo (acupoint) th erapy. Studies described as ' Traditional Japanese massage' or 'Japanese massage' will be included where the description of the intervention is consistent with the definition of shiatsu. There are no limits on intensity, duration of intervention or mode of delivery and s tudies will be included irrespective of whether the intervention is delivered by a certified practitioner or not . To allow for potential subgroup analysis (and to inform decision -making ), studies will be stratified based on the style or form of shiatsu massage delivered (see Section 3.3.15 ). Restrictions: Therapies that are described as Tuina (or tui na) or other styles of massage or manual therapies (e .g. Korean massage , traditional Chinese massage , remedial massage, Swedish massage etc.) are excluded . Interventions that include high -velocity joint manipulation or oils are excluded, as these components a re not consistent with shiatsu practice in Australia. Studies only evaluating component interventions, such as acupressureb, moxibustion, cupping and meridian exercises, will be excluded. Intervention: a cupressure All forms of acupressure , applied to trad itional Chinese medicine acupuncture (tsubo) points , are eligible for inclusion. The acupressu re can be either individualised (i.e. delivered according to a traditional Chinese medicine diagnos is or a predetermined condition/problem) or non-individualised (i.e., delivered to predetermined acupressure points for a specific condition /symptom) and can be applied by a therapist to specific points using a finger, hand, elbow, or foot . The acupressure can also be self-administered or delivered by a lay caregiver and/or via an acupressure band or large bead as a replacement for finger pressure . Studies in which the acupoint is stimulated by needles or other techniques (i.e. by pressure/laser or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) are not eligible for inclusion. There are no limits on intensity, or duration of intervention and s tudies will be included irrespective of whether the intervention is delivered by a certified acupressure or shiatsu practitioner or not. Studies that include acupre ssure delivered alongside shiatsu massage and/or as a component of what is described as whole -system shiatsu therapy will be considered in the shiatsu component of the review (see Section 3.3.11 ). SRs that consider a broader question than intended for this review (e.g. assesses the effectiveness of acupressure among other interventions) will be included if the SR specifically assesses the effectiveness of acupressure independent of the other included interventions. If only a subset of studies contained within the SR meet the eligibility criteria for this review, then only those eligible primary studies as reported in the SR will be considered (see Section 3.3.11 ). Restrictions: Studies that only evaluate auricular acupressure will be excluded , due to indirectness with shiatsu . b Primary studies evaluating acupressure are excluded from the shiatsu component of the review (SR of RCTs and NRSIs). However, SRs of acupressure will be considered within the Overview of Reviews (SR of SRs) component of the review. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 20 Comparators There are no restrictions on the type of eligible comparator s, noting that the analysis will stratify the evidence into three comparisons: (i) placebo; (ii) no intervention, wait list or usual care (unless active); and (iii) other interventions (inclusive of usual care if considered active). The decision to separate placebo and no intervention has been made to account for any potential placebo effect which may occur. For instance, whil e sham interventions are designed to be a placebo, some have demonstrable clinical effects (43). Where usual care is poorly described or where usual care is described as an adjunct to shiatsu it will be considered an inactive intervention. Other comparators could include (but will not be limited to) pharmacologic treatments, manual therapies, exercise programs or other forms of physical activit y designed to improve health. Cointerventions such as diet, education programs, life style modification, or medication may be administered simultaneously to the intervention and comparison group. Studies with co interventions that are not provided within the context of shiatsu therapy will be included if all arms of a study receive the same cointerventions (i.e. the effect iveness of shiatsu is not confounded ). Restrictions: Studies comparing different styles, forms , or components of shiatsu with one another (including studies comparing shiatsu with acupressure) will be excluded. 3.1.4 Types of outcome measures Outcome role Outcomes will not be used as a criterion for including studies (or SRs) . Outcome domains of interest Outcomes are intended to align with the reasons why patients use the therapy and/or practitioners prescribe the therapy. This includes recovery, rehabilita tion, and changes in disease outcomes and symptoms ( e.g. pain, joint range of motion, strength, balance, and accepted surrogate outcomes such as HbA1C for diabetes , body mass index for weight gain or loss , lung function tests), health related psychological/behavioural outcomes, health related quality of life , self-reported benefits, symptoms and function al ability , medication use or compliance with conventional medicine treatment; and injury or disease specific prevention outcomes (e.g. falls p revention, smoking cessation). Restrictions: Consistent with the terms of reference of NTREAP, personal health care preferences, patient -reported experience measures (PREMS) (e.g. satisfaction with care ), safety , quality and economic outcomes are out of scope . Outcome measures and time points of interest Any effectiveness outcome anticipated to demonstrate a treatment achieves its intended purpose is eligible for inclusion (35, 36) . Ther e are no limit ations on time points (e.g. short and long term outcomes ) or outcome measure ( e.g. objective and subjecti ve measures such as clinical and laboratory assessment s and patient -reported outcome measures [PROMS] , preferably measured using validated tools, are eligible) . As there are a broad range of populations eligible for inclusion in the review, it is not possi ble to prespecify outcomes. All pre specified outcomes measured in each eligible SR, RCT or NRSI will be listed in the ' Characteristics of included studies ' tables; however, results will only be extracted for Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 21 those outcomes identified as critical or important to the review. For each identified population, results for a maximum of seven critical (or important ) outcomes will be reported in GRADE summary of findings (SoF) tables and corresponding evidence statements (see Section 3.3.17 ). Outcome selection will occur after identificati on of eligible studies using a pre specified approach. To avoid introducing bias, outcomes will be prioritised by the NTWC, who will be provided with a list of conditions, outcome domains and outcome measurements (including measurement tools and time points) to prioritise. This list will be derived from the outcomes reported in studies identified for inclusion in the review, and , where ava ilable , core outcome set/s for a particular condition (identified by searching COMET ). Throughout the outcome prioritisation exercise, the NTWC will remain blinded about the characteristics or results of inc luded studies (or SRs) to prevent knowledge of study results or other characteristics (such as study design) from influencing decision -making. In determining the critical and important outcomes, the NTWC will be guided by GRADE (6), and focus on the relevance and validity of outcome measures. Where appropriate, outcome domains reported using different measurement tools will be grouped and reported accordingly (see Section 3.3.8 ). Outcomes reported at different timepoints will be grouped and considered as follows: short term, intermediate term, long term, or not specified. Determining whether something is considered short, intermediate or long term for a population will be guided by the published eviden ce, the NTWC and COMET. To avoid unit -of-analysis issues associated with repeated observations (see Section 3.3.9 ), data from a single time point will be selected for each outcome, as determined by the NTWC during outcome prioritisation. Where multiple timepoints are considered critical or important to decision - making (e.g. short - and long -term remission in symptoms) , separate outcomes will be specified for each timepo int. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 22 3.2 Search methods for identification of studies 3.2.1 Electronic searches The literature search strategy (see Appendix A) was developed in Ovid (for Embase , MEDLINE , and Emcare ) based on the key element of research question (i.e. the intervention) . The search is not limited by population or outcome, but rather by study type ; with m ethodological filters for identifying SRs, RCTs , and NRSIs and exclusions for publication typ es developed and published previously (44). In developing the search strategy, we appraised and adapted the relevant search strategies provided in the 2015 Review ; wit h recent systematic reviews identified in the scoping report and studies suggested by the NTWC also reviewed to identify other potentially relevant concepts. Terms or concepts proven not suitable were removed and other terms added. No date, language or geogr aphic limitations will be applied when conducting the search. Non -English databases will not be searched. The search strategy will be adapted to suit the required syntax for the electronic bibliographic databases outlined in Table 3. Table 3 Electronic bibliographic databases to be searched Database Shia coverage of all nursing specialty areas Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (via Cochranelibrary.com) X Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Cochranelibrary.com) X PsycINFO (via OvidSP ) - coverage of behavioural science and mental health AMED (via OvidSP ) - coverage of Allied and Complementary Medicine CINAHL (via EBSCOHost ) - Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature SPORTDiscus (via EBSCOHost ) - coverage of exercise physiology, medicine, biomechanics, coaching, counselling, psychology, and sports medicine, PubMed (limited to inprocess citations and citations not indexed in MEDLINE) - to retrieve citations not yet indexed in OVID Systematic Review Data Repository (via the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) X Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Virtual Health Library (VHL) - including Lilacs (Health information from Latin America and the Caribbean countries), PAHO IRIS (institutional repos itory for information sharing), and BRISA (Regional Base of Health Technology Assessment Reports of the Americas) 3.2.2 Other sources Reference lists of key relevant articles will be checked to identify any additional studies not identified through searche s of the primary databases. The public will also be invited by the Department to submit references for published research evidence (not examined in the 2015 Review) through a public call for evidence . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 23 Grey literature is excluded, the exception being evidence reviews commissioned by Australian government bodies and other national or international bodies that are recommended by NTREAP or committee members , noting that systematic review s of primary studies are only eligible for inclusion where the intervention is specified as 'acupressure' (see Section 3.1.3 ). For 'shiatsu', any recommended evidence reviews will be us ed as a source for identifying primary studies not identified through electronic searches . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 24 3.3 Data collection and analysis In the first instance the evidence reviews will aim to assess the full breadth of eligible studies. However, where the scope of the rev iew becomes unmanageable (as determined post screening i.e. an unmanageable number of eligible citations/ populations), the scope will be narrowed to focus analysis and synthesis of evidence on populations and conditions relevant to Shiatsu practice in Australia , with a focus on evidence evaluating shiatsu first and foremost, augmented with evidence evaluating acupressure. NHMRC's NTWC will advise on the populations and conditions of interest after considering a blinded list of all eligible populations an d conditions post -screening. Populations and conditions will be selected based on objective data about practice in the Australian context (e.g. practitioner or patient surveys that report reasons for use in Australia ), where possible. Evidence for populati ons and conditions not prioritised for synthesis, will be listed in an evidence inventory to ensure that all eligible evidence is catalogued. Included studies will be critically appraised, appropriate data extracted into data extraction tables, and the results analysed and summarised into appropriate categories according to identified populations , conditions and comparators . Summary of Findings tables will be developed for up to seven critical and important outcome s, guided by the GRADE framework . 3.3.1 Inclusion decision s Studies identified in the literature searches Title/abstract screening Citations (title/abstracts) retrieved by the literature searches will be imported into EndNote and duplicates removed. Citations will then be imported to Covidence (www.covidence.org), an online tool that streamlines the screening and data extraction stages of a systematic review. Screening will be staged according to study design, starting with screening of SRs (for acupressure), then RCTs (for shiatsu ), followed by NRSIs (for shiatsu ). Each citation (titles and abstract) will be screened by one evidence re viewer who will discard ineligible studies (marked as irrelevant and tagg ed with a reason for exclusion) and retain those with relevant data or information (marked as relevant or maybe) . Where there is uncertainty regarding eligibility , a decision will be made through discussion with the lead reviewer , who will either decide to mark the citation as irrelevant or take it through to full text . Citations that are in a language other than Engl ish will be tagged and managed as described below under 'Studies published in languages other than English '. Full text screening Full text articles identified for possible inclusion in the evidence synthesis will be retrieved and assessed for inclusion by one reviewer . A pre specified , hierarchical approach , as outlined in Appendix B, will be used to annotate reasons for exclusion , with t he results of the study selection process illustrated in a PRISMA diagram. Ineligible s tudies will be marked with a reason for exc lusion and listed in a table in the technical report under 'Characteristics of excluded studies' . Where there is uncertainty regarding eligibility , a decision will be made through discussion with the lead reviewer. The lead reviewer will also reinspect a random 20% sample of articles marked as excluded to ensure adherence to the a priori exclusion criteria and any differences will be resolved by discussion. If additional expertise or advice regarding the application of the PICO criteria is requ ired, further Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 25 follow up with the NTWC will occur (noting that NTWC will be presented with exce rpts from the publication relevant to the query whil e remaining blinded to other identifying details such as the study citation, design, size, risk of bias , and results ). If a study (or SR) does not contain the required PICO information for a decision to be made regarding eligibility, the information will be sought from the study's authors through an open -ended request . Trial registration numbers, author names, and study titles, locations and dates will be used to identify multiple reports arising from the same study (or SR) . Eligible studies that are not available in English will be noted and managed as described below under 'Studies published in languages other than English ' Overviews identified in the literature search will no t be eligible for inclusion in the review but will be checked for eligible SRs. Evidence provided through the Department's public call for evidence Potentially relevant SRs and primary studies identified by the NTWC, NTREAP, and other key stakeholders will be considered for inclusion if they satisfy the eligibility criteria described in Section 3.1 above . Overviews provided through the Department's public call for evidence will be checked for eligible SRs. All of the submitted literature will be collated , tabulate d, and c ross-reference d with the evidence identified in the literature search described in Section 3.3.1 . In-scope studies (or SRs) not identified in the literature search will be incorporated in to the evidence evaluation . A rationale for exclusion (as noted in Appendix B) will be provided for all s tudies considered out of scope (documented in a table within the technical report ). Studies published in languages other than English Studies (or SRs) published in language s other than English will undergo title and abstract translation using Google translate (or an equivalent tool). If online translation does not facilitate understanding of the title and abstract, then these studies will be listed in a table as 'Studies una ble to be translated or interpreted at the title/abstract stage' . Translated titles and abstracts will be screened to remove irrelevant citations, with articles excluded at title and abstract screen reported in the 'Results of the search' . Translated title s and abstracts will be reviewed and evaluated against the ' Criteria for considering studies for inclusion in the review '. Full text translation will not occur to determine eligibility. Studies assessed as potentially eligible for inclusion in the review w ill be recorded in a 'Studies Awaiting Classification' table. This information will also be reflected in the PRISMA flow diagram. The potential risk of language bias and its implications for the evidence evaluation will be discussed in relevant sections of the Evaluation Report (such as ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence ' and ' Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews '). When assessing the extent to which language bias might influence the conclusions, we will also consider whether English -language reviews included in the acupressure component of the review searched for, and included, studies published in languages other than English. 3.3.2 Data collection process The characteristics of all included primary stud ies or SRs will be extract ed using a standard pre tested data extraction and coding form (see Appendix D). Outcome data will be extracted after Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 26 agreement has been reached regarding the critical and important outcomes to be appraised (see Section 3.1.4 ). Pre-testing will involve all reviewers, who will data extract the required information from the same two SRs (acupressure) and two primary studies (shiatsu) specifically selected to cover the breadth of the PICO and anticipated study designs identified for inclusion in the review. The lead reviewer will inspect the forms to ensure the relevant data are extracted consistently between reviewers and as planned , with any necessary revisions made to ensure consistency. All data extraction forms will be checked for completeness and accuracy by the lead reviewer. Where there is uncertainty or disagreement regarding inclu ded data , a decision will be made through discussion. Full d ata extraction (and critical appraisal) of primary studies included within a SR (for acupressure) will not occur. If a return to primary studies is required to check or confirm information, we will note any discrepancies or adjustments made. 3.3.3 Request s for data Eligible SR protocols, o ngoing trials , studies not published in English, and studies published as conference abstracts will be identified for inclusion. Study authors will be contacted through an open -ended request for data or further information. If no further data are available, the study will be noted as 'Ongoing ' or within the ' Studies Awaiting Classification' table and will not be included in the evidence appraisal. No attempts will be made to obtain or clarify data from authors of published peer -reviewed primary studies (shiatsu) or SRs (acupressure) . 3.3.4 Data items Shiatsu The following characteristics of included studies will be extracted: study design , year conducted , setting and location , participant characteristics (including demographics, comorb idities, etc. ), intervention and comparator characteristics (including number of treatment session s, program duration, cointerventions ), outcomes (including measurement method, timing, or severity) , method of analysis, and funding sources. Acupressure The following characteristics of included SRs will be extracted: review objectives, study design (e.g. qualitative review, meta -analysis), year conducted, databases searched, date (and range) of documented search, SR eligibility criteria for pa rticipant characteristics (including demographics, comorbidities, etc.), SR eligibility criteria for intervention and comparator characteristics (including number of treatment sessions, program duration, co -interventions), outcomes reported in the SR (incl uding measurement method, timing or severity), the method of synthesis/analysis employed, characteristics of included primary studies (number, study design features), risk of bias tool used to appraise included primary studies and their rating (noting revi ew authors comments or concerns), funding sources and the overall conclusion of the SR. The data extraction forms will also note whether the SR searched for and included publications in languages other than English. Included p rimary studies will also be l isted by author, date of publication and eligibility for inclusion in this review. When evaluat ing the effectiveness of acupressure across the same PICO (See Section 3.3.11 and 3.3.12 ), overlaps and omissions between SRs will be noted in a matrix (see Figure 1). Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 27 Where data from a selected SR is augmented with data obtained from an other SR this will be documented using footnotes. 3.3.5 Missing data No imputation for missing data will be conducted. Studies wi th missing data will be included alongside other studies for that condition; either in the narrative (non -quantitative) synthesis of results or on forest plots showing the sample size . Implications of the missing data will be considered when interpreting the evidence and will be discussed under 'Overall completeness and applicability of evidence' . Investigations into missing data within a study (e.g. a review of the clinical trial protoc ol) will be noted when assessing the risk of bias for that study (see Section 3.3.6 ). 3.3.6 Tools to assess risk of bias in individual studies The risk of bias of included studies will be assessed using the most appropriate risk of bias assessment tool according to the type of study as follows: SRs (acupressure): AMSTAR -2 quality assessment checklist (45) RCTs (shiatsu): Revised risk of bias tool v2.0 (46, 47) NRSIs (shiatsu): ROBIN S-I: a tool for assessing risk of bias in non -randomised studies of interventions (31, 48) Shiatsu Randomised controlled trials The risk of bias of RCTs will be assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (46, 47) . This tool is made up five domains assessing bias arising from the randomi sation process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; and bias in selection of the reported result. Each domain will be assessed for bias, which will be recorded as 'high', 'low', or ' some concerns '. An overall risk of bias for each outcome in the RCT will be judged based on the following criteria: overall low risk of bias - low risk of bias for all key domains some concerns - at least one domain has some concerns raised , but none are found to be at high risk of bias overall high risk of bias - high risk of bias for one or more key domains Nonrandomised studies interventional studies (NRSIs) Critical a ppraisal of NRSIs will be guided by the methods described by Cochrane using the ROBINS -I tool (31, 48) . Potential confounders and co interventions for each population identified for inclusion will be identified and agreed through discussion with the NTWC prior to assessment of the risk of bias. ROBINS -I evaluates the risk of bias observed in the following domains: confounding, selection of participants, classification of interventions, deviations from intended interventions, missing data, measurement of outcomes, and selective reporting . Each domain will be judged , which will be recorded as 'low', 'moderate', 'serious', 'critical', or 'no information provided'. The overall risk of bias judgement for a specific outcome will use the following guide: overall low risk of bias - the study is comparable to a well -performe d RCT and is judged to be a low risk of bias for ALL domains . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 28 overall moderate risk of bias - the study appears to provide sound evidence for a nonrandomised study but cannot be considered comparable to a well -performed randomised trial. The study is judge d to be a low or moderate risk of bias for ALL domains . overall serious risk of bias - the study has some important problems and is judged to be at serious risk of bias in at least ONE domain, but not a critical risk of bias in any domain . overall critical risk of bias - the study is too problematic with regards to this domain to provide any useful evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention. The study is judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least ONE domain . no information - there is no information on which to base a judgement about overall risk of bias. There is no clear indication that the study is at serious or critical risk of bias AND there is a lack of information in one or more key domains of bias. Studies rated as a t critical risk of bias in any domain will be excluded from the reporting of results, synthesis, and conclusion ; however, study details will be included under ' Characteristics of included studies '. Acupressure Systematic reviews The methodological quality of included s ystematic reviews will be assessed using the AMSTAR -2 quality assessment checklist (45). The AMST AR-2 consists of 16 domain questions ( see Appendix C) that are answered as 'yes', 'no', or 'partial yes' ; with a 'yes' answer denot ing a positive result. Any notable strengths or limitations of the SR (in reference to the relevant AMSTAR -2 domains ) wil l be reported . If the S R is broader in scope than the clinical question posed in th is review (i.e. includes other interventions or NRSIs not eligible for inclusion), the overall quality of the systematic review will be assessed. It is noted that the AMSTA R-2 leads to a judgement of methodological quality (or limitations) of a SR , not a judgement about risk of bias of the body of evidence included within the SR . Implications concerning relevant AMSTAR -2 items for the risk of bias of primary studies and assessing the certainty of evidence are discussed in Sections 3.3.14 and 3.3.16 .Risk of bias of included studies An independent assessment of the risk of bias of RCTs and pseudo -RCTs included with in an eligible SR will not be performed . Instead, the risk of bias of these studies (or outcomes) will be as reported within the included SR ; no further imputations will be made . A description of the quality assessment tool used to assess the studies will also be provided . Where a study is include d in multiple SRs, a cross check of the risk of bias assessment across SRs will be performed and any discrepancies will be reconciled based on available information . The best available and most comprehensive data will used when assessing the certainty of ev idence (see Section 3.3.16 ). Footnotes will be used to document the source of all information . In the absence of any risk of bias information for an individual study or when appropriate risk of bias information is not available (e.g. the SR reports risk of bias for the overall study and not at the outcome -level, or the SR does not use an appropriate tool to assess risk of bias) , inferences about risk of bias when assessing the certainty of evidence will be made as described in Section 3.3.16 . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 29 3.3.7 Risk of bias assess ment process The risk of bias for each included study or SR will be assessed by one reviewer. The lead reviewer will then check and confirm all assessments made. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, with advice sought from a third reviewer if agre ement cannot be reached . For each study or review , we will report our judgement s for each domain or item and provide a rationale for the judgement with supporting information (see Appendix C). Overall risk of bias judgements will be described in the 'Characteristics of included studie s' table. To ensure consistency among reviewers, pre -testing of risk of bias assessments will be achieved by all reviewers completing assessments for two SRs, two RCTs and two NRSIs (using AMSTAR -2, RoBv2.0 and ROBINS -I, respectively). Studies will be selected to cover the breadth of the PICO and included study design features. The lead reviewer will inspect the forms to ensure consistency , and any differences will be resolved through discussion . Shiatsu For each outcome , we will report our judg ement of risk of bias ( e.g. low, moderate, high, critical, unclear) by domain and provide a rationale for the judg eme nt with supporting information. Overall risk of bias judg ements will be described in the 'Characteristics of included studies ' table. Acupressure For each item on the AMSTAR -2 checklist, we will answer 'yes', 'no', or 'partial yes'. Limitations for each SR (including a rationale for judgements with supporting information) will be described in the 'Characteristics of included studies ' table. 3.3.8 Measures of effect Shiatsu Dichotomous data will be presented as risk ratios (RR ) with 95% confidence intervals and pvalues . Continuous data will be reported as mean difference (MD) (along with the standard deviation (SD) and number of participant s). Standardi sed mean difference (SMD) will be used when different scales are used to measure the same conceptual outcome (e.g. function ). To ensure that all the scales point in the same direction of effect, d ata from one set of studies will be adjusted before standardi sation by multiplying the mean value by -1 to be consistent with the other set of studies . Time-to-event data will be presented as hazard ratios (HR) and, if analyses of covariance have been used to adjust for baseline measures, the adjusted effec t estimates will also be recorded . To reduce effects of confounding, summary statistics from NRSIs will preferabl y be reported as adjusted effect estimates (e.g. adjusted odds ratios (OR) from logistic regression ). The variables that have been used for adj ustment will be recorded . As there are a broad range of populations eligible for inclusion in the review, it is not possible to prespecify the minimal clinically important differences for each outcome. However, where possible, the minimal clinically import ant difference will be sourced from published reports or will be guided by advice from the NTWC. Acupressure For SRs that do not report a meta -analysis for a relevant comparison because it is not appropriate to do so, effect estimates for the primary studi es will be reported (where possible) as described above for Shiatsu. If appropriate to meta -analyse, analysis will be performed as per Section 3.3.11 . Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 30 3.3.9 Unit-of-analysis issues No imputation for unit -of-analysis issues will be performed. While intervention -related clustering is a possibility in this review, it is considered unlikely that included studies will have provided adequate details to enable clusters to be accounted for in their analyses. No adjustments will be made for intervention -related clustering using a statistical method. However, where such clusters are identified, this will be noted in the relevant part of the review along with discussion of the po tential impacts of the clustering on the review findings. SRs that have included studies with potential for unit -of-analysis issues (i.e. cluster -randomised trials, crossover trials, repeated observations) will be noted in the results table, noting how the SR dealt with the unit-of-analysis issues in the ir evidence synthes is (if at all) . The implications of the unit-of-analysis issues will be considered when interpreting the evidence , with any important implications for interpreting results documented in fo otnotes to the summary of findings table . Potential unit -of-analysis issues relating to inclusion of the same study (and same group of participants ) in both the shiatsu and acupressure reviews (see Section 3.3.11 ) will also be considered when interpreting the evidence. Cluster -randomised trial To avoid a unit -of-analysis error in a cluster -randomised trial we will extract and report effect estimates from analyses undertaken by the trial authors. Information regarding the approach used to account for the cluster design will be recorded. If the study authors have not provided information relating to the method of adjustment (i.e. the estimate of the relative variability within and between clusters), the implications of the missing data will be considered when interpreting the evidence and will be discussed under ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '. Crossover trial To avoid a unit -of-analysis error in a crossover trial, only data from the first period will be included in the analysis. Studies reporting paired analysis will be discussed separately, and the potential impact of selective reporting will be discussed under ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '. Repeated observations To avoid a unit -of-analysis error in studies reporting reports from more than one timepoint, results from a single timepoint will be selected, and only data from that timepoint will be presented in the analysis. The timepoint selected will be based on that determined to the critical or important for decision -making as outlined in Section 3.1.4 . 3.3.10 Studies with more tha n two intervention groups If the included studies have multiple treatment groups, only single pairwise comparisons of the intervention with a control (i.e. placebo, no intervention or other) will be considered. If appropriate to combine like groups, we wil l combine to create a single pair wise comparison. The combining of summary statistics across groups will be as described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook (49). SRs that have included studie s with multiple treatment groups, will be noted in the results table along with discussion of how the SR dealt with the multiple treatment groups in the evidence synthes is (e.g. combining like groups to create a single pairwise comparison , double counting the placebo group in a meta -analysis ). The implications of the multiple treatment groups will be Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 31 considered when interpreting the evidence with any important implications for interpreting results documented in footnotes to the summary of findings table . 3.3.11 Meta-analysis Synthesis will only be undertaken for studies that compare shiatsu or acupressure with 'control' (stratified into 'placebo' or 'no intervention'). Results data from studies comparing shiatsu with 'other' interventions (or pooled data from SRs c omparing acupressure with 'other' interventions) will be extracted and presented in data tables (see Appendix D), but will not be synthesised further , except where requested by the NTWC . Pooled data from SRs (for acupressure) will include a list of studies contributing data. Where pooled data is not available, individuals study results will be extracted (see Section 3.3.8 ). These data will be presented as an 'evidence inventory' to provide a snapshot of the available evide nce comparing shiatsu or acupressure with 'other' interventions. The NTWC may request that data comparing shiatsu or acupressure with an 'other' intervention be synthesised, where: at least two studies compare the effect of shiatsu or acupressure with the same active comparator, and the comparator is sufficiently homogenous across studies to support synthesis, and at least two of these studies are at low or moderate risk of bias, and the comparator represents an accepted, evidence -based 'gold standard' of c are for the population in question. Such cases will be identified by the NTWC through blinded discussions with the evidence reviewer at the data synthesis stage, or prior to provision of the first draft evaluation report. Shiatsu Data from RCTs Data synthe sis of RCTs will be performed using RevMan 5. 4 and forest plots presented . Studies will be compared in appropriate group s according to population, intervention (or component thereof ) and comparator . Within each comparison we will combine effect estimates across studies for each outcome using a random effects model to take into account expected differences between studies . Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by visually inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals on the forest plots, formally test ing for heterogeneity using the Chi2 test (using a significance level of =0.1), and quantify ing heterogeneity using the I2 statistic (50). Data from NRSI s NRSIs will be analysed separately from RCTs. Where appropriate, data synthesis of NRSI s will be performed using RevMan 5. 4 and forest plots presented. Within each comparison we will combine effect estimates across studies for each outcome using a random effects model to take into account expected differences between studies. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by visually inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals on the forest plots, formally testing for heterogeneity using the Chi2 test (usin g a significance level of =0.1), and quantifying heterogeneity using the I2 statistic (50). Effect estimates will only be combined if the included NRSIs are judged to be at low to moderate risk of bias for that outcome (see Section 3.3.6 ) and are sufficiently homogenous to be combined. This means the PICO criteria of the NRSIs must be sufficiently similar and the study design features should be comparable. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 32 Acupressure Data from SRs If there are several eligible SRs identified that evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure across the same PICO, preference will be given to extracting pooled results (where available) from the best available source ( e.g. the most recent and comprehensive SR) based on the process outlined in Figure 1. Where the selecte d meta -analysis result identifies all available studies across the breadth of the PICO (i.e. all eligible comparisons and outcomes for a population or condition) , pooled data from the selected SR will be presented with no further data synthesis ; that is, summary effect estimates (95% confidence intervals, pvalues) will be extracted as reported by the SR authors. The effect estimates of the primary studies will not be extracted, however the individual studies contributing data will be recorded. The meta -analysis model fitted, number of included studies, and any reported measures of heterogeneity will be included (e.g. I2 statistic and associated p-value). If available, the certainty of evidence (GRADE) (and any sensitivity analysis) will also be recorded. Where studies identified for inclusion in the shiatsu component of this review are also included within a meta -analysis (for acupressure), they will be excluded from the acupressure component by removal of the appropriate data from the meta -analy sis (where possible). This is to avoid duplicate reporting of results. If it is not possible to remove the data from the meta -analysis, then the implications for reporting bias (e.g. unit of analysis issues associated with duplicate reporting within the re view) will be discussed under ' Potential biases in the review process ' and any indirectness within the SR (for acupressure) considered during the GRADE assessment . Where the selected SR result does not include all eligible studies for a given comparison an d outcome (or includes studies that are ineligible for inclusion ), the meta -analysis reported by the selected SR will be updated (or re-analysed ). Data from all eligible studies will be included, and any ineligible studies removed (where possible) . The decision to re -analyse data will be determined by whether : PICO characteristics of an y additional stud ies are judged to be sufficiently similar (based on comparison s relevant to the Overview question, rather than individual SR questi ons), required summary statistics are available (or able to be calculated) for that study , the SR presents sufficient data to facilitate the addition of eligible studies or removal of any studies ineligible for inclusion in this Overview , and the inclusio n of results from the additional study or studies are likely to change the direction of effect (i .e. where the direction of effect is inconsistent with the pooled estimate of effect) . Where a meta -analysis of a n eligible SR is found to include an ineligibl e study (e.g., includes other interventions or study designs not eligible for inclusion in this review) , re-analysis will involve removal of the ineligible data from the meta -analysis (where possible). If it is not possible to remove the data from the meta -analysis, then the implications for indirectness will be considered during the GRADE assessment (see Section 3.3.16 ) If, for a comparison, there is a mix of quantitative and qualitative data that is unable to be quantitatively synthesised (e.g. due to incomplete data or missing information), then a structured summary of the results will be presented (see Section 3.3.12 ). Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 33 If the best -available SR does not report a meta -analysis for a relevant comparison, and it is appropriate to do so, data synthesis will be performed using RevMan 5. 4 and forest plots presented (see Section 3.3.8 ). Within each comparison we will combine effect estimates across studies for each outcome using a random effects model to take into account expected differences between studies. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by visually inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals on the forest plots, formally testing for heterogeneity using the Chi2 test (using a significa nce level of =0.1), and quantify heterogeneity using the I2 statistic (50). For SRs where the meta -analysis or primary study results are incompletely reported (e.g. no effect estimate is reported, but the dire ction of effect is reported along with a pvalue), we will report the available information (see Section 3.3.8 ). If the reported information allows for calculation of effect estimates or imputation of missing statistics ( e.g. SD), we will perform the calculations as described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook (49). Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 34 Figure 1 Framework for selecting the SR from which to extract data, for any given comparison and outcome for acupressure Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 35 3.3.12 Summary and synthesis when meta -analysis is not possible The evidence review will provide a structure d summary of the results for each condition identified, that will include risk of bias assessments (of primary studies) , and other intervention characteristics, in tables structured by intervention (shiatsu [further delineated to multi - or single component s], or acupressure), comparator ('placebo ', 'control ', or 'other ' intervention ), outcome domain , study design ( ordered and grouped by evidence from SRs, RCT s, NRSIs ), then risk of bias and study size . Where possible, a visual representation of the results of included studies will be presented in a forest plot (without a summary estimate) grouped by study design features a nd risk of bias. Shiatsu The narrative summary will include a brief description of the condition and studies identified (including study design features , size, and population demographics). This will be followed by a summary of results grouped by intervention, comparator , and outcome domain. For shiatsu, result s from each primary study will be reported, with the range and magnitude of observed effects not ed. For studies where the results are incompletely reported (i.e. no effect estimate is reported, but the direction of effect is reported along with a pvalue), we will report the available information. To describe an overall effect across multiple studies for each outcome (for studies comparing shiatsu with control [placebo, or no intervention ] only) , we will use a simple vote count based on direction of effect (e.g. X/Y studies reported an effect favouring the intervention for the outcome Z and A/Y studie s reported no difference between groups (total participants , range of effect size s [or other value s] reported ). We were unable to perform a meta -analysis for this outcome because [add in reasons] ..). Studies that are judged to be at low risk of bias and ar e powered to demonstrate an effect will take precedence over studies that are underpowered and or judged to be at moderate or high risk of bias (i.e., will be called out and highlighted in the text). Any important differences in study size or design featur es that may influence the interpretation of results will be considered and discussed in the text. Qualitative descriptors describing the size of the effect (small, large etc.) will be used only where appropriate and will be based on the smallest difference that patients perceive as beneficial (or detrimental) for that outcome. Acupressure The narrative summary will include a brief description of the condition and reviews identified (including review criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies, population demographics and other key features). A ny notable weaknesses within a review, or inconsistency across reviews will be recorded . This will be followed by a summary of results grouped by intervention, comparator and outcome domain. Details regarding the nu mber of studies and number of participants that inform the data will be included, with a brief statement regarding any overlap of primary studies provided. Any important differences in review criteria or in control group risks that may influence the interp retation of results will be considered and discussed in the text. If there are several eligible SRs identified that evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure across the same PICO, results will be reported from the selected SR based on pre -specified criteria , as outlined in Figure 1. In the absence of supplementary quanti tative data, results from additional studies identified in other SRs will be describe d, with the range and distribution of observed effects noted. Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 36 To describe the overall effect, a simple vote count based on direction of effect will be used (e.g. XX RCTs w ere identified in the SR by YY, who reported a pooled effect favouring the intervention for outcome ZZ ( MH fixed effects; effect size ; 95%CI ; p-value, I2; GRADE). One additional RCT was identified (by SR) that also reported an effect favouring the interven tion, however we were unable to add this to the quantitative synthesis because [add in reasons]...). Any important features of the additional studies that may influence the interpretation of results (e.g. risk of bias. study size, power) will be called out a nd highlighted in the text . 3.3.13 Risk of reporting bias across studies Given the size and breadth of this review, it is expected that a broad approach to data synthesis will transpire. This means, summary estimates will include an outcome domain ( e.g. pain) me asured at a rough time point ( e.g. latest timepoint reported), using any instrument. This will increase the number of studies that will be eligible for inclusion in a summary estimate. As noted in Section 3.3.5 , the implications for missing data within studies will be considered when interpreting the evidence. Similarly, judgements regarding missing data across studies will be made based on available information (e.g. from 'Studies awaiting classification ' etc.) and discussed under ' Overall completeness and applicability of evidence ', noting that approaches for assessing bias due to missing studies (such as additional searching of clinical trial regist ers, grey literature, or other reports) will not be performed. Shiatsu If more than 10 RCTs are included for a particular PICO , funnel plots (of effect estimates against their standard errors) will be generated using RevMan 5. 4 so as to determine possible reporting biases. If, after visual inspection of the funnel plot there is evidence of asymmetry (suggesting small -study effects or missing results ), a brief statement about the potential impact on the overall conclusions of the evidence review will be incl uded under the relevant sections of the review (including the 'Overall completeness and applicability of evidence' ). Other possible reasons for funnel plot asymmetry will also be considered at this time (e.g. poor methodological quality, true heterogeneity , chance) (51). No additional statistical analysis for testing for small -study effects will be conducted. Acupressure Reporting biases identified within SRs will be as described by the review authors. Any variability across reviews and any important flaws in individual reviews will be discussed under 'Quality of the evidence' . 3.3.14 Addressing risk of bia s Shiatsu All RCTs will be included in the review, regardless of judgement s made regarding risk of bias . A description of the risk of bias in individual domains will be presented along with the estimated effect estimate d using the risk of bias visualisation tool (52). To examine the impact of risk of bias, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted, with studies judged to be at high risk of bias to be removed from the analysis . The impact of this change will be noted and discussed under ' Quality of evidence '. NRSIs rated as being at critical risk of bias across one or more domain will not be included in the reporting of results, synthesis, and conclusion . A brief statement about the impact of the exclusion of NRSIs with critical risk of bias on the overall conclusions of the evidence review will be included Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 37 under the relevant sections of the review (including the 'Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '). Acupressure All eligible SRs will be included in the review, regardless of judgements made regarding methodological quality , noting that : methodological flaws in an SR do not reflect the risk of bias at the primary study level, which is the level at which results are synthesised, and the framework in Figure 1 aims to preferentially report results from SRs with fewer methodological limitations for a ny given comparison and /or PICO . No formal analysis specifically addressing the risk of bias at the SR-level will be conducted; however, where there are concerns related to the methodological quality of a SR (e.g. due to concerns with study eligibility criteria, methods used to identify, select, or appraise studies, or concerns with interpretation of findings) we will attempt to mitigate the potential bias by cross -checking data across SRs, re -analysing and re -interpreting results , or returning to the primary study to check data . A brief s tatement about the impact of any changes made to the evidence reported by a SR (e.g., removal of a study due to inappropriate inclusion, change to the risk of bias assessment for that study, update on the data reported by the SR because they reported an in correct number ) on the overall conclusions of the evidence review will be included under the relevant sections of the review (including the 'Overall completeness and applicability of evidence '). Judgements regarding the risk of bias of primary studies will be based on that reported in the SRs. If sensitivity analys es have been reported ( e.g. removal of studies judged to be at high risk of bias), these will be considered as part of the GRADE assessment for that result (see Section 3.3.16 ). 3.3.15 Subgroup analys es We do not plan to undertake pre-specified subgroup analyses of su bsets of participants within studies . For shiatsu, if there is inconsistency between effect estimates, subgroup analysis will be used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity relating to delivery of the intervention (e.g. intensity, mode of delivery, w ho delivers). A standard test for heterogeneity across the subgroups will be reported. For acupressure, sources of inconsistency between SR s for the same PICO will be considered by exploring eligibility criteria of the reviews as well as PICO characteristi cs within the included studies to provide a hypothesis for future reviews. 3.3.16 Certainty of the evidence Across each population , we will assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach (6). Evidence for shiatsu and acupress ure will be evaluated separately , as will evidence from RCTs and NRSIs (shiatsu only) . Further, only (or acupressure) with 'placebo' and 'no intervention' will be presented (in separate 'Summary of Findings' tables) . The GRADE process provides a framework for determining the certainty of the evidence and is based on consideration of the following five factors : Risk of bias. Based on the summary assessment of bias across studies for each outcome reported for a comparison (53). Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 38 Inconsistency. Based on heterogeneity in the observed intervention effects across studies that suggests important differences in the effect of the intervention and whether this can be explained (54). Imprecision. Based on interpretation of the upper and lower confidence limits in relation to a clinically important threshold (i.e., the confidence interval includes both appreciable benefit and harm); and whether the optimal information size has been reached (i.e., t he total number of patients meets the required sample size for a sufficiently powered individual study). In the absence of a published clinically important threshold a rough guide will be used (i.e., a 25% relative risk reduction or increase) (55). Indirectness. Based on important differences between the r eview questions and the characteristics of included studies that may lead to important differences in the intervention effects (56). Publication bias. Based on the extent to which the evidence is available. Publication bias would be suspected when the evidence is limited to a small number of small trials (57). The certainty of evidence will be categorised as follows : High ( ): further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate ( ): further research is likely to have an important impact in the confidence in the estimate of effect. Low ( ): further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low ( ): any estimate of effect is very uncertain. For each domain , a judgement will be made about whether there are serious, very serious or no concerns; resulting in an overall GRADE describing the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Footnotes will be used to record judgements made about downgrading (or upgrading) the evidence (see 'Summary of findings ' table ). Scoring of t he certainty of the evidence will begin as 'high' for RCTs and NRSIs (score= 4), which can be downgraded by -1 for each domain with serious concerns or -2 for very serious concerns (6, 58) . The certainty of evidence can also be upgraded in certain circumstances . Factor s that will be considered for upgrading the evidence include the following: Large magnitude of an effect. When large or very large effect estimates are observed, and there is more confidence in the results (sufficient number of events to be precise). Dose -response gradient . When there is a clear relation between outcome and increasing exposure levels . Effect of plausible residual confounding. If there are clear factors that have likely led to an under -estimate of the true effect such as unmeasured or unkno wn determinants in the adjusted analysis that are likely to be distributed unequally between intervention and control groups (6). Acupressure Where the selected SR has reported a GRADE certainty of evidence for a PICO, we will replicate that information in the Overview, adjusting for any important differences between the eligibility criteria Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 39 of the SR and the Overview (i.e., we will assess indirectness of the evidence in relation to the overview PICOs) . If the PICO from the selected SR has been reanalysed through the removal of studies that do not meet the review PICO (see Section 3.3.11 ) the GRADE assessment (if available) will be revised to reflect the totality of the evidence. If the PICO from the selected SR has been updated with supplementary data (see Section 3.3.11 Data from SRs ) the GRADE assessment (if available) will be revised to reflect the totality of the evidence. If the selected SR has not evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, a de novo GRADE assessment will be performed. In the absence of enough information from the selected SR (or other SRs) to inform our judgements for a certain GRADE domain (e.g. risk of bias, imprecision), the certainty of the evidence will be determined by the following system (adapted from the NHMRC Report on the Evid ence: promoting social and emotional development and wellbeing of infants in pregnancy and the first year of life ) (59): Where information regarding one domain is missing and there are n o apparent concerns or reasons to downgrade : GRADE certainty of the evidence will be presented as a range including the rating based on the available information and one level lower to account for uncertainty in the rating (e.g. an outcome has serious concerns due to risk of bias, but there is no informati on on imprecision, then the overall certainty of evidence will be judged to be 'moderate to low quality '). Where information regarding one domain is missing and there is some indication that the factor with missing information should be downgraded : the overall certainty of evidence will be downgraded based on the available information, and presented with 'assumed' in brackets . Footnotes will be used to record assumptions judgements made about downgrading the evidence in the absence of information. Where information regarding two features is not reported : the overall quality of the evidence will be judged to be 'unclear'. Any weaknesses in the reporting of included SRs that may impact the finding of the Overview will be considered and discussed under 'Overall completeness and applicability of evidence ' and 'Potential biases in the overview process '. 3.3.17 'Summary of findings ' table s For each population, findings for the critical and important outcomes (see Section 3.1.4 ), will be reported in 'Summary of Findings ' tables that will be prepared using the GRADEpro GDT software (www.gradepro.o rg). The findings NRSIs ) and for acupressure (from SRs ) will be presented separately. Estimates of treatment effects for each outcome will be reported as absolute and relative risks (or standardised means) . In the absence of quan titative data, a narrative synthesis will be provided (see Section 3.3.12 ). All critical and important outcomes will be reported, regardless of whether the findings demonstrate a clinically meaningful change. The 'Summary of Findings ' tables will provide a summary o f each of the included critical and important outcomes and the certainty of evidence rating for each outcome in a quick and accessible Research Protocol HTANALYSTS | NHMRC | EVIDENCE EVALUATION ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SHIATSU 40 format (6). As part of the summary of findings table, an evidence statement pertaining to each outcome will be included. This statement will be guided by the f ollowing format: The practice of shiatsu / acupressure in [population] [is suggested to, may, results] in [little to no effect, reduce, increase, promote etc.] on [outcome] compared with [placebo or control ]. A technical report that presents, in detail, the evidence base for each research question by outcome will be developed and will include the following: the methodology used to identify the evidence base (documented systematic literature search, inclusion and exclusion criteria described ), the characteristics of the included studies , including data extraction and risk of bias forms , and detailed results, presented by population and outcome , contain ing complete information about the evidence assessment .

Bias due to deviations from intended interventions High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe the method used to conceal t reatment allocation : were participants aware of their assigned intervention during the trial ? were carers and people delivering the interventions aware of participants' assigned intervention during the trial ? consider the potential effect of deviations due to assignment and deviations due to adherence Bias due to missing outcome data High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe the compl eteness of outcome data for each primary/secondary outcome, including whether data for this outcome were available for all, or nearly all, participants randomi sed; (if applicable) there was evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data; (if applicable) missingness in the outcome was likely to depend on its true value (e.g. the proportions of missing outcome data, or reasons for missing outcome data, differ between intervention groups). Bias in measurement of the outcome High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe whether: the method of measuring the outcome was inappropriate; measurement or ascertainment of the outcome could have differed between intervention groups; outcome assessors were aware of the intervention received by study participants; (if applicable) assessment of the outcome was likely to have been influenced by knowledge of intervention received. Bias in selection of the reported result High risk Some concerns Low risk Describe whether: the trial was analysed in accordance with a pre specified plan that was finali sed before unblinded outcome data were available for analysis; the numerical result being assessed is likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple outcome measurements within th e outcome domain; the numerical result being assessed is likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple analyses of the data.
