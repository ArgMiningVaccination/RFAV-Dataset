For this reason, infection preventionists and laboratory professionals need to understand the roles each must play and work together to improve patient outcomes. To facilitate this, APIC partnered with the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) to create the IP Col-Lab-oration project, part of the Building Bridges program.* The goals of the IP Col-lab-oration project are as follows: To increase communication and understanding between laboratory professionals and infection preven- tionists To educate in the common areas of infection prevention and microbiology that include surveillance viadiagnostics/ screening for resistant organism carriage, and targeted disease trending over time. To equip infection preventionists and laboratory professionals with educational resources and tools thatwill lead to improved outcomes through better integration of effort and communication. The Infection Preventionist's Guide to the Lab was developed to provide infection preventionists with a basic under - standing of various lab tests and microbiology disciplines. This book supports infection preventionists in mak - ing informed decisions about surveillance and patient placement. While the development of this book began before the launch of the IP Col-lab-oration Project, it became clear that the goals of the book and the project were aligned. As a result, our collaborative partner, ASM, provided additional technical review of this resource. APIC is grateful to the editors, David Taylor and Pat Kulich, the eleven chapter authors, additional contribu - tors, and many reviewers from APIC and ASM who worked together to make this resource a reality. Our hope is that this resource in conjunction with the IP Col-lab-oration Project will usher in a new era of im - proved infection prevention practice that lowers healthcare associated infection, reduces the trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens, and improves the quality of care given to all our patients. Those of us involved in this project are grateful for the opportunity to participate and share the excitement of our two great societies in the exciting future we will better share together. Lillian A. Burns, MT , MPH, CIC and Lance R. Peterson, MD Lead Clinical Advisors, IP Col-lab-oration project * About Building Bridges: In the beginning of 2010, APIC created the Building Bridges program to improve patient outcomes bybuilding bridges between infection preventionists and stakeholders across the continuum of care. Funded by educational grants, eachproject focuses on one specific area related to infection prevention and dives deep with a key society partner or partners. Guiding theproject is a clinical advisory council of subject matter experts from each participating society. The advisory council produces educa - tional programs and resources. To learn more about the Building Bridges program, visit www.apic.org/buildingbridges.vi | The In FecTIon Preven TIonIsT's Gu Ide To The Lab Preface This resource was created to help the infection preventionist better understand the laboratory and its applications to infection prevention. It covers many topics within the discipline of microbiology as well as the various functions of the laboratory itself. The authors were chosen due to their expertise in the laboratory field as well as their experience in or relationship to infection prevention. This book is intended to be a quick reference guide rather than an exhaustive laboratory text. Each chapter focuses on a specific type of laboratory test or microbiology discipline and its applicability to the infection preventionist, and includes an introduction, one or more tables, and a list of references. A collaborative relationship between infection prevention and the laboratory is important to achieve the common goal of improving patient outcomes. If readers have questions or need further clarification regarding a specific laboratory test or results, they are encouraged to consult with the clinical laboratory associated with their facility . As editors, we are extremely proud of the hard work of all the contributing authors and content reviewers. We feel it will provide valuable insight into the world of the clinical laboratory and how that world impacts the practicing infection preventionist. Good reading - and enjoy .

The pri - mary goals of the DML are to identify the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in clinical samples, predict response to antimicrobial therapy, and assist the infection prevention department as needed in epidemiological investigation. A variety of methods can be used to identify microorganisms in clinical specimens. Methods used in the DML in the diagnosis of infection are (1) classical methods (direct smear, culture, antigen detection, serological tests) and (2) molecular methods (hybridization, nucleic acid amplification, real-time amplification). The DML is an essential component of an effective infection prevention program. Changes in microbiological diagnostic techniques, such as rapid diagnosis and typing methods, have strengthened the role of microbiology laboratory in infection prevention. The partnership between the infection preventionist and the DML medical microbiologist is crucial in combating healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The appropriate selection, collection, and transport of specimens to the DML is an essential part in the ac - curate laboratory identification of microorganisms that cause infections which affect patient care and infection prevention. Specimen collection guidelines include: Use standard precautions for collecting and handling all clinical specimens. Utilize appropriate collection device(s). Use sterile equipment and aseptic technique to collect specimens. Collect specimens during the acute phase of illness (or within 2 to 3 days for viral infections). Collect specimens before administration of antibiotics wherever possible. Avoid contamination with indigenous flora from surrounding tissues, organs, or secretions. Optimize the capture of anaerobic bacteria from specimens by using proper procedures. Collect a sufficient volume of specimen to ensure that all tests requested may be performed. Inadequate amounts of specimen may yield false-negative results. Label specimens properly with patient's name and identification number, source, specific site, date, time of collection, and initials of collector. Provide clear and specific instructions on proper collection techniques to patients when they must collect their own specimens. 2|The Infec TIon Preven TIonIsT's Gu Ide To The Lab Transportation guidelines include: All specimens must be promptly transported to the laboratory, preferably within 2 hours of collection. -Delays or exposure to temperature extremes compromises the test results. Specimens should be transported in a container designed to ensure survival of suspected agents. -Never refrigerate spinal fluid, genital, eye, or internal ear specimens because these samples may contain microorganisms sensitive to temperature extremes. Materials for transport must be labeled properly, packaged, and protected during transport. -A transport medium can be used to preserve the viability of microorganisms in clinical samples (e.g. Stuart, Amies, and Carey-Blair transport media). Use leak-proof specimen containers and transport them in sealable, leak-proof plastic bags. Never transport syringes with needles attached to the laboratory. Laboratories must have enforceable criteria for rejection of unsuitable specimens.

Laboratory specialties for detection of clinically important and disease-causing microbes (pathogens) include microbiology, virology, parasitology, mycology (fungi), mycobacteriology, surgical pathology, and molecular diagnostics. This chapter reviews laboratory tests utilizing microscopy (routine and special staining procedures) and mi - crobiological cultures (see Table 2-2). It is very important to select the appropriate specimen to be submitted, ensure appropriate timing of collection, and utilize the correct method of collection to maximize recovery of potential pathogen(s) for diagnosis of an infectious process. Please refer to Chapter 1, Specimen Collection and Transport, for more information regarding these factors. No single laboratory test is available that permits isolation of all possible pathogens. Clinical information, such as tentative diagnosis and suspected type of infection, aids in the selection of the proper media and incubation conditions for the isolation of the suspected pathogens . The specimen type will determine other culture require - ments for the suspected pathogen(s) as outlined in the facility's laboratory protocol. For example, a stool sent for bacterial culture is appropriate when bacterial gastroenteritis (e.g., shigellosis, Campylobacter infection, typhoid fever) is suspected. A stool specimen order for ova and parasites is submitted for the detection of amebiasis, giardiasis, or intestinal parasitic \"worms.\" An order for norovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is indicated when the presence of this specific virus in a stool specimen is clinically relevant. Important considerations regarding specimens and types of cultures Specimens for bacterial and fungal culture must be collected prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy. This will ensure that organisms present in the specimen are viable for growth in culture. A culture result can only accurately depict the infectious process if the specimen is adequate. Laboratory collection manuals provide specific specimen collection directions to ensure an optimal specimen. A sufficient quantity of specimen must be submitted to ensure that all of the requested tests can be per - formed. The process of \"splitting\" a specimen for multiple tests must be done in a way that does not contaminate or compromise the specimen prior to setting up cultures. Surveillance cultures require specimens from patient sites, and occasionally from environmental sites, that are known to be implicated as an ongoing source of the organism in question, as may be the case for methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Acinetobacter, and other organisms. When doing surveillance cultures of patients, knowledge of the usual sites of colonization or infection will deter - mine specimen type. Environmental surveillance cultures require knowledge about preferred sites in which the organism persists. Surveillance cultures may be considered necessary based on an outbreak analysis or may be indicated by the facility's ongoing infection prevention risk assessment. In either case, the infection prevention -22 | TheInfec TIonPreven TIonIsT'sGu IdeT oTheLab ist must define a surveillance plan and a standardized process consistent with evidence-based, expert guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other recognized professional organizations when implementing a surveillance culture intervention or program. The reader is referred to the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee's 2006 Management of Multidrug-resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings guideline for evidence-based guidance on this topic. Microscopy Defined and Described Microscopy is the science of observing images of objects (e.g., cells, microbes) that cannot be seen by the un - aided eye. The most common type of microscopy performed in the microbiology lab is bright-field microscopy, in which visible light is used to illuminate a magnified image of an object. In order for the object to be best ob - served, as well as provide information about the structural and physiologic makeup of the cell, chemicals with well-known characteristics in staining (coloring) cells are used. The most widely used stain in the microbiology laboratory is the Gram stain, which is used to make visible and, in certain well-defined ways, to differentiate kinds of bacteria and cells (e.g., white blood cells). The Gram stain includes four chemicals, each providing a crucial step in the process that distinguishes a Gram-positive (purple staining) cell from a Gram-negative (pink/red staining) cell (see Figure 2-1). A Gram stain of a specimen, when appropriate, can provide immediate information about an infectious process. Organisms isolated from culture are Gram stained to determine which additional tests must be done to quickly and accurately identify the or - ganism and provide a culture result. Other stains and microscopy techniques are used by laboratory professionals to characterize specific organisms or tissues that may contain pathogens, including wet preps, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, dark field microscopy, acid fast stains, and electron microscopy. Table 2-1 provides an overview of Gram stain terminol - ogy and results. Microbial Cultures Defined and Described A microbiologic culture is a laboratory technique used to grow (cultivate) bacteria and yeast. A culture of a clini - cal specimen can yield polymicrobial growth (more than one type of bacteria cultivated in culture), pure culture (single bacterial strain cultivated in culture), or no growth (no bacteria recovered from clinical specimen). Identification of the bacteria or yeast grown in culture results in a genus and species designation written in italics (e.g., S. aureus\u2014 genus first, species second). On occasion, and if sufficiently significant for identification purposes, microbes are identified by genus only (e.g., Staphylococcus sp., where sp. stands for species, plural spp.) signifying that the isolate is a member of the group referred to as staphylococci; or genus plus a laboratory dis - tinguishing characteristic (e.g., coagulase negative Staphylococcus ).Figure 2-1: Gram stain 1. Add crystal violet dye to thin smear of specimen or bacterial cell mixture dried onto a microscope slide to stain cells purple. 2. Add Gram's iodine solution (mordant) to form a large complex between the crystal violet and iodine. 3. Add decolorizer (ethyl alcohol/acetone)\u2014the crystal violet iodine complex is trapped in a Gram-positive cell but can escape from a Gram-negative cell (related to makeup of the cell outer membrane). 4. Add counterstain (safranin), which stains a decolorized Gram-negative cell red but does not affect the purple color of the Gram-positive cells that were not decolonized in previous step. Note: Gram stain results always give the staining characteristic plus the morphologic shape of the microbe. Gram-negative bacillus (bacilli = plural), AKA Gram-negative rod, refers to pink, cylindrically-shaped microbes. Gram-positive bacillus (bacilli = plural), AKA Gram-positive rod, refers to purple, cylindrically-shaped microbes. Gram-negative coccus (cocci plural) refers to pink, spherically-shaped microbes. (cocci = plural) refers to purple, spherically-shaped microbes.chaPTer2:cuLTuresandGrams TaIns | 23 When clinically significant, the growth on cultures may be quantified or semiquantified. An example of a quantified culture result is typical in urine cultures (e.g., 50,000 colony-forming units [CFU] Escherichia coli ). An example of a semiquantitative result is typical in throat culture (e.g., heavy growth Group A Streptococcus pyo - genes). Some cultures do not require a quantitative result (e.g., blood culture positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae ). Microbiology Techniques Laboratory professionals perform many tests to identify the microbes isolated in cultures and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities for clinically significant microbes. It is outside the scope of this chapter to review these techniques in depth, so a brief synopsis of bacterial culture techniques and aids are provided here. Growth media, broth (liquid), or agar (solid or semisolid) that provide nutrients microbes required for growth Basic media: nonselective, most organisms will grow (e.g., blood agar, BHI broth, chocolate agar), colony morphology is part of the identifying workup for bacteria grown on solid media (agar) Selective media: incorporates antibiotics or inhibitory chemicals to inhibit growth of unwanted type of bacteria and/or preferentially encourage growth of significant bacteria Different media: incorporates dyes or chemicals (usually carbohydrates) that provide preliminary organ - ism identification Indicator (e.g., chromagenic) media: incorporates indicator(s) that permits identification of certain signifi - cant bacteria based on uptake of a dye or development of a color Optimal incubation parameters are provided as required by different bacteria Temperature requirements Nutrient requirements Incubation atmosphere (O2, CO2, etc.) requirements Time required for sufficient growth and further testing; 24 to 48 hours for indigenous flora and many mi - crobial pathogens, 4 to 6 weeks for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc. Additional time required for susceptibility testing of isolates recovered from culture (24 to 48 hours) Differential Testing Tests of biochemical responses and carbohydrate fermentation for organism identification Tests for microbe specific enzymes, and toxins (e.g., coagulase test, catalase test) Motility tests Germ tube test (yeast) Direct fluorescent antibody tests for specific bacteria Latex agglutination (e.g., determining streptococci groups; group A Strep- tococcus agalactiae , etc.) Special Methods Molecular testing methodologies have greatly enhanced the speed, specificity, and sensitivity of tests for clini - cally significant microbes. Examples of molecular testing methods are PCR, pulse field gel electrophoresis, Western blot assay, enzyme linked immunoassays, and molecular genotypic assays. Final Note Infection preventionists and clinical providers rely greatly on the microbiology laboratory for information crucial to infection prevention interventions and for clinical decision making. The work of the microbiology laboratory is instrumental in surveillance programs for detecting emerging significant and multidrug resistant pathogens, public health or facility outbreaks, and potential bioterrorism events. A strong, ongoing partnership between microbiology laboratory professionals and infection preventionists should remain a top priority in all infection prevention programs to ensure maximum patient safety and positive patient outcomes.24 | TheInfec TIonPreven TIonIsT'sGu IdeT oTheLab Table 2-1: Type and Prep TimeOrganism Morphology and Staining CharacteristicsSpecific Microbe Examples (not all-inclusive) Key Points and Clarifications Bright Field Microscopy Gram stain: 3 minutes Gram-positive cocci \"in chains\" Peptostreptococcus , Clusters of cocci of staphylococci can be referred to as \"grape-like\" Latin baculum meaning rod pleomorphic, variable organisms may appear as variably purple or partly pink (not uni - formly stained) Gram variable rods Bacillus spp., Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive rods with internal spores (endospores) do not stain where the spore is located within the organism Gram-negative cocci Neisseria (pairs \"diplococci \"), KingellaCoccobacillary means rounded Acinetobacter has shape) pair = two pairs in a square Pleomorphic means nonuniform shape Bipolar \"safety pin\" Burkholderia ) Spirochetes Treponema, Borrelia, Leptospira Gram stain is not usually effective for detection of spirochetes May be detected by darkfield or fluores - cent microscopy Yeast Cryptococ - cus, Aspergillus, Blastomyces, Coccidioides Special stains may be used (Gram stain not always effective) Larger than bacteria, budding yeast and/ or branching hyphae may be described Acid fast stain: 2 hours Nocardia , Cryptosporidium Used for organisms that cannot be stained using Gram stain Longer staining process Methods: Ziehl-Neelsen, Kinyoun techniques Wet mount: 1 minute No stain used, check for fungi or parasites;

Available at: MPA, CIC, CLS(ASCP) Hospitalizations for sepsis have more than doubled in the United States between the years 2000 and 2008 ac - cording to a recent report released by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.1 Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey, 2008 shows a dramatic increase in the number of sepsis cases from 326,000 in 2000 to 727,000 in 2008. As the U.S. population has aged, increased use of invasive devices, extended device dwell time, increased antimicrobial use, and emerging antimicrobial resistance have all contributed to rising num - bers of sepsis cases. Due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with septicemia, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential. The laboratory test that is used to detect the presence of microorganisms in the blood is the blood culture. Bacteremia types According to the Manual for Clinical Microbiology , there are several types of bacteremia, depending on the source from which bacteria enters the bloodstream. Primary bacteremia refers to the presence of bacteria in the blood in the absence of an identifiable source or as the result of \"silent\" subclinical passage of bacteria from normally colonized sites in the body. This commonly occurs after dental procedures with no clinically significant sequel - ae. Secondary bacteremia refers to bacteria that enter the bloodstream from a primary site such as the lungs or a remote wound infection. Intermittent bacteremia occurs when bacteria are present in the blood for periods of time followed by nonbacteremic episodes. Continuous bacteremia occurs when patients with intravascular sites of infection such as endocarditis experience continuous seeding of the blood from a remote site. Many of these patients have very low quantities of bacteria in their blood, in spite of severe clinical symptoms. 2 Primary and secondary bacteremia can result in sepsis, septic shock, or severe sepsis. Symptoms such as fever, chills, and tachycardia indicate sepsis, and the presence of hypotension along with sepsis indicates septic shock. Acute organ dysfunction, secondary to severe sepsis, has a 20 to 40 percent mortality rate. Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with any type of sepsis, blood cultures have become the focal point of the sepsis workup and are critical to prompt diagnosis and treatment. 2 The Manual for Clinical Microbiology defines infective endocarditis (IE) as \"an infection of the lining of the heart chambers and valves. IE occurs when bacteremia or fungemia delivers infectious organisms to the surface of one or more heart valves where they adhere and eventually invade the valvular leaflets.\"3 As with sepsis, blood culture results are vital to the diagnosis and management of patients with IE. Current culture techniques al - low positive blood cultures to be obtained in more than 90 percent of infective endocarditis cases.4 Continuous bacteremia is often the result of IE and, because of this, the timing of specimen collection for blood cultures is less important. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommends that blood cultures be collected 30 minutes prior to starting empiric antimicrobial therapy. 2 Theroleofbloodculturesininfectionpreventionandsurveillance With the advent of public reporting of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in many states and the recent CMS reporting requirements linked to Medicare reimbursement, there is significant interest in the collection and interpretation of blood cultures for confirmation of central venous catheter (often called central lines The CRBSI and CLABSI are often used interchangeably to describe bloodstream infections linked to intravascular catheters. However, it is important that clinicians and infection preventionists understand differences between the definitions of CRBSI and CLABSI to avoid misclassification.2 CRBSI CRBSI is a rigorous clinical definition that requires specific laboratory testing to identify a catheter as the source of the BSI. The CRBSI definition is not used for surveillance, but rather for clinical research or deter - mining diagnosis and treatment. 2 To determine that an infection is directly related to the presence of the vascular access catheter, specific diag - nostic criteria must be met. These criteria include one the following diagnostic tests: A positive semiquantitative (>15 colony-forming units [CFU/catheter segment]) or quantitative (>103 CFU/catheter segment) cultures in which the same organism (species and antibiogram) is isolated from the catheter segment and peripheral blood. Semiquantitative testing is the most commonly performed test due to its lower cost and simple technique. However, it does not detect organisms on the intraluminal surface of the catheter and may lead to a false-negative result, because bacterial biofilms may be present on both the exterior and/or interior surfaces of the device. 5 Simultaneous quantitative blood cultures with a 5:1 ratio central venous catheter (CVC) versus periph - eral. This is the most reliable method but may not be available in all laboratories. Differential time-to-positivity between two blood cultures. If the blood culture obtained from the device is positive at least two hours before the percutaneously obtained culture, the infection is then related to the catheter. A drawback in CRBSI testing is that the catheter must be removed. This can be problematic for the patient who requires venous access and increases the costs of care. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of CRBSI remain controversial\u2014large randomized controlled studies have not been conducted. As a result, the impact of prior antimicrobial therapy, the use of antimicrobial impregnated or coated catheters, the presence of multilumen catheters, and questions regarding the appropriate threshold for positive results complicate CRBSI analysis. 6 CLABSI CLABSI is a less scientifically rigorous definition and is only used for surveillance purposes. National Health - care Safety Network (NHSN) defines CLABSI as a bloodstream infection that develops within 48 hours of insertion of a central venous or umbilical catheter. In the NHSN system, the infection must be described as primary or secondary during the reporting process. A primary CLABSI is (a) laboratory confirmed infection and (b) not an HAI meeting CDC/NHSN criteria for another body site. Only lumened devices that terminate at or adjacent to the heart are included in CLABSI reporting. Pacemaker wires, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IABPs), and femoral arte - rial catheters are not included as central catheters. However, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are part of CLABSI reporting in NHSN. NHSN requires that, in addition to patient identification and demographic information, the following elements are reported: If the CLABSI has been detected after any procedure, and if so, when and what type If the CLABSI is part of the organization's in-plan MDRO/CDI reportingchaPTer 3: bLood c uLTures |37 Risk factors identified Event details describing patient signs and symptoms Event details by laboratory findings (recognized pathogen from one of more cultures or common com - mensals from at least two or more cultures) Identified pathogens and their sensitivities The culture of the catheter tip or any segment of the catheter is not a criterion for CLABSI.7 As value-based purchasing (VBP) becomes the norm in healthcare, the differences in CRBSI and CLABSI definitions, as well as their correct application, will become increasingly important. Currently, CMS requires that the CDC NHSN definition of CLABSI be used when reporting catheter-associated bloodstream infections for Medicare reimbursement. It is important to note that these surveillance definitions were not intended to be used for reimbursement purposes. The initial and ongoing intent of the CDC has been to develop a baseline reporting tool capable of producing comparable data across institutions and settings. BloodCultureTests The accuracy of a blood culture can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, many of which pertain to skin antisepsis and/or specimen collection techniques. Skin Antisepsis: In order to minimize the risk of contamination of the blood specimen with common com - mensals, the venipuncture site should be cleaned with an antiseptic. The most common antiseptics used are rubbing alcohol, tincture of iodine, povidone-iodine, iodophors, and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). Studies suggest that tincture of iodine and CHG are superior to povidone-iodine. It is important to follow the manufacturer's guidelines regarding the amount of time required for the an - tiseptic product to dry. If venipuncture is performed before the product has been in place long enough to achieve its full bactericidal effect, the integrity of the blood specimen may be jeopardized. CHG products are increasingly used as they are effective, require only 30 seconds to dry, and are not com - monly associated with allergic reactions. CHG products do not need to removed or rinsed from the skin following venipuncture. Special considerations in pediatrics: CHG products are not approved for use with infants younger than 2 months of age. In addition, iodine-containing compounds should not be used with neonates due to the potential of developing subclinical hypothyroidism. For patients younger than 2 months of age, 70 percent isopropyl alcohol is an acceptable alternative. 8 Specimen Collection: In order to assure the integrity of the specimen and the accuracy of testing, the fol - lowing general guidelines for specimen collection must be followed: The volume of blood obtained for culture is a critical variable in detecting bacteremia or fungemia. Specimen collection from the central catheter is not recommended due to the possibility of intraluminal bacterial contamination of the device. Percutaneous venipuncture from two separate sites is preferred. Inguinal blood vessels (groin) should be avoided when other venipuncture sites are available. Follow institutional policy regarding any amount to be discarded when blood is sampled from indwelling vascular access devices. Blood specimens are only obtained from peripheral vascular access catheters at the time of insertion. If a patient has a peripheral catheter in place, the sample must be obtained percutaneously. It is critical that blood cultures be drawn prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Blood may not become sterile immediately following antimicrobial therapy. If empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated on an emer - gency basis, cultures should be obtained as soon as possible following the first dose. Single blood cultures should never be drawn from adult patients, as these results can be misleading. 38| The Infec TIon Preven TIonIsT's Gu Ide To The Lab Only designated blood culture bottles are used for specimen collection. If blood is drawn into tubes, so - dium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) anticoagulant can inhibit microbial growth. The accidental contamination of blood culture bottles is unfortunately a common problem. It is essential that the tops, into which the blood specimen is transferred, remain sterile until the transfer is completed. For neonates and pediatric patients the volume of blood should be no more than 1 percent of the patient's total blood volume.8 Blood culture bottles must be labeled following laboratory policy and should indicate not only the patient's name and other required identification information, but also the date, time, and location of specimen col - lection. If blood is obtained from a multilumen catheter, the specific lumen sampled should be described. Follow institutional policy regarding the removal of needleless connectors attached to the end of a central catheter. Although some products are labeled for blood sampling, many institutions require their removal to eliminate of the risk of contamination by biofilm that can accumulate in the interior components of these devices. The previously used connector is then discarded and a new, sterile connector is attached after the blood specimen is obtained.

Guide to the Elimination of Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections. Wash - Antigens are cellular components or molecules that are recognized as foreign and \"nonself\" by the body, in- cluding those that are introduced during a communicable disease exposure or when a person is vaccinated. The immune response triggered by the presence of the antigen(s) results in production of molecules called antibodies that aid in the elimination of the foreign \"invader.\" Laboratory tests to detect antigen or antibody are called se - rologic tests. Serologic tests that detect pathogen-specific antigens or antibodies are often used in the diagnosis of communicable diseases, or to verify immunity to disease. The infection preventionist can make use of these tests in surveillance for communicable disease and for the determination of the immune status of a patient or healthcare worker to a given communicable or vaccine preventable disease. Hepatitis B virus testing serves as a good example of the use of serologic tests in communicable disease detection as well as immune status verifica - tion. The panel of hepatitis B virus tests commonly ordered includes tests that detect hepatitis B virus antigens (e.g., HBsAg) and tests that detect hepatitis B virus specific antibodies (e.g., HBsAb) as well as other markers. The reader is directed to Weinbaum et al. (2011) for a comprehensive algorithm and interpretations of the various hepatitis B virus serologic tests. SerologicTestsforAntibodies Serologic tests for immune responses to a specific pathogen are reported in terms of total antibodies (all classes of immunoglobulins), or as a specific immunoglobulin (Ig) class of antibody (e.g., IgG, IgM). The immunoglobu - lin class of an antibody is helpful in determining if antibodies are present due to acute disease, or if the antibod - ies are detected because the patient is in the convalescent stage, or has immune memory of a prior exposure to a specific disease-causing pathogen. During the primary immune response after communicable disease pathogen or vaccine is encountered, the class of antibody that is produced first is IgM. IgG antibodies develop a few weeks later and are a good indica - tion of the convalescence period and generally mark the establishment of long-term immunity to the pathogen. The IgG antibody titer is the quantitative measure of antibody. An IgG-specific antibody titer may remain detectable for months, years, or for life. IgM antibodies to the specific pathogen wane over time and will be - come undetectable as the IgG antibody titer rises. The class of immunoglobulin called IgA is the predominant antibody of secretions but may also be present in serum and may occasionally be included in testing for some infectious diseases (Turgeon, 2009). When exposure to a pathogen occurs again after a primary exposure, or after a booster vaccination, a second - ary or \"anamnestic\" immune response occurs. The characteristics of the immunoglobulin class response, mag - nitude of antibody titers, and the antibody response timing differs during a secondary immune response from a primary response (see Figure 1). During a secondary response, the immune response is boosted and will occur faster and stronger. The secondary immune response to a communicable disease exposure often prevents the development of disease during a subsequent exposure, or will result in an infection that is milder and quickly self-limiting.46| The Infec TIon Preven TIonIsT's Gu Ide To The Lab As shown in the Figure 4-1, detection of IgM alone is typical of early, active (acute) infection. IgM and IgG antibodies may both be detectable in the plateau phase of a primary immune response. In general, high titers of IgG detected at the same time as very low (or not detectable) IgM titers indicates immunity and is associated with convalescence, booster response, or past infection. Laboratory methodologies used to identify and quantify specific antibodies include enzyme-linked immunoas - says (FAs), immunodiffusion, Western blot, hemagglutination, latex agglutination, and others. Results may be quantified as titers or units, or resulted semiquantitatively as positive/negative, detected/not detected, or present/not present. Serologic Tests for Antigens Laboratory tests that detect specific bacterial, viral, cellular, or proteinaceous antigens often use antibodies spe - cific to the antigen of interest. In some laboratory methodologies, the antibody used to detect antigen is tagged with a detectable molecule. In others, a tagged antigen-antibody \"sandwich\" is used to detect the antigen of interest. Examples of these assays include of electrophoresis assays. In addition, there are assays that use polymerase chain reaction (PCR), genetic probes, and other specialized gene-based methodologies, such as DNA or RNA viral load tests, to detect specific antigens. Some testing methodologies will be reported as a qualitative result, indicating that the antigen/antibody is pres - ent or not. An example of this type of qualitative reporting is the total hepatitis A antibody test that is reported as \"detected.\" Otherwise, the result will be quantitative, indicating how much is present. For example, an HIV RNA viral load is reported as \"x\" number of copies. A panel of tests for some infectious diseases may contain both antigen and antibody test results. The panel of tests for the diagnosis of hepatitis B (including antigen and antibody detection) provides a good example, as demonstrated below in Figure 4-2.

Once an infectious organism is identified, the lab performs susceptibility testing, using a variety of testing methods. Only if the organism is capable of exhibiting resistance to commonly used antimicrobials, or if its susceptibility cannot be predicted from its identity, is susceptibility testing performed. Not all identified organ - isms warrant susceptibility testing. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has accredited the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), a voluntary, international, nonprofit organization, to develop standards and guidelines and provide interpretative education to the healthcare community in the United States. The CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing establishes the test methods, interpretive criteria, and quality control parameters used in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The CLSI interpretive susceptibility breakpoints are based on generic reference testing methods. Commercial devices commonly used for susceptibility testing (e.g., Phoenix, Vitek, Microscan, Aris) are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. Per the CLSI, \"In the US, laboratories that use FDA-approved susceptibility testing devices are allowed to use the FDA interpretive breakpoints. Either FDA or CLSI susceptibility interpretive breakpoints are acceptable to clinical laboratory accrediting bodies. Policies in other countries may vary.\" Table 5-1 lists the various methods of antimicrobial testing performed on nonfastidious aerobic organisms. In addition to the methods listed, there are confirmatory tests (e.g., D-test, modified Hodge test, etc.) that can be performed to detect resistance mechanisms of the organisms. Need for these confirmatory tests vary per the testing methodology and antibiotic breakpoints, and will not be described in this chapter. Standardized methods for susceptibility testing are only available for a limited subset of organisms. For many organisms, there are no interpretive criteria available. Additional susceptibility testing can be performed on these isolated organisms, per physician request, but the results are not interpretable using known susceptibility criteria and therefore this testing is discouraged. Clinical microbiologists use the Gram stain to help them identify bacteria. The Gram stain separates organisms into two groups known as Gram positives and Gram negatives according to their cell structure. Differences in the structures of these two groups account for the differences in their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents impact the growth of bacteria either by killing them (bactericidal) or impairing their abil - ity to grow or multiply (bacteriostatic). These agents impact their bacterial targets through specific modes of action. They may: Interfere with cell wall synthesis Inhibit protein synthesis Interfere with nucleic acid synthesis Inhibit a metabolic pathway58| The Infec TIon Preven TIonIsT's Gu Ide To The Lab Antimicrobial agents within the same class typically have the same modes of action. Table 5-2 lists the classes of antimicrobial agents and their antibiotic activity. In response to the antimicrobial agents used to kill or impair bacteria, bacteria have developed a number of ways to resist these agents and survive. Their resistance mechanisms include: Producing enzymes to destroy the antimicrobial agent before it reaches its target Modifying the agent so that it no longer interacts with its target Altering their cell wall makeup, making them impermeable to the antimicrobial agent Altering the bacterial cell target site so that the antimicrobial agent no longer binds to it Using an efflux pump that expels the antimicrobial agent from the bacteria before it can impact the bac - teria Developing alternative metabolic pathways that bypass the reaction inhibited by the antimicrobial agent Bacteria that have developed resistance to several classes of antimicrobial agents are categorized as multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). MDROs are increasingly isolated in more and more species of organisms. In- fection preventionists (IPs) began recognizing the significance of MDROs with the development of resistant Gram-positive organisms, such as oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and faecalis . IPs were aware of the increasing resistance developing in the community-acquired infections due to infectious organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhea and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . We learned of resistance developing in strains of viral organisms, too, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most recently the microbiology community has been alerting IPs to the multidrug-resistance identified in Gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae . Microbiology departments track the changing sensitivity patterns of their most frequently isolated organisms in a periodic (e.g., quarterly, annually) antibiogram report. The antibiogram report summarizes the sensitivity results of organisms isolated for the first time per year per patient. Table 5-3 provides an example of an annual antibiogram report. Please note that the antibiogram report results vary according to the organisms and antimicrobials routinely prescribed at a specific hospital. Table 5-3 is an example only and is not necessarily representative of the \"typical sensitivity pattern\" of the organisms identified at every hospital in the United States. The antibiogram report is useful in several ways: 1. Clinicians can use the information to guide them in choosing appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy. 2. The pharmacy department can use the sensitivity results to determine which antimicrobials are effective and should be readily available for the physicians to prescribe through the hospital formulary of medica - tions. 3. The microbiology department, working with the pharmacy, can determine if the selection of antimicrobi - als per class that are tested should be altered to better reflect the antimicrobials recommended for use. 4. The antimicrobial stewardship committee can use the information to evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts in reducing the overall incidence of resistant organisms isolated from patients. Comparing the cur - rent report with previous reports demonstrates the change in sensitivity patterns for the most frequently isolated organisms. If organisms are decreasing in sensitivity to the antimicrobials most frequently pre - scribed, a change in prescribing practices may help to relieve the antimicrobial selection pressure and reduce the risk of MDROs.chaPTer 5: anTImIcrob IaL Tes TInG|59 Table5-1: Antimicrobial Testing Laboratory Test Process Results Measurement Interpretation Key Points Disk Diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) Use a Mueller- Hinton solid agar plate Inoculate the organ - ism onto the agar plate (organism is diluted to a specified turbidity and spread over the surface of the solid agar plate in all directions to ensure total coverage of the plate's surface) Place an antimicro - bial-impregnated paper disk onto the inoculated plate Labor: ManualMeasure the zone of inhibition (a cleared circle of \"no growth\" around the antimi - crobial disk where the organism cannot grow due to the antibiotic)Measure the diameter of area where there is no growth of the organism (zone size) in millimeters (mm) For some bacterio - static antibiotics, it is necessary to measure the zone of 80% inhibition Interpret zone sizes, using CLSI-defined criteria, as: S - Sensitive I - Intermediate R - ResistantRoutine testing Antimicrobial Gradient Diffusion (E-test) Use a plate of Mueller-Hinton solid agar Inoculate organism onto the agar plate (organism is diluted to a specified turbid - ity and spread over the surface of the solid agar plate in all directions to ensure total coverage of the plate's surface) Place an antibiotic-impregnated strip with a gradient concentration of anti - microbial agent onto the inoculated plate Labor: ManualMeasure the zone of inhibition Read and record the lowest concentration of antimicrobial (\u00b5g/ mL) that inhibits the growth of the organ - ism around the strip on the agar plateInterpret the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and record as: S - Sensitive I - Intermediate R - ResistantRoutine testing Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) Serial dilutions 1:8) of the antimicrobial agent are with a liquid suspension of the organism Labor: Semiauto - mated or manual broth methodInhibition of visible growth\u2014there is no turbidity seen in the dilution wellsThe well with the lowest (minimum) concentration of the antimicrobial (\u00b5g/mL) that inhibits growth is reported MICs are interpreted according to CLSI or FDA guidelines as: S - Sensitive I - Intermediate R - ResistantRoutine testing Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) Serial dilutions of antimicrobial against (log-phase) inoculum of the organism Labor: Manual Endpoint of growth (calculated from the number of colonies isolated upon subcul - ture of serial dilution tubes above the MIC)Lowest concentration of antimicrobial (\u00b5g/mL) capable of reduc - ing >99.9% of organ - isms in inoculum upon subcultureMBC is interpreted as: Lowest concentration of antimicrobial that is bactericidal This test is rarely performed due to the complexity of the testing Serum Bactericidal Titer (SBT) Serial patient serum dilutions against growing (log phase) inoculum of organism Labor: ManualEndpoint of growth (calculated from the number of colonies isolated upon subculture of serial dilution tubes of the patient's serum that prevented visible growth)Lowest concentration of serum (\u00b5g/mL) capable of reducing >99.9% of organisms in inoculum upon subcultureSBT is interpreted as: Lowest concentration of serum (titer) that is bactericidal to the pathogenThis test is rarely performed due to the complexity of the testing 60| The Infec TIon Preven TIonIsT's Gu Ide To The Lab Table5-2: Antibiotic Class and Activity b-lactams Class Subclass Generic Name Antibiotic Activity Against Penicillins Penicillin PenicillinNon-b-lactamase-producing aerobic Gram positives, some fastidious aerobic Gram negatives, some anaerobes Action: able to inhibit bacterial enzymes;

Washington, DC: ASM Press, 2011.|67 Chapter 6 Urinalysis, Fluid Analysis, Chemistry, and Hematology Nancy Christy, MT, MSHA, CIC When conducting surveillance and navigating National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance defi - nitions, the infection preventionist (IP) can look to other laboratory disciplines for guidance in interpreting positive cultures. Knowledge of lab tests such as urinalysis, fluid results, chemistry, and hematology can help the IP determine the type of infection and whether it is healthcare-associated. In addition, it is important for IPs to have knowledge of and access to these test results because some lab tests (i.e., liver enzymes) can be requested by state health departments for mandatory reporting. Urinalysis is very helpful when evaluating for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs). If the labora - tory does not routinely perform Gram stains on urine, the microscopic result can identify whether the urine has bacteria or yeast, especially for urine cultures that grow <100,000 colony-forming units ( cf U) /mL. In addi - tion, the urinalysis in conjunction with the urine culture can be instrumental in determining whether a positive blood culture is secondary to a UTI. NHSN states that a positive blood culture with a known pathogen is a bloodstream infection unless it is related to another infection site. Fluid results, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peritoneal, pleural, and synovial fluid, can aid in determining infections and guide the IP when evaluating bloodstream infections and surgical site infections. The laboratory should send abnormal CSF results\u2014specifically glucose, protein, and cell count\u2014to the infection prevention department to identify possible meningitis. Chemistry is not often used in infection prevention surveillance. However, the arterial blood gas is very useful in pneumonia identification. The PaO 2 is used for determining worsening gas exchange and is one of the easi - est factors of the healthcare-associated pneumonia definition to evaluate. Chemistry may also be helpful for providing additional information to state health departments, depending on the requirements. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) can indicate whether a patient is immunocompromised. However, the white blood cell (WB c) c ount and differential will be the most helpful in determining an infection when using the NHSN pneumonia definition. The CD4 count will help identify immunocompromised patients for PNU3. The WBC count and differential can also identify an infectious process in questionable cases such as blood - stream infections. The differential can sometimes provide clues as to whether there is an infectious process and identify what type (e.g., bacterial versus viral). The following table provides a general overview of the results and interpretation of tests in urinalysis, fluid, chemistry, and hematology studies. It is by no means a comprehensive list, but is intended to highlight the most common tests and those most utilized for determining infections. It is broken down by the following: G eneral category L TIonPreven TIonIsT'sGu IdeT oTheLab Results Specimen Frequency (note the majority of this classification is \"as needed\"; however, there are exceptions) Test t y pe Interpretation considerations for test or interfering factors Key points that relate the test to the appropriate NHSN definition, if applicable For a more complete list of tests or for those not included on the tables, please refer to the Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practices Series: Diagnostic Tests , which is available in most reference libraries, or contact the director of your facility's laboratory for more information.chaPTer6:u Hematology Lab Tests Urinalysis Urinalysis (UA)Appearance cloudy or urine with sediment can be an indicator for infection or other abnormal statefresh urine is slightly hazyFirst morning speci -

The Mycobacterium genus is comprised of rapid growers (grow in less than 7 days) and slow growers (take longer than 7 days to grow) which includes the M. tuberculosis complex . Mycobacterial infections can affect any area of the body. They can cause acute or chronic infections, are dif - ficult to diagnose, and problematic to treat. Mycobacteria cause infections such as leprosy ( Mycobacterium leprae ) and skin and soft tissue fish tanks ( Mycobacterium marinum ). Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapid grower and often a water contaminant. It causes chronic lung disease, disseminated cutaneous disease in immunocompromised patients, and posttraumatic wound infections. Mycobacterium chelonae , also a rapid grower, is often found in water and sewage and will cause occasional opportunistic infections. Mycobacterium fortuitum is a rapid grower that can be found in localized skin infections, osteomyelitis, joint infections, and posttraumatic eye infections. Mycobacterium kansasii is a slow grower that is a water contaminant and may cause disease in patients with severely impaired cellular immunity. The mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) group can cause other pulmonary diseases. The most common is Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex , which can cause chronic lung infections in patients with compromised lungs. The MOTT group can also be a nuisance in the laboratory if specimens become con - taminated with tap water or if procedural instruments, such as bronchoscopes, are improperly processed and contaminated with tap water. The mycobacterial infection of the most significance to the infection preventionist is tuberculosis, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . M. tuberculosis is one of several slow-growing mycobacteria in the M. tubercu - losis complex. The M. tuberculosis complex is comprised of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, and M. microti . When testing specimen and isolates for mycobacteria, microbiologists must wear personal protective equip - ment and conduct tests in a special negative pressure room and under a biological cabinet, with laminar flow. Mycobacteria require special processing to eliminate other faster-growing bacteria, yeasts, or fungi that might be present in the specimen. Special media are used for culturing to meet the nutritional needs of the mycobac - teria\u2014this includes solid media, plates and tubes, and broth media. Because of the slower growth nature of this group and the need to know the infecting agent, rapid means to recover and identify this group are neces - sary. There are a wide variety of techniques available, depending on the specific need. The following table is a summary of testing methodologies for mycobacteria, including their advantages and disadvantages, appropriate use, and test limitations. It is intended to help the infection preventionist make edu - cated recommendations pertaining to patient placement and exposure follow-up. Many of these procedures are performed by reference laboratories rather than in the hospitals. Some of the techniques are quite expensive to perform and are highly specialized, requiring additional knowledge to perform and interpret. 114| The Infec TIon Preven TIonIsT's Gu Ide To The LabTable7-1: Overview of Mycobacteria Testing Methodologies Specimen Collection and Transport: When collecting and transporting specimens to laboratories for testing, consult the lab for collection and transport instructions and adhere to following regulations: Private courier: IATA Packaging Instructions 602 for pure culture isolates; IATA Packaging Instructions 650 for clinical specimens US Postal Service: If sending either type of specimen, see USPS Packaging Instruction 6D at http://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52apxc_021.htm General categoryLaboratory Test IndicationsSpecific Microbes - (MOTT) speciated Respiratory Gastric wash (usually pedi - atrics) Body fluids Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tissue Urine Aspirated pus Blood Bone marrow Less optimal raw specimens: stool, swabs Respira - tory/gastric wash: early morning specimen daily times three Others: as speci - men availableSmear: direct smear and concentrated smearAFB seen or no AFB seen Rapid test for which a positive test would warrant placing patients into airborne precautionswithout waiting for culture results Although positive tests can be definitive for mycobacterial disease, they cannot be considered for any case or used as a stand-alone test Test sensitivity can be as low as 60% because ~ 10,000 organisms/mL of specimen is needed for a visibly positive smear Respira - tory and urine: refrigerate, transport cold; preferably within one hour of collection Bone marrow and blood: collect in a tube with SPS anticoagulant Stool: collect no more than 10 mL in a 50-mL polypropyl - ene tube and securelytighten the lid Swabs: place in 10 mls of 7H9 broth or sterile saline in a 50 ml conical tube; specimen does not offer much sensitivity due to minimal specimen All others: transport to lab immediatelySensitivity can be dependent on whether it is performed on a direct specimen smear or a concentrated specimen smear, the number of AFB in the specimen, and the experience of medical technologist/ microscopist chaPTer 7: Mycobac TerIoLoGy|115Table7-1: Overview of Mycobacteria Test IndicationsSpecific Microbes Specimen FrequencyTest Type InterpretationAdvantages/ DisadvantagesSample Points Culture AFB culture MTB, MOTT speciated Respiratory, including in - duced sputum Gastric wash (usually pediatrics) Body fluids CSF Tissue Urine Aspirated pus Blood Bone marrow Less optimal raw specimens: stool - when contaminated food or milk questions exist, swabs Respira - tory/gastric wash: early morning specimen daily times three Others: as speci - men availableCulture (solid media and liquid/broth media) and identification Growth of myco - bacteria Based on bio - chemical test re - sults for identifica - tion on isolates or molecular testing on the isolate Or no growth of mycobacteria after 6 or 8 weeks, depending on the individual labora - tory protocols Depending on the organism and amount present, can take a few days to weeks to grow Culture method has the advantage of al - lowing performance of susceptibility test - ing on the organism to better guide treat - ment modalities.

Hall, PhD This chapter presents information on the more commonly isolated fungal organisms in regard to their usual appearance on direct smears. The table below is not an all-inclusive list but represents the most common fungal organisms likely to be found in human clinical samples. It is divided by the fungal groups of yeasts and molds and further divided by how these appear and would be reported out by clinical laboratories. In addition, the table includes relevant information about each organism's key characteristics with emphasis on how long it should take for cultures to become positive. The flow diagrams in Figures 8-1 and 8-2 below are to assist in understanding what the clinical laboratory means when they report results of direct smear on clinical samples. These diagrams should help infection preventionists determine what organism(s) is most likely to be seen in the sample on the day it is collected. This in turn should enable clinical personnel to make rapid decisions about treatment options even before the cultures confirm the diagnosis. These results should be used in conjunction with clinical and pathological findings, if available. The references at the end of the chapter can be used to find additional information on the fungal organisms listed and additional information if an organism is encountered in practice but is not included in this chapter.122 | TheInfec TIonPreven TIonIsT'sGu IdeToTheLab Figure 8-1: How fungal Or: Trichosporon systemic dimorphic fungi: Histoplasma capsulatum (small budding yeast cells in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, spleen, liver) Blastomyces dermatitidis (broad-based budding yeast especially in respiratory or skin specimens) Coccidioides immitis (spherules found especially in pulmonary specimens or cerebro - spinal fluid) Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (multiple budding yeast cells) Sporothrix schenckii (skin specimens in particular with football-shaped budding yeast cells) Penicillium marneffei (nonbudding, but mimic yeast cells)chaPTer8:Myco LoGy | 8-2: How to interpret fungal smear results Hyphae seen without yeast cells Septate hyphae Present Zygomycetes Darkly pigmented in tissue Rhizopus Mucor sp.

A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another (the host) from which it obtains nourishment. The host does not benefit from the as - sociation and is often harmed by it. Most parasitic infections are spread by the fecal-oral route or by arthropods (mosquitoes, etc.). The exception to this would be those transmitted by direct contact, such as lice and scabies, which have been identified in health - care outbreaks. In general, parasitic infections are not commonly healthcare-associated but can be a significant problem in extended or residential care facilities for patients with physical or mental disabilities. Due to the nature of these patient populations, challenges with crowding, environmental sanitation, and personal hygiene can lead to rapid dissemination and endemic occurrence of a large variety of parasitic infections. For more in - formation about specific parasites, including mode of transmission and infections caused by them, please refer to APIC's Ready Reference for Microbes. The following tables are arranged by laboratory tests describing the parasites. The tables are designed to en - hance the knowledge of the infection preventionist (IP) as he/she reviews laboratory results for their patient populations. The tables describe what tests are useful, when they should be performed, and what the results might mean. The IP is encouraged to discuss further questions with their microbiology laboratorians when is - sues arise.138 IndicationsSpecific Mi - crobes Specimen Frequency InterpretationAdvantages/Dis - advantages Key Points Microscopic Ova and parasite (O&P) direct wet mountDiarrhea Protozoan trophozoites and cysts, helminth eggs, and larvae Stool clean, dry, tightly sealed container or collec - tion kit Specimens contain - ing barium are unac - ceptable Must wait 7-10 days after barium administrationThree speci - mens, a day or two apart within 10 days of each otherDetection of diagnostic stage of parasite O&P, concentratedDiarrhea as aboveThree speci - mens, a day or two apart within 10 daysDetection of diagnostic stage of parasiteProtozoan trophozoites will not tions as aboveThree speci - mens, a day or two apart within 10 daysDetection of diagnostic stage of parasite Modified Kin - aboveThree speci - mens, a day or two apart within 10 daysDetection of oocysts first thing in the morning before use of bathroomDetection of ova Three to five consecu - tive negative preps to rule out infection Common intestinal helminthic infection Symptoms include perianal itching, disturbed sleep, irritability Eggs in an indoor envi - ronment remain infective (Entero-Test)Consult laboratoryDetection of diagnostic stage of parasiteUseful when clinical symptoms are sug - gestive of infection and routine O&P is negative examDiarrhea Amebiasis, Cryp- tosporidiumSigmoidoscopy aspi - rate or scrapingDone only after at least three negative O&PDetection of diagnostic stage of parasite Examination of fresh specimen by trained microscopist to dif - ferentiate nonpatho - genic amoebae and macrophages Reference lab ser - vices may be requirdPresence of trophozoites containing red blood cells indicative of invasive amoebiasischaPTer9:Paras IToLoGy | 139Table 9-1: Overview of Parasitology Tests (continued) CategoryLaboratory Test IndicationsSpecific Mi - crobes Specimen Frequency InterpretationAdvantages/Dis - advantages Key Points Microscopic examHematuria Schistosoma haema tropho zoitesUrine Early morning specimenDetection of diagnostic stage of parasiteUrine filtration useful for S. haematobium infections be seen on a Papanico - laou smear Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test available but insuf - ficiently reliable for routine use Microscopic examCough/bloody sputumMigrating larval stages of hook parasite Asacria pulmonary mani - festations caused by larval migration (mainly during reinfestation) Characterized by wheezing, coughing, fever, eosinophilia, pulmonary infiltration Microscopic examFever of un - known origin/temperature spikes, malariaPlasmodium , Babe - sia, Trypanosoma , some microfi - lareaBlood from finger - stick or ethylenedi - aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood draw, thick and thin smearsConsult labora - toryDetection of parasite in blood smearBest results when pro - cessed within 1 hour If patient has traveled to malaria endemic area, dates and area traveled are important to diagnosis Microscopic examDiarrhea, ab - dominal painEntamoeba histo-lytica Liver biopsy Consult labora - tory immuno - diffusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA), are very useful in the diagnosis of invasive disease Ultrasound and computed tomography scans beneficial in locating amoebic liver abscesses Dissemination via the bloodstream may occur and produce abscesses of the liver, less commonly the lung or brain The presence of tro - phozoites containing red blood cells is indicative of invasive amoebiasis Microscopic examSkin sores Leishmania Test IndicationsSpecific Mi - crobes Specimen Frequency InterpretationAdvantages/Dis - advantages Key Immunology - toryDetection of IgM, IgG antibodiesUseful in diagnosis of disease - assay, Immu - asymptomatic; cases, muscle soreness, fever, edema of upper eyelidsTrichinella Blood Consult labora - toryDetection of IgM, IgG antibodiesUseful in diagnosis of disease diagnosis of amoe - biasis, liver specificity Enzyme immu - noassay Fever of un - known origin; Wuchereria, painful lymph nodesPlasmodium, WuchereriaBlood Consult labora - toryDetection of where Ectoparasites Exam Skin infection, pediculosisPediculus humanus (head lice)Insect Detection of insect Common parasites Microscopic examSkin infection, pediculosis Pediculus humanus corporis (body lice)Insect Detection of infect humans Microscopic examSkin infection, pediculosisPhthirus pubis (crab lice)Insect Detection of insect Common humans Microscopic examSkin infection Sarcoptes scabiei (scabies)Skin scrapings Detection of mites, eggs, and fecal pelletsCommon parasites to infect humanschaPTer9:Paras IToLoGy | 141 References Forbes BA, Sahm DF, Weissfeld AS.

They may be acute or chronic, be recurrent, or elicit lifelong immunity. They are acquired through various routes via contact with other humans, animals, or the environment; they present as various syndromes and have to be rapidly distinguished from bac - terial and other infectious and noninfectious etiologies to facilitate appropriate clinical management. The emphasis and priorities of diagnostic virology laboratories is constantly changing in response to the avail - ability of rapid diagnostic methods, the identification of new viruses many of which are non- or poorly cultur - able, the increasing availability of effective antiviral agents, the emergence of antiviral resistance, the increasing number of immunocompromised patients in whom opportunistic viral infections are life-threatening, and the cost-effectiveness of performing diagnostic testing. Routine viral diagnostics include techniques for indirect and direct detection of viruses. Indirect detection is performed by serological studies. Techniques for direct detection of viruses include detection of viral antigens, molecular components, or by isolation of the organism in culture. Moreover, it must be taken into consideration that reliable viral diagnostics depends on preanalytic issues such as the choice of correct specimen, optimal sampling time with regard to the course of the disease, and both time and conditions of specimen transport to the laboratory. This section reviews testing methodologies for common and uncommon viral pathogens, specimen require - ments, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Also included are result interpretations and testing frequency suggestions. It is the hope that this will serve as a reference to the infection preventionist who, on any given day, has to interpret test outcomes and make recommendations regarding patient placement and exposures based on these results. 144 | TheInfec TIonPreven TIonIsT'sGu IdeT oTheLabTable 10-1: Overview of Testing Methodologies for Viral Pathogens Test type Indications Specific microbesSpecimen Frequency Interpretation Advantages/disadvantagesKey points Viral culture Viral culture offers the broadest approach to identifying a viral agent Cultures should be obtained as early as possible after onset of illnessAdenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus, herpes viruses, measles, mumps, and polio Specimen swab must be placed in viral transport media Dacron-tipped, rayon-tipped, or flocked swabs with plastic or aluminum shafts are acceptable Calcium alginate swabs are inhibitory to HSV and should NOT be used for viral culture collection Wooden-shafted swabs are not recommended because wooden swabs can contain toxins and formaldehydes that inhibit virus and chlamydia recovery;

With the increasing availability of sophisticated technologies to rap - idly diagnose and treat infections, the roles of clinical microbiology laboratories in infection prevention are dynamically changing beyond the traditional methods of testing. In an era with enhanced focus on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), infection preventionists are increasingly relying on the microbiology laboratory for a number of services beyond regular culture and sensitivity testing including development of antibiograms, environmental testing, health department reporting, and support in surveillance and outbreak investigations. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is highly complex testing, as categorized by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The performance standards and interpretive guidelines for AST are de - fined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) through an evidence-based consensus process. Additionally, in 2002, CLSI published the first guidance document (M39-A) for standardizing the statistical analysis of cumulative AST data called an antibiogram. Clinical microbiology laboratories accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) are required to create and distribute an antibiogram annually. Anti - biograms can provide information needed to establish antibiotic usage recommendations, rules, and restrictions (e.g., in the case of healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile ). They can also be useful in deciding where to focus educational efforts as they can be broken down from a hospital-wide to a unit-specific perspective. See Chapter 11 for additional information on antimicrobial testing, including an example antibiogram. In addition to antibiograms, the clinical microbiology laboratory is an essential partner in environmental test - ing. Although not routinely recommended due to cost, lack of standards, and possibility of inconclusive results, there may be situations in which testing is indicated, even required, including: biologic monitoring of steriliza - tion processes, monthly cultures of water and dialysate in hemodialysis units, and short-term evaluation of the impact of infection measures or changes in infection prevention protocols. When an epidemiologic investigation suggests that a source or reservoir of organisms may exist, special envi - ronmental testing may be needed. The decision to perform testing should be based on epidemiologic evidence indicating an association between the environment and host. Additionally, culturing for epidemiologic purposes should be systematic, specific, consistent, and part of a written infection prevention policy devised with input from the microbiology laboratory. For outbreak situations, the clinical microbiology laboratory's role is vital and can perform important tasks pro - viding further assistance to an investigation. These tasks include: confirming organism identities, identifying organism clusters, detecting new or unusual organisms and/or antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, retrieving archived microbiology data to determine background rates of organisms isolated, and determining the relat - edness between isolates. These tasks can be completed through a variety of phenotypic and genotypic testing methods. 150 | TheInfec TIonPreven TIonIsT'sGu IdeT oTheLab Lastly, the laboratory can help with the reporting of diseases (e.g., invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae ). Most states have a public health code that requires certain infectious or communicable diseases and clinical syndromes be reported to the local state department of public health. Diseases are reportable based on their contagiousness, severity, or frequency. States set requirements for time and content of the reports. The following table provides a general outline and examples of the additional, commonly utilized services/tests a clinical microbiology laboratory can provide. The table is broken down by the following: Laboratory test Indication for use Specific microbe Type of specimen Frequency (Note: The majority of this classification is as needed; however, there are exceptions.) Test type Interpretation of test Key points that include advantages and disadvantages of specific tests Regardless of the test utilized, it is imperative for any infection prevention program to foster and build a col - laborative relationship with the clinical microbiology laboratory in order to be successful in preventing HAIs and further development of antimicrobial resistance. chaPTer11 :oTherM Icrob IoLoGyconTrIbuTIons | 151Table 11-1: Overview of Clinical Microbiology Lab Services and Tests General CategoryLaboratory Test IndicationsSpecific Microbes Specimen Frequency Test Type Interpretation Key Points Antibiograms Antimicrobial susceptibility test -
