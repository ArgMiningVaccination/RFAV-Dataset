In the HLA- DR15 haplotype, two -chains HLA-DRB1*1501 and -DRB5*0101 are co- expressed resulting in two different surface MHC class II heterodimers. They both can serve as antigen presenting molecules for myelin basic protein- specific T cells and they are able to differentially influence T cell effector func-tions. These findings point out that it is important to dissect which of the twoalleles is functionally relevant for MS.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to analyze the mRNA and surface expression of HLA-DRB5*0101 and -DRB1*1501 in antigen-presenting cells(APC) obtained from healthy donors (HD) and MS patients.Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes, B cells and den- dritic cells were obtained from a total of 8 HD and 14 MS patients. Three sam-ples of thymic tissue were also analyzed. The expression of HLA-DRB5*0101and -DRB1*1501 was evaluated by FACS and by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, using specific oligonucleotides and plasmid DNA standard curves. In Bcells and monocytes alleles expression was analyzed under basal conditions and after stimulation with IL-4 and IFN in time-course (T-C) experiments. Results: In all APC, transcripts were a few times more abundant for HLA- DRB5*0101 than for HLA-DRB1*1501, while FACS experiments showedthat surface expression for the two alleles was different in different APC. In T-C experiments they were similarly modulated. No major differences wereobserved between MS patients and HD.Conclusions: HLA-DRB5*0101 expression was overall comparable to the one of -DRB1*1501, providing further evidence for a role of this allele that is usu-ally not considered in the pathogenesis of MS. Different surface expressionpatterns of the two alleles in various APC are currently being evaluated as theymight be important for shaping the T cell receptor repertoire.

Laplaud DAa,b, Wiertlewski CNS is recognized by the T-cell through its hypervariable region on the TCR (Vchain). Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the possible presence of a peripheral immune component in MS. We analysed the V transcriptome at a qualitative and quantitative level in the blood of MS patients using a new method designed in our laboratory (TcLand). This method allows to detectalterations in the T-cell repertoire and to estimate the T-cell pool size express- ing a given altered V family. No further cell manipulation is performed during this procedure avoiding selection biases due to cell culture. Methods: Two groups of patients were analyzed. The first group (n= 10) was composed of patients at early onset of MS. The second group (n=10) was com-posed of patients examined for a second or a third relapse of the disease. Agroup of healthy volunteers was also analyzed as a reference. First, peripheralblood mononuclear cells were isolated, the RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to obtain single strand cDNA. Specific primers for 26 V families were used to carry out the combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of the TCR. The results were integrated to give colored coded vision of the whole T-cell repertoire refered as T-cell Landscapes (TcLand). After identification of the altered V family(ies) for each patient, the cells bearing the altered TCR can be separated with V family-specific antibodies. RNA was then extracted and mRNA cytokine production can be analysed in a quantitative manner (TaqMan).Results: Our data suggest that there are more alterations in the MS group than in the healthy volunteer group. The alterations seem to be more fre-quent in MS patients at the second or third relapse than at the early onsetof the disease. In addition, in preliminary experiments, we show that sort-ing of the cells bearing the altered TCR for transcriptional analysis is pos-sible.Conclusions: We suggest that this approach may open new opportunities for understanding the magnitude and the type of the immune component in MS.

They are also involved in the regulationof amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, a protein that is now widelyregarded as a marker for (early) neuronal dysfunction in multiple sclerosis. Objectives: to investigate the expression of group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and group II (mGluR2/3) mGluRs in multiple sclerosis brain. Methods: we used immunohistochemistry in a total of 10 MS cases and 7 non-neurological controls. We also compared the MS cases to other conditionsexhibiting neurodegeneration. Results: Upregulation of both group I and II mGluRs was found in the MS cases, relative to healthy controls. A diffuse increase in expression of mGluR5 and mGlur2/3 was observed in reactive astrocytes. in a subpopulation of vimentin-positive reactive astrocytes and was strongly expressed in axons of the subcortical white matter. However, no distinct differ-ences between MS lesion types were observed. Axonal immunopositivity wasalso observed in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of MS tissue as wellas in other neuropathological conditions like cerebral infarction and diffuseMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S2 axonal injury. Moreover, in cortical neurons located in the proximity of a lesion, atypical clusters of mGluR1a immunoreactivity were observed. Conclusions: group I and II mGluRs are upregulated in MS brain. This may underline the importance of glutamate excitotoxicity as a part of the patho-physiological process of multiple sclerosis and possibly also of other condi-tions showing neurodegeneration.

Tractogra-phy group mapping allows the construction of anatomical connectivity maps ofthe optic radiation (OR) that compensate for the normal inter-subject variability.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the OR of patients affected by isolated optic neuritis (ON) using tractography group mapping. Methods: Seven patients (mean age 37.3 \u00b19.4, all women) 1 year after isolated ON (4 R, 3 L) and 21 age-matched controls (mean age 33 \u00b19.7, 11 women and 10 men) were studied. Whole-brain DT imaging was performed and the FMT algorithm was used to trace the ORs in each individual. The OR fractionalanisotropy (FA) and volume were calculated, and differences between patientsand controls assessed using the t-test. Group connectivity maps of the ORswere created using SPM99, and VBM was employed to investigate the differ-ences in the left and right OR connectivity between the two groups. A simpleregression model was used to investigate whether the OR connectivity inpatients are correlated with VEP amplitudes and latencies of the affected andunaffected eyes and with the number of lesions within the OR. Results: Patients had lower OR FA (mean 0.29 \u00b10.03) and volume (mean 4.5 cm3\u00b11.2) 0.31 \u00b10.03, volume: mean 5.3cm3 significant (FA: p=0.12; volume: p=0.13). VBM detected significant differences between patients and controlsfor the right and left OR connectivity maps (right OR: p=0.02, left OR: p=0.05,after SVC (small volume correction)). VEP amplitude and latencyof the affected eye correlated with the left OR connectivity (p=0.007 correctedfor whole brain and p=0.03 after SVC respectively). No correlations were foundfor the VEP of the unaffected eye or for the number of lesions within the ORs.Conclusions: Tractography group mapping detects differences in the ORs between normal subjects and patients affected by ON. The relationship between the clinical findings and the extent of OR connectivity may be second- ary to the ON or due to pathological damage within the OR.

Autoreactive MOG play an important role in lesion pathogenesis in both thisMS model and rodent EAE, however, little is known about the molecular andstructural basis for pathogenicity. Objectives: To characterize the diversity of MOG-specific humoral immune responses in a primate model of MS. Methods: MOG-reactive antibody populations from animals immunized MOG-derived peptides were specificity for linear or conformationalMOG-epitopes. MOG-reactive Fab fragments were selected from combinatorial IgG libraries generated from rMOG-immune marmosets, and analyzed for immunoglobulin gene usage and MOG-epitope recognition. CNS tissue was obtained at euthanasia and was stained with Luxol Fast-Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff. Results: Animals immunized with the MOG-derived displayed anti- body reactivity exclusively directed against linear determinants of MOG. In con-trast, animals immunized with rMOG developed conformational and linear epitopes. Neuropathologically, MOGpeptide-immune animals developed very few lesions with scarce demyelination,in stark contrast to animals immunized with rMOG. A limited number of heavyand light chain variable region genes appear to be used by the marmoset immunesystem to target a number of different conformational epitopes of MOG. Theseepitopes are consistently found in MOG-immune antibody repertoires in thisspecies, as demonstrated by competition experiments with monoclonal Fab frag-ments from the antibody libraries against native anti-MOG antibodies.Conclusions: In conclusion, these studies provide the first detailed description of MOG-specific antibody responses in an outbred primate, and suggest thatconformation-dependent anti-MOG antibodies play a predominant role in thepathogenesis of CNS demyelination.

Objectives: We attempted to consolidate this assumption by using serial MRI of the brain to follow the evolution of black holes which are regarded as a puta-tive marker of matrix destruction and axonal loss. Methods: 99 individuals with clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS (age 35.3+/-9.5 yrs, disease duration 6.6+/-7.2 yrs, Expanded Disability Status Scalescore 1.5+/-1.2) underwent genotyping and clinical examination. T2- and T1-weighted axial MRI of brain (1.5 T, TR/TE=2500/30 and 90; 600/15) forsemi-automated lesion segmentation was performed at baseline and after 2.7+/-1.1 yrs. Black holes were defined as T1-lesions with a signal intensity betweencortical grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid.Results: At baseline, T2- and T1-lesion loads (LL) were 4 (n=23; T2-LL: 11.8+/-11.4; ccm), vs. non- 4: 7.4+/-7.6 yrs, p=0.06) and the absence of significant differences in clinical variables between groups. During follow-up, T2-LL significantly enlarged in patients without 4 (10.6+/- 11.0 ccm; p=0.001), whereas it remained unchanged in 4-carriers (11.3+/-11.7Multiple SclerosisOral Presentations S3 ccm). In contrast, T1-LL 4-subgroup (1.7+/-2.7 vs. non- ccm, p=0.039). black-holes increased from 5.5+/-7.7 % to 12.4+/-13.9 % (p=0.005) in 4-patients whereas it did not change significantly in non- 4 patients (baseline: 5.0+/-7.9 %, follow-up: 5.7+/-7.3 %, p=0.37). Conclusions: The observed higher proportion of MRI brain lesions that devel- ops into black holes in MS patients with 4 provides further support for a more aggressive disease course in 4 carriers.

Objectives: To assess, using fMRI, the brain pattern of movement-associated cortical activations in patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes(CIS) suggestive of MS. To investigate the correlation between the extent offunctional cortical activations and the extent of MS-related pathology, measuredusing conventional MRI and whole brain N-acetylaspartate (WBNAA) 1-HMRS.Methods: From 16 right-handed patients at presentation with CIS and 15 con- trols, we obtained: a) fMRI (repetitive flexion-extension of the last four fingersof the right hand), b) dual-echo scans, c) 1H-MRS to assess WBNAA levels.FMRI data were analyzed using SPM99.Results: Compared to controls, patients with CIS had decreased whole brain NAA levels (p<0.001). They also had more significant activation of the con-tralateral primary somatomotor cortex (SMC), secondary somatosensory cor-tex and inferior gyrus. Relative activation of the contralateral primarySMC was correlated with whole brain NAA levels (r=-0.78, p<0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that functional cortical changes can be detected in patients at presentation with CIS. These changes might have a favorablerole in limiting the impact of axonal pathology on subsequent disease evolution.

Nevertheless, the effect of IFNb on the duration of PBHs has not been investigated.Objectives: To evaluate the influence of IFNb-1b on the duration of PBHs in 10 MS patients followed monthly for 18 months before and after treatment withIFNb-1b.Methods: Ten MS patients were treated with IFNb-1b and followed with monthly Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) for 18 months prior to (baseline)and after starting therapy (treatment). Baseline characteristics of the patients were as follow: male/female: 9/3, mean \u00b1SD un-enhanced scan was evaluated. A PBH was defined as anyhypo intense region visible on the T1w with hyperintensity on the T2w andwithout a CEL. Only PBHs with a previously identified CELs were consideredfor the analysis. The student T-test compared the mean number of CELs beforeand during therapy. The Kaplan Meier Survival Analysis (KMS) analyzed dif-ferences in the length of time of PBHs in the two arms. P values were based ontwo-tailed statistical tests, with a significance level of 0.05.Results: Although the number of CELs was significantly reduced during ther- apy, results of the KMS showed no difference in terms of PBHs durationbetween lesions developing during the baseline or treatment periods. Conclusions: These results provide further insights into the mechanisms of IFNb-1b. Although the drug decreases the inflammatory activity, the eventsthat follow the acute lesion formation appear not to be affected IFNb-1b. Theobservation is consistent with a mechanism of action that acts primarily at thelevel of the blood brain barrier.

Penner Psychology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland;bNeurology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Basel Stadt, Switzerland;cNovartis Pharma AG, Central Technologies, Basel, Basel Stadt, Switzerland;dNeuroradiology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Basel Stadt, Switzerland Background: Little is known about the effects a cognitive training might induce on the brain organisation and its possible visualization by fMRI. Objectives: Our aim is to analyse the effects of a cognitive training on atten- tion with functional MRI and to relate baseline and follow up fMRI findingswith the result of training. Methods: We assessed different attention domains with a neuropsychological test battery (TAP) in twelve MS patients and seven healthy controls. Accordingto the patients' performance on the tests, they were classified as mildly andseverely impaired. After the baseline examination, all patients underwent acognitive training program for the most impaired attentional function. To deter-mine the brain structures induced by the attention tasks before and after train-ing, all subjects were investigated by fMRI.Results: Training facilitated functional activation of brain structures that were not responding initially. Those were located mainly in the frontal and parietalcortex. This effect was found in all tasks in mildly impaired patients who wereable to compensate for their deficits even in the tasks with high complexity; inthe more severely impaired patients additional activation and compensationwas restricted to the simplest task. However, when improvement in perform-ance in the attention tasks was chosen as dependent variable instead of absolutedegree of dysfunction, the patients with improvements showed a decrease inbrain activation after training while the patients without improvement showeda significant increase in activation. Conclusions: Effects induced by a cognitive training can be visualized by functional MRI. The amount of performance improvement after retraininghowever, seems to depend on the brain's capacity to establish new interconnec-tions. Successful training might be dependent on the individuals ability to focuson relevant brain structures while failure to improve after training might beMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S4 related to waste non-focused brain activation.

Current treatments of MS are based on immunosuppressive or immunomodula-tory strategies and are only partially effective in majority of patients. The expe-rience with one of these therapies, IFN-beta, clearly demonstrated that the ther-apeutic effect is dose-dependent. It is therefore likely that, depending on thelevel of activation of the immune system, multimodal approaches will berequired in some patients to reach optimal therapeutic effect.Objectives: We tested the hypothesis, whether in patients with only partial therapeutic response to IFN-beta addition of humanized antibody against Inter-leukin-2 receptor alpha chain (Zenapax) would result in further decrease incontrast-enhancing brain MRI lesions.Methods: This was an add-on treatment (IFN-beta + Zenapax) crossover phase II trial, with total of 10 MSpatients. Inclusion criteria included clinical and/or MRI definitions for partialresponse to IFN-beta. Patients have been followed by monthly clinical-, MRI-and immunological measures for 4 months of baseline and 9 months of treat-ment. Primary outcome measure was the change in number of contrast-enhanc-ing MRI lesions. Number of additional MRI, clinical and immunologicalparameters served as secondary outcome measures. Results: Zenapax add-on therapy was tolerated extremely well and led to over 50% additional reduction in MRI contrast-enhancing lesions in the majority ofpatients. Zenapax did not cause general immunosuppression, nor did it signifi-cantly decrease the proliferation of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes to strongpolyclonal stimuli or recall antigens.Conclusions: We anticipate that Zenapax will become a treatment alternative in MS, however, it needs to be studied whether Zenapax acts in concert withIFN-beta or by itself.

Thursday, September 19, 2002 Keynote Address 11 INFLAMMATION, DEMYELINATION AND AXONAL LOSS: UNRAVELING THE RELATIONSHIPS Ludwin SK Department of Pathology, Queens University and Kingston General Hospital, Kingston, Ontario, Canada Abstract Body: Multiple Sclerosis is characterized by demyelination, inflam- mation, gliosis and axonal loss. In recent years it has become obvious thataxonal loss accounts for a major amount of the symptomatology and disability,especially in progressive cases. Etiopathogenesis of the axonal loss has becomeof prime importance, as prevention and regeneration strategies will become part of the Multiple Sclerosis physician's armamentarium. Although axonaldamage in acute cases can be well accounted for by the marked cellular infil-tration, together with its resultant chemical toxic factors, continuing and pro-gressive axonal damage in chronic lesions is less easy to understand. Possiblemechanisms include susceptibility of demyelinated axons to continual insultfrom ongoing inflammation, axonal degeneration following lack of trophicsupport from oligodendroglia and myelin, and primary damage and degenera-tion to the neurons. It is possible that one or more of these mechanisms mayresult in axonal damage. The relationship between these factors and axon lossmay vary from case to case, and also during varying timepoints within eachcase. Experimental models where the elements such as inflammation, demyeli-nation and gliosis can be dissected and examined in isolation may assist in elu- cidating possible mechanisms for this axonal loss. The axon may be differen- tially affected in animal models which are predominantly either inflammatoryor demyelinating as in toxic disorders; models of ischemia and edema mayunder different conditions damage the axon and at times the myelin sheath orboth. These relationships can also be studied in human diseases where the sameelements are prominent, such as hereditary leukodystrophies, toxic diseasessuch as carbon monoxide, and ischemic lesions. Each of these groups of dis-eases may have varying combinations of these elements. Careful examinationof the distribution of lesions may also help to determine the role of neuronaldysfunction in causing axonal loss. Patterns with a distal-proximal gradientalong tracts may suggest neuronal dysfunction with a dying-back picture, asopposed to Wallerian distribution. The role of gliosis as an alternative neuro-protectant in various experimental and clinical conditions may also renderclues as to glial trophic protection.

Session I Inflammation, Demyelination and AxonalLoss: Insights From Pathology 12 MECHANISMS OF AXONAL LOSS Trapp BDa, Bjartmar Ca, Peterson Ja,c, Chang Aa, Rudick Ra,b aDepartment of Neurosciences, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA;bDepartment of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA;cNeuroscience Graduate Studies Program, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA Abstract Body: This presentation will summarize pathological studies from our laboratory that describe axonal pathology and axonal degeneration in post-mortem MS brains. Three mechanisms of axonal loss will be discussed. Thefirst is axonal transection in the setting of inflammatory demyelination. Thismechanism of axonal loss begins at disease onset, predominates in early stagesof relapsing-remitting MS and is often clinically silent because the brain com-pensates for axonal loss. The topological relationship between inflammatory demyelination suggests that demyelinated axons components of the inflammatory environment. Proteolyticenzymes, cytokines, oxidative products and free radicals produced by activatedimmune and glial cells may cause axonal transection by reducing energymetabolism, ATP synthesis and Ca+ homeostasis. The second mechanism isprogressive degeneration of chronically demyelination axons. This processresults in the inexorable progression of neurological disability that so com-monly complicates the secondary progressive stages of MS, when brain inflam-mation often subsides. Myelin or myelin-forming cells provide trophic supportto the axon and chronic loss of myelin can result in degeneration. The possibil-ity has also been raised that the redistribution and abnormal expression of Na+channel subunits on demyelinated axolemma may render axons vulnerable channelopathy, therefore, may also contribute toMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S5 degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons. The third mechanism of axonal loss occurs in the setting of demyelination of the cerebral cortex. Tran-sected axons and dendrites are abundant in cortical lesions and they correlatewith the degree of microglia activation. Infiltration of hematogenous leuko-cytes and perivascular cuffs are not features of cortical lesions. Recent studiesindicate that significant areas (over 25%) of cerebral cortex are demyelinated inmany MS patients. A better understanding of the dynamics of cortical lesionformation is needed to fully appreciate their role in the pathogenesis of neuro-logical disability in MS.

Inrecent years it has become more evident that axonal damage is the major mor-phological substrate of permanent clinical disability. In our study we investi-gated the occurrence of acute axonal damage determined by immunocytochem-istry for amyloid precursor protein (APP) which is produced in neurons andaccumulates at sites of recent axon transection or damage. The extent of acuteaxonal damage was correlated with the stage of demyelinating activity, diseaseduration and course as well as numbers and components of the inflammatoryinfiltrate. Most APP positive axons were detected within the first year after dis-ease onset, but acute axonal damage was also detected to a minor degree inlesions of patients with a disease duration of 10 years and more. This effect wasnot due to the lack of active demyelinating lesions in the chronic disease stage.Late remyelinated lesions (so-called shadow plaques) did not show signs ofaxon destruction. The number of inflammatory cells showed a similar decreaseover time like the number of APP positive axons. There was a significant cor-relation between the extent of axon damage and the numbers of CD8-positivecytotoxic T cells and macrophages/microglia. Our results indicate that a puta-tive axon-protective treatment should start as early as possible and includestrategies preventing T cell/macrophage mediated axon destruction and leadingto remyelination axons.

Histopatho- logically MS lesions are divided into acute, chronic active and chronic inactiveplaques. Objectives: To understand the genes transcription status of the two most often MS lesions: chronic active and chronic inactive plaques we have performed acomparative cDNA microarray analysis of these two lesion types. Methods: Differential gene expression (DGE) was performed by cDNA microarray analysis of CNS tissue from 4 multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects inwhich different regions of chronic active (n=2) and chronic silent lesions (n=2) were compared.Results: DGE analysis shown a significant differences between the lesion mar- gin and lesion center in both types of lesions. Nearly 10% of the genes weredifferentially expressed in the lesion margins and centers in the chronic activeof lesions whereas less then 2% in the chronic nonactive type of lesions. 14genes were identified as overlapping in the analysis of DGE genes from differ-ent active type of lesions. These genes were mostly of inflammatory character-istic or associated with activation of cell death. To compare differencesbetween chronic active and silent lesions, we performed DGE comparison ofthe pooled data from both types of lesions. The major DGE occurred at thelesion margin, 156 (26; 5%), the greater number representing upregulatedgenes at the margin of active lesions (15%).Conclusions: We have identified a set of genes to be differentially expressed within the MS chronic type lesions that may be related with the activity of theMS chronic lesions. Thus, using microarray analysis we were able to highlighta genes associated with lesion activity in MS, many of them not previouslylinked with the disease.

Lindberg RLa, aNeurology and research, Neuroimmunology, Pharmazentrum, Basel, BS, Switzerland;bMedical Centre, MS Centre for Research and Care, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands;cDept. Roche Genetics, F. Hoffmann- La Roche, Basel, BS, Switzerland;dNetherlands Brain bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands Background: Modern MRI techniques reveal an array of changes reflecting substantial loss of axons and myelin damage in the normal appearing whitematter (NAWM). These changes develop already in early phases of MS, andare independent of lesion formation. Objectives: However, little is known about the underlying molecular mecha- nisms that lead to these NAWM changes.Methods: We compared the gene expression profile in brain tissue from active lesions and donor-matched NAWM in autopsy samples from patients with sec-ondary progressive MS (n=6) with that from controls (n=12) without neurolog-ical disease using a 13,000 gene microarray.Results: We identified 112 (34 up- and 78 down-regulated) and 41 (26 up- and 15 down-regulated) genes that were differentially expressed in lesionsand NAWM, respectively, as compared to controls. 95 RNA sequencescoded for known and 58 for unknown genes. 140/153 (91.5%) of genes dif-ferentially expressed in lesions or NAWM showed similar transcriptionalchanges in the respective other tissue compartment, as opposed to 12 genesthat were up- or down-regulated exclusively in lesions. We categorized dif-ferentially expressed known genes into five groups functional for a) tran-scriptional control, b) immune response/extracellular matrix remodeling, c)glial and d) neuronal homeostasis, and e) enzymes. Similar to lesions, 17/23of differentially expressed genes in NAWM grouped for category b), 14/17of these genes related to signaling, activation and migration of immune cells.In NAWM we found a higher prevalence of genes related to the cellularimmune response, while in lesions genes controlling immunoglobulin pro-duction prevail.Conclusions: These results support the concept that MS represents a general- ized inflammatory disease of the CNS and that focal Ig production is critical forplaque formation.

Although the responsible components of the immune system and theprecise molecular targets are still unidentified, expanded lymphocyte popula-tions have been implied in the pathogenesis. Previously we and others havedemonstrated the presence of expanded B cell clones in brain tissue and in thecerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients.Objectives: To study, whether brain tissue and CSF of MS patients contains distinct or identical B cell repertoires. Methods: We employed a PCR - based method to identify and characterize clonally expanded B cells. The method (\"CDR3 spectratyping\") relies on thenatural length variation of the third region (CDR3) of therearranged immunoglobulin gene: whereas a polyclonal B cell populationshows a random, Gauss-distributed length variation of the CDR3, a clonallyexpanded population has a uniform CDR3 length, which can be identified as asingle band on a sequencing gel. The identity of these exanded B cell clonescan often be determined by subsequent cycle sequencing.Results: We analysed matched pairs of cDNA from CSF cells and brain tissue of two MS patients who underwent brain biopsy for diagnostic reasons in theinitial phase of their disease. Histological examination of the brain tissue, CSFand clinical/MRI follow up supported the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. CSFcells were obtained 6 months (patient A) and 5 years (patient B) after brainbiopsy. Using CDR3-spectratyping, we repeatedly detected identical clonallyexpanded B cell clones both in the CSF and brain tissue compartments.Conclusions: For the first time we have shown that CSF and brain tissue of MS patients contains partly identical repertoires of expanded B cell clones. This isespecially remarkable since the time intervall between brain biopsy and spinaltap was up to 5 years. Whereas some B cell clones maintained identical CDR3region sequences, others showed signs of ongoing hypermutation. These find-ings strongly support that spinal fluid B cells at least partially represent diseaserelevant lymphocytes infiltrating MS brain tissue. Disclosure: N Goebels has nothing to disclose.

MS lesions are characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells,demyelination, axonal loss and neuronal degeneration. It has been reported byothers that CD8+ T cells can induce the apoptosis of rodent neurons via anMHC-I mediated mechanism; MHC-I expression on neurons was induced by treatment with IFN and tetrodotoxin. Given that neurons are usually negative for MHC-I expression in vivo, the current study seeks to investigate whether human neurons are also susceptible to T cell cytotoxicity and whether this canoccur through a bystander mechanism. Objectives: To determine whether activated human T cells can kill human neu- rons and to elucidate the mechanisms of this toxicity.Methods: We used a co-culture system of human fetal neurons and T cells from allogeneic PBMC or syngeneic splenocytes. T cells were activated with an anti-CD3 antibody for 72h and then incubated with neurons. After, neurons were stained with mouse anti-MAP-2 antibody conjugated to Cy3. The number of survivingMAP-2 positive neurons was counted. In some experiments, neutralizing antibodiesto defined antigens were introduced to the co-culture system to modify the killing.Results: When activated T lymphocytes were added to neuronal cultures, they aggregated around neuronal elements and death to neurons occurred promptly.By 3h of co-culture, the number of MAP-2 positive neurons was reduced by50% when compared to controls. Neuronal toxicity required the activation of Tcells since unactivated T lymphocytes did not produce any death. Allogeneic orsyngeneic activated T cells were equally deleterious to neurons. The mecha-nism of T cell mediated neuronal toxicity required cell-cell contact, and wasattenuated by neutralizing FasL, LFA-1 CD40. was evident on oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that activated human T cells can kill human neurons in vitro without the apparent need for MHC-I. Toxicity is not aresult of a graft-versus-host response as demonstrated using syngeneic co-cul-ture. Furthermore, cytotoxicity is selective for neurons. We suggest that whenT cells are activated, they enter the CNS to induce disruption of neural ele-ments and cause neuronal death. Disclosure: F Giuliani has nothing to disclose.

An alternative approach would be to inhibitmechanisms that drive the neuropathology of MS, which includes oligodendro-cyte death. Identification of molecular mechanisms that mediate the survivalresponse of injured oligodendrocytes could identify new targets for therapy. Objectives: To study the clinical effect and mechanism of action of the neu- rotrophic cytokine Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) in ExperimentalAutoimmune Encephalomyelitis We tested the effect of LIF in EAE (PLP EAE in SJL/J and MOG EAE in C57/B6 mice), including degree of spinal cord inflammation and oligodendro-cyte numbers, and performed an analysis of EAE in mice deficient in LIF receptorsignalling. We used immuno-histochemistry to study LIF Receptor (LIFR) expres-sion and IP/Western blotting to delineate LIF signaling events in the spinal cord.Results: LIF reduced disease severity in both mouse models of EAE by 1.1 points on the EAE scale (p<0.01). Delayed therapy was equally effetcive. It had no effecton inflammation, including cord infiltration, disease onset, relapse rate, spleno-cyte proliferation/cytokine production, or passive transfer efficiency. However,LIF prevented the 30% oligodendrocyte loss seen in our EAE models, both in greyand white matter. Immuno-histochemistry revealed up-regulation of LIFR onoligodendrocytes in EAE. Western blots confirmed increased expression of LIFR,and showed that LIF both accessed the spinal cord and induced phosphorylationof both LIFR and STAT-3. Mice doubly heterozygous for the LIFR beta deletionand a gp130 truncation exhibited delayed, marked worsening of EAE with 100%lethality. This correlated with a three-fold increase in oligodendrocyte apoptosisin spinal cord, and a 60% reduction in white matter oligodendrocytes (p<0.001).Conclusions: This study identifies that LIF directly prevents oligodendrocyte death in EAE. We also demonstrate that this therapeutic effect complementsendogenous LIF receptor signalling, which already serves to limit oligodendro-cyte loss during immune attack. Our work suggests that oligodendroglial pro-tection may provide a novel approach to the treatment of MS.

Bruno Sa,b, Frederic Na, Marie Stephane Aa, Bernard Za, Catherine La acentre d'investigation clinique, h\u00f4pital de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France;bInserm U 495, H\u00f4pital de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France Background: In multiple sclerosis myelin repair is generally insufficient despite relative survival of oligodendrocytes within the plaques and recruit-ment of oligodendrocyte precursors. Promoting remyelination appears to be acrucial therapeutic challengeObjectives: Using a newly developed enzymatic index of myelination, we screened different neurotrophic factors for their ability to enhance myelination. Methods: Neurotrophic factors were added to the culture medium of myelinat- ing cocultures between 11 and 25 days in vitro. Results: Neurotrophins (NGF, NT-3, NT4/5, BDNF), GDNF related growth factors such as PDGF-AA, FGF-2, or insulindid not increase myelinogenesis. In contrast, among factors belonging to theCNTF family, CNTF, LIF, cardiotrophin-1, and oncostatin M induced a strongpro-myelinating effect. We provide evidence that CNTF acts on oligodendro-cytes by favoring their final maturation, and that this effect is mediated throughthe gp-130 receptor common to the CNTF family, and transduced through thejanus kinase pathway.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a novel role for neurotrophic factors of the CNTF family, and raise the possibility that these factors might be of thera-peutical interest to promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis.

Session II Impact of Relapses on Disability: NaturalHistory and Clinical Trials Data 20 THE ROLE OF EXACERBATIONS IN PERSISTENT IMPAIRMENT IN MS Lublin Fa, Cutter Gb, Baier Mc aCorinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for MS, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, USA;bPythagoras, Inc., Reno, Nevada, USA;cAMC Cancer Center, Denver, Colorado, USA Abstract Body: Although it is intuitively obvious that repeated exacerbations may lead to step-wise worsening of neurological function in patients with MS,the actual role of exacerbations has not been quantified. For this study, wequeried a database of placebo patients from several completed clinical trials ofrelapsing forms of MS to determine the effect of exacebation on clinicalcourse. In these trials, patients had periodic (usually q 3 month) assessmentsand also examinations at the time of exacerbation. Thus, we had a pre-exacer-bation assessment of EDSS and Scripps score, intra-exacerbation scores andfollow-up evalautions. We found that there was a mean worsening of 0.4 EDSSunits. This finding persisted when patients were assessed more than 30 daysafter an exacerbation. Of those patients with exacerbations, 45% had residualimpairment. The finding were similar for the Scripps score, with an averageworsening of 2 points. The percent of patients with residual deficits increasedwith the length of time between the exacerbation and the follow-up visit, sup-porting the permanence of the effect. These results indicate that exacerabtionsin MS can leave residual deficit, in a step-wise fashion, and as such are animportant therapeutic target. The results are consistent with the outcomes ofclinical trials in RR MS.

The classical view isto consider that MS is an organ-specific auto-immune disease, i.e. that inflam-mation is the cause of the neurodegeneration. The succession of relapses even-tually leads to accumulation of disability and clinical progression could resultfrom infraclinical relapses. A series of recent observations tend to challengethis classical concept. Interferons beta have well-known effects in MS. Theylead to a 30 % reduction in the relapse rate and to a more than 50 % reductionin conventional MRI activity. Despite this strong effect on inflammation, theeffect of interferons on disability is only marginal and possibly relapse-reduc-tion driven. Administration of Campath-1H to MS patients results in a pro-found and prolonged lymphopenia, and the suppression of clinical and MRIactivity. In spite of this, progression of clinical disability and cerebral atrophystill occurs. The relapse rate decreases dramatically during pregnancy, notablyduring the third trimester. By contrast, the three-month post-partum period ischaracterized by a 60 % increase of the relapse rate. Despite these dramaticchanges in the frequency of relapses, progression of disability goes on. Strikingresults have also come from the study of the natural history of MS in the LyonMS Cohort. Progression of irreversible disability from the assignment of ascore of 4 on the DSS Kurtzke scale to the assignment of a score of 6 or 7 isunaffected by the presence or the absence of a relapsing-remitting phase beforethe progressive phase of MS. The same observation is true regarding the pres-ence or the absence of superimposed relapses during the progressive phase,either primary or secondary. All these observations give some credit to the factthat relapses do not essentially influence irreversible disability in the long termin MS. They are consistent with what has been shown at the individual level inthe 70's by performing serial quantitative neurological examinations over sev-eral years, and with what is currently emerging from early and serial structuralbrain MRI studies.

Various agents with distinct mechanisms of action and effectsMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S8 are currently available for the treatment of RRMS. The onset of action of these agents can be measured by their effect on several biologic, imaging, and clini-cal parameters.Objectives: To evaluate the time course of early clinical effects of glatiramer acetate (GA) in decreasing the rate of relapse in patients with RRMS.Methods: The effect of SC administration of GA 20 mg QD on decreasing the primary endpoint of relapse rate was evaluated in a randomized, placebo con-trolled trial of 251 patients with RRMS. Regular quarterly and as needed clinicvisits were performed to assess outcome and relapse events with a standardizedcriteria. Mean relapse rate was analyzed using ANCOVA, with tests for study-drug-by-center interaction and including the priori-defined covariates: sex, dis-ease duration (years), prior 2 year relapse rate, and baseline EDSS to evaluatethe time course of effect on relapse rate with GA treatment compared toplacebo.Results: The beneficial treatment effect of GA treatment compared to placebo on decreasing relapse rate at month 3 was 17%, p=NS; month 6 was 27%, p=.074; month 9 was 25%, p=.047; month 12 was 27%, p=.018; month 15 was 24%, p=.034; month 18 p=.014; month 24 p=.007; and atapproximately 30 months was 32%, p=.002.Conclusions: The clinical benefit of GA on decreasing relapse rate is seen rela- tively quickly with widening divergence at 6 months and statistically signifi-cant divergence seen at 9 months. Sustained and increasing benefit wasobserved throughout the 30 month follow-up.

Methods: 308 patients were randomized to double blind-treatment with IFN- beta-1a 22 mcg s/c qw or extensionwith open-label treatment theprimary endpoint, conversion to CDMS, could stay in the study or withdrawand start best available therapy, at the physician's discretion.Results: Fewer patients initially randomized to IFN converted to CDMS com- pared to those randomized to placebo, over the 4 years (67/154 (43.5%) vs79/154 (51.3%). Although the difference at 2 years was statistically significant,it was not at 4 years (p=0.115). The time to conversion (40th percentile) wasprolonged but not significantly (27.9 months IFN vs 16.3 placebo, p=0.114).Annualised relapse rate was not significantly different between treatmentgroups over four years. Of the 263 patients who entered year 3, 174 (66%) hadnot converted to CDMS before the end of year 2 (96 IFN, 78 placebo). Ofthese, 25 (14%) randomised converted to CDMS during years 3 or 4 (p=0.604). The global conver- sion rate dropped from 47% in the first two years to 14% in the second 2 years. Conclusions: During the extension phase the conversion rate was lower in both groups, compared to the double blind phase. The benefit of low doses of IFNseem to be limited to the early phases of the disease. Disclosure: Professor Comi has served as a Consultant to Serono.

Reported frequencies and clinicalimpact of anti-IFN-beta NAB vary depending on the IFN-beta preparation andadministration.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of different serum concentrations of NAB on the therapeutic efficacy in all IFN-beta treated patients in Denmark, using different sensitivities of the bioassay.Methods: We measured NAB every 6 months for up to 48 months in 422 con- secutive MS patients who from 1996 to 1998 started treatment with a commercialIFN-beta preparation. Measurements of NAB were performed in a blinded fash-ion, using anti-viral neutralization (A549/EMC) bioassays with high (3 LU/ml),medium (10 LU/ml), and low (100 LU/ml) sensitivity and employing differentneutralizing capacities as cut-off value for definition of NAB-positive samples.Results: NAB generally appeared within 12 months after start of treatment and faster with IFN- beta-1b than IFN-beta-1a. However, after 36 months of treat-ment we observed a significant reduction in the number of NAB-positivepatients treated with IFN-beta-1b. The presence of NAB had a significanteffect on the relapse rate. During NAB-positive periods, we found a signifi-cantly higher relapse rate with odds ratios from 1.42 to 1.55 (p<0.01) that wererelatively independent of the sensitivity of the assay (medium or low) and cut-off values for neutralizing capacity between 20% and 50%. The time to firstrelapse in NAB-negative patients was significantly increased by 270 days inKaplan-Meier analysis of the probability of remaining exacerbation-free (logrank test p=0.028). In this short study, we found a trend but no significanteffect of the presence of NAB on disease progression measured on EDSS.Conclusions: The results document that the occurrence of NAB reduces the clinical effect. The frequency of NAB against IFN-beta depends on the sensitiv-ity the neutralizing assay. In patients who are not doing well on IFN-beta ther-apy, the presence of NAB should raise the question about change of treatment.

The centre is sponsored bythe MS International Federation, multiple national MS societies and privateMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S9 donors. This centre originated from a desire by international investigators to define meaningful treatment responses to experimental agents and to guidefuture research activities in the complex setting of partially-effective agents(the end of the placebo-era). The goal was to access existing natural historydata sets and data from completed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to permitstatistical modeling and meta-analyses to advance RCT methodology. A spe-cific effort will be the exploration of laboratory marker data to understand dis-ease course.Objectives: To expedite the discovery of effective therapies by improving RCT design and conduct and by the validation of markers of disease activity.Analyses will be conducted to maintain anonymity of the data sets.Methods: Nineteen data sets (7000 patients; > 30,000 years follow-up) are housed at the SLCMSR and a similar number of contracts are being negotiatedfor further data donation. The Scientific Director, Professor A. Neiss togetherwith his staff, an international Scientific Oversight Committee, and two work-ing groups (Clinical Trials Working Group [CTWG] and MRI WG), eight ini- tial projects for study have been identified. Results: The CTWG studies focus on the influence of clinical and MRI param- eters on the short- and long-term disease course (factors contributing to stabil-ity, improvement, transient and unremitting worsening and the development ofsecondary progression) and the behaviors of placebo groups across RCTs. TheMRI WG is addressing interactions of clinical variables with MRI markers ofdisease activity. The SLCMSR will issue a Request for Proposals in the finalquarter of 2002 inviting grant applications to address questions aligned with thestrategic goals of the centre.Conclusions: The SLCMSR has acquired substantial informative data sets from investigators and industry sponsors. Significant progress has been madein the short time since inception. The resources of the SLCMSR will soon bemore widely available to investigators to address additional clinical researchquestions.

Session III Inflammation, Demyelination and AxonalLoss: Insights From Imaging 26 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONTRAST ENHANCING LESIONS ANDAXONAL LOSS Frank JA LDRR/NIH, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA Abstract Body: Contrast enhancing lesions (CEL) are a marker of acute inflammation and have provided an understanding of the pathophysiology ofmultiple sclerosis (MS). CEL have also been used as outcome measures to mon- itor MS activity, either natural or modified by experimental treatments and increases in CEL are correlated to clinical exacerbations. The relationshipbetween CEL and axonal loss or permanent tissue damage is not completelyelucidated, as it is apparent that there is continued tissue damage and atrophythat occurs independent of detected inflammation by MRI. Serial monthly MRIstudies have shown a modest relationship to T1 \"Black Holes\" (i.e., demyelina-tion, axonal loss, gliosis and possibly remyelination) and relatively weak corre-lation to the progression of cerebral atrophy over short term (i.e., < 2 years).However, long-term follow-up suggests that MS patients with increasing num-bers of CEL have a greater degree of atrophy at >8 years. Therefore it is neces-sary to explore the natural history of CEL, the progression and relationship ofthese lesions to T1 hypointensities over long follow-up periods and determine if there is a relationship between CEL and exacerbations or clinical outcome withtime. Lastly, the long term (i.e., >8 years) relationship CEL and cerebral atro-phy (a cumulative measure of both microscopic and macroscopic disease activ-ity) will be discussed.

Recently-developed MR techniques are, however, better suited for such a role. These techniques include: (i) magnetization transfer imaging (MTI),(ii) short T 2imaging, (iii) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), (iv) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), (v) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and (vi) MR-based measures of brain atrophy. Imaging Myelin Integrity MTIprovides contrast based on the exchange of magnetization between waterbound to macromolecules, which is normally MR-invisible, and bulk water. Incerebral white matter, MTI is relatively specific for myelin because most ofthe exchange originates from myelin. Quantitative MTI is technically moredemanding than standard MTI but has the advantage that it is not affected by edema. Short T 2imaging quantifies water trapped within the layers of the myelin sheath and appears to specifically measure the amount of myelin (both normal and abnormal) that is present. Increases in MRS-measured choline, ametabolite associated with membrane turnover, and MRS-measured mobilelipids are associated with active myelin breakdown. Imaging Axonal IntegrityMRS measurement of the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NA), providesa specific surrogate of axonal integrity but at much lower spatial resolutionthan that available from water-based imaging. Imaging Structural IntegrityDWI and DTI provide contrast based on the structural integrity of both myelinand axons. MR-based measures of brain atrophy show loss of tissue thatincludes myelin and axons; importantly, however, any such observed volumeloss is attenuated by any co-occurring gliosis or expansion of extracellularspaces. Findings in MS When appropriately applied, the above methods showabnormalities, not only of MR-visible lesions, but also of normal-appearingwhite and grey matter. Furthermore, changes in MT, DWI, and MRS may pre-cede the development of MR-visible lesions. The correlations between thesedifferent surrogates, as well as between these measures and disability, indicatethat they measure aspects of MS pathology that are related but not necessarilythe same.

Barkhof F VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands Abstract Body: Little is know about the imaging appearance of remyelination. While postron emission tomography (PET) may have the required sensitivity tovisualize remylination, no tracer is available for in vivo imaging. Magnetic res-onance (MR)imaging is very sensitive to alterations in brain composition, butlacks histopathological speicifity. Remyelinated lesions have increased signalon T2-weighted images, and a mildly decreased signal on T1-weighted images.Serial images reveal a decrease in T1-signal intensity after cessation ofenhancement, suggestive, but certainly not spcific for, remyelination. For themagnetic transfer ratio (MTR), a similar temporal profile has been linked inanimal models to the occurence of remyelination.

Grossman R University of California, San Francisco, California, USA Abstract Body: It is clear that the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is not \"normal\" at all. Theterm NAWM is misleading. What is normal at 0.3 tesla is not normal at 1.5tesla. What is normal at 1.5 tesla is clearly not normal at 7 or 8 tesla. Images atsuch high field strengths clearly reveal tiny MS lesions. What is normal byimaging is not normal by diffusion or spectroscopy. It is just as important todistinguish what the abnormalities represent as to detect them. As MR method- ology becomes more powerful and resolving power improves there will be much less discussion of NAWM and much more characterization of what isabnormal. Biophysical measures including magnetization transfer and diffu-sion clearly reveal abnormalities that cannot be detected on conventionalimages. Higher field imaging (3 T or >) will enable better delineation of theseabnormalities. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can detect metabolic equiva-lents of structural abnormalities including low levels of N-acetyl aspartate andelevated levels of choline in what is now considered NAWM. Abnormalities inwhat is today considered NAWM appear to be diffuse in nature and contributeto the neurological deficit. They are potentially the most interesting aspect ofthe MS lesion for this may represent an early reversible component of the dis-ease. How we quantitate and characterize such lesions will allow us to detecttreatment effects and potentially provide prognostic information in rapid andaccurate fashion. Our reseach goals must be to exploit all MR techniques thatfacilitate improving our sensitivity and specificity with respect to the so-called\"NAMW\". Disclosure: R Grossman has nothing to disclose.

They also showed positive treatmenteffect on MRI-derived metrics. Objectives: This study reports the results of normalized brain volume (NBV) measurements from patients at presentation with SMS recruited in theETOMS trial.Methods: Of the original 309 patients, electronic MRI data for NBV assess- ment were available for 131 patients 22mg of interferonbeta-1a (Rebif, Ares Serono) subcutaneously once a week and 132 identicalplacebo. The study duration was 24 months. NBV was measured using a fully-automated technique called SIENA. Results: Mean NBV at study entry were 1503 ml (SD=89 ml) for placebo and 1496 ml (SD=122 ml) for treated patients. The mean percentage changes of NBV from baseline to month 24 were significant for both placebo and treatedpatients (p<0.001). However, the mean percentage reduction of NBV over the24 month study period was significantly higher for placebo (-1.68%) than fortreated (-1.18%) patients (p=0.003). Over the entire study period, significantcorrelations were found between the NBV percentage change and the numberof enhancing lesions (r=-0.18, p=0.006) and the number of new (r=-0.29, p<0.001) lesions formed during the first year correlated significantly with brain volume changes during the second year of the study.Conclusions: The rate of brain tissue loss in the SMS patients is close to that reported in patients with more advanced disease and an early treatment withinterferon beta-1a is able to reduce the rate of brain tissue loss in these patients.

However no long-term follow-up data exist on the roleof enhanced lesions and \"black holes\".Objectives: To assess the long-term predictive value of baseline MRI parame- ters including location of the lesions, gadolinium-enhancement and \"blackholes\" in patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) for mild disability as defined by EDSS 3. Methods: After a median follow-up period of 8.7 years, hospital charts of 42 patients presenting with CIS were reviewed and assessed for date of conversionto CDMS, date at which EDSS 3 or 6 was reached and EDSS at last follow-up.MRI parameters were dichotomized according to maximum accuracy and sub-sequentely hazard ratios were calculated.Results: Conversion rate to CDMS was observed in 26 patients (62%) of which 14 patients progressed to EDSS 3. Infratentorial lesions are the best pre- dictors for long-term disability (hazard ratio 6.3). Predictive value of enhanced lesions and \"black holes\" seems limited.Conclusions: Infratentorial lesions predict long-term disability and may help to identify patients at high risk for progressive disease.

However, why some CEL are morelikely to form a persistent BH over time is not completely understood. The dura-tion of the inflammatory process is a possible explanation for this observation.Objectives: To evaluate the influence of duration in time of a CEL on the dura- tion in time of a BH over the natural history of MS patients followed monthlyfor four years. Methods: Eight MS patients (male/female: 7/1, mean age 35.2 \u00b15.9, EDSS 2.4\u00b11.4, 3.8 \u00b15.0) had 48 monthly MRIs. The number of CEL and of BH in the corresponding un-enhanced scan was evaluated. A BH was defined as any hypointense region visible on the T1-Weighted Images (WI)Multiple SclerosisOral Presentations S11 with high signal intensity on the T2-WI and without enhancement in the corre- spondent post-contrast scans. Only BHs with a previously identified CEL wereconsidered for the analysis. Cox Proportion Hazards models were used to eval-uate the effect of enhancing time on BH duration.Results: Out of 878 new CEL, 158 turned into a BH (17.9%). The mean dura- tion in time of these BHs was 9.3 \u00b19.7 months. The results of Cox Regression Analysis showed that among those CEL that formed a BH the increase in the duration of the enhancement significantly influenced the duration of the corre- sponding BHs (p =0.04), with each additional month of enhancement leading to a 22% reduction in the rate at which BHs disappear. Conclusions: The enhancement duration is an important factor in BH duration. The longer the duration of the enhancement in a given active lesion, the higheris the chance to persist as a BH over time, thus accumulating a permanent dam-age and disability in MS.

Session IV The Blood Brain Barrier as a Target forTreatment 33 ADHESION MOLECULES AND THEIR ROLE IN PATHOGENESIS Antel Seguin R, Prat A Neurosurgery, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Abstract Body: Cellular immune trafficking across the blood brain barrier (BBB) involves a series of molecular interactions between such cells and thecells and extra cellular matrix (ECM) that comprise the BBB. These interac-tions include the processes cell-cell adhesion; chemoattraction, ECMdegradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). With specific regard toadhesion molecules, expression of these molecules is up-regulated on lympho-cytes and monocytes when such cells are activated, as is observed to occur inconcert with active phases of multiple sclerosis (MS). In situ studies of centralnervous system (CNS) microvessels derived from MS cases, demonstrate up-regulation of the ligands for a number of adhesion molecules on endothelialcells (ECs) when compared to ECs from non-inflammatory control cases. Tomodel the role of cell-cell adhesion in cell trafficking across the BBB, we have examined the interaction of lymphocytes and monocytes derived from the peripheral blood of MS patients and controls with human brain (HB)ECsderived from non-inflammatory surgical tissue specimens. These HBECs con-stitutively express moderate levels of ICAM-1 but only very low levels ofVCAM-1. Expression of both of these adhesion molecules is up-regulatedwhen the HBECs are exposed to Th1 cytokine producingCD4 T cell neither up-regulate norinhibit adhesion molecule expression. Using a Boyden chamber assay system,we can demonstrate that both lymphocyte and monocyte migration across abarrier of HBECs grown on a fibronectin matrix can be inhibited by antibodiesdirected at ICAM-1 but not VCAM-1. Antibodies directed at the VCAM-1 lig-and VLA-4 do inhibit migration, implicating VLA-4 binding to an alternateligand (Connecting Segment (CS-1) fragment of fibronectin) as the functionalevent. Adhesion molecules remain targets for therapeutic intervention in MS(eg anti-VLA-4 antibodies). Neither Copaxone nor intereferon (IFN IFN treated lymphocytes induce VCAM on VCAM-1 al 2001). sVCAM provide a means to trans-endothelialmigration.

There is a substantial and growing literature concerningtheir biological functions in development, inflammation and degeneration ofthe nervous system. The core hypothesis of our research is that chemokines andtheir receptors are significantly involved in leukocyte invasion, differentiation,activation, tissue destruction and repair in the nervous system. Furthermore,resident neuroepithilial cells both make and respond to chemokines. To addressthis hypothesis and identify the molecular targets for therapeutic endeavors, weexamine chemokine and chemokine receptor expression and function. Thesestudies comprise material from patients with neurological disorders, diseasemodels in mice, and tissue culture studies. We make extensive use of trans-genic and knockout mice to clarify how chemokines exert their remarkablyspecific effects in vivo in the face of apparent functional redundancy in vitro.Additional Reading: (1) Huang DR, Wang J, Kivisakk P, Rollins BJ, Ranso-hoff RM.

WEE YONG, DEPARTMENTSOF ONCOLOGY & CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OFCALGARY Yong V Oncology & Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary,Alberta, Canada Abstract Body: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in MS (reviewed in Yong et al., Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2: 502-511, 2001).This presentation will review the evidence that MMPs have a role in the pathol-ogy and the progression of disease in MS. It will also address which MMP fam-ily members (of 26) may be important to consider as having important roles inMS. Evidence will be presented that in experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, specific MMP members areexpressed at the initiation of clinical disease while others become prominentMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S12 during the evolution of the disease. The mechanisms by which MMPs may contribute to CNS pathology will be discussed. It is important to appreciate thatsome MMP members may be expressed following injury in an attempt to limitdestruction or to attempt repair. In this regard, it is worthy of consideration thatduring myelinogenesis, the extension of oligodendrocyte processes through aCNS matrix may require MMPs to remodel the extracellular environment. Evi-dence will be presented that MMP-9 plays a role in process formation by oligo-dendrocytes and that there is deficient remyelination in MMP-9 null mice fol-lowing lysolecithin induced demyelination of the mouse spinal cord. Insummary, MMPs have important roles in the pathology of MS. Inhibitors ofMMP activity are appropriate therapeutic agents to consider in the disease.Nonetheless, caution is advised that specific MMPs, under particular circum-stances, may have reparative roles.

New lesions exhibit BBB breakdown andperivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. The location of lesions around cere-bral venules suggests that BBB breakdown may have a key role in lesiongenesis. Serial MRI studies using gadolinium-chelate contrast agentshave demonstrated BBB breakdown as a consistent feature of new lesionsin relapse onset MS. However, new or enlarging lesions may develop with-out BBB breakdown in primary progressive MS and possibly in otherforms of the disease. Diffuse abnormalities of the normal appearing whitematter also occur, and the relationship of these to BBB breakdown isuncertain. It is however, likely that BBB breakdown is more extensive thanthe regions of gadolinium enhancement that are detectable to the eye.There is good evidence for low grade leakage in chronic lesions, and it mayalso exist in normal appearing white matter. Using gadoliniumenhanced MIR, there is a relationship of BBB leakage with relapses, butnot with progressive MS. Many immunosuppressive and immunomodula-tory treatments have been shown to suppress new areas of focal BBB leak-age. High dose intravenous steroids have a similar but transient effect onpre-existing and new enhancing lesions. Recently, the monoclonal anti-adhesion molecule antibody, anti-VLA4 (natalizumab), has shown dra-matic effects in reducing by 90% the frequency of new areas of BBB leak-age, but unlike intravenous steroids, does not effect the existing areas ofleakage. Natalizumab treated patients also experienced a reduced relapserate by 50% in the 6 month placebo controlled exploratory trial, and exhib-ited increased well being compared to those on placebo. Two year studiesof this agent are now underway to evaluate its long term safety and effi-cacy, and in particular the effect on disability. Such long term studies areimportant, in view of the uncertain relationship between focal BBBchanges and progressive disability.

Snyder E Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA ABSTRACT NOT AVAILABLE FOR PUBLICATION Session VNeuroprotection 38 MOLECULAR BASIS OF LIMITED REMYELINATION IN MULTIPLESCLEROSIS Raine CS, John G, Brosnan CF Pathology (Neuropathology), Neurology and Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA Abstract Body: Although CNS remyelination in MS is well-known, that its occurrence and extent is not more widespread has perplexed investigators formany years. Among frequently proposed causes of incomplete remyelination inMS, scarring astroglia, inflammation, macrophage activity and serum factors arethe most studied, but to date, no satisfactory explanation has emerged. Duringan investigation of gene expression by astrocytes in vitro following activation by the inflammatory cytokine, TGF 1 (John et al., submitted), induced expres- sion was noted of Jagged1, a transmembrane protein shown to suppress the dif- ferentiation of oligodendrocytes, through activation of Notch1. Since TGF 1 expression and reactive astrocytes are common features of active MS, we con- ducted a study on MS lesions displaying demyelination and remyelination. Byimmunocytochemistry, a broad zone of reactive, hypertrophic astrocytes sur-rounded acute and chronic active lesions lacking remyelination, and these cellsdisplayed decreasing expression of Jagged1 away from the lesion. TheseJagged1 positive astrocytes were invariably associated with a population ofsmall rounded cells revealed by immunocytochemistry to be oligodendrocytes expressing PDGFR , O4 and some NG2, indicative of immature, precursor phenotype. These oligodendrocytes expressed Notch1 and Hes5, a downstream gene in the Jagged1/Notch1 pathway also associated with inhibition of differen-tiation. On the other hand, within remyelinated lesions adjacent to activelesions, astrocytes displayed negligible expression of Jagged1, and oligodendro-cytes were negative for Notch pathway activation. Thus, oligodendrocytes at themargins of active MS lesions may be inhibited from maturing into myelinatingcells by the activation of Notch1 on their surface by the ligand, Jagged1, onastrocytes and this molecular inhibition may account for the limited remyelina-tion in active MS lesions.

Myelin alsoactivates complement, which is amplified >50-fold by anti-myelin Ab. Thus,C5b-9-dependent demyelination can be more prevalent in vivo in the presenceof Ab. This hypothesis is supported by recent works by Mead and by Tran, using EAE in C6-deficient rats. This detrimental role on myelin contrasts with the OLG survival actually enhanced by sublytic C5b-9. In defined medium,OLG progenitors differentiate and undergo apoptosis. We found that C5b-9rescues OLG from serum deprivation- and TNF-induced death, by regulatingapoptosis at multiple levels, by increasing BCL-2 synthesis, inhibiting caspase3 and 9, preventing cytochrome c release, and reducing BAD-BCL-Xl com-plex. They are in part regulated by PI-3 kinase/Akt pathways and associatedwith BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 and 136. We then examined the role ofC5b-9 on remyelination and apoptosis with C. Raine and S. usingDNA microarray of EAE induced in C5(-) and C5(+) mice. Inflammation anddemyelination were more restricted in C5(-) mice, as expected. Noteworthy isour our finding that the lesions of chronic EAE were replaced with gliotic scarin C5(-) mice, but showed robust remyelination in C5(+) mice. Acute EAEspinal cords of these mice were compared for the mean expression of each 96genes of apoptosis. Of 96, 23 showed >2.5-fold difference in expression. InC5(-) mice, 17 of 20 genes expressed higher were pro-apoptotic families ofBCL-2, caspase, TNF/TNFR, and CRADD/CAD, while only 4 of 10 in C5(+)mice were pro-apoptotic. Hierarchical clustering of samples and differentiatllyexpressed genes revealed, with a few exception, that C5(-) mice clustered sep-arately from C5(+) mice. Together, our data support the beneficial role of C5b-9 in demyelinating disorders by down-regulating apoptotic gene expressionand promoting OLG survival and remyelination.

Hohlfeld R Institute for Clinical Neuroimmunology, University of Munich, Bavaria,Germany Abstract Body: Recent evidence suggests that inflammatory reactions in the CNS can have beneficial and even neuroprotective effects. Intriguingly,immune cells are capable of producing neuroprotective molecules of theneurotrophin family. The concept of \"neuroprotective immunity\" has pro-found consequences for the pathogenesis and treatment of neuroinflamma-tory diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), and is also important for neurode-generative disorders, in which inflammatory reactions often occur. In MSlesions immune cells produce brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),whereas neurons and astrocytes express the appropriate tyrosine kinasereceptor TrkB. This observation together with functional evidence for theneuroprotective effects of immune cells support the concept of \"neuropro-tective immunity\". In addition a protective role of endogenous CNTF hasrecently been demonstrated in EAE by comparing the severity of EAE inwild-type and CNTF-knockout mice. Several neurotrophic and growth fac-tors have been employed for the treatment of EAE. Pilot studies clearlydemonstrated that growth factors like NGF, IGF-1, or GGF-2 can have ben-eficial effects in EAE. However, some of these effects seem to be primarilymediated by immunomodulation rather than primary CNS protection or repair. These observations have important implications for the treatment ofmultiple sclerosis.

Ciliary neurotrophicfactor (CNTF) is a survival factor that also promotes differentiation of oligo-dendrocytes. 3% homozygous deletions in the CNTF gene exist in the Euro-pean population. Objectives: We compared clinical course and neuropathological features in CNTF-knockout and wild-type C57BL/6 mice using experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model for MS. Methods: EAE was induced by immunization with MOG peptide 35-55. Ani- mals were clinically scored and weighed on a daily basis. At various timepoints spinal cord, brain and optic nerves were analyzed by histo- andimmunoimmunocyto-chemistry. For quantification, coded sections werecounted by blinded observers. To investigate the peripheral priming andinduction of the immune response, lymph node proliferation assays were per-formed. Results: CNTF deficient mice exhibited a significantly earlier onset of disease (p<0.005, 80 mice per group) and showed enhanced disability during the course of disease until day 100 p.i. (p=0.002). Histopathologic changes were mostly confined to the anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord withprominent vacuolation and myelin destruction. In early and later stages of thedisease, CNTF deficiency was associated with histopathological featuresindicative of oligodendrocyte cell death. Increased apoptosis of oligodendro-cytes was seen on semithin sections and by TUNEL assay. In parallel prolifer-ation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells was decreased by 60% in CNTFknockout mice. The severe vacuolar pathology in CNTF deficient mice couldbe prevented by treatment with an antiserum against TNF-alpha. No significantdifferences in proliferative response to MOG in primed lymphocytes or innumbers of infiltrating T-cells and macrophages could be observed betweenCNTF-knockout and wild-type mice.Conclusions: These results underscore the critical role of CNTF for oligoden- drocyte integrity in the inflamed CNS.

This is true for multiple sclerosis where IFNb does not reach inflammation sites. Objectives: To circumvent this problem, we evaluated the feasibility of genet- ically altering bone marrow cells ex-vivo, and using them as vehicles to trans-fer the IFNb cDNA into the mouse CNS. Methods: An vector (pLXSN-IFNb) was used to stably transfect PA317 cells (Producer cells). The supernatant from these pro-ducer cells, which contain IFNb-expressing provirus, were used to infectmouse bone marrow cells. IFNb-transduced marrow cells were then trans-planted into irradiated SJL mice via intravenous injection. IFNb expressionwas CNS by and immunocytochem-istry. Results: IFNb-engineered marrow cells accessed the CNS and expressed IFNb mRNA and protein. Marrow cells transduced with a control neomycin vectorentered the brain and expressed the neomycin but not IFNb gene. In the CNS,IFNb delivered by marrow cells induced the mRNA expression of 2-5 oligoad- enylate synthetase (2-5-OAS) indicating biological activity. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrating that bone marrow cells can serve as a delivery system for IFNb cDNA into the CNS could have implications for thetreatment of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, viral encephali-tis and brain tumors. Preliminary therapeutic results in experimental allergicencephalomyelitis will be presented. Disclosure: S Dhib-Jalbut has nothing to disclose.

Neurology, 3.LF, Plzen, Czech Republic;gDpt. of Hematology, Charles University, Plzen, Czech Republic Background: The program of bone marrow transplantation in multiple sclero- sis (MS) started in Czech Republic in January 1998. It has been offered to MSpatients who failed to react to convention therapies including immunosuppres-sive regimens. Objectives: To prove the manipulation of immune system with high-dose immunoablation and autologous stem cell (SC) support is both tolerable andstabilizing therapeutic access in malignant MS. Methods: 26 pts (15 females, 11 males, age 36.3 \u00b17.4, EDSS 6.3 \u00b10.6) with SP MS, rapid progression ( 1.0 EDSS/last year), failure of steroids and at least one salvage regimen (interferon beta, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone), and no major organ dysfunction were involved in the study, signed informed con-cent and underwent mobilization of SC with cyclophosphamide 4g/m2 and G-CSF. 23 SCtherapy Results: Efficacy: 13 patients with SCT are followed 2-4 years, 9 of them either stable or with improved EDSS, 1 pt died 30 months after SCT (from peri-tonitis). 4 pts are followed 12 months, all are stable. MRI has revealed no activ-ity in 10 pts. Improvement, if any, have started after 4-6 months after SCT andneeded sustained rehabilitation effort. 3 pts failed to mobilize stem cells, 1 ptimproved after mobilization and refused immunoablation. Safety: Peritrans-plantation morbidity: 2 pts underwent life threatening events: 1 pt with brain-stem impairment had severe mucositis and respiratory distress, needed 7 daysof supportive ventilation, recovered, but deteriorated by 1.5 EDSS. 1 pt hadCMV pneumonia and gut bleeding, needed 12 days of supportive ventilation,deteriorated by 2 EDSS. 1 pt developed factor VIII inhibitor syndrome 1 yr after SCT.Conclusions: High-dose immunoablation with SCT may stabilize or improve the course of MS in some pts with malignant course. The procedure itself mayrepresent high risk for patients with brainstem involvement, high EDSS andintensive immunosuppressive pretreatment. Disclosure: E Havrdova has nothing to disclose.

Session VIHot Topics in Neuroimmunology 44 CYTOKINE REGULATION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Weiner H, Khoury SJ Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Abstract Body: MS is an inflammatory disease of the CNS presumed to be Th1 type cell mediated autoimmune disease. There is increased IL-12 by intracyto-plasmic staining and anti-CD3 stimulation and IL-12 is increased more in pro-gressive than relapsing-remitting (RR) disease MS. Increased IL-12 is linked toincreased IFN-g and the interaction between T cells and APCs via CD40-CD40Linteractions. There are twice as many IL-12 secreting cells in the peripheral bloodif there is Gadolinium enhancement on MRI. Cyclophosphamide decreases IL-12in MS which is related to clinical response to therapy. Patients with elevated IL-12may not respond as well to IFN-beta. IL-18 is increased in RR and progressiveMS. In controls and RR MS neutralizing anti-IL-12 and anti-IL-18 alone equallysuppressed IFN-g production whereas in progressive MS, maximum suppressionwas only observed when neutralizing anti-IL-12 and anti-IL-18 were giventogether, suggesting that in progressive MS, IL-12 and IL-18 function in a non-linked manner to induce IFN-g. Elevated IL-18 production was also dependent onCD40-CD40L interactions and IL-18 levels correlated with disease duration inprogressive MS. We found a defect in regulation of both IL-12 and IFN-g byendogenous IL-10 in progressive MS which could contribute to the transition ofMS from the relapsing to the progressive stage. Dendritic cells also may con-tribute to the cytokine milieu in MS and the increased Th1 milieu in progressiveMS as dendritic cells from progressive MS are polarized in a Th1 type pattern.INF-g levels are linked to MRI measures of disease activity and polarization ofdendritic cells. Th1 type chemokine receptor expression (CXCR3 and CCR5) isincreased in MS and to a greater extent in progressive MS. Taken together, a pre-dominant Th1 type cytokine milieu exists in MS that is linked to clinical and MRImeasures and is more pronounced in progressive MS. Currently usedimmunomodulatory drugs appear to act in part by decreasing this Th1 polarization and further development of treatments that decrease Th1 and increase the Th2 and Th3 (TGF-b) cytokine milieu are likely to benefit MS. Increased immune dys-function in progressive MS must be reconciled with the disease becoming moredegenerative progressive MS and less responsive to immunomodulatory therapy.

Martin R Neuroimmunology Branch, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,Maryland, USA Abstract Body: Specific intervention with the T cell-mediated autoimmune process in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases has longbeen an attractive goal. Such therapies require a sound understanding of theMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S15 specificity/ies of pathogenic T cells and the development of effective therapeu- tic strategies that allow to selectively target these cell populations. Both in theanimal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),there is good evidence that certain myelin proteins including myelin basic pro-tein (MBP) have pathogenic potential in EAE and are immunogenic in MSpatients in the context of disease-associated HLA-DR2- and other DR alleles.In EAE, the definition of individual encephalitogenic peptides served as a basisfor establishing various specific immunotherapies. These included the induc-tion of antigen-specific apoptosis, anergy induction, T cell receptor (TCR) pep-tide vaccination, T cell vaccination, oral tolerization, and the induction ofbystander suppression via altered peptide ligands (APL), but also otherapproaches. A few of the above therapies are also in clinical testing in MS orhave already been explored in the past. So far, the evidence for efficacy and/orsafety of specific immunotherapies in MS is sparse. Oral tolerization was noteffective in a large phase III trial, an APL peptide based on MBP (83-99) raisedsafety concerns, to give only two examples. The current state and future per- spectives of specific immunomodulation in MS will be discussed.

One regulatory mechanism that may be useful for treatingautoimmune diseases involves an innate second set of Th2 cells specific forportions of the TCR of pathogenic Th1 cells. These Th2 cells recognize inter-nally processed V region peptides from the TCR expressed on the Th1 cell sur-face in association with MHC molecules. As assessed by ELISPOT, TCR-reac-tive T cells constitute nearly 8% of the T cell repertoire in healthy individuals,but are significantly reduced in MS patients, potentially allowing unregulatedclonal expansion of Th1 cells. We have used a variety of strategies to identifydisease-associated V genes present on pathogenic Th1 cells, including BV5S2,BV6S5 & BV13S1 in MS, BV3, BV17 in RA, and BV3 & BV13S1 inpsoriasis. TCR peptides corresponding to the mid region of these BV geneswere found to be consistently immunogenic in vivo when administered either i.d. in saline or i.m. in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In MS patients, injection of low doses of peptides (100-300 \u00b5g) significantly boosted the number of TCR-reactive Th2 cells, and the strength of response to TCR vaccination was correlated with clinical benefit. Once the regulatory Th2 cells were specificallyactivated, they non-specifically inhibited activation of other CD4+ T cells viamechanisms involving cell-cell contact (as for CD4+CD25+ Treg cells) andinhibitory including IL-10. These findings indicate the potential ofregulatory Th2 cells to inhibit not only the target Th1 cells, but also bystanderTh1 cells expressing different V genes specific for other autoantigens. TCRpeptide vaccines have been used in our studies to treat a total of >200 MSpatients (7 trials), 484 RA patients (7 trials), and 177 psoriasis patients (2 tri-als). Based on treatment of almost 900 patients with autoimmune diseases,TCR peptide vaccination is safe and well tolerated, and can produce significantclinical improvement in a subset of patients that respond to immunization. TCRpeptide vaccination represents a promising approach that is well-suited for treating complex autoimmune diseases.

In relapsing EAE, transient Tcell deletion, using CD4-specific mAb, delays the return of disease. Similarly,myelin Ag i.v. induces a readily reversible unresponsiveness. Objectives: To test whether the combination of transient T cell deletion and i.v. myelin Ag induces tolerance that prevents relapsing EAE. To test whetherleukocyte depletion with a mitoxantrone was used in actively induced mouse EAE. Ag-specific tolerance was induced bya single injection i.v. of myelin Ag either alone or attached to fixed cell-carriers. Results: In contrast to non-depleting agents, a combination of transient CD4 T cell deletion and i.v. myelin Ag, administered during the periodwhen primed T cells are regenerating, induce tolerance that is resistant tofurther disease induction and inhibits relapsing EAE. This was achieved bydepleting with either anti-CD4 mAb or mitoxantrone. Dependent on theimmunizing Ag, single peptides were effective or ineffective. Recombinantmyelin proteins were effective and require no knowledge of the pathogenic epitopes. Conclusions: Translation of this strategy into MS may go some way towards halting the immunological disease process and provide a platform for addi-tional neuroprotective and repair strategies. The observation that mitoxantrone,a drug already licensed for use in MS, can substitute for CD4+ T cell depletionhas the potential advantage of targeting pathogenic B cell responses, which inpart are responsible for some of the adverse reactions following myelin Agadministration.

T cells acutely activated with mitogen upregulate the K+ channelIKca, but not Kv1.3, whereas in chronically activated T cell lines (TCL) theMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S16 converse situation occurs with marked ShK is a high affinity peptide antagonist for Kv1.3 and has been shown to ameliorate EAE.Objectives: To determine whether myelin reactive TCL from MS patients dif- fered in their expression of Kv1.3 depending on their stage of differentiation, aswell as compared to TCL from healthy controls. Further, we wished to studythe functional effects of the peptide antagonist ShK on Kv1.3 hi TCL.Methods: Myelin reactive TCL were generated from 15 MS patients and 10 healthy controls. Antigen specific TCL were phenotyped by FACS using mon-oclonal antibodies for CD4,CD45RA,CD45RO, and CCR7. IKca and Kv1.3channel number was determined by patch clamp analysis and fluorescencemicroscopy. The functional effects of ShK were studied by tritiated thymidineproliferation assays and cytokine analysis.Results: (2-3 stimulations) myelin Kv1.3 was not upregulated until TCLhad been restimulated greater than 7 times. The expression of Kv1.3 correlatedstrongly with conversion from central memory T cells (Tcm=CD45RA- to effector memory T cells (Tem=CD45RA-/CCR7-). Myelin reac- tive T cells from MS patients expressed high channel numbers of Kv1.3 afteronly 3 stimulations and were phenotypically Tem. ShK selectively inhibitedproliferation of Tem, but not Tcm in keeping with the observed K channel pat-terns on these cells.Conclusions: We conclude that Kv1.3 is a functional marker of Tem, but is not expressed on acutely activated naive T cells. Our preliminary data suggest thatacutely stimulated myelin reactive T cells derived from MS patients have theTem/Kv1.3 phenotype, which is not present on The Kv1.3 peptide antagonist, ShK, may specifically targetTem and should be considered as a potential therapy in MS.

Session VIIMethodological Issues in Clinical Trials 50 THE NEW DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FORCLINICAL TRIALS Wolinsky JS University of Texas, Houston, Texas, USA Abstract Body: The International Panel on the Diagnosis of MS (IP) recom- mended revised diagnostic criteria for the disease (McDonald et al., Ann Neu-rol 50:121, 2001). The focus of the new guidelines remains on the objectivedemonstration of dissemination of lesions in both time and space. Advances inMRI mandated its integration with clinical and other sensitive paraclinicaldiagnostic methods. The revised criteria clearly facilitate the diagnosis of MSin patients with a variety of presentations, including the clinically isolated syn-dromes (CIS) or \"monosymptomatic\" disease suggestive of MS, and diseasewith a typical relapsing remitting course. Previously used terms such as \"clini-cally definite\" and \"probable MS\" are no longer recommended, with the out-come of a diagnostic evaluation designated as MS, \"possible MS\" (for those atrisk for MS, but for whom diagnostic evaluation remains equivocal), or \"notMS.\" Stringent guidelines for diagnosis of disease with insidious progression,without clear attacks or remissions were also formulated that require character-istic CSF abnormalities. The near term specificity and negative predictivevalue of the IP MRI criteria at first presentation of CIS are well supported byseveral studies (Tintore et al. MS 7:359, 2001), and the serial use of MRI toprovide earlier evidence of dissemination over time than can clinical events iswell-established in CIS subjects with two or more lesions on their presentingcerebral MRI (Beck et al., Ann Neurol 51:481, 2002). Nevertheless, severalissues are raised by the IP criteria that may impact clinical trial designs that usethem. The proportion of subjects with CIS and negative MRI may range to 37%(Brex et al. NEJM 346:158, 2002). While superb placebo data now exist formodeling sample size projections for relapsing MS with two or more clinical attacks and CIS with 2 cerebral MRI lesions, similar data are not available forsubjects meeting minimal IP criteria for relapsing MS, or for CIS with less than2 cerebral lesions. Nor is it clear whether the IP criteria for primary progressiveMS (PPMS) that exclude all CSF negative cases and some other subjects ful-filling the \"probable PPMS\" category of proposed certainty trees (Thompson etal., Ann Neurol 47:831, 2000), are suitable as clinical trial entry criteria.

Number and topography of lesions at baseline, alone or coupled withCSF analysis, provided evidence for DIS and new T2 lesions at follow up forDIT. Diagnosis of clinically definite MS (CDMS) based on Poser criteria wascompared to diagnosis of MS incorporating MRI (McDonald criteria). Accu-racy of new diagnostic criteria was evaluated. Results: At 12 months, 11% had CDMS according to Poser compared to 37% who had MS according to McDonald MRI definitions for DIS andDIT. Eighty percent of patients fulfilling these MRI definitions and fol-lowed for at least three years, converted to CDMS. The McDonald MRIcriteria (DIS and DIT) showed a sensitivity of 74%, specificity of 86%and accuracy of 80% in predicting conversion to CDMS after three years.Specificity for DIS decreased when adding CSF abnormalities to MRIdefinitions.Conclusions: McDonald criteria more than triple the diagnosis of MS at one year. Specially when CSF analysis is not considered, evidence of DIS and DITusing MRI accurately predicts conversion to CDMS, demonstrating the useful-ness of these criteria in anticipating MS diagnosis.

There remains less certainty that these orother agents influence mid- and long-term clinical (disability) and MRI (atro-phy) measures of disease progression. Multiple recent RCTs have exploitedshort-term markers of inflammation (relapses, MRI activity) to assess treat-ment benefit in trials lasting less than ttree years. Positive findings suggest bio-Multiple SclerosisOral Presentations S17 logical benefit but this remains unproven by confirmatory studies of adequate length and rigor. The desire to hasten the approval and subsequent availabilityof effective agents for patients must be balanced with the need to confirm thatshort-term measures of efficacy predict long-term benefit. Positive findingsfrom short-term trials provide treatment options but disrupt equipoise makingconfirmatory, controlled, long-term RCTs difficult to conduct and complete.The major challenges to short-term trials in chronic diseases include: 1.Methodological issues: accelerated enrollment, large sample size, limited eligi-bility spectrum (generalizability), 2. Biological issues: time limitations both forchange in major outcome measures in the control group and for therapeuticagents to influence measures of axonal degeneration and regeneration despitepotential to measure benefits on short-term markers of inflammation, 3. Safetymonitoring: limited time for important, rare or delayed toxicities to appear.Although prognostic markers in relapsing-remitting MS provide guidance forestimates of time to disability, studies to date have not shown that treatment-related reduction in these variables (including relapse frequency, severity, new and active MRI lesions) will change time to and degree of clinical disability (or MRI atrophy). Contemporary short-term trials have provided evidence of bio-logical benefit upon markers of inflammation in MS resulting in drug approval.These studies, however, have not been followed by definitive, confirmatory,trials to measure the presence or magnitude of clinically relevant effects on dis-ability.

Unfortunately, the relationship between MRIand clinical disease has been found to be weaker than expected and the roleof MRI as a surrogate marker in clinical trials more problematic than initiallythought. The most important criterion for a potential surrogate is that themarker must predict future clinical disease. Early in the course of disease, theextent of change on MRI does have value in predicting the course of diseaseover a period of several years. However as patients who are further into thedisease course are studied, the relationship between these conventional MRImeasures and disability as measured by EDSS is poor in a cross-sectionalanalysis and seems to fail in predicting future course. Thus, conventionalimaging falls far short of being a validated surrogate. Several techniqueshave been shown to be more sensitive for assessing the changes ascribed todestructive MS lesions including spectroscopy, MTR, T1 hypointensities,and atrophy. Although the correlations between some of these measures anddisability does improve as compared to measures of T2 lesion load andalthough the correlations between MRI measures and other measures of dis-ability such as the composite score are better than with EDSS, the correla-tions remain less robust than hoped and long term data which would allowassessment of the predictive value of the techniques is not available. Thus, MRI is not, at present, an appropriate surrogate for clinical disability. Despite the failures, evidence is accumulating which indicates that disability isrelated to irreversible damage to myelin and axonal loss. Imaging techniquesthat can accurately identify these processes early in the disease course shouldeventually prove capable of predicting future disability. Long term follow-upof patients initially assessed with a MRI evaluation using validated andreproducible techniques is, in the end, necessary to determine the value ofMRI as a surrogate in MS.

MRI has poten-tial in the follow-up of patients, yet there are no standards for MRI use inclinical practice. A consensus meeting was convened and consideredguidelines for a standard brain and spinal cord MRI protocol. Methods andMaterials: An international group of experienced MS neurologists andradiologists, along with representatives from the AAN, the ASNR, and theRSNA met in Vancouver, November 3-4, 2001. The working groups devel-oped detailed guidelines, and the meeting culminated by a joint clinical-MRI consensus session. Results: Results were: (i) when available, a brainMRI based on a standardized protocol should be acquired for diagnosisand initial evaluation of suspected MS; (ii) when presenting symptoms areat the level of the spinal cord, a spinal cord and brain MRI arerequired;(iii) when brain MRI provides equivocal results, spinal cordimaging may be justified;(iv)in the absence of clinical indications, routinefollow-up MRI scans are not recommended. Clinical indications for fol-low-up MRI include unexpected clinical worsening, reassessment of dis-ease burden for initiation of treatment, suspicion of secondary diagno-sis;(v)follow-up MRI by standardized protocol should be compared toprevious studies; (vi) contrast enhanced MRI recommended for diagnosis,but optional otherwise. The full protocol will be available on the Consor-tium web site (http: //www.mscare.org) Conclusion: Uniform imagingstandards and guidelines should improve the quality, yield and value ofMS follow-up. These recommendations are a part of a continuing qualityimprovement process based on interactions of the neurology and radiologycommunities. Disclosure: D Paty has nothing to disclose. Session VIII Genetics and Hormonal Influence 55 GENETIC ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN EUROPEANS (GAMES) Compston Aa, Sawcer Sa,b aNeurology, Institute of Neurology, Cambridge, United Kingdom;band the GAMES Consortium, New York, USA Abstract Body: The Genetic Analysis of Multiple sclerosis in EuropeanS (GAMES) set out to identify genetic factors conferring susceptibility to multi-ple sclerosis by screening the genome indirectly for linkage and associationusing markers for susceptibility genes evenly distributed at a density of c0.5 -10 centiMorgans. We argued that independent identification of the same chro-mosomal regions, using different genetic tactics, would increase confidence intheir candidature as susceptibility loci. GAMES has co-ordinated genetic stud-ies in 19 European populations. Results are available on a dedicated web-site (http: //www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/MSgenetics). Linkage analyses included in the GAMES project provide whole genome screening (using a sub-set of 400microsatellite markers) in 521 multiplex families from the United Kingdom,Italy, Sardinia, Scandinavia, Turkey and Australia. Associations have beenscreened by comparing 5893 cases and 5903 controls from the 19 populations(23 cohorts) using a standard set of 6000 microsatellite markers spaced to pro-vide a 0.5cM map of the genome typed in samples of pooled DNA. ProvisionalMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S18 analysis has identified linked and chromosomes 1p, 5q, 6p (MHC), 11p, 17q and 19q. Because cases were not typed individually,GAMES is concerned only with genes conferring disease susceptibility and notthose influencing disease progression or the clinical course.

To date there are nearly 20,000 patients in theCCSGSMS database. For many clinics, the patient population can be consid-ered \"population based\" because contemporaneous prevalence studies haveshown that the proportion of patients identified in the region is extremely high.These have allowed for a concentric approach to all studies. The ability to carryout population-based studies in large numbers of patients has been beneficialfor answering a number of questions relating to the genetic epidemiology ofMS. The frequency of familial occurrence gradually increases in clinics pro-portional to some degree to the background prevalence rate of patients and hasapproached 25% in several sites. More than 2700 families having more onecase of MS have been identified including three families with more than 11affected individuals in a single pedigree. More than 40 families have been iden-tified with four or more affected individuals. These families may hold specialvalue in looking for susceptible genes in MS and their similarities and differ-ences to sporadic cases will be outlined. In a single pedigree having more than15 cases who are affected, the mode of inheritance appears to be autosomaldominant and may differ both from other familial cases and from those withsporadic MS. The female predominance is generally lower in such complexfamilies, the contribution from the MHC may be larger (always transmittedfrom heterozygous parents), and the phenotype appears to be surprisinglybroad. Studies of phenotype in concordant monozygotic twins imply the exis-tence of genes influencing outcome as distinct from those determining suscep-tibility.

Linkage to the HLA-DR locus, and associationwith the DR2 2 subre-gion of the MHC on ch.6p21 has been consistently demonstrated. In a NorthAmerican MS dataset, intrafamilial concordance for early manifestations waspresent, but was not associated with HLA-DR2. A more detailed screen of 6p21, using 24 markers spanning approximately 20Mb, indicated that associa-tions to other markers could be attributed to close proximity to the DR locusand that no evidence for a second MS susceptibility locus distinct from theclass 2 region could be found. A dose effect of DR2 haplotypes on MS risk wasalso observed, indicating that individuals who inherit two copies of a DR2 hap-lotype are at greater MS risk than those who inherit a single copy only. Fur-thermore DR2 homozygotes were significantly less frequent in patients with abenign disease course, demonstrating a disease modifying role for HLA-DR2.A recently completed follow-up whole genome screen demonstrated that evi-dence of linkage to the 6p21 region was restricted to DR2+ families and that,by controlling for HLA influences, additional candidate loci emerged. Thesefindings shed new light on the complex molecular mechanisms that underlieHLA contributions to MS pathogenesis. Disclosure: S Hauser has nothing to disclose.

In vitro and in vivo data suggest thathigh levels of testosterone are immunomodulatory and therefore may be pro-tective in young males. On the other hand, the protective effect of late preg-nancy may be due to high levels of estrogens. Estriol is the predominant estro-gen of pregnancy. It is normally not detectable, but during pregnancy it is made by the fetal placental unit and gradually increases to reach its peak during late pregnancy. In pre-clinical studies, when estriol was administered to mice withEAE, disease was ameliorated and a favorable shift in the immune responsewas observed which recapitulated, at least in part, that which occurs duringpregnancy. Oral estriol was then given in a pilot trial of female multiple sclero-sis patients in an attempt to recapitulate the beneficial effect of pregnancy. Ascompared to pretreatment baseline, relapsing remitting patients treated withoral estriol (8mg/day) demonstrated significant decreases in delayed typehypersensitivity (DTH) responses to tetanus. In addition, interferon-g levels inperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were estriol gadolinium enhancing lesion numbers andvolumes on monthly cerebral MRIs were decreased as compared to pretreat-ment baseline. Further, when estriol treatment was stopped, enhancing lesionsincreased to pretreatment levels. When estriol treatment was re-instituted,enhancing lesions were again significantly decreased. Based on these results, alarger, placebo-controlled trial of oral estriol is warranted in women withrelapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. In summary, clinical observations ofalterations in disease activity which correlate with alterations in hormone lev-els should be viewed as invaluable clues to the identification of modulators ofdisease which can then be explored as novel therapies.

Koski CLa, Hila Sa, Popescue Ta, Hoffman Gb aNeurology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA;bAnatomy & Neurobiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Background: Our previous data indicate estrogen (E) improves neuron sur- vival in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergicMultiple SclerosisOral Presentations S19 encephalomyelitis. In striking contrast, progesterone (P) makes neurons more vulnerable to death during inflammation.Objectives: To investigate possible mechanisms for our in vivo data in an in vitro model of TNF -mediated neuronal cell death. Methods: PC12 cells were differentiated with NGF. Cell death was determined with a TUNEL assay and FACS analysis. Protein expression was detected bybinding of specific antibodies, FACS and Western blot. Results: TNF (0-150 ng/ml) induced death of up to 80% of PC12 cells in a dose dependent manner. Cell death was prevented by a 72 hr preincuba- tion of cells with physiologic levels of E (1 nM); in contrast, a similarpreincubation with P (100 nM) increased cell death by two fold over cells treated with TNF alone (50-100 ng/ml). 24 hr pre-treatment with E prior to TNF exposure was required to achieve maximum neuroprotection, wereas P was able to enhance cell death within 30 min. E preincubation for 72 hrs increased ER expression and BCL-xL expression greater than 2 and 3.6 fold respectively while reducing TNFR1 to 19% of control. P (72 hr) decreased ER expression to 29% of control, did not effect BCL-xL levels, but increased TNFR1 greater than 2 fold. A peptide inhibitor of c JUN N terminal kinase, JNK1, a pivotal kinase in a pathway implicated in neuronalapoptosis, abrogated the ability of a 30 min P pretreatment to enhance TNF induced injury of PC12 cells but did not effect death induced by TNF alone. Conclusions: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that during inflammation, E may regulate neuron survival viatranscriptional mechanisms while P increases neuronal cell death viaa dual mechanism: activation of JNK1 which augmented the TNF mediated death signal cascade and up-regulation ofTNFR1 expression.

Objectives: To evaluate abnormal gene expression in MS immune cells directly or indirectly related to environmental influences. Methods: Differential display was performed to screen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from identical twins who are discordant for MS.Genes found to be differentially expressed in the twins were then evaluated inlarger populations of MS patients and controls. Results: A gene with no significant homology with any known gene fam- ily was identified in the MS twin. Real-time RT-PCR studies showed it tobe expressed 5.25-fold higher in the MS population compared to thehealthy control group. Preliminary data also suggest that it is over-expressed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) PBMCs, and under-expressed inother autoimmune diseases and in healthy subjects post-vaccination. Studyof a panel of normal tissues revealed ubiquitous expression with levelsranging from low (breast) to moderate (lung, kidney, spleen) to high (pan-creas, liver, prostate). Northern blot analysis in healthy PBMCs revealedfive transcripts: approximately 4.9, 2.6, 1.8, 1.2, and 1.0 kb in size. 5' and3' RACE studies have revealed the 2.6 and 1.3 kb transcript sequences todate.Conclusions: This gene that is overexpressed in MS and RA requires further evaluation regarding its function and control of its expression.

These may be divided into two broad categories, namely dis-orders of mood and cognition. The commonest mood problem is major depres-sion which has a lifetime prevalence approaching 50%, 3-4 times the rate in thegeneral population. Depression is associated with a suicide rate well above thatin most other neurological disorders. Regional lesion laod on brain MRIaccounts for ~40% of the depression scoe variance, psychosocial factors mak- ing up the remainder. There are a paucity of treatment data relating to depres- sion in MS, but anecdotal evidence and open label trials suggest symptomsrespond well to the SSRI anti-depressants. Sexual dysfunction as a side effectmay prove troubling. Psychotherapy that focuses on coping mechanisms maybe equally effective. Bipolar Affective Disorder occurs twice as commonly inMS patients than the general population, a fact that cannot be attributed to useof steroids. Mania should be distinguished from euphoria, a state of physicalwell being that is found in a median of 25% of patients, usually those withadvance physical disability, extensive lesion load on MRI (most prominent infrontal regions), and significant cognitive difficulties. Pathological laughingand crying (PLC) occurs in 10% os MS patients and responds well and quicklyto low dose amitriptyline or an SSRI. Cognitive dysfunction affects 40% ofcommunity based MS patients. The deficits are primarily subcortical and arecharacterized by slowed information processing speed, memory dysfunction,attention deficits and problems with abstrat thinking. The clinical picture thusdiffers substantially from cortical dementing illnesses such as Alzheimer's dis-ease and the more subtle presentation means that the diagnosis may be missed.Cognitive abnormalities correlate with total and regional lesion load on brainMRI, whereas associations with disease duration, physical disability and dis-ease course are poor or absent. Cognitive decline over time is not invariable,shows considerable individual variation and is linked to a deteriorating brainlesion load. Unlike depression or PLC, cognitive dysfunction is harder to treat.Cognitive rehabilitation that is compensatory, utilizing residual cognitivestrengths can prove beneficial.

It is reported by about one-third of patients, and for many fatigue isthe most disabling symptom. Fatigue may be associated with motor distur-bances and/or mood disorders, which maked it very difficult to determinewhether the fatigue is an aspect of these features or a result per se of the dis-ease. Although peripheral mechanisms have some role in the pathogenesis offatigue, in MS there are clear inidications that the more important role is playedby \"central\" abnormalities. Neurophysiological studies have shown that faticuedoes not depend on involvement of the pyramidal tracts and implicate impair-ment of volitional drive of the descending motor pathways as a physiopatho-logical mechanism. Metavolic abnormalities of the frontal and vasalganglia revealed by positronemission tomography and correlations betweenfatigue magnetic imaging lesion burden support this hypothesis.Multiple SclerosisOral Presentations S20 Some recent studies also suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the sense of tiredness.

Enthusiasm for the ablative thalamotomy hadbeen modest at best because of the then poor prognosis of multiple sclerosis,surgical risks, and high recurrence rates. However, recent advances on severalfronts have rekindled interest and include treatments that may alter the naturalhistory of multiple sclerosis, improvement in surgical techniques, and thedevelopment of deep brain stimulation (DBS). A number of clinical studieshave been published attesting to the clinical efficacy of thalamic DBS. In ourown published clinical study of 15 patients there were statistically significantreductions in tremor. Resting tremor was virtually abolished. Postural tremor was reduced to nearly 0 on Clinical Tremor Rating Scales (zero equals no tremor, four means severe to the point where the patient is unable to performthe task). Action tremor such as bringing the finger to the tip of the nose wasreduced from an average value of 4 preoperative to 1 postoperatively. Tremorwith bringing a cup to the lip improved from an average of four preoperativelyto 0.8 postoperatively. Patients often developed tolerance requiring frequentadjustment of the simulator that nearly always resulted in regained improve-ment. Long-term follow-up is not available. Our clinical impressions suggestthat if patients can continue frequent simulator adjustments their tremors canremain improved. However, it is been our experience that as the disabilitiesassociated with the multiple sclerosis continue to increase, their ability to makethe frequent visits diminishes especially in view of the limited availability ofclinics to adjust the DBS stimulators. When assessing a patient's candidacy forDBS, it is very important to have a realistic set of expectations. Our goal is toimproved tremor in one arm so that the patient has greater independence.Unfortunately, clinical trials utilizing large inventories of assessments will notdetect significant improvements in the quality of life associated with tremorreduction in one arm. Our criteria for candidacy include tremor that is signifi-cantly disabling, reasonably intact speech and swallowing, good strength andsensation in the upper extremity, and no significant exacerbations in the previ-ous six months.

Their overall prognosis has been shown to be better than adultonset MS, but these results are still discussed.Objectives: The aim of this study, that is a part of the KIDMUS project (a European cooperative study on childhood onset MS), was firstly to describe thenatural history of MS with onset under 16 years of age and secondly to identifyprognostic factors of the evolution to a disability of 6 on the Kurtzke's DSS and to compare this evolution with adult-onset MS. Methods: We studied a cohort of MS patients with an onset under the age of 16, from the Lyon MS database. This database, created in 1976, contains infor-mations about all patients seen in our department since 1957. We collecteddemographic data (age at onset of the disease, sex), clinical data ( relapsing-remitting or progressive course at onset, initial symptoms, interval between thefirst two relapses, number of relapses during the first 2 and 5 years of the dis- ease, date at entry into irreversible DSS 4, 6 and 7). All data were validated in the medical file, especially the date and characteristics of the first clinical eventwhenever possible. Statistical analysis was done by Kaplan-Meier method andCox model for survival data.Results: One hundred and eleven patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eighty (72%) were female. Mean age at onset of MS was 13.5 years (range 5.5- 16 years). Mean disease duration was 18 years at the date of the latest news.Sixty four (57.7%) patients had a relapsing-remitting course, 42 (37.8%) a sec-ondary progressive one and 5 (4.5%) a primary progressive one with or withoutsuperimposed relapses. Conclusions: Analysis is still in progress. Final results will be available at the meeting in September 2002.

Johnson M, Ford H, Denton S Dept of Neurology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom Background: In most series, about 20% of patients started on disease modify- ing treatments for M.S. will, for various reasons,stop treatment. Patient disap-pointment and waste of scarce resources would be avoided if some of thesetreatment failures could be prevented. Objectives: To investigate whether practical measures in a clinical setting could be used to predict treatment discontinuation.Methods: All patients treated with interferon beta in the Leeds Multiple Scle- rosis Treatment Programme had a comprehensive pre-treatment assessment.This included a self-report disease-specific measure of quality of life, the LeedsMultiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Scale (LMSQoL) and the Guy's Neurologi-cal Disability Scale (GNDS). These measures were repeated at intervals ontreatment. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was assessed annu-ally. Patients eligible for treatment had clinically definite relapsing remitting(RR) or secondary progressive (SP) multiple sclerosis. Patients with RRMShad at least two disabling relapses in the previous two years and those withSPMS had active secondary progression with superimposed relapses or a 1point deterioration in the EDSS in the previous year. Those patients who dis- continued treatment were compared with those who stayed on treatment at two or more years.Results: At the end of two years, 20 out of 73 (27%) patients had stopped treat- ment. 3 had stopped because of pregnancy, 4 had stopped or reduced the dosebecause of side-effects and are now back up to full doses. Of 57 patients treatedfor RRMS, 11 (19%) stopped because of treatment failure, (relapses or pro-gression). Of 16 patients treated for secondary progressive disease, 7 (44%)stopped because of treatment failure. Patients in whom treatment failed were,as a group, no different on measures of quality of life or disability when theystarted treatment but they did not show any improvement. They did have gen-erally higher EDSS scores on starting treatment. Conclusions: Patients with relapsing remitting MS are more likely to stay on treatment with Interferon and less likely to be counted as treatment failuresthan secondary progressive patients. In relapsing remitting patients, a higherEDSS score does not confer a greater risk of treatment failure in the first twoyears.

Objectives: 1.To classify patients from the \"complete responders\" or \"non-responders\" based on gadolinium lesions at baseline and 1 year. 2. To determine the proportion of responders and nonre-sponders for the two treatment arms. 3. To correlate 8-year EDSS, MSFC, andBPF change with these categories. Methods: 172 patients followed for 2 years in the phase III IFN 1a trial were evaluated 8.1 years after randomization. EDSS was calculated in 163 pts; MSFC in 137; and BPF in 134. Complete responder was defined as a patientwith lesions at baseline but not at year 1; non-responder was defined as apatient with more enhancing lesions at year 1 compared to baseline. EDSS,MSFC, and BPF change over 8 yrs were compared in responders and non-responders. Results: 42% of IFN and 46% of plc patients were complete responders or non-responders. There were more complete responders in the IFN group (27% vs 21%); and more non-responders in the plc group (25% vs 15%). Over the 8-year study period, complete responders did better than non-responders in theIFN group - mean EDSS worsening 1.1 vs 3.0; mean MSFC worsening -0.78 vs-2.5; mean vs -3.2%. In contrast, completeresponder and non-responder groups did not differ in the plc arm - mean EDSSworsening 2.6 vs 2.2; mean MSFC change; 2. outcome more strongly in the IFN than the plc arm, suggesting thatgadolinium change is a marker of therapeutic response to IFN. The resultssupport use of gadolinium as a surrogate marker in MS trials, and provide sup-port for biological studies that classify IFN responders based on gadoliniumactivity.

Patients with recurrent NMO (R-NMO) generally do not respondadequately to treatment trials with glucocorticosteroids, cyclophosphamide,interferon beta, or azathioprine. Following treatment with mitoxantrone (MITO, Novantrone) we observed improvement in disability (EDSS from 6.0 to 4.0) inone patient with R-NMO. This prompted a pilot trial of MITO in R-NMO.Objectives: To determine the benefit of MITO therapy in patients with R- NMO.Methods: We are evaluating the effect of 2-year MITO therapy in 5 patients with R-NMO. Entry criteria included recurrent longitudinally extensive myelitis with or without optic neuritis and normal brain MRI. The treatmentprotocol consists of IV MITO infusions 12mg/m2 (maximum 20 mg)withmethylprednisolone 1,000 mg monthly for 3 months followed by every 3month up to 2 years (maximum dose 140mg/m2). Neurological assessment(EDSS) is performed every 3 months and during relapses. Brain and spinalcord MRIs are performed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Visualevoked potentials and ophthalmologic evaluations are performed at baselineand annually. Treatment failure is defined as: one severe relapse (completeparaplegia or blindness); 2 relapses with change in EDSS; four documentedrelapses but without change in EDSS during a 12 month interval, or step-wisedisability progression sustained for 6 months. Results: Five patients are already enrolled: 3F; 2M; age range to 19 years; EDSS 2.5 to 6. Previous treatments:repeated cycles and plasmapheresis. Number ofMITO infusions per patient: 3 to 4, follow-up 4-5 months. One patient, 4months after an initial substantial benefit became treatment failure. Theremaining patients are stable or improved by clinical and MRI parameters. Thetherapy was well tolerated by all patients.Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest a beneficial effect of MITO for R-NMO. Disclosure: B.

Session XLate Breaking News ABSTRACTS NOT AVAILABLE AT TIME OF PRINT ECTRIMS Lecture 68 QUO VADIS? AGENDA FOR EUROPEAN MS RESEARCH. Hommes OR European Charcot Foundation, Nijmegen, Netherlands Abstract Body: Scientific progress is strongly dependent on political aspects. It is reflected in societies' willingness to direct attention and funding to spe-cific fields of research. For health care, poliomyelitis and HIV are good exam-ples. In the European Union research developments in general are laggingbehind Japan and USA. Neurological and specifically MS research remain atlower organisational and political scales. Since 1990, when the first ConcertedAction on MS Research was funded by the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities, developments of European co-operation in MS Research havebeen slow. Reasons can be found in the fact that overall national activities andinterests prevail over the European dimensions. Two organisations, ECTRIMS and the European Charcot Foundation, are endeavours for MS Research on a European scale, each with different, but fully complementaryaspects. MS research expertise in Europe is high, and a number of excellentMS Research Centers have been developed. These developments could beenhanced by a strong organisation of MS Research on a European level. Pre-requisites, structure and funding of such an organisation are discussed, withemphasis on clinically and politically relevant goals, fund-raising and gover-nance. Such an organisation is required now as the European Parliament onMay 15, 2002 accepted the 6th cadre-programme (2003-2006) doted withMultiple SclerosisPosters S22 17.5 billion, of which 2.2 billion will go to life science research and health care. European MS Research should and could be a strong contender in thisfield. Disclosure: O Hommes has nothing to disclose.

Adam P, Sobek O, Taborsky L, Vesela B, Prucha M Neuroimmunology, Homolka Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic Background: Till now, the biological role of many CSF proteins is not known. In the group of 7849 patients with neurological disorders, concentrations ofCSF and serum proteins were measured using laser nephelometry.Objectives: Concentrations of CSF immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, III)were evaluated to find outifthere is some specific biological role of these proteins present in CSF.Methods: As method of measurement, immunonephelometry was used to find out the CSF and serum concentrations of these proteins. Measurements werefollowed by statistical analysis of data.Results: Majority of these proteins has specific biological meaning which enabled to define their subgroups as inflammatory, destructive and tumorousmarkers.Conclusions: Complete CSF proteinogram comprising evaluation of the func- tional state of CSF-blood barrier and evaluation of intrathecal synthesis ofimmunoglobulins followed by analysis of specific CSF protein markers, i.e.CSF Protein Status, enables to improve the quality of CSF investigation anddiagnostics of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases of CNS.

P2 INTERLEUKIN-10 / INTERLEUKIN-12 COEFFICIENT AS POTENTIAL INDICATOR OF POSITIVE RESPONSE TO INTERFERON TREATMENT Bartosik-Psujek H, Mitosek-Szewczyk K, Belniak E, Stelmasiak Z Neurology, Medical School, Lublin, Poland Background: Only part of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with inter- feron preparations, positively responded to applied treatment. Up to now, no parameters were found which could enable the determination before treatment if the patient would respond positively. Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) is (IL-10 it's main inhibitor. between IL-10 and IL-12 is of keyimportance in immunopathogenesis of MS and is also recognised to be verysubstantial in the mechanism of interferon beta operation.Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the dependence between IL-10 and IL-12 levels before treatment and the clinic condition during the 2years period of the use of interferon beta preparation. Methods: The study included 21 patients (14 women, 7 men, aged 26.9 \u00b18.5) with clinically convinced relapsing-remitting MS. All patients were in a remis- sion phase and during at least 8 weeks they weren't being received any steroidtherapy because of disease aggravation. The patients were given interferon beta-1a (30 \u00b5im once a week). Before the commence of the treatment with ELISA method, levels of IL-10 and IL-12 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid had been determined. After 24 months of treatment, groups of patients posi-tively and negatively reacted to the therapy, were distributed on the basis of clinical criteria. Results: clinical criteria. Results: 15 patients positively responded to treatment and 6 patients - negatively. Patients who didn't react, had higher level of IL-12 in serum (p<0.05) before treatment and coefficient IL-12 influid / IL-12 a serum significantly differed in both groups ( p<0.05 ).However we didn't observe significant differences in IL-10 level both inserum and cerebrospinal fluid. Measured IL-10 / IL-12 coefficient wasmarkedly lower in patients with negative response to treatment ( p<0.05 ).Conclusions: Definition of the dependence between levels of IL-10 and IL-12 in serum might be helpful in a distinction of patients with potentially positiveresponse to interferon treatment.

Leptin directly activates the production of Th1 and isrequired for inducing EAE.Objectives: To investigate whether leptin can be used as a marker of MS activ- ity and clinical outcome in patients under IFN therapy and correlates with peripheral blood mononuclear cell proinflammatory cytokine production. Methods: We studied 24 patients affected by RR-MS, who underwent IFN 1a therapy. Case report documentation, body mass index (BMI) and blood sam- ples were obtained at baseline and after 2, 6, 12 months of treatment. At the endof the follow-up period, patients were divided into two groups according to theoccurrence of clinical relapses. Serum leptin levels were measured by Eleven patients had no relapses and 13 patients had one or more relapses. Baseline leptin levels were found comparable between relapse-freepatients and relapsing ones. There was no main time effect in both groups ofpatients on BMI. Serum leptin level significantly decreased in relapse-freepatients at all time points since two months after starting therapy. There was nomain time effect in the group of relapsing patients on leptin concentration butserum leptin measured before the first clinical relapse occurring during the fol- low-up were significatly higher as compared with baseline values. A trend toward a decrease in IL12/IL10 ratio was observed in relapse-free patients anda significant decrease was evidenced after one year of treatment vs. baselinevalues. In relapsing patients a significant increase in IL12/IL10 ratio wasobserved after 6 months of therapy as compared with the control performedright before. At that time 6 out of 12 patients showed a relapse. Conclusions: 1. leptin can be a useful predictive marker of clinical outcome and response to therapy in RR-MS patients under IFN 1a treatment; 2. IL12/IL10 ratio correlates with disease activity, as previously suggested in MS patients, also under IFN 1a treatment. Disclosure: A Batocchi has nothing to disclose. P4 ANTI-NEUROFILAMENT ANTIBODIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE PROGRESSION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Ehling R, Reindl M, Schanda K, Wanschitz J, T Neurology, University of Innsbruck Background: Axonal pathology seems not only to be the major cause of per- manent disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), but may also be crucial for thedevelopment of the progression of the disease. Axonal damage and loss areMultiple SclerosisPosters S23 basic features in the pathogenesis of MS, but there are currently no established in-vivo markers for monitoring axonal pathology in MS patients. We sought toinvestigate the association between axonal pathology and serum antibodies tothe light (L) and the heavy (H) subunit of neurofilament (NF) in patients withrelapsing remitting (RR), primary and secondary progressive forms of MS.Objectives: . Serum samples of 149 MS patients were investigated for antibod- ies to NF and compared to patients with neurodegenerative diseases, patientswith Guillain-Barre syndrom (GBS), patients with other inflammatory neuro-logical diseases (IND), patients with other neurological diseases (OND; includ-ing back pain, headache and stroke) and to healthy controls.Methods: Recombinant NF-L and NF-H cDNAs were amplified from human brain cDNA by PCR. All cDNAs were cloned into pTrcHis2-TOPO-vector andoverexpressed in E. coli TOP 10 F. Proteins were purified using affinity andhydroxylapatite chromatography. Human NF-L and NF-H were prepared fromhuman white matter by the axonal floating technique and purified by hydroxy-lapatite chromatography from bis-tris SDS polyacrylamide gels. antibodies with an established sandwich ELISA.Results: Serum-autoantibodies to NF-L were found to be significantly increased in MS patients with a progressive disease course. In addition, serum-autoantibodies to NF-L were significantly increased in patients with GBS, INDand OND, whereas serum-autoantibodies to NF-H did not differ significantlyamong the investigated probands.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that elevated levels of antibodies to NF-L are associated with the disease course in MS and are valuable biological mark-ers for monitoring disease progression in MS, which may allow for the identifi-cation of at least a subgroup of MS patients. Though the diagnosis of SP-MS isyet still a retrospective one, anti NF-L antibodies might be used for prospectivemonitoring of disease progression in MS in the future.

P6 A FOUR-MONTH LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON THE RELATIONSHIPBETWEEN CLINICAL ACTIVITY AND SERA CONCENTRATION OF S100PROTEIN AND NEURON SPECIFIC ENOLASE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. Finamore la, Zivadinov Rb, and Experimental Medicine, University \"La Sapienza\", Rome, Italy;dEuropean Biomedical Foundation, Rome, Italy Background: The calcium binding S100 protein (S100p) constitutes the major component of the citosol in glial cells. Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) is a sol-uble cytoplasmatic protein localized mainly in neurons. Both these proteinshave been reported to increase in blood concentration in patients with MultipleSclerosis (MS) and other neurological disorders. T1 Black Holes (BH) andbrain atrophy on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are considered as radio-logical signs of axonal loss in MS.Objectives: To investigate the role of serum levels of S100p and NSE as bio- logical marker of tissue destruction in MS. Methods: Thirthy patients 1.4 \u00b10.6, MS duration 5.4 \u00b15.1) were included. Patients were clinically assessed and imaged for four consecutive months. Samples' sera were con- comitantly collected for the evaluationof S100p and NSE, by the means of anenzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Results: A mean monthly value of \u00b10.004 ngr/ml of S100p and of 8.9 \u00b10.9 ng/ml of NSE were found in the sera of these MS patients. Such values were both within the range already reported in healthy subjects. A mean monthly 2.3\u00b11.1 cm3 in T1BH lesion load and a mean monthly value of 0.769 \u00b10.766 for brain parenchymal fraction was found in the MRI of these MS patients. Conclusions: S100p and NSE do not increase in patients with MS even in the presence of radiological signs of axonal loss. Thus such proteins cannot be con-sidered a sensitive biological marker of tissue distruction for patients with MS. Disclosure: l Finamore has nothing to disclose. P7 WHOLE BRAIN N-ACETYLASPARTATE ASSESSMENT IN RELAPSING- REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS - EVIDENCE FOR aRadiology, New York University Scholl of Medicine, New York, New York, USA;bNeurology, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA Background: Evidence is mounting that axonal damage, followed by neu- ronal cell death by Wallerian degeneration is the cause of permanent neu-rological deficits in MS. This can be assessed non-invasively by protonPosters S24 Multiple Sclerosismagnetic resonance the acid derivative N-acetylaspartate (NAA), found almost exclusively in neu-rons and axons. Since MS pathology is diffuse, NAA assessment of theentire parenchyma is crucial to evaluate the full extent of the disease.Indeed, a new 1H-MRS method to quantify the whole-brain NAA(WBNAA) has recently shown that the latter can be more than 20% lowerin RR MS patients than in their healthy contemporaries and declines x10faster with age. Objectives: To quantify the rate of concentration decline of the neuronal marker NAA in the entire brain of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients inrelation to healthy, age-matched controls.Methods: WBNAA was quantified in 49 RR MS patients, using MRI and 1H- MRS. It was statistically analyzed using Spearman rank correlation coefficientsto test the within-group relationship between WBNAA and Expanded Disabil-ity Status Scale (EDSS) score and Mann Whitney analyses to test for differ-ences between the groups' EDSS scores versus WBNAA values of healthy sub-jects, disease duration and age.Results: The analyses indicated three subgroups of WBNAA dynamics: Ten patients were \"Stable,\" exhibiting an insignificant change of ~0% per year ofdisease duration (p=0.54); 27 showed a \"Moderate\" decline, -2.8%/yr(p<0.01); and 12 experienced \"Rapid,\" ~27.9%/yr (p<0.01) loss. The avreageEDSS in each of the subgroups, however, was the same - 2.0. No correlationwas found between WBNAA deficit, EDSS score, or age.Conclusions: MS metabolic progression is highly variable even in a cohort of patients of similar, mild, clinical impairment (average EDSS of 2). Conse-quently, ascertaining an individual's NAA concentration dynamics might: (a)provide an early forecast of disease course; (b) reflect disease severity, hence,influence treatment decisions; and (c) improve clinical trial efficiency byselecting candidates based on individual WBNAA dynamics in addition totheir clinical status.

Objectives: To stratify relapses or progression according to MRI measures, a new - quantified - view into the course of disease in individual patients. Methods: 183 pts planned for the study. 90 pts were already enrolled (27 males, 63 females, age 29+/-4.5yrs, Kurtzke EDSS 1.8+/-1), signed informed consentand were randomized either i.m. IFNB + AZA 50mg/d +prednisone 10mg every other day, or IFNB + AZA 50mg/d + placebo S, or IFNB+ placebo A + placebo S. MRI done every 8 weeks (T1, T2 and PD weightedimages, 1-2mm slices, automatic measurement of lesion load and atrophy)enables to follow the development of lesions and atrophy. The study is plannedfor 2 years and data on MRI used for multivariate analyses were routinely moni-tored every 2 months during 1st year of the follow up. Survival analysis: time-to-event data were primarily based on EDSS score and censored at the point of sus-tained change.Results: MRI parameters (volume of lesions) were found to be highly signifi- cantly correlated with changed EDSS status of each individual (p < 0.010) andon average level it clearly distinguished pts with repeated relapses or progres-sion (group R) from cases without relapses (group W). Volume of lesions increased by nearly 65% in the group R (12 months follow-up with statisticalsignificance of time-related trend: p < 0.01), while it remained within 100-111% of initial level in group W and reached statistically negligible trendchanges.Conclusions: Although MRI measures correlated positively with increasing EDSS score (with the best cut off at EDSS 2.5), the MRI parameters provide more detailed and intrinsically multivariate information related to time-related changes. Using pilot multivariate analysis, the MRI-based score was used aseffective covariate for survival analysis modelling time to the first relapse orprogression.

P9 PLASMA LEVELS OF BRAIN-SPECIFIC OXYSTEROL Insubria, Varese, Italy Background: 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OH-chol) is colocalized with the myelin-sheath membranes of oligodendrocytes. It is pro-duced from cholesterol by cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase, an enzyme synthe-sized in neurons throughout the brain. Plasma 24S-OH-chol is derivedalmost exclusively from the brain; it can thus be used as a marker of cho-lesterol turnover in the CNS. Any process that damages myelin would beexpected to lead to a transitory increase of 24S-OH-chol in plasma andCSF, with a long-term loss of neurons resulting instead in reduced enzy-matic formation of 24S-OH-chol. In MS one would thus expect elevatedlevels of 24S-OH-chol during periods of active inflammation, and reducedlevels, from an atrophied CNS, during the final, progressive stages of thedisease.Objectives: We assayed 24S-OH-chol in plasma and CSF from 118 MS patients and in plasma alone from 183 age-matched controls, with a view tocomparing levels in, first, patients and controls subgrouped by age, and, sec-ond, patients subgrouped according to the results of brain MRI.Methods: Blood and CSF were taken after an overnight fast. MRI scans were considered positive if judged by a neuroradiologist to be consistent with MS.Only scans performed within two months before or two months after samplingwere assessed with regard to gadolinium (Gd) enhancement. Results: In the oldest patient subgroups, plasma 24S-OH-chol levels were sig- nificantly lower than in age-matched controls. Spikes (levels more than 2 SDhigher than the mean in the age-matched control subgroup) were found exclu-sively in patients with positive brain MRI scans, and CSF levels in patientswith Gd-enhancing lesions were significantly higher than in patients withoutsuch lesions.Conclusions: Compared to levels in controls, plasma 24S-OH-chol is increased in younger patients with MS and decreased in older patients, per-haps corresponding to the occurrence of inflammatory relapses in the formerand of degenerative progression in the latter. Measurement of plasma 24S-OH-chol may thus represent a convenient method for evaluating differentphases of MS. Disclosure: T Masterman has nothing to disclose.

Matrix metallopro-teinase-9 (MMP-9) is an enzyme that degrades the extracellular matrix, and hasbeen involved as part of the inflammatory cascade of MS. The role of MMP-9in PP/TPMS has not been assessed.Objectives: 1. To determine pro and active MMP-9 levels in PP/TPMS patients, relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients, and healthy controls (HC). 2.To correlate the values of pro and active patients withclinical and radiological variables.Methods: Seventy-three PP/TPMS, 50 RRMS patients (non-treated and stable for at least 3 months), and 46 HC were included. MMP-9 determinations (proand active forms but not TIMP-complexed) were performed on serum samplesusing a the time of blood sampling for PP/TPMS cases. T2- and T1-weighted MR scans for the PP/TPMS group were obtained at the time of bloodsampling and one year later; increase in T1 and T2 lesion load and new orenlarging lesions at 12 months determined.Results: Mean MMP-9 MMP-9 EDSS scores or radiological parameters werefound in the PP/TPMS group, although a trend for a correlation (p=0.06;r=0.312) between baseline T1 lesion load and MMP-9 levels was MMP-9 activity is different in PP/TPMS and RRMS. MMP-9 seems to be unrelated to clinical or MR variables in PP/TPMS, except for apossible role in brain tissue loss. Disclosure: X Montalban has nothing to disclose. P11 DYNAMICS OF AXONAL PATHOLOGY IN MULTIPLE of Neurology, Queen Square, London, United Kingdom;bClinical Neurology, VU, Amsterdam, -, Netherlands Background: Neurofilaments (Nf) are principal components of the axoskele- ton released during axonal injury. Objectives: To identify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients with high cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Nf and relate them to disability and progressionin their disease.Methods: Twenty-eight MS patients were included into this 3-year follow-up study along with 9 control patients. CSF levels of the phosphorylated Nf (NfH-SMI35) and extensively phosphorylated Nf (NfH-SMI34) heavy chains were quantified at baseline and 3-year follow-up using ELISA technique. Patients were stratified into relapsing remitting 'RR' or progressive 'SP/PP' disease. Patients 1 point increase in the EDSS over 3-years were classified as clini- cally advancing. Levels of NfH phosphoforms, degree of phosphorylation (ratio) and changes between baseline and followup (delta) were related to phe- notype, EDSS, ambulation index (AI) and 9 hole peg test (9HPT). Results: 74% of patients with SP/PP disease experienced an increase in delta NfH-PP compared to 20% maintaining RR disease (p<0.05, Fishers exact patients (80.5 pg/mL) (131 pg/mL) higherNfH-SMI35 RRMS patients (below assay sensitivity,p<0.05). Median NfH-PP levels were significantly higher in clinically advanc-ing RR (123 pg/mL) versus stable RRMS patients found for NfH-SMI34. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that NfH-phosphoforms might predict the development of disability in RRMS, supporting the concept that earlyaxonal injury is a poor prognostic sign. During the progressive phase of the dis-ease an increase of NfH was observed, suggesting cumulative axonal damage.The correlation of NfH-SMI35 with all 3 clinical scales finally suggests thataxonal pathology in MS is a dynamic process.

The role of NO in the pathogenesis ofMS is complex and remains unclear.Objectives: To elucidate the relationship of serum NOx levels to disease activ- ity measured using Gd-enhanced MRI and disease progression.Methods: Twenty-five patients with early relapsing-remitting MS (RR- MS) were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Patients were on average fol-lowed up for 12 months and underwent a series of clinical (EDSS) andmagnetic resonance (MRI) assessments. Serum samples were obtained ateach visit for measurement of total serum NOx using a vanadium-basedassay.Results: Mean serum NOx was raised in patients who had enhancing MRI lesions compared to those without or with very low enhancement (<260mm3) during thestudy period as well as to healthy controls (45.7+/-11.5uM vs. 35.0+/-8.1uM and32.7+/-13.3uM; p=0.02, p=0.004; respectively). Similarly, patients who progressedon EDSS assessment during the study had higher serum NOx levels compared tostable patients (46.6+/-12.5uM vs. 35.3+/-10.0uM; p=0.02). There was no correla-tion between serum NOx levels and other MRI parameters of disease progression.Conclusions: Serum NOx levels appear to be increased in the early relapsing- remitting phase of MS and are associated with MRI apparent inflammatory dis-ease activity.

P13 IMMUNOLOGICAL MARKERS OF DISEASE ACTIVITY IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A ONE YEAR FOLLOW-UP STUDY INMRI MONITORED Innovation, Padova, PD, Italy;bDept. of Neurological and Phychiatric Sciences, University Neurology Clinic, aggression to myelin antigens is currently thought to be responsible for MS immuno-pathology and MS still today remains orphanof immunological markers of diagnostic/prognostic relevance. Objectives: We designed a clinical protocol for the study of circulating immune parameters in MS, in attempt to correlate possible ongoing immuno-logical changes with disease activity assessed by EDSS score and MRI burden.Methods: The protocol entails a one year follow-up of 20 newly diagnosed untreated MS patients, that, every 45 days, undergo clinical examination andPosters S26 Multiple Sclerosiscerebral MRI. At the same time points, of a broad-spectrum of lymphocyte KIRs,and CD1d+ APC.Results: To date 18 patients have been recruited and initial results show that each MS patient is characterised by an individual pattern of lymphocyte sub-sets, the general features of which are maintained throughout the follow-up.Nevertheless subgroups of patients are distinguishable on the basis of the per- centage of circulating lymphocytes (e.g., NK, T) or expres- sion of KIRs on NK and CD8+ T cells. In addition, preliminary evidence sug- gests an association between increased MRI lesion load, increasing EDSSscore and fluctuations in the frequency of NKT cells, CD4+CD25+ T cells,CXCR3+CCR5+CD4+ and CXCR3+CCR5+CD8+ T cells, and NK and CD8+T cells expressing one or more KIRs. Conclusions: Although the study is still in progress, results currently available show the occurrence in MS of a complex immunological interplay, which mayunderlie the observed MRI changes. This favours the possibility that well-defined immunophenotypic panels may be used in monitoring theimmunopathological events of MS. Disclosure: L Rinaldi has nothing to disclose.

P14 COGNITIVE FATIGUE DURING A TEST REQUIRING SUSTAINEDATTENTION Schwid SR, Weinstein A, Goodman AD, Scheid EA, Tyler CM, McDermott MP University of Rochester, New York , USA Background: Fatigue is common in MS, but difficulty quantifying fatigue severity has impeded studies of its characteristics, mechanisms, and therapeu-tics. Motor fatigue can be objectively measured as the decline in strengthoccurring during sustained contractions. Analogous declines in cognitive per-formance occur during tasks requiring sustained attention. Objectives: To objectively measure cognitive fatigue as a decline in perform- ance during administration of the PASAT (3-second version), which requiressustained attention for 3 minutes.Methods: Patients with clinically stable MS (n=20) and healthy controls (n=21) matched for age, gender, and education completed the PASAT at 2identical test sessions separated by 4-10 days, within a month after 2 prac-tice sessions. A cognitive fatigue index (CFI) was calculated from thenumber of correct responses in each block of 10 PASAT items. Reliability of the CFI was determined from the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and validity was evaluated from correlations with self-reportedfatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS], Modified Fatigue Impact Scale[MFIS], Rochester Fatigue Diary), cognition (PASAT total score,MMSE), and overall neurological impairment (EDSS, MS FunctionalComposite).Results: MS patients had a mean of 9.3 items correct on the first 10 items of the PASAT and 8.5 on the last 10 items (CFI of 12%, p=0.01 rejecting thehypothesis CFI=0). Mean CFIs patients were similar at both sessions,but within-patient reproducibility was relatively the FSS (r=0.58, P=0.008), but not with other measures of self-reported fatigue, including the cognitive subscale of the MFIS. (r=-0.47, p=0.04) in MS patients but not in controls. Cognitive fatiguescores were not associated with overall neurological impairment, and therewere no significant differences between patients with relapsing and progressiveMS. Control patients did not demonstrate significant declines in performance.Conclusions: MS patients, but not controls, have measurable cognitive fatigue during administration of the PASAT. Comparison with measures of self-reported fatigue, cognition, and impairment further establish the constructvalidity of this entity. Disclosure: S Schwid has nothing to disclose.

Objectives: To determine the relative sensitivity of T25FW and other meas- ures of LE function for progression of disability in patients with MS.Methods: Thirty patients with MS, worsening LE symptoms in the past year, and measurable LE weakness were tested on five consecutive daysduring a period of clinical stability to establish baseline variability, andafter 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months to determine change over time. Relativesensitivity for progression was determined by t-tests (or Wilcoxon signed rank tests for ordinal measures) of the mean changes from baseline for measures of ambulation (T25FW, maximum distance walked [Dmax, up to500m], velocity on 500m walk [V500], AI), strength (manual motor testingin 18 muscles [MMT]), and coordination (foot taps in 5 seconds [FT],timed balance test [TBT]. Composite measures (EDSS, MSFC, ScrippsNeurological Rating Scale [SNRS]) were assessed. The 95% confi-dence interval for the within-patient variability on each outcome measureduring the baseline period was used to determine the number of patientsworsening.Results: Participants had mean age 51.9 (sd=8.6) (n=11), primary (n=2) or secondary progressive (n=17) courses,mean MS duration 13.8 (10.6) years, and baseline EDSS 2.5-6.5.They were taking a variety of course-modifying and symptomatictherapies, and 70% were women. Mean T25FW scores were signifi-cantly worse than baseline at the 9-month visit (p = 0.01) and there-after, with 8-12 patients demonstrating worsening beyond their base-line variability at each visit. None of the other measuresdemonstrated worsening as early, although V500 and AI were moresensitive to worsening (p = 0.002 and 0.009) and had a higher num-ber of worsened patients (n = 14 and 9) by 24 months. Of the 19patients who had worsened T25FW at least once, 4 (21%) were worsethan baseline at only one visit. Eight (42%) remained worse thanbaseline at all subsequent visits.Conclusions: Change from baseline evolves more rapidly for T25FW than for other measures of LE impairment, but it may not be the most responsive tochange at later time points.

Cell Biology, VU Medical Centre Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Oxidation of into 24S-hydroxy-cholesterol likely is an important route for choles-terol transportation out of the brain, and this oxysterol is almost specificallyformed in the brain. A recent report showed a decrease of CYP46 in neu-ronal cell bodies, axonal structures and oligodendrocytes in the cortex ofpatients with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls. In astrocytes, incontrast, increased presence of CYP46 was observed. Since in MS axonalloss, demyelinization as well as astrogliosis occur, it may be expected thatthe presence of CYP46 in neuronal axons or oligodendrocytes may bedecreased and the presence of astroglia may be increased in thisdisease.Multiple SclerosisPosters S27 Objectives: The objective of our experiments was to investigate if CYP46 could be a suitable marker for neurodegeneration in MS. Methods: The expression of CYP46 will be studied in MS lesions. Experimen- tal autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) stands as an animal model for MSand we will use this model to investigate if the axonal presence of CYP46 isaltered in EAE. Both acute monophasic as well as chronic EAE will be studiedfor CYP46 expression in the brain and spinal cord. The aim of the presentexperiment was to study the immunocytochemical CYP46 staining in controlbrain tissue sections of humans, rats and mice.Results: The results showed the presence of the CYP46 staining in large neu- rones in the human grey matter. CYP46 staining was also present in endothelialcells, oligodendrocytes and microglia. In mice and rat brain, CYP46 structures in the hippocampus, cortex, striatum andthalamus. Conclusions: The results obtained in control brain tissue of humans and rodents show that CYP46 staining is present in different neuronal subtypes known to be affected in MS lesions.

BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY SCALE Avasarala JR, Cross A, Trinkaus K Neurology, Washington U School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, USA Background: Screening for depression in patients with MS currently includes Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a 21 item self-report rating inventory thatmeasures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. However, BDImight not be the most appropriate instrument if simpler techniques can be usedto screen for depression. We compared the accuracy of a Yale single questionscreen (YSQ) response against BDI to screen for depression in MS patients.Objectives: To examine if depression in MS can be accurately recognized using YSQ as compared to BDI, a 21-item self-report rating scale for depres-sion.Methods: One-hundred twenty consecutive MS patients seen in our MS Clinic were screened for depression by asking patients the YSQ - \"Do you frequentlyfeel sad or depressed?\" followed by BDI administration. Depression wasdefined as a score of > 13 on the BDI. Results: Of the 120 patients studied, a total of 49/120 were clinically depressed as defined by a BDI cut-off of > 13; 71/120 were not. The sensitivity of YSQwas 32/49 = 65.3% with a 95% confidence interval (0.50, 0.78), specificity was62/71 = 87.3% (0.77, 0.94), positive predictive value was 32/41 = 78.0% (0.62,0.89) and negative predictive value was 62/79 78.5% (0.68, 0.87). Of the 49patients depressed responded 'no' to YSQ, yieldinga false-negative rate of 34.7 % (0.22, 0.50). Conclusions: Our results show that YSQ cannot replace BDI as an instrument for screening for depression in MS. YSQ could not identify 34.7% of patientswho were depressed by BDI criteria.

P18 MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS: TWO CASES Balc\u00b4yBP, \u00d6zer F Neurology, Haseki Hospital, Istanbul, Multiple sclerosis (MS) occurs with immune-mediated mecha- nisms and its pathogenesis is not known accurately. Coexistence with otherautoimmune diseases reported. Although the real prevalence of association is unknown, there are some case reports of MS associated with autoimmune thy-roid diseases.Objectives: We present the clinical data of two patients who fulfilled Hashimoto's thyroiditis diagnostic criteria.Methods: Among 106 consecutive patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of Poser for definite MS, two patients who had the diagnosis of Hashimoto'sthyroiditis by the determination of T3, TSH and antithyroidal antibodies werepresented.Results: We had two MS patients associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (1.89%). The patients were 35 and 38 years old women and had relapsingremitting (RR) MS of benign course and secondary progressive form respec-tively. None of them were under interferon treatment. In both of themHashimoto's thyroiditis diagnosis was previous to MS diagnosis. Clinical man-ifestation of hypothyroidism was mild in both of the patients. Conclusions: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is relatively common in MS patients, especially in women (4.3%). This high association was not related to the inter-feron in our series. Thyroid autoimmune diseases should be carefully deter-mined in patients suffering MS. Disclosure: B Balc\u00b4 y has nothing to disclose. P19 EFFECT OF INTERFERON-BETA-1B ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BARAK Y, ACHIRON A Psychogeriatrics, ABARBANEL Hospital, Bat-Yam, NA, Israel Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is recognised as a central nervous sys- tem disease also affecting cognition. The rate of cognitive dysfunction in MS isin the range of 45-65% and adversely affect the quality of life.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of 1 year of treatment with interferon-beta- 1b (IFN -1b) on cognitive functions in patients suffering from relapsing-remit-tingMethods: A battery of cognitive tests was used to assess verbal learning, delayed recall, visual learning and recall, complex attention, concentration andverbal fluency at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with IFN -1b. A groupof 23 relapsing-remitting MS patients matched for neurological disabilityserved as controls. Results: Eighteen of 23 patients treated with IFN -1b (74%) completed the study. In the IFN -1b-treated group, complex attention, concentration as well asvisual learning and recall improved significantly (p = 0.024, p = 0.006 and p =0.005, respectively), while no deterioration was observed in the other dimen-sions. In the control group, complex attention, verbal fluency, as well as visuallearning and recall deteriorated significantly (p = 0.02, p = 0.004 and p = 0.01,respectively), while no deterioration was observed in the other dimensions.Conclusions: Immunomodulating drugs that reduce the relapse rate and slow the disease progression also inhibit cognitive deterioration in patients with MS.

P20 COMPUTERIZED ISOMETRIC MUSCLE STRENGTH - Sch, Madison, Wisconsin, USA;bNeurol Svc, Wm S Middleton Memorial VA Med Ctr, Madison, Wisconsin, USA;cMS Clinical Research Ctr, Dept Neurology, University of Wisconsin Hospital & Clinics, Madison,Wisconsin, USA Background: Clinical changes occur within Expanded Disability Status Scale steps that may be crucial to patient function such as walking or transfers.Posters S28 Multiple SclerosisProspective longitudinal measurement of maximum voluntary isometric con- traction [MVIC] in 10 arm and 10 leg muscles, as well as 2 neck muscles hasbeen ongoing at the University of Wisconsin Hospital & Clinics and VA Med-ical Center MS Clinics [http: //www.neurology.wisc.edu/MPL/index.htm] in279 [227F/70M] MS patients. Objectives: To identify in arm and leg MVIC during exacerbation, [2] correlation of arm and leg MVIC cross-sectionally and longitudinally withEDSS and AI and [4] mean percent predicted arm and leg MVIC distinguishingthose patients with wheelchair requirement.Methods: CIMS measurement of participating MS patients occurred at each clinic visit. MVIC was transformed to muscle-specific percent predicted mus-cle strength according to equations developed by the National Isometric Mus-cle Strength (NIMS) Database Consortium for use of normal isometric strengthdata for weakness assessment [Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilita-tion. 77(12): 1251-5, 1996]. MS patients were studied cross-sectionally by age,gender(sex), site of disease onset, disease duration, EDSS, AI. MS patients were studied longitudinally by these parameters, as well as developement of exacerbation or progresssion,treatment and response to treatment. Results: MVIC decreases significantly in motor exacerbations involving arm and leg and, like recovery seen in poliomyelitis, seldom achieves recovery tonormal MVIC. Leg MVIC correlates better with EDSS and AI than arm MVIC.In MS patients who require wheelchairs arm MVIC decreases from 87.04 \u00b124.21 [SD] percent predicted to 73.45 while leg MVIC decreases from 57.74 predicted [p 0.00001]. Conclusions: Longitudinal changes in MVIC may be studied in MS as a func- tion of treatment with anti-inflamatory agents, agents, anti-spasticity agents, anti-tremor agents.

P21 MS FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITE. A TRANSVERSAL POPULATION BASED STUDY Casanova Ba, Coret Fb, Bernat Ab, Ea, Pascual Ab, Aa aNeurology, Hospital La Fe, develope outcome mesure for clinical tri- als is a sensitive scale to measure disability in MS, because it integratesthree dimensions; the arms function, the legs function and the cognitvefunctionObjectives: To explore the utility of the MSFC in the differents clinical forms of MS patients, and its relation with the disability (mild, moderate or severe)and the EDSSMethods: 217 clinically definitive MS patients have been studied, mean age 39.5 years old (17-67), mean evolution time 9.08 years (1-46) andmean 32.3% PPMS.The the same time as the EDSS, and then com-pared with the normalized population of the NMSS task force data base.Disability was grouped in mild if EDSS was <4.0; 130 cases, moderate ifEDSS was between 3.5 and 6.5; 71 cases, and severe if EDSS was >6.5; 16casesResults: Correlations between our series and the normalized series was 0.997 (Spermann rank corrleations). The correlation to the mean evolution time wasof -0.534 and to the EDSS was of -0.710 (Spermann rank), we found, also, acorrelation with the compounds of the MSFC and the rank tothe arms: th PASAT-3: -0.388. Also wefound a correlation between the Z-score of the MSFC and its compounds forthe three clinical evolutive forms of MS, except for the PASAT-3 in the PPMSpatients. Correlations were reached for the Z-score of the MSFC and its threecompounds in mild disability patients, while in moderate disability patients thePASAT-3 didnn't correlate with the EDSS, finally in the severe disability patients corrrelation only was reached to the Z-score from the armsConclusions: The MSFC is a reproducible and sensitive scale, in our study a correlation of 0.997 in relation to the population was reached by the NMSStask force, and as in the pivotal study from Cutten, a significant correlationbetween the EDSS and the mean evolution time for the three compounds andthe total Z-score of the MSFC was demonstrated Disclosure: B Casanova has nothing to disclose. P22 EFFECT OF TRAINING ON THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITE SCALE IN EARLY RELAPSING AND REMITTING MS. ALONGITUDINAL ONE Ca, Ab aNeurology, Hospital La Fe, Val\u00e8ncia, Valencian Country, Spain Background: The MSFC has been proposed as a more sensitive form to meas- ure the clinical state from MS patients, but the first exams may be biased bypractice, as has been demonstrated by Cohen who noted continous improve-ment in the MSFC in the first three examnsObjectives: To study the effect of training on the MSFC for one year in an early population of MS patients Methods: We have studid 30 consecutives MS patients with clinical definitive MS (22) or problable MS (8) according to the Poser criteria, mean age 26 yearsold, mean evolution time 18 months and 1.4 of EDSS to PMS and 1.8 of EDSSto CDMS, with no statistical differences between groups. The Z-score from theFCMS has been calculated at basal time and each sixs months, in two ways; onein relation to the Task Force Database to allow comparison between studies, andanother to longitudinal studies with the follow formula: ((Mean DS PASAT3) 3,according the guidelines published by the NMSS.The Z-scores values havebeen compared between the two differents populations of MS patients, at basal time and after one year of evolution. We have used the Wilcoxon test, t-test for independent variables analysis of means and the Spermann rank for correlationsResults: Correlations between our series and the normalized population was 0.892 (p<0.0001) at first examination, and 0.923 (p<0.000001) one year after (afterundergoing two previous exams). At the baseline a significant difference for Z-score was demonstrated between PMS and CDMS patients (p=0.01), with no cor-relation with the EDSS (Spermann rank -.188, p=0.3). In the follow up the Z-scoreimproved slightly from 0.004 to 0.11, with no differences between patients that hadsuffered from brouts or remained as PMS. The differences between the basal Z-score and the Z-score measure after one year wasn't statistically significant (p<0.7)Conclusions: The MSFC is a sensitive measure of the activity in MS patients, even in the beginning of the disease, but a training of almost two exams arenecessary to compensate for practice effects and improve the sensitivity Disclosure: B Casanova has nothing to disclose. P23 PROBABLE CUTANEOUS SARCOIDOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERFERON-BETA 1B TREATMENT Chevalier effects described after interferon-beta 1b injections are numerous and appear mostly near to the injection site.

P24 BENIGN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN SARDINIA: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY Cocco Lai Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, which affects predominantly individuals in their mostproductive period of life. MS course and its clinical outcome could beextremely heterogeneus ranging from death in few weeks from onset to diseasediscovered casually at autopsy. Benign MS is defined by the presence of mini-mal or no disability in the long term, but there is lack of agreement in quantita-tive terms. Objectives: To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of \"benign MS\" in MS Sardinian patients with long disease history.Methods: Among all (1402) clinically defined MS Sardinian patients followed at the Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Cagliari, we selected patients with a longduration of disease (20 years or longer). We considered as \"benign\" patientspresenting a disability measured by Kurtke EDSS scale <3 after 20 years ofdisease.Results: Among 1402 Sardinian MS patients 276 (19.7%) had a disease dura- tion longer than 20 years and 55 (3.9% of total patients and 19.9% of patientshaving >20 years of disease duration) of them presented disability <3, thus ful-filling definition of benign MS. Thirty three were female an 22 were male, themedian age was 47.2 years (DS +/-7), the age at onset was 22.4 years (DS+/- 6.6) the median duration of the disease was 24.8 (DS +/-4.5). There no statisti- cal difference between benign MS and the other MS patients for sex, age atonset and age at observation. Conclusions: Our results sustain the existence of \"benign MS\" in Sardinian patients having more than 20 years of disease duration. However the percent-age of benign patients is relatively small, thus suggesting than only in fewcases MS in long term does not cause a consistent disability. The availability ofdisease modifying treatments for MS and the increasing evidence of the utilityof early treatment sustains the need of a good definition of \"benign MS\" and ofearly predictive markers for its detection.

P25 ACUTE PARTIAL TRANSVERSE MYELOPATHY: A 7-YEAR PROSPECTIVE STUDY Cordonnier and radiological characteristics of myelopathy in multi- ple sclerosis (MS) are relatively well known. Nevertheless, it remains difficultfor the clinician to ascertain an evolution into MS after a first episode of acutepartial transverse myelitis (APTM).Furthermore, there is a need for predictivefactors of bad evolution in order to decide which patients should be treated by immunomodulatory drugs early in the course of the disease.Objectives: The aims of this study were to define predictive criteria of conver- sion into clinically definite MS after an APTM and to define predictive factorsof severe disability progression.Methods: Between 1994 and 2001, we prospectively included 55 APTM (28.85% men, 71.15% women, mean age of 35 years). Three patients were lostduring the follow-up. We evaluated clinical, spinal cord and brain MRI, cere-brospinal fluid (CSF) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) at admission. Meanduration of follow-up was 35 months (range 12-86). At endpoint we evaluateddiagnosis and among the MS subgroup, severity of the disease. Results: Among the 52 APTM who completed the study, 30 became definite MS (23.33% men, 76.67% women, mean age 33 years, mean follow-up 37months) and 22 remained of unknown aetiology (36.36% men, 63.64% women,mean age of 37.8 years, mean follow-up 31.5 months). All the MS patientsremained in the relapsing remitting form of MS.The discriminating factors forthe evolution in MS were: initial sensorial symptoms (p=0.009), cord (p=0.002), oligoclonalbands in CSF (p=0.003), but not VEP. In the clinically definite MS subgroup,we did not find any predictive factors of severe disability progression.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that clinical symptoms, CSF, spinal cord and brain MRI are highly predictive of an evolution of APTM into clinicallydefinite MS. These patients should be selected for an early treatment byimmunomodulatory drugs. Disclosure: C Cordonnier has nothing to disclose.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS de seze Ja, Lebrun Cb, Stojkovic Ta, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) associates optic neuritis and myelitis without other neurological signs. Many patients with NMO may bediagnosed as having multiple sclerosis (MS), optic neuritis and myelitis beingthe inaugural symptom in 20% and 5% of MS cases, respectively. However,there have been no previous studies comparing these two pathologies and it isstill unclear if NMO is a separate entity or a syndrome including MS, systemicor infectious diseases. Objectives: To compare NMO patients with MS patients revealing by optic neuritis or myelitis, in order to determine the place of NMO in the spectrum ofMS.Methods: We retrospectively studied 30 patients diagnosed with NMO. We compared these patients with 50 consecutive MS cases revealed by optic neuri-tis (n=26) or acute myelitis (n=24). Patients were diagnosed as MS only if asecond relapse occurred demonstrating time and space dissemination. We com-pared the groups in terms of clinical presentation, initial laboratory findings(MRI, visual evoked potentials and CSF) and clinical outcome (evaluated bythe expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the index of progression (IP) =EDSS/duration of the disease). Results: NMO patients were older and more frequently female than MS patients but the differences were not significant. CSF and MRI data weredifferent: oligoclonal bands were found in 23% of NMO cases and 88% ofMS (p<0.001), abnormal brain MRI data following Barkhof et al. criteriawere observed in 10% of NMO cases and 66% of MS cases (p<0.001).Clinical outcome was evaluated as more severe in the NMO group(p<0.001 for both EDSS and IP). If we include MRI data only two of theNMO patients met criteria for MS and one of the MS patients met the crite-ria for NMO.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that NMO and MS should be considered as two different entities.

Furthermore, SSwith neurological manifestations may mimic multiple sclerosis (MS) andespecially in the primary progressive forms of MS (PPMS). We previouslyobserved that SS could be misdiagnosed with PPMS in around 15% ofcases. A recent study underlined the interest of a new biological marker forSS, showing IgA or IgG autoantibodies (aAb) against alpha-fodrin inalmost 70% of patients with primary SS and in less than 5% of blood donors.Objectives: To investigate the interest of aAb against alpha-fodrin in order to discriminate SS and MS patients especially PPMS. Methods: We tested alpha-fodrin aAb, with an ELISA method, in 30 SS patients with neurological manifestations, 60 MS patients without SS (20patients with relapsing-remitting MS, 20 patients with PPMS and 20 patientswith secondary progressive MS) and 10 patients who responded both to PPMSand SS criteria.Results: IgA and/or IgG levels against alpha-fodrin were observed in 19 of the 30 SS patients (63%) with neurological disease, in 8 of the 60 MSpatients without SS (13.3%) unrelated with the clinical form of MS, and in6 of the 10 patients with PPMS and SS criteria (60%). The frequency ofanti-alpha-fodrin autoantibodies was statistically higher in this last groupcompared with MS patients without SS criteria both when we consideredall MS patients (p<0.01) and the 20 PPMS without the SS criteria(p<0.05).Conclusions: Our study confirmed that aAb against alpha-fodrin are reli- able markers for SS and may differentiate MS and SS, especially in the pro-gressive form of MS. These results are consistent with the fact that SS andPPMS are different diseases rather than PPMS could be associated with SS. Disclosure: J de seze has nothing to disclose. P29 QUANTITATIVE COMPUTERIZED TREMOR ASSESSMENT IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: TREMOR PREVALENCE, TYPE, LONGITUDINAL EVOLUTIONIN 321 PATIENTS Dogan S, Konopacki R, Brooks BR Neurology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA Background: Tremor is the most common movement disorder found in multi- ple sclerosis [MS] due to pathological changes in specific white matter tractsduring the illness. Detailed clinical, neurophysiological, and motor controlstudies of such patients are infrequent, limited, and have rarely followedpatients longitudinally.Objectives: Evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of quantitative computerized tremor testing in determining the prevalence, type, change overtime, and response to treatment of tremor in MS patients.Methods: We have determined the prevalence and tremor type in 321 patients in the UW- Hospital and Clinics/VA Medical Center MS Program. Eachpatient underwent a standard computerized tremor assessment. Bilateral upperextremities were tested for postural, intention, rest, action tremor by standardalgorithms employing uniaxial accelerometer input for computer analysis.Isometric tremor was measured with a force transducer providing computerinput of the amplitude in grams. Patients were assessed longitudinally over 1-12 years.Results: The 321 MS patients [253 F/68 M] with an average age of 48 years had clinically definite/laboratory confirmed MS [30 F/5M]. Tremor was detected in 93% patients. Multiple tremor type were seen 70%of the patients. Intention tremor was most common [73%] with 40 unilateraland 194 bilateral arm tremors. Action tremor was present in 80 patients with 32unilateral and 48 bilateral tremors. Postural tremor was present in 90 patients,while 13 patients had rest tremor and 10 patients had orthostatic tremor. Iso-metric tremor was present in the limbs of 67 patients. Tremor types were stable after the initial evaluation except for the appearance of new tremors with exac- erbations and the evolution of intention tremor into action tremor as the MSprogressed in 25 patients. Conclusions: Quantitative computerized tremor testing identifies cerebellar and other tremor type in MS patients with increased diagnostic sensitivity andspecificity. It is a reliable means to follow tremor evolution and response totreatment over the course of MS. Disclosure: S Dogan has nothing to disclose. Funding: Supported by In part by Great Lakes Veterans Integrated ServiceNetwork [VISN 12], Department of FLUID AND NEUROIMAGING FINDINGS OPTICOSPINAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE SPECTRUM OF INFLAMMATORYDEMYELINATING DISEASES Eraksoy M, Turan N, Kurtuncu Z, Deniz E, Ozcan H Neurology, Istanbul University, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey Background: The selective involvement of optic nerve(s) and spinal cord may be encountered in the spectrum of inflammatory demyelinating diseases. There hasbeen some debate on the classification and the naming of these group of diseases.Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the clinical, neu- roimaging, cerebrospinal fluid and other laboratory findings of 26 patients withinflammatory demyelinating disease presented with opticospinal involvement.Methods: The case records of patients seen in our department between June, 1987 and April 2002 and diagnosed as Devic's syndrome, Devic's MS classified patients who met the criteria set by O'Riordan at al.Thefindings of these patients were compared with the clinically definite multiple scle-rosis(CDMS) patients presented with uni- or bilateral optic neuropathy(ON/BON).Results: There were 21 women and 5 men with a mean age 26 (range 4-52) years.This study revealed that most of the patients in this group developed multi-phasic Devic's neuromyelitis optica(DNO), small group of patients had monopha- sic DNO, and the remaining patients had a transitional form between multiphasic DNO and opticospinal MS at the last follow-up. Mean interval between first andsecond relapses was shorter in multiphasic DNO than CDMS of prognosis of multiphasic DNO group was relativelypoor than the other two MS groups. However, a statistically significant differencewas not found between three groups in terms of reaching the Kurtzke's score of 6.0.Conclusions: This study revealed that the occurence of opticospinal involvement in inflammmatory demyelinating diseases seemed a result of different etiopatho-genetic factors. Some of the clinical and laboratory clues showed that there hasbeen a close relationship between inflammatory demyelinating diseases,vasculi-tis and DNO showing opticospinal presentation. The genetic and environmentalfactors which modify the acuteness and tempo of the process might explain thedifferences of the syndrome presented with opticospinal involvement.

P31 RECURRENT SYNCOPE AS THE PRESENTING SYMPTOM IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Fazio MC, Musolino R, Buccafusca M, Dattola V, Scalfari A, Girlanda P, Messina C Neurosciences, Psychiatry and Anaesthesiolgy, University of Messina, Messina, Italy Background: Syncopal episodes are relatively underestimated presenting symptom of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The cause and the pathophysiology ofthese episodes and their incidence in MS are unknown. In literature only twoisolated cases are reported (Sakakibara et al. 1997, Funakawa et al. 1998).Objectives: We describe two patients, who presented with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness. Case report: a male and a female, 51 and 31 years oldrespectively. The first patient had been presenting syncopal episodes for five yearsand the second one for twelve years before our observation. They both had notconsulted a neurologist and had received the diagnosis of \"sincopal episodes\". Dueto an increase of episodes, the patient were adressed to neurological evaluation.Methods: Neurological examination, brain and spinal cord MRI, visual and somatosensory evoked potential and cerebrospinal fluid examination were per-formed in both patients.Results: The neurological examination revealed in the male patient mild tendon hyperreflexia and a left Babinski sign; the female patient had tendon hyperreflexia,decreased deep sensation and mild ataxia. The brain and spinal cord MRI showedin both the presence of tipical lesions of a demyelinating disease. In both patientsone lesion in the paramedian tegmentum and another one in the high cervicalspinal cord (C1-C2) with enhanced gadolinium were found. Visual andsomatosensory evoked potential were also abnormal and cerebrospinal fluid exam-ination revealed oligoclonal bands. The patients were treated with high dose IV methylprednisolone and syncopal episodes did not recur after more than one year.Conclusions: We underline that syncopal episodes can be presenting symptom of MS. A possible relationship with localization of demyelinating lesions inbrainstem and high cervical spinal cord has been hypotized. Disclosure: M Fazio has nothing to disclose. P32 THE ITALIAN DEVIC'S STUDY GROUP (IDESG) - PART 1: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DEVIC'S NEUROMYELITIS not clear whether Devic's Neuromyelitis Optica (DNO) is a form of MS or a separate syndrome. Apart from one study (Wingerchuk et al.1999) data are not available on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of DNO.Objectives: Our study was undertaken to evaluate these aspects: in this study clinical findings at onset will be presentedMethods: several Italian neurologicsl departments involved in MS research were invited to collect patients with DNO, diagnosed on a clinical ground,according to these characteristics: clinical attack suggesting involvement ofoptic nerve/spinal cord, no other site of CNS involvement. Brain MRI wasrequired to be normal in initial stages of the disease (or with < 3 lesions). Caseswith intrathecal IgG synthesis and brain MRI lesions were considered asaffected by MS and were nor included. Fifteen neurological departments par-ticipated to the study.Results: 45 subjects were collected. The mean age was 40.2 years (+/- 15.1) with a peak at age 30-39 ys and a second peak at age > 59ys. Nine were males(20%). Symptoms suggesting spinal cord involvement were found in 17 sub-jects, suggesting optic nerve involvement in 26, both spinal cord and opticnerve in 2. EDSS at onset was 3.9 +/- 1.5 during the acute phase, the residualscore was 2.1 +/- 1.9. Concomitant diseases: fever or viral infections in 5 sub-jects, ANA positivity in 4, thyroid dysfunction in 3, HCV positivity in 3,epilepsy in 2, myasthenia gravis in 1.Conclusions: Our results show a strong preponderance of females affected (80%), a bimodal distribution of age at onset, with a first peak at age 30-39 ys.and a second peak at age > 59 ys., a frequent association withinfectious/autoimmune/thyroid dysfunction Disclosure: A Ghezzi has nothing to disclose. P33 THE ITALIAN DEVIC'S STUDY GROUP (IDESG) - PART 2: COURSE AND PROGNOSIS Devic's neuromyelitis optica (DNO) is a form of MS or a separate syndrome. Apart from a few studies, data are not available on the long term evolution of this disease. Objectives: Our study was undertaken to evaluate the course and prognosis of DNO.Methods: 45 patients affected by DNO were collected by 15 Italian neurological departments. Patients were included if presenting optic nerve/spinal cord involve-ment in a mono/multiphasic pattern (for details see the presentation: Part 1)Results: The duration of follow up was 8.8 +/- 7.0 years (range 1-26 ys). The number of attacks was 6.3 The of attacks/year was1.3 +/- 1.2 (range first 6 attacksPosters S32 Multiple Sclerosiswas 16-17 months for each interval. Kurtzke's EDSS during the acute phase was 3.9, 4.4, 4.9, 5.4, 6.3 in the first 6 attacks, the residual score was respec-tively: 2.1, 3.0, 3.9, 4.3, 4.6, 5.4. The % of reduction was respectively: 46%,32%, 20%, 20%, 18%, 14%. Data concerning 103 brain MRI scans and 91spinal cord MRI scans will be presented.Conclusions: The clinical course was variable but, in general, disability increased progressively with time, with a tendency to a poor recovery. Theprognostic value of different variables (age, gender, inter-attack interval, initialEDSS score) will be presented. Disclosure: A Ghezzi has nothing to disclose. P34 THERAPY RELATED ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA IN A PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TREATED WITH MITOXANTRONE Heesen Ca, Bruegmann Mb, Koch Ea, Gold SMa, Ja aNeurology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany;bHematology and Oncology, Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Background: In 2000, mitoxantrone (mitox) was approved for treatment of progressive relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis(MS) in the US. Therapy related leukemia (tAL) is a rare but serious adverseevent of mitoxantrone therapy described in about 1% of mitoxantrone treatedcancer patients. We report the case of a patient out of 59 treated at our centerwho developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) after 108 mg mitox-antrone.Objectives: To describe a case of therapy-related leukemia (tAL) under mitox- antrone treatment.Methods: Casereport. Results: A now 34-year old patient developed relapsing-remitting MS 16 years ago. After disability ratings worsened considerably in 1998 (EDSS 5.0 to 6.0),mitoxantrone therapy was initiated at a 12mg/m2 dose every third month. Med-ication was well tolerated. Mitoxantrone was administered 6 times until Novem-ber 2000. In April 2001, the patient presented with fever, fatigue and markedleukocytosis. Bone marrow biopsy and immunophenotyping led to the diagnosis of AML, French-American-British Group classification type (FAB) M4Eo. Cytogenetic analysis showed an inversion of chromosome 16. Chemotherapyand autologous stem cell support chemotherapy were performed. Up to now, norecurrence of leukemic cells could be detected. At her last presentation in April2002, she reported increased fatigue but EDSS was stable at 6.0, no deteriora-tion of hand function or cognitive dysfunction were seen.Conclusions: This is the third reported case of t-AL in MS patients treated with mitox. We conclude from these studies that MS patientsshould not only be educated about the risk of cardiomyopathy but alsoabout the risk of t-AML, which might be in the range between 0.05-1%.However, since only three cases have been described so far, the empiricalevidence does not allow for definite conclusions to be drawn. Cytogeneticstudies may help to clarify a causal relation to therapy and identify prog-nostic factors. Disclosure: S Gold has nothing to disclose. P35 RETROSPECTIVELY ANALIZING MONOSYMPTOMATIC DEMYELINATING DISEASES, ACCORDING TO NEW MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Guerrero A, Bueno V, Hern\u00e1ndez M, Mart\u00edn-Serradilla R\u00edo Carri\u00f3n, Palencia, Spain Background: There have been recently proposed revised criteria for the diag- nosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). According with these criteria, a monosympto-matic demyelinating disease can be diagnosed as MS, when it fulfills criteria of dissemination in time and space.Objectives: We retrospectively analyzed our patients with a isolated demyeli- nating disease, in order to apply in the usual clinical parameters, these new cri-teria. Methods: In January 2002 we analyzed 12 cases seen in our unit among April 1997 and January 2001 due to a clinically isolated demyelinating disease. Noneof them suffered a new clinical episode during the follow-up. Accordin to thenew recommended criteria we analyzed the RMN performed during clinicalevent, and a new one performed later in all the casesResults: Among our 12 cases, 3 clinically corresponded to spinal cord lesions, 5 to infratentorial ones, and 4 were optic neuritis. Only 2 of ourpatients presented space and time dissemination, so fullfilling MS new diag-nostic criteria. Five more presented dissemination only in space and one dis-semination in timeConclusions: The analysis of the patients seen in our unit due to monosympto- matic demyelinating disease, leads us, according to the new recommended cri-teria, to diagnose two new cases of MS, as well as to identify 6 more in whichdissemination either in space or in time will lead us to observe more carefullythe evolution of these patients Disclosure: A Guerrero has nothing to disclose. P36 A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PRESENTING WITH LARGE FOCAL TUMOR-LIKE LESIONS OF THE BRAIN. Jean Pa,b, Bertrand Aa,b, Laurent Sa, Jean Philippe Rb, Sylviane Cb, Patrick Cb, Andre Aa aNeurology, CHU Timone, de M\u00e9decine Background: The clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS) presenting with large brain focal tumor-like lesions at the onset of the disease remainsuncertain.Objectives: A follow-up study was performed to determine the clinical course in a group of patients presenting with large brain focal tumor-likelesions.Methods: The population consisted of 20 patients (13 women, 7 males; age: 27 (17-44)) presented with large (more than 2 cm) demyelinating lesions on brainMRI performed at the first clinical episode (T2 and T1 with and withoutgadolinium injection weighted sequences). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysiswas performed for each patient and brain biopsy in 9 cases. Exclusion of alter-native diagnoses was performed in all cases.Results: Clinical presentation was acute or subacute in 17 cases. Motor signs were present in 10 cases, cerebellar dysfunction in 7, sensitiveimpairment in 6, headaches in 5 patients and cognitive dysfunction in 4cases. At presentation, mean EDSS score was 4 (2-8). Initial brain MRI wasstrongly suggestive of MS in 15 cases (Barkhof criteria) and gadoliniumenhancement was present in 17 patients. CSF analysis showed oligoclonalbands in 16 patients. The follow-up period was 8 years (4-11ys) and meanEDSS score was 3.5 (1-10) at this time. During this follow-up period, 16 patients presented one or more exacerbations and time to the first recur- rence was 14 months (1-28). One patient died after a monophasic history(26 months).Conclusions: This study confirms that clinical course of MS presenting with large focal tumor-like lesions seems not to differ from classical relapsing-remitting course of the disease.

Jean Pa,b, Bertrand Aa,b, Jean Philippe Rb, Laurent Sa, Alban Da, Sylviane Cb, Patrick Cb, Andre Aa aNeurology, de M\u00e9decine Background: The risk of progression to multiple sclerosis (MS) after an episode of acute non compressive episode involving the spinal cord remainuncertain.Objectives: To determine the risk of progression to MS in a population of 50 patients presenting with clinically isolated lesions of the spinal cord,and to evaluate the clinical course of these patients in a long term follow-up study.Methods: The population consisted of 50 patients (30 women, 20 males; median age : 26 / 9,2 ys) presenting with a first clinically isolated acute syn- drome of the spinal cord suggestive of MS. At baseline, spinal cord and brainMRI (T2 and T1 with and without gadolinium injection weighted sequences),cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, evoked potentials (VEPs, BAEPs, SEPs)were performed. During the follow-up, brain MRI was performed in all cases.Results: Spinal cord MRI demonstrated cervical lesions in 78% of the cases. Initial brain MRI was strongly suggestive of MS in 25 cases (Barkhof criteria)and normal in 7 cases. 40% of the patients presented abnormalities on evokedpotentials (VEPs and/or BAEPs and/or SEPs) while CSF analysis showedoligoclonal follow-up period (7/3 ), 76% ofthe patients presented one or more exacerbations and time to the first recur-rence was 23/12 months. Among these patients, 90% had CSF OB and initialbrain MRI was strongly suggestive of MS 65%. During this follow-up period,brain MRI showed emergence of lesions in 5 of the 7 cases with normal initialexamination.Conclusions: This study confirm the predictive value of brain MRI and CSF OB for the diagnosis of MS in patients presenting with clinically isolated acutesyndrome of the spinal cord.

P38 CLINICAL PROFILE AND APPLICATION OF DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA IN PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Khan O, Caon C, Ching W, Sonenvirth E, Tselis A, Zvartau-Hind M Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA Background: PPMS represents 15% of all MS patients. New diagnostic crite- ria for PPMS were proposed by Thompson et al. We examined the usefulnessof these criteria in a clinical setting outside the context of clinical trials. Objectives: To apply the diagnostic criteria proposed by Thompson et al. and study the clinical profile of PPMS patients. Methods: PPMS patients followed at a large urban hospital MS Clinic were evaluated. Detailed history was obtained. Investigations including brain andcervical spine MRI, CSF, and evoked potentials (EP) were evaluated.Kurtzke's EDSS were recorded. Clinical course was analyzed retrospectively.Diagnostic criteria proposed by Thompson et al. were applied. At the time ofneurological assessment, no patient had received therapy with disease modify-ing potential. Our clinic has a large African-American (AA) MS patient popu-lation who were also analyzed as a subgroup. Results: 67 patients with PPMS were identified. 37 (55.2%) of 67 patients were women with a female to male ratio of 1.23 : 1.0. Mean age was 51.6 years, mean ageof onset was 40.4 years, and mean EDSS was 5.4. 44 (65.6%) of 67 fulfilled theThompson criteria for definite PPMS. However, with the addition of somatosen-sory (tibial) EP to the criteria, 53 (79%) of 67 fulfilled the criteria for definitePPMS. 62 of 67 patients had undergone lumbar puncture for CSF studies. In onecase, results could were not available. Review of CSF abnormalities i.e. presence ofOCB (greater than 2) and/or raised IgG index (n=46 or 75.4%) revealed no effect onthe clinical course compared to the CSF negative (n=15 or 24.6%) PPMS patients. Additional analyses of brain and cervical spine MRI abnormalities will also be pre-sented. 16 (23.8%) of 67 were AA. Details of this sub-cohort will also be presented.Conclusions: Diagnostic criteria for PPMS by Thompson et al. are applicable in a clinic setting. However, the addition of SSEP may increase the diagnosticyield for definite PPMS. Based on the current understanding of disease mecha-nisms in PPMS, it is not clear if CSF abnormalities should be a mandatoryrequirement for definite PPMS. PPMS appears to be more aggressive in AA.

P39 RELIABILITY OF EDSS AND FS-SCORE RATING CAN BE IMPROVED BY STANDARDISED TRAINING Lienert C, Lechner-Scott J, M\u00fcller U, Kappos L University Hospitals, Basel, Switzerland Background: The EDSS of Kurtzke is the most widely used outcome measure in clinical trials Objectives: to improve reliability of Kurtzke` EDSS and FS assessment in clinical trials by standardised trainingMethods: 721 neurologists and neurologists in training participating in four ongoing multicenter trials, underwent either EDSS-training sessions at 11 dif- detailed verbal instruc- tions of EDSS and FS rating and demonstration of video vignettes, or used atraining CD-rom for self-training and assessment(ECD, n=227).Level ofknowledge about EDSS FS scoring was assessed with a questionnaire,containing 25 questions.Participants were asked to fill in questionnaires beforeand after the ETS, ECD trained participants after training. A score of 2 wasallocated for the correct answer, a score of 1 for the second best, thus resultingin a maximum score of 50. A minimum score of 31 was required for passingthe test.Results: Post-training results were significantly better than pre-training results group. Mean-score pre-training: 33.98; 38.36; p<0.001, Wilcoxon-test. This overall result was con-firmed in the evaluation of each separate meeting, but in different magni-tude. Performance at post-training tests was not statistically different inETS and ECD.Conclusions: Standardised training improves level of knowledge for EDSS and FS scoring. Post-ECD results did not differ significantly from post ETS-results, indicating that self-training with CD-rom may be as effective as partic-ipation in training sessions, although the different environment at completionof the questionnaires must be taken into account.

ISOLATED SPINAL DEMYELINATING EVENTS WITH NORMAL BRAIN MRI: PROGRESSION TO MS, CLINICAL AND MRI FOLLOW UP Milo Ra,b, Katz Ta, Corat-Simon Jb Harofeh Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel Background: Most clinically definite MS patients show multiple hyperintense lesions on T2W MRI images in the white matter of the brain. However, up to10% of patients with spinal cord lesions may have no, or few, brain lesions.The number of MRI lesions at presentation is predictive of the development ofMS and the long-term outcome.Objectives: To characterize MS patients with initial spinal demyelinating events and normal brain MRI.Methods: Among 150 consecutive patients with definite or probable MS, 48 (32%) presented initially with demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord. ThesePosters S34 Multiple Sclerosiswere further divided according to brain MRI to those with positive scans com- patible with MS, and those with negative (normal) scans, which were followedup for clinical and MRI findings.Results: Sixteen patients (F-10, M-6) with an initial clinical spinal demyeli- nating episode and a corresponding MRI lesion but normal brain MRI weredetected. Their mean age was 31.8 (19-47), mean EDSS at presentation 2.9(1.5-6.5) and mean EDSS during first remission 1.1 (0-2.5). Location wascervical in 12, thoracic in 3 and conus cauda in 1. During the follow-upperiod of 7-130 (average 35.3) months, 12 (75%) converted to clinically def-inite MS, while 4 did not have further relapses. All patients showed therelapsing-remitting form of MS. Although most patients continued to havespinal relapses, the optic nerve, brainstem or cerebellum were involved in50%. In only 4 patients, a second brain MRI became positive within a year; inthe other 12 patients, additional 1-4 scans performed 3-84 months after thefirst one were still negative. Disease progression was usually slow, withEDSS = 1.5 (0-6.5) after 7-130 months. Oligoclonal bands in the CSF were detected in 1/15 (7%) only. Conclusions: A considerable number of patients with an initial spinal demyeli- nating event have normal brain MRI scans at presentation. Albeit high conver-sion rate to clinically definite MS, most of them show normal brain scansrepeatedly. This group of patients is characterized by a relapsing-remitting andrelatively benign course of the disease (despite repeated spinal relapses), andby the absence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF. We speculate that these char-acteristics may be associated with a relatively minor activity of the disease inthe brain. Disclosure: R Milo has nothing to disclose. P41 ASSESSMENT OF SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AND EVALUATION OF DISABILITY CONDITION IN PATIENTS REFERREDTO MS RESEARCH CLINICS FROM 1997-2001 (2412 CASES) Iran;bNourology, Beheshti University Background: Multiple Sclerosis is one of the most common neurologic disor- ders in young adult. It is noted because of making disability and disfunction inyouth.Epidemyologic studies show that there are differences inprevalence,manifestation and disability condition between various races andgeographical locations.Objectives: From four years ago, three clinics of MS established in Tehran (which has high prenalence of MS) in order to syudy on sign and symptomsand disabilities of patients which some of the results discussed.Methods: This is a prospectine cross-sectional study, which is carried out dur- ing 1997-2001. The patients with MS announced to these three MSclinics.After taking history and complete examination, computerized data ana-lyzed with statistical method EPI.6.Results: In this study 2412 patients were diagnosed as having MS as based on Poser criteria.Mean age were married.Family history was positive in 7.7% . Mean duration ofdisease was 5.7 years deficit(23%), diplopia(21%), ataxia(14%), bladder course of disease is relapsing-remission in 56% and progressive in 31%of cases. Mean EDSS - Kurtzkenumber- was 4.2.Conclusions: According to results obtained in this study, it seems that clinical manifestation and symptoms in Iranian patients with MS are similar to those indeveloped countries.More incidences of MS in high-educated persons are con-siderable. In spite of mean duration of disease (5.7 years) Kurtzte number inour patients is 4.2 which is exactly equal with the number in other countries.So, it does not seem to be significant difference in MS prognosis in Iran andother countries.

Methods: The patient had a family history of MS (father) and was treated for hypercholesterolemia. In March 1998, she presented with alexia during 30minutes. MRI showed multiple and disseminated periventricular hypersignalon T2 weighted images and a CSF oligoclonal profile was found. In April1999, a new MRI performed because of aphasia showed right frontal and leftparietal enhancing lesions. The neuropsychological examination found a pat-tern of frontal subcortical cognitive dysfunction. In April 2001 paresthesia,central vestibular syndrom and VI paralysis led to realize a new MRI. Thisexam showed new lesions located at subcortical fronto-parietal, right temporal,left frontal and central with contrast enhancement. Spinal cord MRI revealedenhancing lesions at cervical and thoracic levels. The vascular negative, except aminimal monoclonal and non significant values of ANA (1/160). Results: Conclusions: The interest of this case is given by the presence of typical Mac- Donald criterias for MS in an old patient with cognitive impairment, without any other immunological or inflammatory definite disorder.

P43 APHASIA IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BERGER E, CHOPARD G, VIDRY E, CHU Minjoz, Besancon, France Background: A large proportion of patients with MS are cognitively impaired memory deficits are the most frequently reported. MS can impair speech pro-duction but aphasia is considered to be uncommon.Objectives: To describe 4 patients with MS whose main cognitive complaints were aphasia that appeared at onset (1 case) or during (3 cases) the diseaseMethods: The clinical and imaging pictures of 4 patients with aphasia are described.Results: Case 1. A 28-year-old man presented with the acute onset of right arm decreased sensation, an inability with speaking ; he also reported problems incomprehending spoken language. Exam showed right Babinski sign. MRIdemonstrated several white matter lesions and CSF showed oligoclonal bands.Case 2. A 45-year-old man was diagnosed as having MS for 10 years. He expe-rienced several relapses ; he has been treated by Interferon for 5 years. In July2000, his main complaint was speaking difficulties ; he also had a right hemi-paresis. MRI showed several lesions and a new large frontal one. He did notrecover. Case 3. A 28-year-old man had a typical relapsing-remitting MS his-tory for 4 years. In one of his relapse he presented word-finding problems,speech abnormalities with normal comprehension. Case 4. A 40-year-old manhad 5 previous episodes of relapses. Five years after the disease onset, a relapsewas characterized by difficulties in reading and comprehending spoken lan-guage. Conclusions: Although memory impairments have been the most reported, theses cases stress the involvement of other cognitive domains.

However, little is known about which factorsinfluence their decisions.Objectives: To determine which factors influence patients' treatment choices. Methods: This was an observational cohort study of 104 adults with RRMS from 3 Canadian provinces. Consenting subjects completed self-administeredquestionnaires after patient education and prior to initiation of one of four MStherapies (Copaxone, Rebif, Betaseron, Avonex). Patients were asked to rankthe three most important factors that influenced their choice of therapy. Results: Sample characteristics: median time since diagnosis was 0.7 years, mean age was 39 years, and 82% were women. Physician recommendation wasthe most common factor influencing choice of therapy (71.2%) with no statisti-cal differences between the four drugs (p = 0.378). The two most frequentlyreported factors to influence choice of therapy, by treatment, were: (1) physi-cian recommendation (76.7%) and tolerability (75.0%) for pre-filled syringes (52%) forRebif = physician (80%) and tolerability(60%) for Betaseron (n = 5, 5%); and (4) injection frequency (85.7%) andphysician recommendation (57.1%) for Avonex (n = 14, 13%). When avail-able, the following devices were also rated Relapsedata, disability data, MRI data, type of injection, cost, availability of more thanone dose, and 'other' were infrequently identified.Conclusions: While the sample size of this study limits the precision of the reported frequencies, physician recommendation is fairly consistently the mostfrequently reported factor that influenced patients' choice of MS immune mod-ulating therapy. Tolerability, injection frequency, and the availability of auto-injectors and pre-filled syringes are, however, also important to patients.

P45 FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFICULTY INITIATING ANDMAINTAINING IMMUNE MODULATING THERAPY Stoian CA, Metz LM University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada Background: Adherence to immune modulating therapy is often challenging. Objectives: To identify factors associated with difficulty initiating and main- taining therapy over the first month of treatment. Methods: This was an observational cohort study of 104 people with RRMS. Consenting subjects completed self-administered questionnairesafter patient education and prior to initiation of therapy. Ease of therapyinitiation was defined as reporting \"somewhat\" to \"very easy\" to maintaintherapy, tolerance of full dose, and feeling normal or better over the firstmonth of treatment. Failure to meet these criteria defined difficulty of ther-apy initiation. Interferon (Avonex, Betaseron or Rebif), glatiramer acetate(Copaxone), age, disease duration, impaired vision, impaired fine motorskills, use of an injection device, anxiety level, number of significant con-cerns about therapy initiation, expectations, and commitment to therapywere examined as predictors of difficult therapy initiation using logisticregression. Results: Sample characteristics: median time since diagnosis was 0.7 years, mean age was 39 years, and 82% were women. Therapy initiation was diffi-cult for 38.5%. Impaired vision and having any significant concerns abouttherapy initiation were associated with difficulty initiating therapy. Patients with impaired vision (difficulty reading newsprint) were more likely to findtherapy initiation difficult than those without (OR=3.7, 95% CI: 1.2-10.9,p= 0.019). The odds ratios of reporting difficulty initiating therapy werehigher for people \"very concerned\" about any of 18 listed potential treat-ment concerns compared to those with no \"very concerned\" ratings andincreased with the increase in the number of \"very concerned\" ratings. Theodds ratio of experiencing difficulty was 7.6 (95% CI: 2.1-27.8, p=0.002)for those with 1 ratings and 18 (95% CI: 3.6-89.6,p<0.001) for those with 6 to18 ratings compared to those with no \"veryconcerned\" ratings.Conclusions: Patients with 'impaired vision' or 'significant concerns' may benefit from additional support during therapy initiation and earlytreatment.

Metz and her research team (C Stoian) coordinated data management, analy-sis and interpretation.Funding: Supported P46 MULTIPLESCLEROSIS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE Tremlett H, Oger J, Special Therapies Group M Medicine (Neurology), University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Background: The beta-interferons (IFNB) are long-term treatments for MS. Drug adherence is essential to maximize cost-effectiveness. Identification ofpatients that are likely to stop treatment and reasons for non-adherence mayhelp in the prescribing, patient-counseling and education process. Objectives: 1) To identify why MS patients stopped an IFNB 2) To ascertain if particular demographic factors (age, gender, disease duration, EDSS) were pre-dictors of non-adherence Methods: In December 2001 we reviewed the charts of MS patients who had started on one of the three IFNBs between July 1st 1995 and May 31st 2001.IFNB trial patients were excluded. Results: 590 patients were identified whom had been prescribed an IFNB 'first- line' and 585 charts were reviewed. Mean treatment length was 1.8 years (range 7days to 6.3 years). In all, 190 patients were non-adherent (ie had stopped treatmentfor at least one month). Of these, 60/190 (32%) were non-adherent by 6 months,and 103 (54%) by one year. The most frequently cited reason for drug cessationwas perceived lack of efficacy (63/190 33%) followed by injection abnormal liver (13; 7%). No reason was documented for 5 patients.Compared to the adherent group, the non-adherent group had a significantlyhigher median baseline EDSS (2.5 versus 3.5; Mann-Whitney p=0.001) andlonger disease duration (mean 12.1 versus 14.5 years; Fishers exact test p=0.001).There were no differences between the groups for age or gender (p>0.05). Of thenon-adherent patients, 19/190 (10%) were re-started on the same IFNB; 73 (38%) on a different IFNB and 29 (15%) on glatiramer acetate. Overall, 69/585 (12%) discontinued immunomodulatory drug therapy, averaging 6% of patientsper year.Conclusions: Lack of efficacy was the single most frequently cited reason for non-adherence, followed by injection site reactions. EDSS score and dis-ease duration were both significant factors for non-adherence to the IFNBsindicating that those more disabled at the start of treatment were more likelyto cease therapy. The low discontinuation rate found was attributed to thecompulsory education session and frequent follow-up with trained nurses forall patients.

There is little published experi-ence on long-term assessment of visual function for these patients.Objectives: To compare visual function in clinically definite MS (CDMS) patients 20 years after onset, who presented with ON or diplopiaMethods: We included patients from the UBC MS Clinic computerized data- base (MS-COSTAR) who met the following criteria (i) had CDMS, (ii) initialmanifestation was ON or diplopia, (iii) visual function was assessed (by neu-rologist) 20 or more years after onset. The groups were compared for course ofMS, age of onset, and sex ratio.Results: ON was a presenting symptom in 13.2% (479/3617) and diplopia in 6.5% (234/3617) cases with CDMS in the UBC MS Clinic (September 1980-May 2000). The mean age of onset, duration of observation, and sex ratio wassimilar in the ON (104 patients) and the diplopia (45 patients) groups with fol-low up for 20 or more years after onset. The proportion of patients with primaryprogressive course of MS (PPMS) was lower in the ON group (3/104 patients,2.8%) than the diplopia group (6/45, 13%, p=0.01). The precentage ofpatients that switched to secondary progressive (SP) MS during observationperiod was similar in both groups (61% in ON and 67% in diplopia group). Visual acuity remained 20/40 or better in majority of patients in both groups (69.2% in ON and 84.4% in diplopia group). Severe decrease of visual acuityto 20/200 was rare in both groups(13/104, 12.5% in ON group and 3/45, 6.7%in diplopia group). However, optic atrophy was more frequently noted in ONgroup (81/102, 79.4%) than in patients with diplopia onset (22/41, The frequency of internuclear opthalmoplegia (INO) after 20 yearsof disease was similar in both groups (28/97, 28.9% and 16/42, 38.1 %in diplopia group) Conclusions: CDMS patients who presented with ON have less frequently PPMS than those who presented with diplopia. 2/3 of both groups switched toSPMS during observation period. Majority of the patients in both groups havegood visual acuity after 20 years of disease. Only very small proportion ofpatients become legally blind after 20 years of disease.

Epidemiology P48 COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Balc\u00b4yBP, Yayla V, \u00d6zer F Neurology, Haseki Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey Background: The diagnosis of MS is relied upon the accumulation of infor- mation, Neurological examination and laboratory findings. Until date, Posercriteria were used most for MS classification, recommended in 1983. By 2001,after Recommended Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis: Guidelinesfrom the International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis publishedby McDonald et. al, these criteria are taken into consideration for diagnosticapproach.Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the status of the patients fol- lowed up in Haseki Educational and Research Center - Neurology Departmentas definite MS according to Poser criteria by McDonald criteria.Methods: Total 106 patients (62 women, 44 men) age ranged 19 - 67 (mean: 35) diagnosed as definite MS according to Poser criteria were reassessed by thenew criteria, taking disease duration into consideration.Results: By McDonald criteria 88 (83%) of 106 patients who previously diag- nosed as definite MS by Poser criteria (92 CDMS, 14 LSDMS) were diagnosedas MS. 81% of the patients diagnosed as MS by McDonald criteria wereCDMS and 2% wer LSDMS. The mean duration of the disease was 6.17 years for 106 patients with definite MS according to Poser and 7.06 years for 88patients diagnosed MS according to McDonald.Conclusions: Difficulties of diagnostic approach at the onset period of the dis- ease continue by McDonald criteria. By McDonald criteria the diagnosis getseasier with longer disease duration. Disclosure: B Balc\u00b4 y has nothing to disclose. P49 LOOKING FOR THE DEFINITION OF BENIGN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Coustans M, Le Page E, Le Duff F, Leray E, Sartori E, Edan G Neurology, CHU Pontchaillou, Rennes, France Background: Benign multiple sclerosis (BMS) has been variably defined in quantitative terms and no consensus had been reached to definite this entity.BMS commonly defined as EDSS <= 2 or 3 after 10 years (y) of disease dura-tion is questionable.Objectives: To determine the best definition of BMS taking eitheir EDSS <= 2 or 3 at 10, 20, 30 y of disease duration.Methods: In our EDMUS (European database for multiple sclerosis) database, among 1019 clinically definite relapsing remitting MS (RR MS), 695 patientshad a disease duration more than 10 y. We analysed evolution of BMS with twodefinitions : RR MS population with an EDSS <=2 and EDSS <=3 after 10 y ofdisease duration and we examinated these two groups of patients at 20 y and 30y disease duration.Results: Among the 695 RR MS patients followed more than 10 y, 280 were followed more than 20 y and 100 more than 30 y. Proportion of BMS definedas EDSS <=3 was respectively respectively 48%, 26% and 16%. Moreover among the 433 patients with a definition of BMS as EDSS <=3 after 10 y of disease duration, 217 had a disease duration more than 20 y, only 47% (102) of themwere still BMS. Among these 102 still BMS patients at 20 y, 49 had 30 y fol-low-up and only 51% (25) of them were still BMS. For BMS with an EDSS<=2 at 10 y (334), 184 had a disease duration more than 20 y, 73 (39.7%) werestill BMS. Among these 73 BMS patients, 41 had 30 y follow-up, only 16(39%) were still BMS. Conclusions: In the population of BMS defined as either EDSS <=2 or EDSS <=3 at 10 y, a majority of these patients had a worsening of their disabilitywhen they are followed at 20 and 30 y and so did not deserve the term obbenign MS. Benign MS is a questionable entity. Disclosure: M Coustans has nothing to disclose. P50 INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN AN HMO IN ARGENTINA Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina Background: There is a lack of incidence and prevalence studies in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in Latin-america.Objectives: To estimate the incidence and prevalence of MS in an HMO in Buenos Aires, Argentina. (Lat 34 38'S; long 58 28'W)Methods: Population : the population at risk was all members of a Hospital based HMO, who were affiliated at least since December 1992 or at leasttwelve months before the date of diagnosis of each case included up toDecember 2001. Each person was followed until voluntary desenrollment,death or finalization of the study (final dates), contributing time at risksince December 1992 or enrollment date (whichever occurred later) to thatfinal date. Case ascertainment : multiple methods for case finding were usedMultiple SclerosisPosters S37 to ensure complete ascertainment: a)patients included in data- bases, b)patients with the Classification for PrimaryCare) code in the HMO Computer-based Patient Record System,patients with ICD 9 codes 340-341 on admission to Hospital, and d)patientsreceiving MS specific drugs. Medical records of all patients found werereviwed and only cases with MS definite diagnosis(Poser) were included.For incident cases the date of diagnosis was considered. To be included,cases must have been affiliated to the HMO at least 12 months before diag-nosis. Statistical analysis : incidence density was calculated with 95% confi- dence intervals. Prevalence was estimated at December 2001, and thedenominator population was the number of active members at December31, 2001.Results: In the study period 120,442 patients were followed for a total of 446,842 persons-year, of whom 10 developed MS. The incidence densityrate(IR) was 2.24/100,000 (95%CI: 0.85-3.62/100,000). On December 2001,21 prevalent cases females) were identified, among 81,855 members. Prevalence: 25.6/100,000(95%CI: 17-38/100,000); 27.2 for females and 23.5 for males/100,000. Mean age at diagnosis of these patients was 35.6 years (20-56 years).Conclusions: Incidence rate estimated in this selected population was similar to countries with median risk for MS. Prevalence detected was higher thanreported in previous studies in our country. Disclosure: E Cristiano has nothing to disclose. P51 DEVIC'S NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA (NMO) AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS): CLINICAL FINDINGS IN AN Capital Federal, Argentina Background: Argentina is a country of medium risk for developing MS (prevalence: 18-25/100,000). In Latin-america there is a lack of epidemiologi-cal data regarding NMO.Objectives: To determine the proportion of NMO regarding a population of MS patients followed in our MS center and to describe some of its clinical andepidemiological features. Methods: We reviewed the clinical charts of 569 patients followed up at our MS clinic. Patients who developed definite MS (Poser) and NMO(Wingerchuk) between January 1996 and March 2002 were included. We compared initial symptoms, sex prevalence and age at onset between both groups. In the NMO group we also analyzed clinical evolution and para-clinical findings.Results: Of 134 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 124 (77 females) were definite MS (92.54%) and 10 (7 females) NMO (7.46%). The MS: NMOratio was 12.4 : 1. The mean age of onset was 29.6 for MS and 40.6 for NMO.30 (24.1%) MS patients presented spinal symptoms at the beginning of thedisease (18 males and 12 females), and 14 (11.3%) optic neuritis (2 males and12 females). In the NMO group, 3 (2 males) out of 10 patients presented spinalsymptoms and 7 (6 females) optic neuritis at onset. Clinical presentation inNMO was monophasic (less than 3 months between initial symptoms) in 3patients and polyphasic in 7. During the follow up period (0.4-6.2 years), 5 outof 10 NMO patients suffered one or more relapses (5 myelitis and 5 ON) withpartial recovery of spinal symptoms and minimal recovery of visual function.In the acute period, pleocytosis with increased neutrophil count in CSF, abs-cence of oligoclonal bands in all patients, extensive spinal cord lesions andnormal brain MRI, were the main paraclinical findings in NMO patients.Conclusions: In this stydy the proportion of NMO compared with MS patients was higher than expected according to published data. In NMO the age of onsetwas greater, ON was the most frequent onset symptom, polyphasic clinicalpresentation showed a clear female predominance and 50% of the patients suf-fered relapses during this follow up period. Further studies are needed to clar-ify the prevalence and relative incidence of NMO compared with MS in differ- ent areas and its clinical features. Disclosure: E Cristiano has nothing to disclose. P52 FIRST LACTRIMS' (LATIN AMERICAN COMMITTEE FOR TREATMENT AND RESEARCH IN MS) E-CENSUS: UNDERSTANDING THE PRESENT TODEVELOP THE FUTURE USA;dNeurology, Hospital Britanico, Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina Background: At present there are partial and incomplete data about incidence and prevalence of MS, degrees of medical care and distribution of profession-als and centers involved or interested in MS in the Latin American countries.Lack of economic resources, low population density and geographical isolationdo not allow retrieving the necessary information by conventional methods. Objectives: To communicate the development of an ongoing census as an effective tool in order to know the number and geographical distribution of pro-fessionals and centers involved in MS in Latin America, with the aim of per-forming systematic studies in the next future. Methods: We elaborated an electronic application form structured in HTML format, available on www.esclerosismultiple.org/censo, divided in 3 main areas: 1- Demographic information 2- Specific information on MS (number oftreated patients, complexity of the center, diagnostic resources, etc.) 3- Elec-tronic dispatch of the application form to other colleagues Confidential datawill be stored and processed in a host resident database Results: Preliminary results of this survey will allow, in the short term: 1.to design local and tailored epidemiologic strategies to know the prevalence ofMS 2.to establish a better communication among participants. 3.to promoteactive participation between professionals and centers in a network, in order tooptimize care, medical education and research in MS 4.to propose new projectsto the members 5.to publish a Directory of professionals and centers, at a com-munity level in different countries, in order to get better accessibility forpatients. The general results (number of professionals per city, country andregion, degrees of specialization, participation in clinical or basic studies, esti-mated number of patients seen by area, etc.) of the Census will be periodicallyinformed to the participants and to the Scientific Committee of LactrimsConclusions: This census will allow the gathering of fast and economic infor- mation regarding the availability of resources for MS Disclosure: E Cristiano has nothing to disclose. P53 OPTIC NEURITIS AS EARLY MANIFESTATION OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Eleonora Ka, Jarmila Sa aNeurology, Teaching Hospital and Medical Faculty, Kosice, Slovakia;bTeaching Hospital and Medical Facultx, Kosicr, Slovakia Background: Optic neuritis (ON) as early manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS) is prognostically favorable factor in following course of the disease.Objectives: To find out the occurrence of ON as onset of MS in our patients and in accordance with clinical course to determine the forms of the diseaseand the value of disability, expressed by Kurtzke EDSS. Methods: In retrospective analysis of 159 patients, with clinically defined or prob- able MS, who were admitted to our Department of Neurology from 1987 to 2000 -we followed the occurrence ogf ON in relation to clinical course. In each patientwe have investigated the age of occurence of the initial symptoms of MS, clinicalPosters S38 Multiple Sclerosisforms, duration and degree of disability.These findings were compared in two groups of patients - with initial ON and without ON ( non- ON) in onset of MS.Results: ON as an isolated initial symptom was in 29 cases ( 18,2 % ). Average age of patients in the time of occurence of ON was 27,9 years of age, what is in com-parison with non-ON group 2,8 years less. In ON -group there were 73 % ofpatients with RRMS and their EDSS was about 2 degrees better than in non -ONgroup, 27 % with SPMS and PPMS was not observed. Average duration of the dis-ease up to December 2000 is in in ON-group 9,4 years, in non-ON group 11,7 years.Conclusions: First retrospective analysis of ON as early manifestation of MS in East Slovakia. Our results do not exclude the upper opinion in background. Disclosure: K Eleonora has nothing to disclose. P54 MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PREVALENCE AND HLA CLASS II ALLELE DISTRIBUTION IN GYPSIES FROM MALAGA, SOUTHERN Ciudad de Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain Background: There are occasional reports about the low prevalence of multi- ple sclerosis (MS) among Gypsies. Few HLA studies have been carried out inthe MS gypsy population.Objectives: To study MS prevalence and HLA class II distribution among MS gypsies in Malaga.Methods: MS gypsy patients in our geographical area were actively searched with a yield of 12 cases. The HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1 were investigatedby PCR/SSO and PCR/SSP. HLA distribution of a healthy control gypsy groupfrom the same geographical area was taken from published data. Results: Estimated MS prevalence for gypsy population in Malaga is 52/100.000. DRB1*1404,DQB1*0503 was a frequent allele combinationin ourgypsy patients(25%). Just one positive association was detected MSgypsy patients and the allele DQB1*0602 (41,7% vs. 2,5%, corrected p= 0,0009)Conclusions: in Malaga population, MS preva- lence in gypsies is about the same as in caucasians (53/100.000 in 1991). Gyp-sies from Malaga have the same anthropological origin as other EuropeanGypsy groups. We have detected a positive association of HLA class II alleleDQB1*0602 with MS gypsy patients.

P55 COURSE, DISABILITY AND IMMUNOMODULATORY TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BASED ON A POPULATIONBASED REGISTRY Frederiksen J Neurological department, glostrup university hospital, Glostrup, Denmark Background: We underwent a population based epidemiologic study of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) from the County of Copenhagen withabout 610.000 inhabitants and two departments of neurology. Objectives: The aim was to create a clinical database for research purposes with demographic data, date of onset og MS, date and result of various para-clinical examinations, and informations about course and degree of disabilityog MS. The previous and actual immunomodulatory and immunosuppressivetreatment is registrated. Patients were consecutively refferred, either as in- oroutpatients, to Gentofte or Glostrup University Hospital during a three yearsperiod from March 1, 1999 to Feb. 28, 2002. Methods: Patients were identified based on the diagnose of MS, G 35.9 based on the ICD-10 code system. We also went through files of patients diagnosedwith opticus neuritis (H 46.9) to see if they fulfilled the Poser criteria of defi- nite MS. Results: At the time of the ECTRIMS congress we expect to have classified the patients according to course (relapsingremitting, primary progressive and secondary progressive, benign) of MS and to have registrated the disability onthe Kurtzke EDSS scale. We will calculate the frequency of patients withrelapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS, who are treated withbetainterferon or copaxone. Likewise, we will judge how many would havebeen eligible for such treatment but did not want to receive it, and the charac-teristics of theese patients. In addition, we will analyse how many patients whostopped the above mentioned treatment and the reason why.Conclusions: Based on the prevalence of MS in Denmark we expect to regis- trate about 700 patients. As the study population is population based from awell defined geographical area with free admittance to the local neurologicaldepartments and to immunomodulatory treatment, the results may be represen-tative for a population of patients with MS.

Izquierdo G, Navarro G, Garcia Moreno J, Dur\u00e1n Gamero Macarena, Sevilla, Spain Background: The prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is well known in south Europe, but the actual data for MS frequency depend on incidence andnot prevalence data. The incidence data are missing in our region.Objectives: We studied incidence and prevalence rate in a well-delimited area of our region.Methods: Patients were included as MS when fulfill the Poser et al. 1983, cri- teria. The incidence data were studied in a prospective study in a nine-yearperiod (from January the first 1993 to December 31th, 2001) in the province ofSeville (Spain) in a well-delimited rural area depending of our hospital. Thetotal population of the area was the 142,776 inhabitants in 16 villages.Results: Seventy patients were detected in the area, 62 of them were diagnosed in the follow-up period. The global prevalence of the area was 49.02 per 100,000.The annual incidence rate changes from 1.5 to 8.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. Themean annual incidence rate of the 9-year period was 5.2 per 100,000 inhabitants.Conclusions: The incidence and prevalence rates are not concordant. Missing cases of pre-study period explain these differences. The frequencies of MS inour region are higher than that has been previously reported. Disclosure: G Izquierdo has nothing to disclose. P57 THE PREVALENCE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL Lana-Peixoto MA, AL CIEM MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: The epidemiology of MS in South America is largely unknown. In a recently published study the prevalence of MS in Sao Paulo city was foundas 15.0/100 000 inhabitants. Objectives: To describe the prevalence of MS in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Methods: The city of Belo Horizonte is the capital of the state of Minas Gerais in Southeastern Brazil. The city covers an area of 330.9 Km2 at a mean altitudeof 858 m and is situated at a latitude of 19 55S and a longitude of 43 56E. Theclimate is subtropical. The estimate population in the prevalence day (July 1,2001) was 2258,857 inhabitants. Case ascertainment was done through most ofneurologists, most of the hospitals in the city area, two local societies ofpatients, the Brazilian Association of Multiple Sclerosis and the State HealthMultiple SclerosisPosters S39 Department. Only patients living in the city area and with the diagnosis of CDMS were included. Results: This search provided a list of 453 patients, 409 of whom qualified for inclusion. The MS prevalence was 18.1/100 000 population. There were 95men and 314 women; 243 were white, 63 mulatto and 11 black. The age atonset was below 20 years in 13.5%, between 20 and 39 in 65.5% and 40 yearsor above in 20.9% (median 36 years). The most frequent symptoms and signs atpresentation were motor (28.1%), sensory (27.7%), optic neuritis (20.6%) There were patients RRMS, 84 withSPMS and 39 with PPMS. The EDSS was 3.5 or below in 49.0%; 4.0 to 6.5 in36.6%; 7.0 and 7.5 in 6.5% and 8 or above in 7.9%. Conclusions: This study adds strength to previous investigations on the preva- lence of MS in Southeastern Brazil. Disclosure: M Lana-Peixoto has nothing to disclose.

P58 STUDIES ON MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: VG CIEM MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: The understanding of MS has had a striking progress in the last decade as a result of an increasing number of investigations dealing with dif-ferent basic and clinical features of the disease. Objectives: To analyze the growth of the scientific production on MS in dif- ferent parts of the world. Methods: The search was conducted through the MEDLINE from 1991 to 2000. All publications containing the key word Multiple Sclerosis as a majortopic were considered. The search was conducted for each country separately in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In the search strategy the term affiliation was used to indicate the country of origin ofthe institution the first author was affiliated to. Results: The MEDLINE contains 6816 citations of papers on MS published during the last decade. In 4919 papers the system provided information aboutthe country and institution the first author was affiliated to. The origin of thepapers are as follows: 2098 came from countries in the American continent,2511 from Europe, and 310 from Asia, Australia and New Zealand. There isno paper from African countries. There has been a regular growth in thenumber of papers from 1991 (495) to 2000 (1018). This trend is observed inall continents and most countries. As individual countries are concerned thelargest number of papers came from the USA (1735 in the decade; 96 in 1991and 259 in 2000). Canada (298), Brazil (28), Mexico (14), Cuba (10) andChile (5) followed the USA in the American continent. The most productivecountries in Europe have been Italy (561), UK (478), Germany (254) andFrance (228). They were followed by The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmarkand Spain. Russia (4), Portugal (3) and Luxemburg (1) were the least produc-tive countries. Most papers from Asia came from Japan (143) and Israel (87).Investigators from Australia published 49 papers and from New Zealand 10.Conclusions: Interest in the study of MS has markedly increased during the last decade. Other factors in addition to differences in prevalence may play a roleencouraging investigators in different parts of the world to conduct studies on MS.

Lana-Peixoto MA, Callegaro Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: There has been an increasing interest in the study of MS in Brazil.Its prevalence has been described in Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte,two of the largest cities in Southeastern Brazil which share common fea- tures regarding immigration, genetic background and economical devel-opment.Objectives: To describe the demographic, clinical and disability features in a sample of MS patients in Southeastern and Southern Brazil. Methods: Cases were randomly ascertained from Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo, Sorocaba, Florianopolis and Londrina. All patients had CDMS, and the disabil-ity was assessed according to the EDSS. Results: The study comprised 1035 cases, 156 of them were discarded. Analysis of the remaining 859 cases showed that 633 were women and 226 men; medianage at onset was 13.8%, Blacks2.4% and Orientals 1.3%. The mean duration of the disease was 10.9 years. MSpresentation was monosymptomatic in 87.8% of the cases with motor symptomsand signs in 31%, sensory in 26.1%, brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction in19.7% and neuritis in 13.5%. The clinical course was relapsing-remittingin 74%, secondary progressive in 14% and primary progressive in 12%. Themean frequency of relapses was 1.6 in the first year, 2.6 in the first three yearsand 3.6 in the first five years after onset. Cross-section analysis of disabilityshowed that 305 patients were full ambulatory, 388 had minimal to severeambulation disability,94 were bound to wheelchair, and 46 were bedridden.Conclusions: The present study fulfills the methodological requirements for reliability as it derives from an extensive database, a geographically definedpopulation and cases were selected at random.Further analysis of this databasewill provide more detailed information about the natural history of MS in Brazil.

P60 CLINICAL ASPECT, COURSE AND PROGNOSIS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSISIN SOUTH OF FRANCE: STUDY FROM 500 CONSECUTIVE MS PATIENTSUSING Soriani C, Bourg CHU Pasteur, Nice, Am, France Background: The course of multiple sclerosis (MS) was assessed in a group of 500 consecutive patients observed in our neurological department. The datawere collected using EDMUS between May 2000 and April 2002.Objectives: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and the evolution of our MS patients and to compare among them prognosis of 2 subgroups classified according to the number of relapses during the first year of evolution.Methods: According to Mc Donald criteria, 462 patients (92.4%) presented a defi- nite MS. Among them, 166 (36%, M/F ratio=1/2.4) had an active MS defined by aninterval from MS onset to second event <1 year (group A). 249 patients (54%, M/Fratio=1/3.1) had at least 2 relapses with an interval >1 year (group B) and 47 (10%)had primary progressive course. Student test was performed for statistical analysis.Results: The mean age at onset was 32.2+/-10.1 years (median 30.7 ; group A) and 30.2+/-9.6 years (median 29.5 ; group B) (p<0.05). Record of sequellaeafter the first relapse was not determinant between the 2 groups (28.3% groupA/26.5% group B). Time to progression in RR with sequellae and in secondaryprogressive (SP) forms was significantly shorter in group A (2.4+/-3.4 years)than in group B (8.3+/-6.2 years ; p<0.001); SP : group A (8.3+/-7.2 years),group B (12.6+/-6.9 years ; p=0.05). The most common symptom at onset waslower limbs involvement (motor or sensitive): 51.5% (group A)/47.8% B upper limbsinvolvement (motor or sensitive) : 34.1% (group A)/24.9% (group B ; p<0.05),and optic neuritis : 19.8% (groupA)/36.5% (group B ;p<0.05). After a 5 and 10years follow-up, more patients with active or progressive form had reachedEDSS 3 : group A =13.2% and 24.1%, group B = 8.8% and 2.8%, group C =29.8% and 51.1%. This difference was still observed for time to reached EDSS7 at 10 years: group A =24.7%, group B=4.4%, group C=10.6%. Conclusions: Our study confirm that patients presented an active MS had a dif- ferent clinical profile and a more severe prognosis than those who have a remit-tent course with a two-first relapses interval >1 year. lebrun has nothing to disclose.Posters S40 Multiple SclerosisP61 SEASON OF BIRTH IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Luetic GG Multiple Sclerosis, Sanatorio Britanico, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina Background: MS is a complex disease. It has been strongly suggested that influence of environmental factors early in life may play a key role in the latterdevelopment of the disease. There is a great variability in environment featuresbetween different seasons (sunlight hours, weather, viral agents, diet). Thereare few studies regarding the association between birth's season and MS, and the results are controversial. Objectives: To investigate season of birth in a Multiple Sclerosis population Methods: The study was performed in Santa Fe Province (Argentina). Our MS database of over 200 patients is very representative of our MS overall popula-tion. We designed a descriptive study. 123 definite MS patients were included.The control group was the siblings of these patients to rule out any bias. Sea-son's definition used was the standard for the south's latitudes. At enrollment,birth date and MS clinical course (relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive,primary-progressive) were assessed. For the evaluation of statistical signifi- cance we used chi-square test ( 2). Results: Of the 123 MS patients studied, we found that 20.3% were born in autumn; 48% in winter; ( 2=31,4; p=0,0000007). The number of winter births was significantly higher in the MS population than in control group ( 2=29,4; p 0). Conclusions: MS patients in Santa Fe Province, showed a greater tendency to be born in winter as compared with other seasons and with their own siblingsused as control group. 48% of our MS patients were born in winter(p=0,0000007). They were exposed to certain environmental conditions typicalof this season (viral agents, less sunlight hours, adverse weather conditions) ina moment of their life, when their immune system (IS) was still immature. In adisease process like MS, where IS (especially T cells) plays such an importantrole, this finding could be of great implication. Disclosure: G Luetic has nothing to disclose. P62 BIRTH WEIGHT IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Luetic GG Multiple Sclerosis, Sanatorio Britanico, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina Background: Early in life, in predisposed individuals, environmental factors seems to play an important role in the ethiopathogenesis of MS. Myelin is thetarget of the immune mediated damage in MS and as we know myelination isan essentially post-birth process. There are many diseases linked with birthweight variations. Objectives: To study birth weight (BW) in a Multiple Sclerosis population. Methods: This study took place in Santa Fe Province (Argentina). Our local database is very representative of our MS population. We designed adescriptive study to compare birth weight of definite MS patients with thatof the general population (GP). Data from those patients with diabetic moth-ers was excluded. We considered: sex, clinical course of MS, season ofbirth, number of siblings and birth weight. 86 patients were included in thisstudy. For statistical analysis we used t-Student, ANOVA or Kruskall Wal-lis test.Results: Of the 86 patients studied we found that MS male (n=34) had signifi- cantly higher birth weights than MS women grs and 3361 \u00b192 grs respectively (P=0.03 t-Student's test). When we compared BW of MS patients with those of the GP, we found that MS male patients showed signifi- cantly higher BW. This difference was evident from 30 percentile of the BW curve and was greater between 50 and 90 percentile of weight curve (P<0.0003 t-Student's test). Differences of 500 grs in favour of MS patients were noted (p<0.0003). We couldn't reproduce this finding when comparingbirth weight in women groups. Conclusions: Birth weight in MS male patients was significantly higher than in general population in our area. Myelinogenesis is an active andessentially post-birth process that depends on both intrinsic properties of the cells (oligodendrocytes) and extracellular signals. Environmentalchanges could affect myelin synthesis. Some studies have shown thatdietary fatty acids can be positively involved in the control of CNSmyelinogenesis. One possible explanation for this finding could be thatmyelin from this patients were different in its constitution, maybe varyingin the amount or quality of its components in a subtle way. This could makeit more susceptible to latter immuno-mediated damage when joined to otherenvironmental factors. Disclosure: G Luetic has nothing to disclose. P63 USE OF ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Marrie Ra, Cohen JAa, Hadjimichael Ob, Vollmer Tb aMellen Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, Ohio, USA;bNeurology, Yale University Medical School, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Background: Alternative providers are used by MS patients. There are few studies exploring the predictors of use of these therapies. These studies havebeen small, or limited to a single geographic region, and have identified fewpredictors. Objectives: To determine frequency of use of alternative providers (AP) among MS patients, and factors which predict such use, using data from theNorth American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS)Patient Registry.Methods: We examined the cohort of MS patients enrolled in the NARCOMS registry residing in the U.S. We used self-reported data on demographics, dis-ability, disease status and use of AP to create a binary multivariate logisticregression model for the use of AP.Results: Data regarding the use of AP was provided by 17018 patients. Life- time use of AP was 55%, and current use was 18%. Chiropractors (42%), mas-sage therapists (37%), and nutritionists (16%) were the most commonly usedAP. Current use of any AP was statistically significantly associated with beingfemale (OR=1.23), having had a relapse in the last year (OR=1.17), incomeover $50,000 (OR=1.32), living in the Western U.S. (OR=1.33), having at leastsome college education (OR=1.24), and being unmarried (OR=1.20). Predic-tive power of the model was poor (c-index=0.57), despite being a good fit forthe data.Conclusions: Demographic factors play a minimal role in predicting the use of AP in this MS population. There must be other factors involved that mayinclude cost of therapy, accessibility, social acceptability and cultural factors. Given the frequency of use of AP by this patient population, characterization of these factors is important. Disclosure: R Marrie has nothing to disclose. P64 THE PREVALENCE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN IRELAND McGuigan C, McCarthy A, Hutchinson M Dept. of Neurology, St Vincents, Dublin, Co. Dublin, Ireland Background: Ireland has been recognized as a high risk area for MS since the work of Allison and Millar in the 1950s. Recent studies have indicated a high and rising prevalence in the north of the island. A study in CountyAntrim, northeast Ireland, reported a prevalence rate of 168.7 per 100,000in 1998. By contrast, prevalence figures for the south of Ireland haveremained relatively low with published figures ranging from 48.4 - 73 per100,000.Objectives: To establish the prevalence of MS in two Irish counties: Donegal in northwest Ireland and Wexford in the southeast.Methods: Patients with clinically definite or probable MS (Poser criteria) who were resident within the county borders on the 1st of January 2001 were con-sidered prevalent cases. Sources of case ascertainment included a postal surveyMultiple SclerosisPosters S41 of General Practitioners, County Physicians, Consultant Neurologists, Respite Facilities and local MS charities. Hospital coding lists and interferon prescrip-tion lists were also reviewed. Patient examination and / or review of clinicalcase records confirmed the diagnosis of MS.Results: In County Donegal, 217 prevalent cases were identified resulting in a prevalence rate of 166.9 per 100,000 (95% confidence limits: 145.5 - 190.7). InCounty Wexford there were 126 cases giving a prevalence figure of 120.7 per100,000 (95% confidence limits: 100.5 - 143.7).Conclusions: The southeast of Ireland has a higher prevalence of MS than previously reported, however, the rate remains significantly lower thanthat for northern counties. This is possibly due to genetic variations withinthe background populations of the two regions. HLA typing of the back-ground populations in Donegal and Wexford is ongoing to test thishypothesis.

P65 UNCONVENTIONAL THERAPY USE AMONG MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Sastre-Garriga Ja, Munteis Eb, Rio Service, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain Background: Use of unconventional therapies (UT) is growing in western countries. Prevalence studies as well as knowledge of why they are used IN MSare needed.Objectives: To assess the prevalence of UT use among MS patients and to explore associations with clinical, demographical and other variables.Methods: Structured self-administered questionnaires were given to 380 con- secutive patients seen at two hospital-based MS clinics. At the time of ques-tionnaire dispensation, clinical data were recorded: duration of disease, timefrom diagnosis, clinical course of MS, EDSS, and use of disease-modifyingtreatments. The questionnaire recorded socio-demographical features (includ-ing education and income) and inquired on use of UT for MS.Results: The response rate was 50.78%. Clinical and demographical features were not statistically different between patients who responded and those whodid not respond. Of the patients who answered the questionnaires 40.9% admit-ted to using UT in the previous year. Lower degrees of satisfaction with medi-cine in general, lower degrees of satisfaction with the results of medicine for MSand higher EDSS scores were associated (p<0.05) with higher use of UT in thelast year.Conclusions: We found a 40% prevalence of UT use by MS patients in the Barcelona area (similar to that found in a USA survey). UT users have higherEDSS scores and are less satisfied with conventional medicine than non-users.We cannot demonstrate an association with income or educational levels asfound in other surveys. Cultural and public health system organisation differ-ences could explain these different findings. Disclosure: X Montalban has nothing to disclose. P66 ACUTE DISSEMINATED ENCEPHALOMYELITIS (ADEM) IN ADULTS: COMPARISON WITH AN ADEM PEDIATRIC POPULATION Papayannis CEa, Ferreira Ja, Caceres monophasic inflammatory condition of the CNS, typically occurring after infections or vaccinations. Young adults andchildren are more frecuently affected.Objectives: To assess the prevalence of ADEM in an adult population of a Clinic for demyelinating diseases. To analyze the clinical data, the results ofcomplementary studies and prognosis comparing with another pediatric ADEM population (PAP) in the same area. Methods: 590 clinical records registered between 1989-2002 in the Demyeli- nating Clinic were reviewed. 9 cases were selected with the diagnosis ofADEM (prevalence of 15,2 cases per 1000 clinical records), 8 of these wereanalysed. The PAP was of 79 patients with a mean age of 5,6 years (0,4-16);60% were male, 90 % of them experienced complete recovery. We analized:preceding infections or vaccinations; symptons at onset, results of MRI andCSF, treatment and evolution. Results: The mean age at ADEM onset was 32,8 (20-54), 50% were male with a mean time of follow up of 4 months (6-120). 8 cases (87,5%) had a precedinginfection (2 of them were EBV; 2 nonspecific viruses and another 3 of bacter-ial origin), 2 to 30 days (mean time 16) before the neurological manifestation.The symptoms at onset were disturbed conciousness in 6 cases (75%); motorinvolvement 6 (75%); headache 4 cranial disturbances (37,5%); menigism 1 (12,5%), seizures 1 (12,5%). In 4cases brain MRI showed small and multiple lesions; 3 cases large and multipleand 1 patient no lesions. Gray matter involvement was found in 50 %.CSFpleocytosis in 3 cases. Oligoclonal bands in 20%. 6 cases showed a monopha-sic pattern, 2 of them had no sequel, 2 had nondisabling symptoms and 2 hadmoderate deficits. One patient developed a clinical definite Multiple Sclerosis(CDMS) and another a multiphasic course (recurrent ADEM).Conclusions: The prevalence of ADEM in this adult population was signifi- cantly lower than in a PAP in the same area. Only one patient developedCDMS and another one recurrent ADEM. According to these data ADEM inadults could have a worse prognosis in terms of sequels.

P67 MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN BOTUCATU, BRAZIL - A POPULATION STUDY Rocha FCa, Herrera LCa, Morales RRa, and the Brazilian Committee for Z aNeurology Department, Medical School of Unesp, Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background: Population target: Urban people of Botucatu, Brazil s southwest- ern small city (22.5 \u00b0S latitude), who had fulfilled multiple sclerosis (MS) diag- nostic criteria. Objectives: Study of prevalence and clinical presentation of MS patients in that population.Methods: All patients with symptoms suggestive of MS were personally exam- ined by authors and submitted to paraclinical evokedpotential collagen, inflammatory, infec-tious and vascular disorders were excluded. Only patients between 15 and 59years at onset of disease, who had filled diagnostic criteria (McDonald et al.2001), were included.Results: 17 patients had diagnostic of MS in 103,793 inhabitants (prevalence day: 2001 June have European ancestral. 19 to 59 years (mean: 34.9).Evolution forms: relapsing-remitting (RR) (9 patients), primary progressive(PP) (3 p), secondary progressive (SP) (3 p), benign (2 p). Percentage of initialpresentation: sensory PP type and optic neuritis in benign form.EDSS range 1.0 to 7.0. Conclusions: Prevalence of MS in Botucatu - 22.5 \u00b0S (17/100,000) is similar of Sao Paulo - 23.5 \u00b0S, Brazil (15/100,000 - Callegaro, 1999) and Buenos Aires 34\u00b0S, Argentina (16.5/100,000 - Cristiano, 1997) both in South America. This suggests that these cities have higher risk to MS than reported in literature (Kurtzke, 1998). Frequency of disease is close to south of USA and southerncountries of Europe. Factors like geographical location and ethnic background(Caucasians with European ancestry) may be relevant. Clinical distributioncorresponded to that described by others in our country (Lana-Peixoto et al,Moreira et al, Tilbery et al). Spinal and cerebellar presentation were associatedwith worse prognostic, otherwise optic neuritis was associated with betterPosters S42 Multiple Sclerosisprognostic.

P68 CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NON-RESPONDERS TO INTERFERON BETA University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA;bNeurologie A, H\u00f4pital Neurologique, Lyon, France Background: There is no consensus to define what constitutes poor response to IFNB in patients with MS. This is why the percentage of MS patients who donot respond to IFNB therapy and the predictors of clinical response areunknown.Objectives: To describe clinical characteristics of patients with RRMS on IFNB therapy in the Lyon EDMUS database, and to determine whether respon-ders and non-responders to IFNB differ clinically.Methods: The prospectively up-dated EDMUS database in Lyon was used to obtain information on patients treated with IFNB for MS for 6 or more months.Data on all RRMS patients who received one of the 3 IFNB approved inEurope was extracted from the database in March 2001. Non-responders toIFNB were defined as patients who experienced higher or identical annualizedrelapse rate on IFNB therapy compared to the two years and/or the year prior toIFNB therapy.Results: A total of 200 RRMS patients having received IFNB for at least 6 consecutive months were identified. 63 of the 200 RRMS patients (31.5%)experienced higher or identical annualized relapse rate on IFNB therapy com-pared to 2 years and/or the year prior to IFNB therapy. Non-responders andresponders were similar for mean age when MS started, disability levels whenIFNB was initiated, and sex ratio. Responders were older and had a longermean disease duration than non-responders at the time IFNB was initiated.Responders also had a higher mean annualized relapse rate during the yearprior IFNB therapy. Less often responders converted to secondary progressiveMS, or progressed during IFNB therapy compared to non-responders. Themulivariate logistic regression showed that annualized relapse rate was thestrongest clinical predictor of response to IFNB (OR=0.59, 95%CI: 0.42-0.82).However, MS duration and age when IFNB was initiated also predicted to alesser extent IFNB response (respectively, OR [95%CI]: 0.90 [0.85-0.96] and0.96 [0.92-1.0]).Conclusions: Although the clinical activity of the disease preceding IFNB use may be the strongest clinical predictor of response to therapy, the MRI profile and the biological mechanisms underlying this poor response to IFNB are still unknown.

Imaging (Part 1) P69 LONGITUDINALLY DIFFUSION TENSOR SCLEROSIS Hospitals Toulouse, Toulouse, 31, France Background: In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a lack of specificity has been previ- ously reported in derived imaging parameters (such as lesion load quantified onT2-weighted images and Gadolinium enhancement) in order to predict the dis- ease course.Objectives: Our aim is to determine the reproducibility of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in healthy volunteers and to evaluate its capability to monitorpatients with Multiple Sclerosis over one year of follow-up.Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging was performed at 1.5 tesla (Magnetom Vision; Siemens Erlangen, Germany). Six non colinear directions of gradientswere acquired to obtain the whole diffusion tensor with an Echo-Planar Imag-ing (EPI) single-shot sequence patients (3with a Relapsing Remitting form, RR-MS and 4 with a Secondary Progressive,SP-MS) underwent three-monthly MRI examinations over one year of follow-up. All were chosen with a limited cerebral lesion load on T2-weighted images.Seven age and sex matched normal controls underwent three examinations andthirteen controls were also studied once. The mean diffusivity is assessed with the Trace of the tensor (Tr= 1+2+3) and the directionality is described with an index of anisotropy (Ani=3. 1/Tr). Both were quantified over the whole brain and fully described with histograms. Results: In volunteers, differences were found for both trace (Tr) and anisotropy (Ani) according to the age and the sex of the subjects, but remainstable over the time. In patients, Tr is higher whereas Ani is lower (p<0.0001)than in matched controls. There is no evidence of difference when comparingthe mean global Tr value in patients with different MS phenotypes. However,on longitudinal histograms of Ani, a recovery is emerging in RR-MS whereasthere is a worsening in SP-MS.Conclusions: DTI is reproducible and sensitive to modifications in cerebral diffusion in MS patients. The Anisotropy parameter seems to be more sen-sitive to assess the longitudinal modifications over one year of follow-upthan mean diffusivity and may better reflect the progressive phase of thedisease.

Funding: Supported de Recherche contre la University Segalen, Bordeaux Cedex, France Background: Antibodies against adhesion molecule VLA4 have been shown to reduce clinical and histological signs of experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) most probably by reducing blood-brain-barrier(BBB) damage. Anti-VLA4 antibodies are under testing in MS patients (Nat-ulizumab). The new contrast agent ultra-small-particle-iron-oxide (USPIO) isable to disclose. by MRI, in vivo, macrophage containing lesions in EAE.USPIO have been successfully applied to detect active lesions in MSpatients.Objectives: To evaluate the usefulness of USPIO imaging in EAE rats treated by anti-VLA4 antibodies or placebo.Methods: Acute EAE was induced in Lewis rats by immunization by guinea pig cord homogenates in complete Freund adjuvant. 8 rats were treated by amonoclonal anti rat VLA4 antibody (CD49d) (gift of Biogen, Cambridge, MA)and 8 rats by a placebo. MRI was performed on a 1,5 T magnet. T1 weightedimages were performed before and after gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) infusion. T2 and T2* weighted images were also acquired . After the first MRI, rats received USPIO infusion (sinerem\u00ae, gift of Guerbet, France) and a second MRI wasperformed 24 hours after this infusion to detect cellular enhancement. Ratswere sacrificed after this MRI to study EAE histological signs and macrophagerecruitment by immunohistochemistry.Results: 3 out of 8 anti-VLA4 antibody treated rats and 7 out of 8 placebo treated rats developed EAE (p<0.03). Mean clinical scores were significantly reduced in the active treatment group (0.24 \u00b10.44) compared to the placebo group (1.7 \u00b11.1) (p<0.01). The disease was delayed by the treatment (13.5 \u00b10.9Multiple SclerosisPosters S43 against 10.4 \u00b11.5 days) (p<0.003 ). MRI 24 hours after USPIO infusion showed abnormalities in 3 rats treated by anti-VLA4 and 6 rats treated by placebo. A good correlation was observed between clinical and USPIO MRI signs.Macrophage infiltrates were significantly reduced in rats treated by the anti- body (5.9 \u00b12.6) compared to placebo (11 \u00b13.2) (p<0.02). Conclusions: Both MRI with USPIO and histology showed anti-VLA4 antibody treatment reduces macrophage infiltrates in EAE. USPIO may be auseful tool to monitor biological efficacy of this treatment.

P71 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CELLULAR IMAGING WITH SINEREM\u00ae AND USPIO IN Segalen, Bordeaux, Bordeaux Cedex, France Background: Phagocytic activity of cells within inflammatory lesions of the central nervous system can be visualized in vivo by MRI using new contrastagents like Ultra small particle iron oxide (USPIO). This has been shown inboth experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Multiple Sclero-sis (MS) using Sinerem\u00ae, a first generation USPIOObjectives: To compare a newly available USPIO, called 7228 to sinerem \u00ae for the detection of EAE lesions.Methods: Acute EAE was induced in 8 Lewis rats by immunization by guinea pig cord homogenates in complete Freund adjuvant. MRI was performed at thepeak of EAE clinical signs on a 1,5 T magnet. T1, T2 and T2* weighted images(w.i.) were USPIO infusion: AMI 227 (Sinerem\u00ae, giftof Guerbet, France) for 4 and USPIO 7228 (gift of Guerbet, France) for 4rats. Rats were sacrificed after this MRI to study EAE histological signs andmacrophage recruitment by immunohistochemistryResults: No difference was observed between sinerem\u00ae and 7228 to detect EAE lesions on T1 w.i. However, 7228 was more sensitive on T2 and lesions enhanced by infiltrates. staining showed iron deposits than after sinerem\u00ae infusion.

Callegaro Da, Otaduy Mb, Lacerda Mb, Costa Mb, Bacheschi La, Leite Cb aNeurology, Medical School of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil;bRadiology, Medical School of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background: Diffusion MRI is sensitive to the microscopic randomic transla- tional motion of water molecules in biological tissue. Pathological tissue in MSis commonly characterized by an increase in diffusion. The histogram analysisof diffusion images provides global parameters for the patient, which measureboth the lesions and NAWM. It is important to address what is the relationbetween these parameters and the lesion load measured on conventional images.Objectives: To correlate whole-brain diffusion MR histogram results to total lesion load (TLL) in MS patients. Methods: Fifteen patients (mean age = 32 \u00b18 years) with MS were examined with conventional and diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Studies were per- formed on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Axial 5 mm thick T2, T1 and PD weightedimages were acquired. Diffusion was measured mm thickSE echo-planar images ms) with matrix reso- lution of 95 x 128 and with two different b values: 0 and 1000 s/mm 2. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were generated off-line assuming a monoex-ponential decrease of signal intensity with b value. From these maps diffusionhistograms were calculated after removal of the extracerebral tissue and CSF.TLL was measured off-line on PD weighted images. After applying a tresholdlesions were selected manually on each image by two radiologists and the areawas automatically calculated by the software Scion (NIH, USA). Results: Mean lesion load was 1261 2(range 20 5564 mm2). From diffusion histograms following parameters were calculated: mean ADC 1000 \u00b144 x 10-6mm2/s (range 945 to 1075 x 10-6mm2/s), mean ADC peak position 803 \u00b131 x 10-6mm2/s (range 757 to 877 x 10-6mm2/s) and mean ADC peak height 43.9 \u00b16.1 (range 34 to 52). Mean ADC and ADC peak height showed a strong and significant correlation with TLL (0.7355; p = 0.002 and - 0.7678; p < 0.001 respectively), but the correlation between ADC peak positionand TLL was not significant.Conclusions: Whole brain diffusion histograms can be a reliable and fast method to control disease evolution in MS patients.

Davies G, Hadjiprocopis A, Altmann D, Rashid W, Griffin C, Chard D, Kapoor R, Thompson A, Miller D NMR Unit, Institute of Neurology, UCL, Queen Square, London, United Kingdom Background: Cross sectional histogram analysis has shown that T1 relaxtion time measurement can detect abnormality in normal appearing white matter(NAWM) early in the course of multiple sclerosis (MS).Objectives: The question as to whether diffuse abnormality occurs prior to or following the first clinical episode may provide valuable insight into patholog-ical mechanisms in MS. To investigate the evolution of abnormalities with timewe have studied longitundinally a cohort of early relapsing MS (RRMS) sub-jects using T1 histogram analysis.Methods: Nineteen subjects (6 male and 13 female, mean age 38) with early RRMS (mean disease duration 2.1 years) and eight controls (6 male and 2female, mean age 38) were imaged six monthly. Mean follow up was 22.5month (range 12-36 months). Dual fast spin echo (FSE) sequences wereobtained along with a gradient echo data set (PD and T1 weighted images) per-mitting the calculation of a T1 map. Lesions were contoured on the FSE imagefollowing registration of this image to the T1 image. Using these regions andSPM derived masks, NAWM segments were generated from the T1 map.Remaining CSF was removed with a 1000ms threshold and 2 sequential ero-sions. Normalized histograms were generated from the NAWM segments ofthe T1 map and mean T1 was extracted from the histogram. A hierachicalregression model was used to assess the difference in mean T1 between MSsubjects and to look for a gradient of increase in T1 with time. Gender differ-ences were accounted for. Results: The mean T1 relaxation time was 669.5ms in MS subjects (standard deviation (SD) 22.8ms) and 630.8ms in controls (SD 15.2ms), p<0.001. Nosignificant change in T1 was observed during follow up although at baseline,values were significantly related to disease duration. Results suggest that,assuming a linear relationship, the T1 relaxation times increase by 1.14ms permonth between disease onset and the first data point. Projecting back fromthese observations suggests that at the time of disease onset, abnormalities arealready present.Conclusions: This study confirms the presence of diffuse T1 relaxation time abnormalities early in the clinical course of MS and suggests that these arepresent prior to clinical onset.

PRELIMINARY DATA. Durand Dubief Fa, Pachai studies have been done to quantify the severity and the evolution of brain tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). Brain atrophymeasured by MRI techniques is a potential way to monitor disease progressionin MS. Objectives: The objective of the study was to determine the evolution of the whole brain atrophy in MS patients by annual MRI acquisitions.Methods: 3D MRI T1 weighted sequences covering the whole brain from the foramen magnum to the vertex, pre and post-Gadolinium enhancementwere performed on a yearly basis (matrix 256.256.170 ; resolution : 1mm).Serial 3D data sets were spatially registered for each patient using a fullyautomatic algorithm. Intracranial volume, brain parenchyma volume andventricular volume were automatically segmented. A mask representingartery and vein structures was obtained for each patient by segmentingGadolinium enhanced acquisitions. These vascular structures wereremoved from the final brain mask. Two parallel anatomical planes atanterior/posterior commisural level and internal auditory meatus levelwere interactively defined. These planes were considered as the quantifica-tion cut-off. We quantified different volumes of interest such as the vol-ume above the anterior/posterior commisural plane, volume above theinternal auditory meatus, whole brain volume and Brain ParenchymalFraction.Results: Seventeen patients with clinically definite MS have been included in the study. Eight patients had a relapsing-remitting course and nine a secondaryprogressive one. Mean disease duration at the first MRI was 13 years (Range :0 - 34). Mean follow-up duration was 3.8 years (Range : 3 - 5). Mean numberof MRI assessments for each patient was 3.5. The different volumes were com-pared to identify the more informative one. The percentage of brain atrophywas evaluated for each patient over at least 3 years. Conclusions: Analysis is still in progress Disclosure: F Durand Dubief has nothing to disclose.

Methods: 26 patients were recruited with acute unilateral optic neuritis. Their optic nerves were imaged a mean 14 days since the onset of visualsymptoms with a fat saturated fast spin echo (FSE) sequence and a 3D gradi-ent echo magnetization transfer sequence. 17 of them had serial imagingafter 2, 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. A blinded observer segmented the opticnerves from the MTR maps. Lesions were then defined on the acute FSEimages and from the coordinates the mean lesion MTR was calculated for each time point.Results: The mean lesion MTR at baseline was 47.3pu compared with 48.2pu in contralateral healthy nerve (p=0.03). The serial lesion datawere analysed using a hierarchical model with a quadratic term which gavethe best fit. In the acute phase mean lesion MTR fell rapidly. The coefficientin the linear term was -0.029pu per day (standard error [SE] 0.005), 0.000033 to 0.000093,p<0.0001. The rate of decrease lessened over time with the suggestion of anadir of mean lesion MTR at about 200 days and a small increase in MTRsubsequently.Conclusions: The early fall in MTR is consistent with demyelination and acute axonal damage. The subsequent late rise in mean lesion MTR suggests that thistechnique may be able to demonstrate remyelination. Disclosure: S Hickman has nothing to disclose.

P76 CORTICOSTEROIDS AND OPTIC NERVE Miller DHa aNMR Research Unit, Institute of Neurology, University College London, United Kingdom;bDept. of Neuro-Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom;cDept. of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom;dDept. of Clinical Neurophysiology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery,London, United Kingdom Background: Optic nerve atrophy has been shown to develop following optic neuritis. There has been recent interest in the use of corticosteroids as neuro-protective agents. Pulsed corticosteroid treatment has been shown to reduce thedevelopment of cerebral atrophy in multiple sclerosis.Objectives: To assess whether corticosteroids prevent the development of optic nerve atrophy following optic neuritis.Methods: Optic nerve short tauinversion recovery images from a recent randomized placebo controlled trial of intravenous methylprednisolone inacute optic neuritis were evaluated. Imaging was performed before random-ization and six months later. Mean optic nerve area was measured by anobserver blinded to image identity, acquisition order and treatment statusfrom two consecutive orbital slices using a semi-automated contouringtechnique. Results: At baseline optic nerve mean area was 18.4mm 2in affected optic nerves and 17.8mm2in unaffected optic nerve (n=45, p=0.3). After six months optic nerve mean area was 16.4mm2in affected optic nerves and 17.4mm2in unaffected optic nerves (n=59, p=0.019). The mean area of affected optic nerves in the corticosteroid group was 15.9mm2(n=30) compared with 16.9mm2(n=29) in the placebo group (p=0.29). The mean measurement coeffi- cient of variation was 3.8%. Conclusions: This technique was able to demonstrate optic nerve atrophy fol- lowing optic neuritis. There is no evidence from these data that intravenousmethylprednisolone prevents the short-term development of optic nerve atro-phy following optic neuritis.

After administration ofintravenous triple dose Gd the patients' optic nerves were images with a fat sat-urated T 1-weighted spin echo sequence. A blinded observer identified and measured the length of any enhancing nerve lesions on the images. Serial imag- ing was performed on 15 of the patients and the duration of enhancement noted.A clinical assessment was carried out at baseline and again after one year.Results: The symptomatic lesion was identified in 27/28 cases. The median lesion length at baseline was 30mm (range 0-39mm). Patients with longer lesions ( 30mm) had worse initial 30-2 Humphrey visual field mean deviations (p=0.009) and central field visual evoked potential amplitudes (p=0.05) com- pared with those patients with shorter lesions. The median duration of enhance-ment was 63 days (range 0-113 days). Neither the length of the initial lesionnor the duration of enhancement were correlated significantly with final visualoutcome.Conclusions: The initial lesion length in optic neuritis appears to be important in determining the amount of initial visual impairment. The extent and durationof the initial inflammatory lesion does not, however appear to affect prognosis. Disclosure: S Hickman has nothing to disclose. Funding: SJH is Supported by The Wellcome Trust.

P78 A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF BRAIN ATROPHY WITH TRANSCRANIAL ULTRASOUND IN RELAPSING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS KV, M\u00e4urer Neurolog.Klinik, Wuerzburg, Germany Background: In multiple sclerosis, brain atrophy was shown to correlate with disability and is considered to represent the net effect of tissue destruc-tion. As a parameter for assessment of brain atrophy we could recently showthat determination of ventricular width by transcranial ultrasound correlatedwell with MRI measurements of the ventricular system. Moreover, ultra-sound revealed larger ventricular diameters in MS patients in comparison toage and sex matched control patients. It was further shown that brain atro-phy determined by ultrasound correlated with EDSS and several neuropsy-chological tests.Objectives: We conduct a longitudinal follow up of measurements of ventric- ular width with transcranial ultrasound in comparison to MRI in MS patients. Methods: 38 patients (mean age 36+/-9 years) were included in this 2 year study. Patients were investigated clinically (EDSS, 9 hole peg test), with tran-scranial ultrasound and MRI at baseline, 12 and 24 months follow up.Results: A first evaluation with 22 patients who completed the first year was done. The EDSS at baseline was 3.8+/-1.5 and showed only a minor change to3.9+/-2 after one year (not significant). The width of the III. ventricle at base-line was 5.5+/-2.9 mm. In accordance with the stable clinical situation thediameter of the third ventricle remained nearly unchanged (5.6+/-3.3 mm, notsignificant). Ventricular diameter was determined by two independent examin- ers and revealed highly reproducible results. Conclusions: These preliminary results from a longitudinal study underline the value of transcranial ultrasound as an easily applicable method for evaluation of brain atrophy in MS patients.

P79 FUNCTIONAL MRI CHANGES DURING RECOVERY FROM OPTIC NEURITIS Norway Background: Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have suggested that adaptive cortical changes take place during the recovery from MS attacks, and that thesechanges have the potential to augment clinical recovery. . When visually stim-ulating eyes, previously affected with acute optic neuritis (ON), the activatedvolume in the visual cortex was smaller compared to healthy controls, and cor-related with visual acuity. Objectives: In the present serial fMRI study changes in visual cortical function was studied in patients with first episode of acute unilateral ON. It wasexpected that the volume of visual cortical activation would correlate to thevisual function, when stimulating the affected eye. Since the visual function isbased on both eyes working in collaboration, it was hypothesized that an adap-tive change of cortical activation would be detected, when stimulating the unaf-fected eye,(monocularly or binocularly) during the period of visual impairment.Methods: Subjects: Eleven patients with acute monosymptomatic ON (4 men,7 women), median age 38 years, nine healthy subjects(3 men, 6women),median age 32 years. Methods: Patients: Four serial sessions, eachcomprising fMRI, Snellen visual acuity and visual evoked potentials. Sessionswere performed at mean 10 (range 4 - 18),34,70,and 432 days after symptomonset. Healthy controls had fMRI on two occasions. Eyes were stimulated sep-arately and together using ep imaging in eleven slices, covering the visual cor-tex. The visual stimulus was a black/white checkerboard reversing at 8 Hz. Results: When stimulating binocularly a significant increase in activated vol- ume was detected in the second session (34 days), at the same time as improve-ment of visual function had started. During the four sessions the mean resultsof the Snellen visual acuity and of the VEP amplitude correlated significantlyto the volume of cortical activation. There was no significant diffence betweenfMRI results on the two occasions in healthy controls. Conclusions: The large increase in cortical activated volume when stimulating binocularly in the second session may represent dynamic adaptive functionalchanges augmenting recovery from unilateral ON.

P80 DEVELOPMENT OF A BRAIN TUMOUR IN MS: A CASE Laule aPhysics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;bMedicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;cRadiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;dPathology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;eSurgery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Background: Clinical deterioration is expected in most patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) due to relapses or secondary progression. Routine MRI is notPosters S46 Multiple Sclerosisoften done to determine if this is due to a secondary diagnosis. We report a woman with clinically definite MS for 9 years who had unexpected worseningdue to a large CNS mass.Objectives: To investigate possible causes of unexpected deterioration in a patient with MS using both standard and novel MRI techniques.Methods: A 53 year old woman with MS who presented with a 3 month his- tory of anorexia and vomiting had a standard neurologic exam. Prior to biopsy,gadolinium enhanced MRI, proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) and a 48 echo T2relaxation measurement were performed using a 1.5T GE scanner. Results: MRI demonstrated a left frontal mass (>60cm^3) with mixed signal intensity, edema, significant mass effect and irregular ring enhancement. (Oneyear prior, the patient had a large frontal plaque extending into the corpus cal-losum. No mass effect was evident at that time). The lesion spectrum was dom-inated by large peaks around 1ppm, likely due to lipid. T2 measurementsshowed heterogeneous decreases in myelin water and prolonged relaxationtimes. At least 3 T2-distinguishable volumes were found within the mass, with intermediate mean T2 times (~130ms) and myelin signal remaining in the cen- tral core, while the periphery tended to have almost no myelin signal andlonger relaxation times (250-450ms). Histopathology showed characteristicstypical of a giant cell glioblastoma (grade IV astrocytoma). Conclusions: MRI is indicated for MS patients with unexpected deterioration to exclude a secondary diagnosis. For more pathologically specific informa-tion, MRS and T2 measurements are valuable.

P81 GUIDELINES FOR A STANDARDIZED MRI PROTOCOL FOR THEDIAGNOSIS AND FOLLOW-UP OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS LiDa, Traboulsee Ab, Paty Db, Work Group on Standardized MRI Protocol Cc aRadiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;bNeurology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;cConsortium of MS Centers, Teaneck, New Jersey, USA Background: The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become rou- tine in the diagnostic workup of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Thereare however no guidelines for the use of MRI in practice. Standardized MRIprotocols would help maximize the value of individual scans, as well as allowsystematic data collection for clinical and comparison studies.Objectives: To develop consensus guidelines for standardized MRI protocols and indications for their use in the diagnosis and follow up of patients with MS.Methods: An expert consensus meeting on 'MRI Protocols for the Diagnosis and Follow Up of MS', sponsored by the Consortium of MS Centers (CMSC)was convened November 3-4, 2001 in Vancouver, Canada. Participantsincluded MS neurologists and radiologists from North America, Europe, andNew Zealand, with representation from the American Academy of Neurology,American Society of Neuroradiology, and Radiological Society of NorthAmerica.Results: 10 guidelines were recommended with specific proposals concerning baseline evaluation, diagnosis and follow-up, indications for spinal imaging,use of gadolinium, appropriate requests, reports and archiving. The guidelinesproposed standardized MRI protocols to image the brain and spinal cord, withspecified required and optional features. Scans should be obtained, if possible,on a 1 Tesla or higher machine, using a slice thickness of 3mm or less (1.5mmor less for 3D sequences), without gaps, with scans oriented along the subcal-losal line using a 3 plane localizer if available. Routine follow up MRI's inpractice were not recommended, until standardization. A prototype radiologyreport was suggested using standardized and consistent common language,describing such features as lesion number, location, size, shape, and character.A copy of the MRI should be retained permanently for future comparison.Conclusions: Consensus guidelines will be posted for review on the CMSC website (www.mscare.org) for discussion and comment. The development ofthese recommendations is only the beginning of what has to be a continuingprocess, requiring modification, implementation, evaluation and continuedupdating and improvement.

P82 SPONTANEOUS MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY RECORDINGS IN MS PATIENTS Ramo Ca, Amo Cb, Fernandez Sb, Carmen Mb, Maest\u00fa Fb, Fernandez Ab, Ortiz de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain;bCentro of Madrid, Madrid, Spain Background: Magnetoencephalogrphy (MEG) is a non-invasive technique that allows us to detect the magnetic dendritic activity and the anatomical local-ization in MRI images.Objectives: The objetive of this estudy is to detect and measure the abnormal low frequency magnetic activity (ALFMA) and epileptogenic-like activity inmultiple sclerosis patients and evaluate their clinical applications as a comple-mentary diasnostic technique.Methods: Twenty one patiens were selected according to the followin criteria: twenty one relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients. All the RR patients wererecently diagnosed whith at least 2 relapsing episodes whithin the last twoyears. Mean age 31.6 (range 22-45). Mean EDSS 1.5 (range 0-3.5). None ofthem were on corticoid therapy in the last 3 months before the MEG or were oninnmunosupressor treatment. Spontaneous awake simultaneous MEG-EEGrecording was measured using a 148 channel biomagnetic system with aMAGNES 2500W device, performing an equivalent current dipole analysisand superimposing on a corresponding 3D weighted MRI.Results: The results reveal that on all the patient MEG recordings appear focal slow waves (theta & delta) activity; in 17 patients (81%), of wich had areas (frontal ascendant circumbolutions), inaddition of the same group, 52% had slow waves in other parietal areas. Othersfrequently affected areas were frontal and temporal lobes. Also, epileptogenic-like activity was found indepently in MEG records (simultaneous EEG wasnormal in all patients) in 12 patients (57%). The most affected areas were frontal andtemporal lobes.Conclusions: The MEG detects the presence of abnormal activities in well lim- ited areas of the brain cortex. Epileptogenic-like activity in a high percent ofpatients (57%) has been found. This activity was not foun in conventionalsimultaneous EEG records. This sharp MEG activity has no correlation whith clinical features, degree of lesional load, degree of motor disability and multi- ple sclerosis evolution time. The presence of this activity is related whith braincortex affectation. This results could be explained in future studies. Disclosure: D Martin C. recibes a grant from Serono laboratories. Hospital, Salford, of Clinical Neurology, University hospital Notttingham, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom Background: The emphasis on axonal damage as the pathological substrate of disability in MS has focussed attention on black holes. To date, the majority ofclinial studies of black hole volumes have used moderately T1-weighted spin-echo (T1 SE) sequences. It has been postulated that the use of heavily T1-weighted sequences, such as Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradi-Multiple SclerosisPosters S47 ent Echo (MPRAGE), that provide greater T1 contrast will reduce the patho- logical specificity of black holes. Objectives: To investigate black hole volumes using moderately T1-weighted T1 SE and heavily T1-weighted MPRAGE, and, to investigate the pathologicalspecificity of such lesions as quantified using the Magnetization Transfer ratio(MTR). Methods: For 12 patients with secondary progressive MS, T2 SE and MTR images, and post contrast T1 SE and MPRAGE images, were acquired.MPRAGE images were reformatted to the same voxel dimensions as the spinecho sequences and co-registered using image correlation. Black hole and T2lesion volumes were estimated using a seeded region growing technique. on T1 SE was 0.316, signifi-cantly lower than those identified (0.33,p=0.03). The was significantly lower than forT2 lesions (p=0.03). Individual lesions were significantly larger on SE (159mm3, to signal of narmal appearing white matter) of lesions visibleon MPRAGE but not T1 SE was 0.88, significantly higher those visible onboth T1 SE and MPRAGE (0.88, p=0.05).Conclusions: Heavily T1 weighted Gradient Echo sequences yield greater black hole volumes than T1 SE. Lesions visible on MPRAGE but not T1 SE aresmaller and less hypointense than lesions detected on both sequnces. MTR val-ues of MPRAGE lesions are higher than T1 (but lower than T2) suggesting thatthe greater sensitivity of MPRAGE is at the expense of pathological specifiity.MPRAGE lesions may not be as pathologically heterogeneous as T2 lesions.

P84 STEREOTAXIC CO-REGISTRATION OF MRI AND HISTOPATHOLOGY of Neurology, London, England, United Kingdom;bNeuropathology, Institute of Neurology, London, England, United Kingdom Background: Several groups have examined the pathological substrate of MRI in post-mortem (PM) MS brain. However, no standardised method has been developed so far to accurately match the areas of changes visible on MRI withthe tissue specimens.Objectives: To investigate whether a stereotaxic navigation system is a useful tool to co-register lesions on MRI and pathologically in PM brain slices ofpatients with MS.Methods: PM tissue specimens of seven patients (4 women, 3 men; age: 59.4 +/- 18.7 years) with MS were studied. Formalin fixed coronal slices (thickness: 1cm) of one cerebral hemisphere were placed on a grid that was attached to astereotaxic navigation system. Spin echo T2- weighted MRI and FLAIR scans of5 mm slice thickness were obtained. Lesions visible on MRI were matched withpreviously obtained scans of the same, but fresh, specimens. Guided by the targetpoints calculated from coordinates of the localizer frame, the dissection of thebrain slice was performed. Blocks were cut in halves (thickness: 5 mm) with thecut surface corresponding with the imaging plane. After processing of the blocksfor embedding in paraffin, sections were stained with H & E and Luxol-Fast blue.Results: On MRI of fixed brain specimens, 26 areas suspected to be MS lesions were detected, 24 of which were confirmed histologically. Twoconfirmed lesions detected on MRI of the fresh slices were not visible onthe MRI of the fixed slice. Four additional areas that appeared to be lesionson MRI of the fresh specimens could not be matched, either with the scanafter fixation or histologically. 13 microscopically confirmed lesions werenot visible on macroscopic examination of the tissue during the dissectionprocedure.Conclusions: The co-registration of MRI and histopathology in PM brain tis- sue of patients with MS using a stereotaxic system is feasible. This novelapproach improves the accuracy of MR guided sampling of tissue specimensand may increase the yield of tissue that can be used for the correlation of MRIand pathological markers. This method may thus reduce the number of brainspecimens needed in such studies. With regard to a suggested homogeneity of lesions within individual MS patients, this approach may be helpful to collectrepresentative samples from individual cases.

P85 QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LESION PATHOLOGY IN POST- MORTEM A DHa aNeuroinflammation, NMR Research Unit, Institute of Neurology, London, England, United Kingdom;bNeuropathology, Institute of Neurology, London, England, United Kingdom Background: Recent studies have shown that there has been considerable overlap between lesions at various stages with regard to measures of MRI and histopathology in post mortem (PM) MS brain. To better quantify the patho-logical components of MS, there is a need to improve the ability of MRI todepict these features more specifically.Objectives: To quantify and correlate the myelin content and axonal density in MS brain using MRI and digital image analysis (DIA) of histological sections.Methods: Five fresh coronal PM MS brain slices (1cm thick) were studied. T1-, T2-, PD-weighted, and FLAIR scans were performed. T1-relaxation time (T1-R),and magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) maps were produced. After scanning, thespecimens were cut so that the cut surface resembled the imaging plane. Tissueblocks were processed for embedding in paraffin and sections were stained (H &E, Luxol-Fast protein (MBP).We used a Leica Q500MC image analyser for DIA of the slides. Light transmit-tance (LT) was obtained separately for LFB and Bielschowsky stained slides.Results: Of 33 lesions detected on MRI, 19 could be analysed whereas 14 could not be matched with the specimens. Normal appearing white matter(NAWM) of each brain slice served as an intraindividual reference. Lesionswere chronically inactive, three were classified as remyelinated. Reduced MTRcorrelated strongly with axonal loss and demyelination as reflected by high LTvalues in Bielschowsky- and LFB-stained slides. MTR and LT also correlatedstrongly with T1 hypointensity whereas T1-R did not. The latter may be due toan increase of T1-R in PM brain (mean T1-R of NAWM, 740 ms). No differ-ence for any measure of MRI or DIA was detected between demyelinating andremyelinating lesions, probably due to the small sample size in this study.Conclusions: These preliminary results show that DIA is a promising tool to quantify specific components of MS pathology in PM brain tissue. Its exactrole needs to be confirmed in a larger sample and in combination with otherquantitative MRI measures (e.g. fractional anisotropy, bound water fraction).

P86 T2 LESION BURDEN AND T1-HYPOINTENSE (T1-BLACK HOLE) MRIRESULTS FROM THE IMPACT TRIAL Simon JHa, Cohen JAd, Goodman Ac, Heidenreich Fe, Kooijmans Mb, Sandrock Ab, Tsao ECb, IMPACT Investigators .a aRadiology/MRI, University of Colorado HSC, Denver, Colorado, USA;bBiogen,Inc, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA;cNeurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA;dMellon Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA;eNeurology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany Background: The IMPACT Trial evaluated the effect of treatment in patients with secondary progressive MS with EDSS 3.5 to 6.5 randomized by weekly intra- muscular injection (60mcg) for two years. Prior MRI analyses have shown thatnew or enlarging T2 lesions and gadolinium enhancing lesions (inflammatoryactivity) are significantly reduced in treated patients at one and two years (p <0.001). Objectives: To determine the effect of treatment and to define the natural his- tory of T2 burden of disease (T2 lesion volume) and more destructive tissuechanges based on (T1-black holes) and T1 hypointense lesion volume were determined at baseline, year one and two years for all evaluable studies. Differences betweentreatment groups were determined based on nonparametric analysis of variance,stratified by baseline EDSS and number of enhancing lesions on baseline MRI.Results: The T2-lesion volumes and T1-lesion volumes were well balanced at baseline. A treatment effect in favor of treatment with IFN beta-1a was seenwith a significant reduction in change from baseline T2 volume at both one and two years(p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). A similar treatment effect was seen with T1 hypointense lesion volume with group differences favorablefor treatment for change from baseline at both one and two year intervals, witha significant change over the two year timepoint (p = 0.02). Conclusions: These results extend the positive MRI observations from previ- ous analyses of the IMPACT Trial to include measures of T2 burden of diseaseand the more destructive and likely irreversible injury indicated by T1 blackholes, and are supportive of the clinical findings of positive effects of treatmenton MS Functional composite progression, relapses and quality of life.

P87 NEURONAL TRACT DEGENERATION PATTERNS BASED ON DIFFUSIONTENSOR VERSUS T2 MRI CHANGES IN THE CORPUS CALLOSUM IN MS Coombs Bb, Corboy Ja, Simon JHb aRadiology/MRI, University of Colorado HSC, Denver, Colorado, USA;bNeurology, University of Colorado HSC, Denver, Colorado, USA Background: Prior studies have revealed that acute focal MS lesions may be the source of secondary abnormalities observed on high resolution T2 weighted(T2W) MRI images including transcallosal bands and corticospinal tract pat-terns that traverse long white matter pathways. We have hypothesized thatthese are the result of neuronal tract degeneration. Objectives: Test the hypothesis that diffusion tensor derived measures (mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) are sensitive to abnormality in the corpus callosum independent of the visually detected and defined tract degeneration patterns detected by high resolution T2W images. Methods: Diffusion tensor analyses based on mean diffusivity (MD) and frac- tional anisotropy index(FA)calculated in a pilot study with 10 consecutive MSpatients (EDSS 1.5 to 8) compared to echo-planar (EP) 1000 s/mm2 with six diffusion encoding gradi-ent directions. Regional analysis of corpus callosum based on five midlinesagittal slices per subject with EP data mapped by a bilinear geometric trans-formation onto T2-weighted images used as the basis of lesion, ie abnormalappearing white matter (AAWM) versus normal appearing white matter(NAWM) segmentation.Results: In established MS transcallosal bands in some cases involved a substan- tial fraction of the midline callosum on T2W imaging. Abnormal increased MDwas detected in the NAWM (mean, 95% CI) (0.93, 0.84-1.02) and AAWMfractions (1.24, 0.91- 1.57). These abnormalities corresponded to abnormaldecreased FA in NAWM (0.70, 0.65-0.75) and AAWM 0.56, 0.48-0.65) frac-tions.Conclusions: This pilot data suggests that the diffusion tensor derived MD and FA measures are sensitive to pathology in the NAWM in MS in thecorpus callosum suggesting the possibility of several classes or degrees ofabnormal tissue, some potentially the result of secondary tract degenera- tion. The corpus callosum provides a volume of relatively homogeneouswhite matter well-suited for the detailed study of tract degeneration inearly MS. Disclosure: J Simon has nothing to disclose.

Russian Federation;bState Medical University, St.Petersburg, Russian Federation Background: GA is an approved treatment for the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS). However, the mechanisms of action of GA are incompletelyunderstood and effects of GA on metabolic processes at the grey matter areunknown. MR imaging is currently the technique of choice for evaluatingstructural brain lesions in patients with MS. Positron emission tomography(PET) unlike MRI assesses real biochemical and physiological process in thecortex and subcortical brain structures in vivo.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of one year treatment with GA on regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu) in RRMS patients.Methods: 17 RRMS patients were studied with FDG-PET at baseline and after one year of treatment with GA. A group of 9 untreated RRMS patients and 13healthy volunteers served as controls. All patients were assessed using theExpanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) and Functional Systems (FS) Score.RCMRglu differences were evaluated by Mann-Witney U-statistics, and the rela-tionships between PET and clinical data - with Spearman's rank correlation coef-ficients.Results: Significant reduction of rCMRglu in both patients' group was found in the frontal cortex (Brodmann areas and correlations between FS2 and glucosemetabolism were found for the right and left cerebellar hemisphere (r = -0.51,p<0.01). After 12 months the GA treatment group showed substantial stabilityof rCMRglu. By contrast, the control group demonstrated progressive declineon FDG-PET.Conclusions: Our results suggest that in addition to axonal injuring, MS patients suffer from grey matter metabolic alterations that are at least partiallyreversible with GA therapy. Further investigation is warranted to determine thevalue of cerebral metabolism measured by FDG-PET as an objective markerfor monitoring disease activity and to provide prognostic information.

Immunology (Part 1) P89 EARLY IMMUNOLOGIC CHANGES IN SEVERELY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS RECEIVING MITOXANTRONE Altintas Aa, Demir Gb, Siva Aa aNeurology, Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey;bOncology, Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey Background: Mitoxantrone is anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that inter- calates with DNA and is a potent inhibitor of both DNA and RNA synthesis. Inmultiple sclerosis (MS), mitoxantrone treatment has been used largely to down-regulate the immune response non-specifically. The immunosupressive func-tion of mitoxantrone is diverse, with selective effects on various cellular com-Multiple SclerosisPosters S49 ponents and functions of the immune system. In vivo and in vitro studies show that mitoxantrone reduces T cell numbers and suppresses humoral immunity.Objectives: Our objective was to report the early changes in immune cell counts following mitoxantrone treatment in severely progressive MSpatients.Methods: In our study, four relapsing progressive and two secondary progres- sive MS cases not responding to other treatments ( IV methylprednisolone,interferons, plasma exchange, IV immunoglobulin or azathioprine) wereincluded. Before enrollment, patients underwent a general medical history,physical and neurologic examination. Screening blood tests, urinalysis, car-diac tests were performed. The mean age of the patients was 36.6 years(range: 23-61), mean duration of the disease was 13 years (range: 4-30) andmean EDSS was 5.7 (range: 4.0-6.5). According to our protocol, most of thepatients were treated in the Oncology outpatient clinic. Blood samples werewithdrawn immediately before first and second mitoxantrone infusions (12mg/m2). The interval between two infusions was 4-8 weeks. Peripheral immune typing including total lymphocyte and CD4 count did not any prominent change, CD8, CD3, CD16, CD4/CD45RA and CD4/CD45RO cell countsshowed a tendency to decrease after a single IVmitoxantrone infusion.Conclusions: Our preliminary study is limited. Detailed longitudinal immuno- logic studies could be helpful to understand better the mechanism of action ofmitoxantrone in MS patients. Disclosure: A Altintas has nothing to disclose. P90 EFFECT OF 24 MONTHS INTERFERON TTREATMENT ON CD4, CD8, CD4CD45RO AND CD4CD45RA CELLS H, Mitosek-Szewczyk K, Stelmasiak Z Neurology, Medical School, Lublin, Poland Background: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, autoimmune, demyelinating dis- ease of central nervous system. The pathological process underlying MSinvolve dysregulation of the immune system and it is predominantly T cell- mediated immune disorder. Objectives: The aim of our study was evaluation of some select T-cells sub- populations: CD4, CD8, CD45RO and MS treated with INF 1a (30 \u00b5g im once a week). Methods: We investigated 15 patients (6 men and 9 women aged 32,3 \u00b18,4) with RRMS. Peripheral blood samples were collected before therapy and after 9 and 24 months after therapy initiation. Expression of C4, CD8, CD45RO and CD45RA were evaluated byflow cytometry method. Comparisons were made with 20 control patientsmatched in age. Methods: We investigated 15 patients (6 men and 9 women aged 32,3 \u00b1(8,4) with RRMS. Peripheral blood samples were collected before therapy and after 9 and 24 months after therapy initiation. Expression of C4, CD8, CD45RO andCD45RA were evaluated by flow cytometry method. Comparisons were madewith 20 control patients matched in age. Results: Compared to the controls the MS patients showed statistically signifi- cant (p<0,01) lower expression of CD8, higher (p<0,001) expression of mem-ory cells (CD4+45RO+) and they had statistically significant higher (p<0,001)index CD4/CD8). Expression of CD4+45RO+ cells increased after 9 monthsand was still increased after 24 months after therapy initiation. Compared tocontrols expression of CD4+45RA+ cells didn't differed and it didn't show anysignificant fluctuations during therapy. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that after 24 months of INF 1a therapy there are no normalisation of CD8 and CD4+45RO+ cells disturbances in MS patients.

LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF CSF EXPANDED CD8+ CLONOTYPES INTHE PERIPHERAL BLOOD OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Cepok S, Zhou D, Vogel F, Sommer N, Hemmer B Department of Neurology, University of Marburg, Marburg, Hesse, Germany Background: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although the aetiology of MS is stillunknown, it is widely believed that T cells play a central role in its pathogene-sis. Recent studies demonstrated oligoclonal expansion of CD8+ T cells in MSlesions and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. Objectives: To identify and follow disease associated CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients. To correlate their frequency in the peripheral blood with clinical disease parameters. Methods: We determined clonal expansion on CD8+ CSF T cells in 6 patients. Blood samples of these patients were analyzed for T-cell receptor V-beta chainexpression on CD8+ memory T cells monthly over a period of at least 1 year.Quantitative rtPCR was performed to follow CD8+ CSF clonotypes in theblood of three patients over time. All patients were monitored for clinical dis-ease activity.Results: Using flow cytometry for T-cell receptor V-beta chain expression and clone-specific rtPCR we demonstrate the occurrence and persistence of theCNS expanded clonotypes in the peripheral blood of several patients. CSFaccumulated T cells were found at higher frequency in the peripheral bloodduring and after acute relapses. Conclusions: Our findings support the role of CD8+ T cells in the pathogene- sis of MS and favour the idea of an ongoing immune response in the peripherallymphoid system of MS patients. Further studies are aimed to (a) address theantigen specificity of the clonotypes and (b) correlate the clonotype frequencyin the peripheral blood with disease activity in a larger group of patients.

P92 THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF PEROXYNITRITE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OFCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFLAMMATION: Scott GS Microbiology and Immunology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA Background: Lesions in the CNS tissues of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and animals with either experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)or neurotrophic virus-induced CNS inflammation often contain evidence ofperoxynitrite formation. In these diverse animal models of neuroinflammation,inactivation of peroxynitrite-decomposition radicals with urate inhibits notonly peroxynitrite-mediated damage but also inflammatory cell accumulationin CNS tissues. This is especially noteworthy as MS patients generally haveserum urate levels that are lower than normal.Objectives: The aim of this study is to use urate as a probe to elucidate perox- ynitrite-dependent effects on processes that facilitate inflammatory cell inva-sion into the CNS.Methods: The effects of urate treatment on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, adhesion molecule and proinflammatory cytokine expression in theCNS tissues of mice with EAE were assessed as changes in these parametershave been associated with CNS inflammation.Results: Urate treatment prior to the onset of CNS inflammation inhibited BBB permeability changes as well as the upregulation of ICAM-1 and TNF- expression in CNS tissues. The therapeutic effects of similar treatment of ani- mals with ongoing EAE were also associated with restoration of BBB integrity.In no case were inhibitory effects on peripheral immune functions, includingthe activation of monocytes to produce peroxynitrite, detected.Conclusions: Invasion of inflammatory cells from the periphery into CNS tis- sues is promoted by peroxynitrite-dependent changes in BBB permeabilityPosters S50 Multiple Sclerosismediated, at least in part, by matrix metalloproteinase activity. Other processes central to CNS inflammation, such as ICAM-1 upregulation and TNF- expression in CNS tissues, are evidently dependent on these initial peroxyni- trite-dependent and urate sensitive permeability changes. The likelihood thatsimilar mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of MS is Supported byrecent evidence that serum urate levels in relapsing-remitting MS patients areinversely correlated with disease activity and BBB dysfunction. This suggeststhat elevation of urate levels in MS patients may have therapeutic benefit. Disclosure: D Hooper has nothing to disclose.

P93 T-CELL REACTIVITY IN proliferative responses of T lymphocytes in whole blood is a simple, reproducible and widely used assay of immune competence.Evidence suggests a role of T-cell reactivity in several infectious and autoim-mune diseases.Objectives: We aimed to compare proliferative T-cell responses in the differ- ent clinical subgroups of MS. In addition, it was assessed whether this assaycould serve as a predictor of clinical responsiveness to immunomodulatorytherapy with Beta-interferon(IFN).Methods: Proliferative responses of T lymphocytes were measured in whole blood of 189 MS patients (65 RR, 70 SP and 54 PPMS) and 249 healthy con-trols (HC). Forty-eight relapse-onset and number of relapses and steroid interventions in 2years before initiation of treatment compared to 2 years under treatment,patients were classified as either clinical responder or non-responder to IFN. Results: T-cell proliferation in samples from both relapse-onset and PPMS patients was increased compared to HC. Furthermore, the proliferativeresponse of whole blood T lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), cor-rectly predicted 83% of the clinical responders and non-reponders to IFN. Conclusions: Compared to HC, MS patients show increased peripheral blood T-cell reactivity. The level of T-cell proliferation was related to the likelihoodof a favorable response to IFN. If these findings are confirmed, baseline prolif-erative T-cell responses to PHA stimulation have the potential to become aclinically useful prognostic marker for responsiveness to IFN therapy in MS.

P94 INTERFERON- LEADS TO STABILIZATION OF THE BARRIER FUNCTION IN BOVINE, MURINE AND HUMAN BRAIN CAPILLARY ENDOTHELIAL CELLS IN VITRO Kraus Ja,b, Ling AKa, Hamm Kim KSc, Voigt Kb, Oschmann Pb, Engelhardt Bd Hesse, Germany;bNeuology, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Hesse, Germany;cInfectious Diseases, John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA;dVascular Biology, Max-Planck Institute, Muenster, Westfalia, Germany Background: BBB breakdown event in the pathogenesis of inflam- matory CNS diseases like MS or its animal model EAE. Besides clinical bene-fits, serial MRI scans from interferon- (IFN- ) treated MS patients show a reduction of Gadolinium-enhancing lesions. This indicates an IFN- associated stabilization of the BBB in these patients. Objectives: To test the influence of IFN- on the paracellular permeability in anin vitro BBB model. Methods: We applied BBB consisting of bovine brain cap- illary endothelial cells (BBCEC) and rat astrocytes. In this model, we investi- gated the influence of human recombinant IFN- on the paracellular perme- ability for 3H-inulin and 14C-sucrose in different conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the paracellular permeability for 3H-inulin and 14C-sucrose in [b.End BBB co-culture of BBCEC and astrocytes leads to the induction of a barrier, whereas removal of astrocytes results in a break- down of this permeability barrier function. However, addition of IFN- to the in vitro BBB model maintains the barrier even in the absence of astrocytes. In the HBMEC and b.End 5 systems, pre-incubation with IFN- significantly amelio- rated the increase in the paracellular permeability after histamine challenge. Conclusions: In our in vitro BBB model, application of IFN- prevents the breakdown of the permeability barrier. However, the molecular mechanisms of IFN- induced BBB stabilization remain to be investigated. Disclosure: J Kraus has nothing to disclose. P95 FINE SPECIFICITY OF ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO MYELIN SEQUENCES IN ASSOCIATION WITH HLA CLASS II ALLELES IN THE SERUM OFBRAZILIAN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Carvalho Ac, Liem AMa, Sant'Anna Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;bNeurology, Universidade do Rio de Janeiro;cDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the human central nervous system characterized by demyelination and pro-nounced B-cell responses to myelin components MBP and proteolipid(PLP). Susceptibility to MS is associated with class II allele expressionthat confers preferential binding to specific immunodominant myelin epi-topes.Objectives: IgA and IgG antibodies epitopes associ- ated to HLA class II alleles.Methods: We determined by ELISA, the levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to myelin epitopes was included 34 patients with clinically definite MS and 59 age-matchedhealthy individuals. Genomic analysis was performed by amplification ofDNA isolated from peripheral leukocytes using PCR followed by SSOPhybridization.Results: MS patients showed strong (p< 0.001) association with DQA1*0102 and DQB1*0602. Regardless stage of the disease MS patientsshowed a marked specific oligoclonal IgG production to MBP and PLP frag-ments. Yet, higher IgA levels was observed for MBP 86-98 sequence withpromiscuous overlapping 20 aminoacids which encompass the framerecognized by DR molecules *1501,*0401,*0301 and PLP 95-116 withDRB1*1501.Conclusions: Since MS patients showed low frequency of DRB1*1501 and DRB1*1503 expression, the results suggest that epitope specificity of B cellresponse to MBP and PLP in this MS population may be influenced by immunerecognition associated to DRB1*0401, DRB1*0301 in association withDQB1*0602 and DQA1*0102.

The expansion of autoreactive T cells targeting theCNS is essential element in inflammatory demyelinisation.The disease is prima-rily mediated by T cells that secrete the inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IFN-greferred as Thl cells. The therapies which decrease T cells producing IFN-g orincrease IL-4 production would be expected to have an ameliorating effect on MS.Objectives: Corticoids and immunosuppression remain the main therapy of MS. More subtle strategies of immunomodulation such as the use of interferon-b (IFN-b) and glatirameracetate in the treatment of MS are well accepted.Methods: In order to better understand the mechanism of action of IFN-b and glatirameracetate 14 MS patients treated with these drugs were studied. Thenumber of CD3, CD4, CD8, secretion patterns of IFN-g and IL-4 examined beforestarting the therapy and in month 1,3,6 and 12.Results: We did not find any significant changes in the number of T, B and NK cells. IFN-g secretion after the treatment both with IFN-b glatirameracetatewas reduced. IFN-g secreting cells and decline kinetics fluctuated a lot amongpatients. No change in the frequency of IL-4 secreting cells was seen.The highnumber of IFN-g producing cells accompanied with slight decline during the ther-apy was observed in patients with high number of memory CD4CD45RO cells.Conclusions: The study demonstrates that both IFN-b and glatirameracetate can induce variations in cytokine secretion levels and it also stresses the roleplayed by TH1 cells in the ethiopathogenesis of MS.

P97 A ROLE FOR CD1C IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Lyons Ja, Yeager Ma, Luecking La, Wang Qa, Porcelli Sb, Trotter Ja aNeurology, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA;bMicrobiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA Background: CD1 expression by antigen presenting cells has been recognized for years. Recent data has demonstrated CD1 molecules are capable of present-ing lipid antigens to T cells. Autoreactive T cells specific for CNS myelin arethought to mediate MS pathology, and CNS myelin 70% lipid. Objectives: The role of CD1, CD1c, in relapsing/remitting MS (RRMS) was investigated. The phenotype of CD1c-expressing cells isolatedfrom the peripheral blood over the course of RRMS was characterized andcompared to healthy controls. Also investigated was the CD1-restrictedresponse to myelin lipids of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) iso-lated from MS patients and healthy controls.Methods: Heparinized whole blood was collected by venipuncture. PBMC were isoloated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. When necessary,monocytes/macrophages and T cells were purified from gradient-purified cellsby magnetic cell separation. The phenotype of CD1c-expressing cells by flow cytometry. The lymphocyte response to myelin lipidswas characterized by ELISA, ELISpot, and proliferation assays.Results: Flow cytometry of PBMC revealed changes in the phenotype of CD1c-expressing cells during RRMS. In patients experiencing a clinicalrelapse, a decrease in CD1c+ CD19+ B cells as compared to normal controlsand stable MS patients was observed. This was accompanied by a relativeincrease in CD1c+ CD4+ cells. Flow cytometry revealed and normal controls revealed myelin lipid-reactive T cells inboth populations, with a higher precursor frequency detected in MS patients. Assays performed with CD1-transfected HeLa cells demonstrated that at least aportion of this response was restricted to CD1 molecules. Conclusions: CD1-mediated presentation of myelin lipids may be important to MS pathology. Disclosure: J Lyons has nothing to disclose.

MOLECULAR TRACKING OF MYELIN BASIC PROTEIN - SPECIFIC T CELLEXPANSION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Muraro PA, Wandinger K, Bielekova B, McFarland HF, Martin R Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA Background: Current evidence suggests that T cell responses to myelin anti- gens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) may be important in the pathogenesisof MS. However, the kinetics of frequency of MBP-specific T cell clones dur-ing the course of disease, particularly during clinical exacerbations, is stillpoorly understood.Objectives: Our goal was to track candidate pathogenic MBP-specific T cell clones in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and assess a potential relation-ship of their frequency with the course of disease.Methods: We developed a highly specific and sensitive technique to meas- ure the frequency of single T cell clones by real-time PCR quantification of clonal T cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 transcripts. We used this novel methodto track in a patient with MS a CD4+ T helper 1 clone, P2-10, clonal frequency in PBMC obtained beforeand during a clinical trial with an altered peptide ligand of MBP(83-99).As controls, we tracked the frequency of other antigen-specific T cellclones in PBMC from a healthy donor and from patients with other neuro-logical disorders.Results: The frequency of T cell clone P2-10 in PBMC increased 5-fold com- pared to baseline at one week before the clinical onset of a severe exacerbation,reaching an absolute frequency of 1 cell in ~1,800 PBMC. Clonal frequencyhad already decreased at baseline levels on the day of onset of new clinicalsymptoms, when brain MRI showed a sharp increase in the number of contrast-enhancing lesions. In contrast, tracking of control T cell clones in peripheralblood from a healthy subject and from a patient with HAM/TSP showed verystable clonal frequencies over time.Conclusions: The dynamics of frequency of an autoreactive Th1 clone in a clinical relapse of MS closely resembled the kinetics of encephalitogenicT cells in animal models, that reach their highest frequency before theonset of disease and rapidly decrease in the peripheral compartments fol-lowing massive migration into the CNS. These data suggest that signifi-cant increases of the frequency of autoreactive effector T cells in MSmight be only detectable during a short period of time preceding clinicalexacerbations.

P99 NITRIC OXIDE AS AN ACTIVITY MARKER IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS School of Medicine, \u00b4Yzmir, \u00b4Yzmir, Turkey Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease which is the most common cause of morbidity in young adults. Toxic damage on myelin,Posters S52 Multiple Sclerosisoligodendroglia and axon is a result of increased concentration of cytokines, chemokines as well as nitric oxide (NO). Although NO is an important media-tor/messenger molecule of immune system which acts neuroprotective underphysiologic conditions, when secreted in high amounts in autoimmune diseasesNO acts as a neurotoxic molecule. There are several studies reporting that NOmetabolites are produced in high amounts in cerebrospinal fluid during relapseof MS opatients.Objectives: In this study we aimed to investigate if NO metabolites are mark- ers of disease activity and whether they are correlated with active lesion exis-tence in cranial magnetic resonanve imaging (MRI) and increased immunglob-ulin (Ig) G index.Methods: Twenty-four (15 female, 9 male) definite MS patients and 18 (10 female, 8 male) healthy control subjects were included in the study.serum andCSF samples were obtained from MS patients during relapse and remissionwithout receiving any kind of treatment following cranial MRI with triple dosegadolinium. Griess reaction which is a spectrophotometric method was used for nitrite and nitrate measurements. Results: Nitrite and nitrate nitrate levels during relapse period were very signifi- cantly higher than remission period and also healthy subjects (p=0,000).Therewas no significant difference in serum NNLs between relapse and remission.As a result nitrite and nitrate measurement test is a highly specific (94 %)marker of the disease, however it's sensitivity is mild (62,5 %). IncreasedNNLs are also significantly correlated with active lesion existence in cranialMRI and increased IgG index (p<0,05). Disclosure: S \u00d6zakbas has nothing to disclose. P100 LONGITUDINAL CYTOKINE RESPONSES TO MYELIN PEPTIDES IN MS: PERSISTENCE AND SPREADING OF IMMUNE RESPONSES Pelfrey CM, Moldovan IR, Cotleur AC, Born SE, Karafa M, Lee J, Fisher E, Rudick RA Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Background: Myelin-specific immune responses can be found in both MS patients and healthy controls. Consequently, the relevance of these immuneresponses to MS disease progression is not clear. Few studies have examinedwhich features of the immune response to myelin relate specifically to MS dis-ease progression over time. Objectives: To examine longitudinal cytokine responses to myelin antigens in MS patients and healthy controls in order to understand the role of persistenceand spreading of immune responses in disease progression. Methods: We performed a 1 yr longitudinal study measuring cytokine responses every 3 mo in 20 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 27 age/gender matched controls. We determined ex-vivo IFN- and IL-10 production by PBMC in response to 9-mer overlapping peptides that span the entire PLP and MBP molecules. At each time-point, we obtained the number and location of epitopes that induced cytokine responses, the magnitude of the response, and if there was preferential induction of IFN- or IL-10. We examined possible cor- relations between cytokine expression patterns and clinical/MRI parameters. Results: At baseline, MS patients had significantly higher PLP-induced IL-10 responses and MBP-induced IFN responses, compared with controls (p = 0.019 and 0.02, respectively). MS patients showed a significant negative corre- lation between both PLP- and MBP-IFN responses and clinical disability (as measured by the MS Functional Composite, MSFC)(p = 0.01 and p = 0.004, respectively). No correlation was observed in controls. HLA DR17(DRB1*0301) expression was associated with significantly elevated MBP- andPLP-induced cytokine secretion. Persistent PLP responses (present with MS-associated HLA alleles DR4,DR15, and DR17. Conclusions: Our results suggest that clinical disability correlates with IFN responses. For certain myelin antigens/cytokines, we can observe significantdifferences between MS patients and Controls using the ELISPOT assay. These findings suggest that persistent cytokine responses to the same myelinepitopes over time may distinguish MS patients' responses from controls. Thisis a ongoing study that will include several more longitudinal time-points withcorresponding clinical and MRI data. Disclosure: C Pelfrey has nothing to disclose.

No clear correlation with markers of inflammation or MRI lesionshas yet been established.Objectives: We hypothesized that relationships between fatigue, inflamma- tion or MRI disease activity would be most apparant at onset of disease, andstudied these variables in a series of patients with clinically isolated optic neu-ritis (ON). Methods: We studied 40 patients with ON, 25 patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and 20 healthy controls. Fatigue was measuredby the fatigue severity scale FSS, and a FSS score of 5 or more was con-sidered abnormal. ON patients underwent lumbar puncture and MRI stud-ies. MRI studies comprised T2-weighed sequenses and T1-weighedsequenses before and after the administration of Gd-DTPA. T cell activa-tion in blood and CSF was measured by studying T cells expression 5 or more were observed in 40% of patients with ON (n=40), 68% of patients with SPMS and 0% of healthy controls (n=20:p<0,001 compared to ON and SPMS). FSS scores did not differ significantly inON and SPMS. In ON there was no correlation between FSS scores and thenumber of lesions on T2-weighed MRI or the number of Gd-enhancinglesions. Neither did FSS scores correlate with the CSF leukocyte count, TheIgG index of T cell activation on CSF or blood as assessed by flow cytometrystudies.Conclusions: Fatigue is signifikantly more frequent in patients presenting with ON than in healthy controls and is not signifikantly less common than inpatients with SPMS. However even in this patient group we found no evidenceof an assotiation between fatigue, inflammation or even the precence of MRIlesions in patients with ON.

The commitment of T lymphocytes to die is partly regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins, which actas a checkpoint upstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. These proteinsinclude the death antagonists Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and death agonists Bax andBad. Recent studies suggest that altered expression of Bcl-2 family proteins inT lymphocytes is involved in promoting cellular resistance to apoptosis inpatients with MS.Objectives: In this study we examined the relationship between alterations in Bcl-2 family proteins expression and clinical disease activity in patientswith MS.Methods: We analyzed the expression ratios of pro-apoptosis (Bax and Bad) to anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) proteins in peripheral T cells from patientswith clinically active MS and compared the results with corresponding ratios inpatients with stable MS and relevant control groups. Results: We observed a significant reduction in the expression ratios of pro- to anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 members in peripheral lymphocytes from patients with active MS when compared to corresponding ratios in patients with stable MS or other controls. This imbalance in the cellular expression ratios of pro- and anti-apoptosis proteins was functionally active in reducing cellular susceptibility toapoptosis in active MS. It also correlated with clinical features of disease activ-ity, such as the number of gadolinium enhancing MRI lesions and clinicalrelapses.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that dysregulated expression of Bcl-2 fam- ily proteins in peripheral lymphocytes is a feature of clinically active multiplesclerosis.

However, the mecha-nisms that regulate lymphocyte activity in MS are poorly understood. In nor-mal circumstances, programmed cell death (apoptosis) contributes to the main-tenance of lymphocytes homeostasis and the deletion of autoreactive cells.Cellular commitment to apoptosis is partly regulated by the cell death receptorFas, and the anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and FLIP. Objectives: Although there is emerging evidence that dysregulations of apop- totic pathways play a role in T cell autoimmunity in MS, the expression ofapoptosis- regulatory proteins in B cells from MS patients is largely unknown.In this study, we sought to examine the expression of several apoptosis regula-tory proteins in peripheral B lymphocytes from patients with MS.Methods: In this study, we used a combination of dot-blot immunoassays and Western blotting to analyze the expression profiles of Fas, Bcl-2, and FLIP pro-teins in peripheral B lymphocytes from patients with relapsing remitting andprogressive MS, and from appropriate controls.Results: We observed a significant upregulation of Bcl-2 and FLIP pro- teins in B cells from relapsing remitting MS when compared to correspon-ding expression in progressive MS, or in non-inflammatory neurologiccontrols and healthy individuals. This cellular overexpression of Bcl-2 andFLIP proteins was not affected by treatment with interferon-b, but wasalso observed in B cells from patients with systemic inflammatory dis-eases. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cellular overexpression of the apoptosis-inhibitory proteins in patients with relapsing MS may promoteapoptotic resistance of potentially pathogenic, autoreactive B lympho-cytes and consequently, may allow for continuing autoimmune Sharief has received Neuroimmunology, GKT School of Medicine, London, UK, United Kingdom;bNeurology Dept, St Thomas Hospital Background: eatment with interferon beta reduces clinical exacerbations in MS through several immunomodulatory mechanisms that involve the augmen-tation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) of peripheral T lymphocytes. Theexpression of survivin, a antiapoptosis protein, is up-regu-lated in mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes from patients with MS, and thisexpression correlates with MS disease activity.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of interferon beta on the expression of sur- vivin and other apoptosis regulatory molecules in peripheral T lymphocytesfrom patients with MS.Methods: In a prospective, clinical and immunologic study, we evaluated the expression of survivin, Bcl-2 protein, and the death receptor Fas in mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes from 26 patients with MS, before and serially aftertreatment with interferon beta-1a. We also investigated the long-term effects ofinterferon beta-1a on cellular expression of these proteins and T-lymphocyteapoptosis in a cross-sectional study of 19 patients with MS receiving long-terminterferon beta-1a therapy.Results: Treatment with interferon beta-1a reduced the expression of survivin in in vitro stimulated T lymphocytes. This reduced expression correlated withaugmented T-cell susceptibility to apoptosis and with clinical response to treat-ment. In contrast, interferon beta-1a therapy did not alter cellular expression ofBcl-2 protein Fas. This down-regulatory effect of interferon beta-1a on cellularexpression of survivin was maintained after long-term therapy.Conclusions: Our observations suggest that interferon beta exerts a regulatory effect on peripheral T lymphocytes through an antiapoptosis mechanism thatinvolves the down-regulation P105 CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR EXPRESSION ON CEREBROSPINAL FLUID T- CELLS IN PATIENTS WITH RELAPSING REMITTING Background: There is accumulating evidence that chemokines are important in trafficking, retention and activation of T-cells in active multiple sclerosis(MS) lesions. In immunohistochemical studies of autopsy brain sections con- taining active MS lesions CXCR3- and interferon- inducible protein 10- (IP- 10) positive cells were found in the perivascular space around nearly all inflamed vessels within MS lesions. Objectives: To evaluate the chemokine CXCR3 expression on T-cells and lev- els of its ligand IP-10 in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients withrelapsing remitting MS (RR-MS) in association with magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI) disease activity.Methods: 22 newly diagnosed definite RR-MS patients underwent Gd- enhanced-MRI examinations and diagnostic lumbar puncture in a short timeinterval, ranging from 1-24 hours. Chemokine expression was measured by flow cytometry and levels of IP-10 were determined by ELISA. Results: IP-10 was strong intrathecally released, but did not change in association with MRI activity. CXCR3 positive T-cells were enriched in the CSF comparedwith peripheral blood and more than 75% of T-cells in the CSF expressed CXCR3receptor (p<0,0001). CXCR3 expression was lower in the peripheral blood ofRR-MS patients compared to healthy controls (p<0,005) and was increased in theCSF of RR-MS patients undergoing acute attacks, as illustrated by Gd-enhancinglesions on MRI, compared to patients without enhancing lesions (p<0,005).Conclusions: Our results suggest that MRI documented disease activity is associated with an increase of CXCR3 positive T-cells in the CSF of patientsPosters S54 Multiple Sclerosiswith RR-MS, possibly due to the migration of activated T-cells from the circu- lation into the CSF.

Sophie Ga, Christian Sa, Myriam Sb, Thierry Dc, Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland Background: In a previous study, we reported a similar frequency in the occurrence of either CSF-specific oligoclonal free kappa or CSF-specificoligoclonal IgG (92%) in a group of 48 MS patients. In the present work, wespecifically studied the presence of CSF free kappa bands in a group of 33 clin-ically suspected MS patients with no or only a single IgG band. CSF data werecompared with the clinical characteristics and MRI scans.Objectives: Relevance of free kappa chains in CSF. Methods: Oligoclonal IgG and free kappa bands were determined by an immunoaffinity blot technique (1). Brain MRI was performed within one month after lumbar puncture in all patients ; spinal cord MRI was done only incase of a relevant clinical picture. Positive MRI for MS fulfilled the criteria ofBarkhof et al (2) and Tintore et al (3). MS suggestive MRI displayed 2 or morelesions consistent with MS, either in the brain or in the spinal cord.Results: Oligoclonal free kappa bands were observed in 18 cases out 33 (55%), especially in patients with motor dysfunction (5/6, 83%), optic neuritis (7/11,64%) and sensory impairment (3/7, 43%). Positive MRI was found in 6 cases,all with oligoclonal free kappa bands. The latter were present in 7/11 (64%)patients with MS suggestive MRI, but only in 5/16 (31%) of patients with nor-mal or aspecific MRI.Conclusions: CSF oligoclonal free kappa bands can be substituted for CSF oligoclonal IgG when the latter are not detectable.

Wiendl Ha, Neuhaus Mehling Ma, inducible CD28-related costimulatory molecule with relevance for T cell differentiation and effector function and a possible role inautoimmune diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Objectives: To characterize the expression and functional relevance of ICOS in healthy donors and patients with MS.Methods: FACS staining, proliferation assays, real time PCR, ICOS was preferen- tially expressed on CD4+ Th2 T cells. Blocking experiments with antigen-spe-cific T cell lines as well as SAg-stimulated CD4 T cells demonstrated thatICOS-costimulation affected the production of both Th1 and Th2 cytokineswhereas T cell proliferation, expression of T cell activation markers or chemokine receptor expression were unaffected. Interestingly, the effects oncytokine secretion were observed in the absence or inducible ICOSexpression on human T cell subsets from peripheral blood were quantified inhealthy donors (n=16) and MS patients (n=10). Constitutive expression ofICOS varied between 0.12 and 12.35%. No significant differences were notedbetween both groups concerning the constitutive expression or inducibility ofICOS on T cells. Cells constitutively expressing ICOS did not represent theCD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cell subset. ICOS expression on CSF T lympho-cytes in patients with acute MS relapses or acute neuroborreliosis showed thatthe frequency of ICOS-positive cells was not elevated compared with periph- eral blood. Whereas neither IFN- nor glatiramer acetate altered baseline expression of ICOS on T cells, antiinflammatory cytokines such as Th1 and Th2 cytokine production in the presence and absence of B7-costimulation. SinceICOS is rapidly induced on T cells after antigen-specific stimulation, this mol-ecule qualifies as a suitable target aimed at specifically modulating T cellcytokine responses in CNS inflammation.

P108 MODULATION OF ACTIVITY MOG-INDUCED QYNAD, Demyelination and inflammation both contribute to the neuro- logical deficits characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although conductiondeficits attributable to inflammatory demyelination are well known, solublefactors may also contribute to neurological dysfunction. QYNAD is a pen-tapeptide detected in the CSF of patients with MS that has been proposed toinfluence symptomatic changes or the disease course in MS by putative block-ade of sodium channel action. Objectives: To further clarify the potential relevance of QYNAD for MS, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo properties of this pentapeptide. Methods: We performed experiments in 1) acutely isolated thalamic neurons and 2) in a model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-inducedexperimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Results: QYNAD blocks sodium channels in acutely isolated neurons by shifting their steady-state inactivation to more negative potentials.QYNAD putatively acts via direct action at the sodium channel as demon-strated by confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluorescently labeled,bioactive QYNAD together with a type II sodium channel specific anti-body. We explored the influcence of QYNAD in MOG-induced rats. QYNAD itself was not encephalitogenic. QYNAD nei-ther altered the onset of disease nor disease severity when given repeatedly(qid) from day 0 to 15 after MOG immunization. Furthermore QYNAD didnot influence the severity or frequency of relapses when given after dis-ease onset.Conclusions: QYNAD specifically blocks neuronal sodium channel action with a limiting concentration at 10 microM. Taking into consideration published valueson CSF QYNAD concentrations in MS (9 to 34 microM), our in vitro and in vivoexperiments make a correlation of QYNAD concentrations with the clinical statusunlikely. Although QYNAD might still be a contributing factor causing rapidlywaxing and waning symptoms in MS, a role for permanent axonal damage andthus relevance for overall disease severity in MS is not Supported by this work.

ALA treated and suppressed EAE in SJL mice by inhibition of T cell trafficking into the CNS and directly inhibited matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity (manuscript submitted). As MMP-9 facilitates T lymphocyte transmigration across the subendothelial basement membrane, its inhibition may be especially relevant to the therapeutic benefitof ALA.Objectives: To elucidate the mechanism of action of ALA in suppressing EAE. Methods: SJL mice were immunized with PLP 139-151 peptide in CFA and given daily injections of ALA, DHLA or S,S'-dimethyl lipoic acid (Me 2LA) commencing on day 7 to suppress EAE. Supernatants were collected from PLP-specific T cells after 48 hours in culture with ALA, DHLA or Me 2LA (10- 1000 \u00b5g/ml). Zymographic analyses were performed in the presence of ALA, DHLA or Me 2LA (10-1000 \u00b5g/ml) in buffer or buffer alone. Results: The mean maximum EAE score and mean 10-day CDS after suppres- sion with ALA and DHLA were reduced significantly ( p=0.01 and 0.02, respectively) below those of saline, while Me 2LA did not suppress EAE. Zymographic analyses revealed direct, dose dependent suppression of MMP-9 activity by ALA and DHLA (up to 99%), while Me 2LA did not. DHLA was more potent than ALA in directly inhibiting MMP-9. ALA and DHLA, but not Me 2LA, inhibited the production of MMP-9 in vitro by up to 94%, in a dose dependent fashion, suggesting that ALA and DHLA can indirectly suppress T cell production of MMP-9. Conclusions: DHLA is a more potent inhibitor of MMP-9 than ALA, but has an equal ability to suppress EAE. Since ALA is rapidly reduced to DHLA invivo, these data suggest that DHLA is the therapeutically active molecule invivo. Me 2LA, unlike DHLA, lacks free sulfhydryl groups and did not inhibit EAE or MMP-9, suggesting that DHLA functions by reducing MMP-9. ALA and DHLA are capable of indirectly inhibiting T cell production of MMP-9, perhaps by inhibiting activation of nuclear transcription factor NF- B. ALA and DHLA appear to suppress EAE through direct and indirect inhibition of MMP-9 activity. Disclosure: G Marracci has nothing to disclose. Funding: Supported by NIH grant (P50AT00066).

P110 NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF GLATIRAMER ACETATE AUTOIMMUNEENCEPHALOMYELITIS Panet Ha, Medical Research Center, Tel Aviv University, Petah Tikva,Israel;bNeurology, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel Background: The accumulated experience with glatiramer acetate (GA) (COP- 1) confirms its efficacy in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.Although the immune response to GA has been intensively examined, its possi- ble effects on the axonal damage in animal models has not yet been investigated.Objectives: To study whether treatment with GA provides a beneficial effect on central neuronal damage in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(EAE) induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG).Methods: (12.5 mg/kg x2) and GA (25 mg/kg x2 s.c.), on days 1 and 8. CNS tissue sec-tions were examined for integrity of axons by silver and Luxol precursor protein (APP),were used to examine axonal damage.Results: MOG-treated mice developed significant clinical manifestations with complete hind limb paralysis while the GA-treated mice showed only very mildand delayed clinical signs (clinical score 4.1+/-0.4 vs. 0.3+/- 0.1, p<0.001). Thebeneficial effect in GA-treated animals was maintained until sacrifice at 50 daysfollowing MOG injection. Multifocal areas of perivascular lymphohistiocyticinflammation with loss of myelin were shown in the control mice, while only rearareas of focal inflammation were demonstrated in the GA-treated mice. Massiveaxonal loss and damage was found in controls, while in GA-treated mice therewas only minimal damage. Moreover APP and SMI-32 immunostaining in spinalcord sections, analyzed by image-j software, indicates for high axonal injury inthe control mice as compared to undamaged axons in GA-treated mice.Conclusions: Our study suggests that GA may provide neuroprotective effects attenuating the induced axonal damage in a chronic EAE model.

Recent evidences suggest that downregulation of FucT activity may represent an attractive target for ther- apeutic intervention aimed at blockade of chronic inflammatory diseases.Objectives: The goal of this study was to determine the effect of different FucT deficiency on lymphocyte recruitment in brain venules and on induc-tion of EAE.Methods: FucT-deficient mice (FucT-/-) for FucT-IV, FucT-VII and double deficient mice for FucT-IV FucT-VII were generated on C57Bl/6 genetic back-ground. Intravital microscopy studies were performed in inflamed brain vessels.EAE was induced in wt or FucTs deficient by using MOG35-55 peptide.Results: Th1 lymphocytes produced from FucT-IV-/- mice efficiently tethered and rolled in brain postcapillary venules when compared with cells isolated from wtmice. In contrast, primary adhesion of Th1 lymphocytes obtained from FucT-VII-/- or Fuc-VII-/- & FucT-IV-/- mice was drastically reduced, suggesting that FucT-VII is critical for the recruitment of Th1 cells in brain microcirculation. The onsetof actively-induced EAE in Fuc-VII-/-, but not FucT-IV-/-, mice was delayed. Dis-ease was significantly inhibited in Fuc-VII-/- & FucT-IV-/- mice when comparedwith wt mice. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed interesting differences in thecomposition of the inflammatory infiltrates between wt mice and FucT-/- mice.Conclusions: Our data unveil a critical role for FucT-VII in the recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes in brain venules, and suggest that FucT-VII together FucT-IV play a significant role in the pathogenesis of EAE.

Members of the NF- B family are transcrip- tion factors involved in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) genes, that are closely related to the extravasa-tion of immune cells and tissue destruction during EAE. Rolipram (a type IVphosphodiesterase inhibitor) amielorates EAE by inducing a delay in the entryof inflammatory cells into the CNS, but the precise mechanisms of this drugremain elusive. Objectives: To investigate the expression of MMP-9 and the in vivo regulation of NF- B activation after treatment of EAE with rolipram. To determine if rolipram can modulate NF- B-driven promoter activity and MMP-9 enzymatic activity. Methods: Lewis rats were immunized with guinea pig myelin basic protein, and treated daily with rolipram. MMP-9 gene expression was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The activation of NF- B was assessed by elec- trophoretic mobility supershift assay in cells from the lymph nodes (LNC) upon anti-CD3 engagement. Jurkat cells were transfected with the B-pGL3- prom plasmid, which contains the NF- B binding site of the MMP-9 gene, stimulated with PMA in the presence of rolipram and the transcriptional activ- ity was assessed by luciferase activity. MMP-9 activity assayed by cells.Results: In rolipram the expression, in LNCs and CNS, and impairs the nuclear translocation of NF- B in lymphocytes from EAE rats. PDE-IV inhibition decreases promoter activity in a construct con- taining the NF- B binding sequence of the MMP-9 gene and reduces IL-2 induced MMP-9 enzymatic activity in rat lymphocytes. Conclusions: Rolipram may be an interesting agent to be used in combination with IFN- with the purpose of better controlling the production of MMP-9, as its action on the promoter region of that gene involves a nuclear factor different from that of IFN- Disclosure: A S\u00e1nchez has nothing to disclose.

P113 DISEASE SIGNS IN GENE KNOCKOUT MODELS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSISDIRECTLY CORRELATE WITH BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER PERMEABILITY Scott GS, Brimer CM, Kean RB, Hooper D Microbiology and Immunology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA Background: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. However, a breakdown of the normal function of the BBBhas been demonstrated in multiple sclerosis and its animal correlate, experi-mental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). This would not only enhance factorexchange between the blood and the CNS, but could facilitate inflammatorycell infiltration into CNS tissues. Objectives: The present study uses knockout mice lacking a variety of genes relevant to immune function to examine the relationship between BBB break-down and the evolution of neurological disease signs following immunizationwith myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG).Methods: Groups of mice were immunized MOG and examined for dis- ease signs. BBB permeability was assessed by measuring the uptake of sodiumfluorescein into spinal cord tissue. Results: Mice with targeted disruptions in the genes for IFN- receptors, IFN- receptors, NF- B and iNOS developed neurological signs of EAE whichvaried in incidence, onset and severity between the groups. Nevertheless, all MOG-immunized animals exhibited some degree of increased BBB permeabil-ity and, irrespective of the strain, the extent of BBB permeability directly cor-related with disease signs.Conclusions: Our results indicate that the appearance of clinical signs of EAE is critically dependent on BBB breakdown, regardless of the immunologicalstatus of the animal. BBB breakdown could not only contribute to diseasedevelopment by permitting communication between the circulation and theCNS, but may also induce fluid phase shifts resulting in edema formation andneurological dysfunction.

IL-12 DEPENDENT/ IFN GAMMA INDEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF CCR5 BYMYELIN-REACTIVE CD4+ CORRELATES WITHENCEPHALITOGENICITY Bagaeva La, Williams LPa, Segal BMa,b aNeurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA;bMicrobiology and Immunology, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, New York, USA Background: The administration of neutralizing antibodies against the Th1 polarizing monokine IL-12 protects otherwise susceptible mice from clinicalEAE and the development of inflammatory infiltrates in the central nervous sys-tem (CNS). Paradoxically, mice deficient in the signature Th1 cytokine, IFNgamma, remain highly susceptible to EAE; however disease is also suppressed inthese animals by IL-12 blockade. Collectively these results suggested that IL-12might stimulate myelin-reactive T cells to home to the CNS by an IFN gammaindependent pathway.Objectives: To test our tive T cells to upregulate chemokine receptors that are critical for CNSmigration.Methods: We performed RNAse protection assays to measure the expression of a panel of chemokine receptors by lymph node cells (LN cells) that had beenprimed in vivo with a peptide fragment of proteolipid protein (PLP) emulsifiedin Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) and challenged in vitro with antigeneither in the absence or presence of recombinant IL-12 and/ or a neutralizingantibody against IFN gamma. In parallel experiments we measured the expres-sion of selected chemokines and chemokine receptors in spinal cords from theadoptive transfer recipients of PLP-specific T cells that were treated asdescribed above.Results: PLP/IFA primed LN cells only transfer EAE only following ex vivo challenge with antigen and IL-12. IL-12 directly induces expressionof CCR5, but not CCR1-4 by these PLP-specific T cells. Neu-tralization of IFN gamma CCR5 are upregulated in the spinalcords of mice following the injection of IL-12 stimulated effector cells indirect association with the development of inflammatory demyelinatinglesions.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that IL-12 might promote the encephali- togencity of myelin-reactive T cells by the direct induction ofCCR5.Expression of CCR5 most likely facilitates the homing of autoim-mune effector cells to the CNS since its ligands are expressed in EAElesions.

There is growing evi-dence that while peripheral APCs stimulate immune responses against foreignantigens in the setting of tissue destruction and \"danger\", they actually main-tain tolerance against self antigens under steady state conditions. The activa- tion state of APCs is critical in deciding an outcome of T cell priming versus tolerization.Objectives: To test our hypothesis that tolerance against a candidate myelin autoantigen could be reversed by activation of APCs via CD40 or TLR 9 sig-naling. Methods: Adult of proteolipid protein (PLP) emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant fail to mount lym-phoproliferative or cytokine responses and are protected from EAE upon sub-sequent challenge with the antigen combined with adjuvants. We harvested LNcells from such PLP-tolerized mice and reactivated them ex vivo in the pres-ence of either an T cells the ability to divide, dif- ferentiate along a Th1 lineage and transfer EAE only when reactivated in thepresence of agonistic antibodies against CD40 or CpG oligonucleotides. Theeffects of both anti-CD40 and CpG oligonucleotides are dependent uponinduction of IL-12. In parallel experiments, we found that systemic injectionsof mice with anti-CD40 prevent tolerance induction and increase susceptibilityto EAE.Conclusions: Our findings suggest two mechanisms to explain the well docu- mented association between infectious illnesses and flare ups of multiple scle-rosis. Microbial pathogens could: (i) release molecules that both microbial and auto-antigens to break tolerance. Disclosure: B Segal has nothing to disclose.

We assessed the effect of DNA pre-immunization on subsequent EAEcourse in SJL/J mice, evoked with Both clinical and pathologic measures ofEAE have been applied to assess the course of the disease.Results: The EAE course, in mice pre-immunized with pVaxMOG 4 and 12 weeks prior to EAE induction, was significantly ameliorated. In contrast, inmice pre-immunized with pVaxPLP 4 weeks prior EAE induction, more severe disease was observed and only 12 weeks after DNA vaccination, theEAE course was ameliorated. Prevention of EAE was associated with adecrease in T cell proliferation in response to encephalitogenic peptides andwith diminished Th1-type cytokine response in both groups of DNA pre-immunized mice in comparison to EAE animals pre-immunized with emptyvector (pVax).Conclusions: These results indicate that kinetic of tolerization of EAE with DNA vaccination, involving T cell unresponsiveness, depends on antigenand/or mouse genetic background. In further studies mechanism of differencesin generation of DNA-induced EAE tolerance should be evaluated. Disclosure: A Walczak has nothing to disclose. P117 PROFILES OF MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES (MMPS) IN EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE SIGNIFICANTELEVATION OF MMP-12 Aa, Pennington Hogan Ab, Edwards DRb, Yong VWa aNeuroscience, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada;bBiological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, United Kingdom Background: Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of at least 25 zinc-containing proteolytic enzymes that play an important physiological rolein degradation extracellular matrix (ECM). However, MMPs are also impli- cated pathologically in cancer and inflammatory diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE), several groups have reported increased expressionof specific MMP members (MMP-2, -3, -7, -9 and -19). Nonetheless, anextensive analysis of the involvement of other MMP members has not beenconducted.Objectives: To examine a profile of MMPs and ADAMs (a related metallopro- teinase) during the course of EAE, and to use genetically deficient mice tounderstand the role of a highly expressed MMP.Methods: Female 129/SvEv mice were induced with EAE using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in complete Freunds Adjuvant, producing arelapsing-remitting model of MS. Animals were sacrificed at various stagesof the disease and spinal cord samples were analsyed. Taq-Man PolymeraseChain Reaction (PCR) was used to profile mRNA levels when animals hadhindlimb paralysis, while RNase Protection Assay (RPA) was used to evalu-ate spinal cords over the course of EAE. As a result of the increase in MMP-12 that was observed, MMP-12 null mice were utilized to analyse phenotypiccharacteristics.Results: The Taq-man PCR data displayed an increase in MMP-8 (20 fold), - 10 (20 fold), 14 (2 fold), -19 (5 fold) and TIMP-1 (150 fold); impressively,MMP-12 was elevated 1000 fold in EAE-afflicted mice compared to healthyanimals. RPA further confirmed the dramatic increase of MMP-12 over thecourse of disease. ADAM-10, -15, -17 and -28 were unchanged in EAE versuscontrols.Conclusions: The data demonstrate that specific MMPs, other than previously examined MMP-2, -7 and -9, need to be pursued for their involvement in EAEand MS. In particular, MMP-12 appears to be important over the course ofEAE. EAE experiments in MMP-12 knock out mice are currently underway toexplore the clinical phenotype. These results will lead to the further under-standing of MMPs in EAE and MS and may help to resolve the issue of selec-tive inhibition of particular MMPs.

Va aNeurology, CHU of oligoclonal immunoglobulin G bands restricted to CSF is one of the most consistent laboratory abnormalities for the diagnosisof multiple sclerosis (MS).Objectives: To confirm the diagnostic value of isoelectrofocusing (IEF) in a large cohort and to evaluate the various neurological diseases likely to presentthe same profile.Methods: The cerebrospinal fluid of 1000 patients with neurological was stud- ied by IEF. The infectious diseases without microbiological confirmationand/or not fulfilling the classically definite diagnostic criteria for the variousneurological diagnoses were excluded. After a follow up of 2 to 36 months, 407patients were diagnosed as MS and 593 patients as others neurological diseases.Results: The best sensibility and specificity was obtained with 3 oligoclonal bands. 380 patients had oligoclonal bands including 335 with MS and 50 withothers neurological diseases. Our results showed a sensitivity of 83% and aspecificity of 92%. The positive and negative predictive values were 87 % and90% respectively. Inflammatory and infectious disorders of the central nervoussystem represent the main affections associated with oligoclonal bands in par-ticular Sjogren syndrome, HIV encephalitis and Lyme disease. Conclusions: IEF of the CSF is a reliable method for the diagnosis of MS with both good sensitivity and specificity. CSF is therefore of particular interestespecially after a clinical isolated syndrome. Disclosure: B Amina has nothing to disclose.

When present, they are usually attributed to factors associated withadvanced disease, such as malnutrition or cytotoxic drugs or hereditary factors.However, a combination of MS and neuropathy has been reported. Objectives: To evaluate the combination between MS and peripheral neuropa- thy we studied nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in a group of MS patients andin a group of healthy subjects. Methods: We studied sensory and motor NCV and amplitude in the ulnar, median, tibial, peroneal and sural nerves in one side, right or left, in 20 definiteMS patients diagnosed according to the criteria of Poser Scale and in 15healthy subjects. The total number of studied nerves were 91 in patients groupand 69 in contol group.Results: The most frequent electrophysiologic abnormalities noted in patients group were low amplitudes of the ulnar and sural nerves and slow conductionvelocities of the tibial and sural nerves. Electrophysiologic abnormalities werefound in 15 of 91 nerves examined (16.5%). The neurologic disability was notassociated with the presence of electrophysiologic abnormalities. The electro-physiologic abnormalities in control group subjects were found in 2 of 69nerves examined (2.9%). There were a slight slowness in sural nerve conduc-tion in two healthy subjects. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a high frequency of sensory and motor neuropathy in a selected group of MS.

Bruno Sa,b, Sonia Bc, Julien Ac, Celine Ja, Gilles Ba, Marie-Stephane Pierre Sc, Za, France;cInserm U 109, centre Paul Broca, h\u00f4pital Sainte Anne,, Paris, France Background: Edg-2 is a member of the Edg seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor family, which, to date, contains 8 members (Edg-1-Edg-8).These receptors are mainly involved in bioactive lipids signaling : Edg-1, Edg-3, Edg-5 and Edg-8 have been proposed to act as sphingosine-1-phosphatereceptors, whereas lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been proposed as the lig-and for Edg-2, Edg-4 and Edg-7. Objectives: To assess the expression of Edg receptors in oligodendrocytes, and the biological effects of Edg-2 putative ligand, LPA. Methods: The expression of Edg-2 receptor in oligodendrocytes was studied in vivo and in vitro.Results: We show that both in vitro and in vivo, Edg-2 receptors are not detected during early stages of oligodendroglial development, but areexpressed only in mature oligodendrocytes, shortly before the onset ofmyelination. We also provide evidence that other members of the Edg familyare expressed in oligodendrocytes. Whereas LPAhas been reported to be aligand of Edg-2 receptor in different cell types, it had no effect on either sur-vival, maturation or cytoskeleton organization in oligodendroglial cultures.In myelinating oligodendrocyte-neuron co-cultures, LPA did not influence myelinogenesis. In addition, LPA failed to induce Ca2+ mobilization and had no effect on forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Phosphorylation ofthe ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinases was the only response elicited by LPA inoligodendrocytes.Conclusions: Therefore, in contrast to other cell types, in which LPA exerts pleiotropic effects, Edg-2 positive post-mitotic oligodendrocytes display arestricted responsiveness to LPA. Nevertheless it is so far the only G protein-coupled receptor identified to date whose expression is restricted to matureoligodendrocytes and myelin in the post-natal CNS.

All the patients were evaluated using the following questionnaires: Epworth sleepiness scale, Beck'sdepression scale, Fisk's fatigue impact scale, and general sleep disorderquestionnaire (Montpellier). All patients underwent a standard oxyhemoglobinsaturation). The results of the PSG were compared with those of 14 healthycontrols matched for age.Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in comparison with the controls: longer sleep latency (p=0.016), shorter total sleep time(p=0.0001), lower sleep efficiency index (p=0.001), greater WASO (p=0.008)and greater sleep fragmentation index (p=0.079). We found periodic leg move-ments (PLM) in 48.87% of patients (p=0.019). No evaluable respiratory abnor-malities were observed in these patients. A positive relation is observedbetween the duration of WASO and time of outcome of the disease, regardlessof age. The sleep fragmentation index is the parameter with the greatest corre- lation with the level of depression, according to the Beck scale and the total and social fatigue impact scale. There is a negative relation between the total sleeptime and the degree of disability measured by EDSS. Conclusions: 1. Sleep disorders are underevaluated in patients diagnosed with MS. 2. There exists a relation between the physical factors and thepolysomnography alterations in these patients Disclosure: C de Andres de Frutos has nothing to disclose. P123 ELECTRONYSTAGMOGRAPHY FINDINGS IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS K\u00b4yl\u00b4yn\u00e7M, Can U, Benli S, \u00d6zl\u00fcolu L, Akkuzu University, Ankaran, Turkey Background: Electronystagmography (ENG) records the changes in eye posi- tion indicated by the polarity of the cornea-retinal potential relative to eachelectrode placed beside the eye. Since the vestibular aparatus contributes sig-nificantly to the control of eye movements, these movements can be exploitedto examine the activity of the peripheral vestibular end organs and their centralvestibulo-ocular pathways. Therefore, ENG can be used to reveal small lesionslocated in the brain stem, and cerebellum. Objectives: Our objective was to present and correlate the ENG findings of a group of MS patients with clinical and MRI findings. Methods: Eighteen clinically definite MS patients with or without vertigo were evaluated with neurological and otological examination along with ENGtest battery and contrast enhanced cranial MRI. The ENG test battery includedsaccades, gaze, sinusoidal tracking, optokinetic nystagmus, positional test,Dix-Hallpike maneuver and abnormality was detected by optokinetic stimu- lus, 88.8% of the patients had abnormal or asymmetric optokinetic nystagmus.Sinusoidal tracking was abnormal in 55.5%. Abnormalities werefound in 44.4 %, and calorics in 27.7%. Gaze and positional tests were abnor-mal in 11.1% of the patients. Nystagmus could be elicited in none of the patientswith Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Vertigo was a symptom in 50 % of the patients. Incranial MRI 94.4% of the patients had supratentorial and 77.7% had infratento-rial lesions. The lesions were located only in supratentorial regions in 22.2%,and only in infratentorial regions in 5.5%.Four of the patients (22.2%) hadabnormal ENG findings although they did not have any infratentorial lesion.Three of these patients did not complain of vertigo, and two of them had noabnormality in brain stem and cerebellar examinations. In one of the patients(5.5%) there was only infratentorial lesions; she complained of vertigo, and shehad abnormalities in ENG test results confirming the clinical symptoms andMRI findings.Conclusions: We suggest that ENG can be used as a laboratory support in diagnosis and/or follow up of probable or definite MS patients with clinicallysilent and/or MR negative lesions.

Results: MS patients and controls were not different regarding conven-tional auditory tests. BAER was significantly abnormal in the MS group in thefollowing conditions: (1) at 11/s click rate regarding the latency of wave III (inmales) and wave V; (2) at 31/s regarding latency of wave V; (3) at 51/s regard-ing latency of wave III, wave V and I-III interval (only in women); (4) at 61/sregarding latency of wave III, wave V and I-III interval (both in women andmen); (5) at 71/s regarding latency of wave V in women. Conclusion: Thisstudy shows that high click stimulus rate increases significantly the sensitivityof the BAER and may be more helpful in detecting abnormalities in the audi-tory pathways in MS patients. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of high stimulus repetition rate in the wave latencies and interpeak intervals of the BAER in MS patients.Methods: The cohort comprised 20 women and 9 males with CDMS (mean age 43.8 and 38.2) and a control group of 20 women and 9 men (mean age of22.6 and 23.1) with no history or objective sign of neurological or otologicaldisturbance. MS patients had no infratentorial MRI lesion. BAER was per-formed using a stimulus repetition rate of 11 clicks/s, 31, 51, 61 and 71clicks/s.Results: MS patients and controls were not different regarding conven- tional auditory tests. BAER was significantly abnormal in the MS group inthe following conditions: (1) at 11/s click rate regarding the latency ofwave III (in males) and wave V; (2) at 31/s regarding latency of wave V;(3) at 51/s regarding latency of wave III, wave V and I-III interval (only inwomen); (4) at 61/s regarding latency of wave III, wave V and I-III interval(both in women and men); (5) at 71/s regarding latency of wave V inwomen.Conclusions: This study shows that high click stimulus rate significantly increases the sensitivity of the BAER.

P125 NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: San Raffaele, Milan, Italy Background: Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of Multiple Scle- rosis (MS), particularly related to frontal executive functions, reflecting a subcorti- cal dementia. Frontal lobes are involved in motor planning and execution, reflected in the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the EEG sensorimotor rhytms.Objectives: In order to investigate neurophysiological correlates of executive function in MS, we evaluated ERD to self-paced movement and reaction timesto the Stroop test (which evaluates frontal functions) in MS patients with andwithout frontal neuropsychological deficits.Methods: Eleven MS patients, who failed in three or more frontal neuropsycho- logical tests, were compared to 10 MS patients matched for age, handedness, dis-ease duration and disability, who did not fail at any frontal test. EEG wasrecorded during self-paced movement paradigm. Manual reaction time to theStroop test was also measured. Nine frontal patients and nine non frontal patientsunderwent follow-up examination of both EEG and reaction time measurements.Results: Stroop reaction times and ERD were significantly delayed in both MS groups compared to normal subjects and in frontal compared to non frontal MSPosters S60 Multiple Sclerosispatients. At follow-up, RT performance at the Stroop test were worsened in both groups of patients, but mostly in frontal patients. Patients with frontal dys-function also showed changes in EEG parameters.Conclusions: These data suggest that frontal cognitive involvement in MS cor- responds to abnormal bioelectrical activity emerging also during a self-pacedmovement paradigm. Moreover, changes over time of both EEG and reactiontimes suggest a potential usefulness of these measurements in monitoringfrontal function in MS. Disclosure: L Leocani has nothing to disclose. P126 PRESENCE OF HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 1 IN SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WITH OPTIC NEURITIS AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Christodoulou Ca, Constantinou Aa, Ab, Milonas Ib aDepartment of Molecular Virology, The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, -, Cyprus;b2nd University Department of Neurology, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece;cDepartment of Ophthalmology, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, -, Greece Background: Multiple sclerosis is one of the most venerable of neurological diseases and one of the most important by virtue of its frequency, chronicityand tendency to attack young adults. The etiology of MS remains unknown.Several epidemiological studies emphasize the importance of environmental,familial and genetic factors. There are supporting data over the years ofresearch that viruses are possible agents triggering the autoimmune response.The initial event in the genesis of MS could be viral infection of nervous sys-tem, than some secondary factor must be operative in later life to activate theneurological disease and cause exacerbation. It is widely believed that this sec-ondary mechanism is an autoimmune reaction.Objectives: Our group is interested not only in the viral etiology of MS but also in the way the possible viral agent enters the CNS. Our hypothesis concerns theeye as possible entry. To perform a preliminary study, we chose 13 patients withboth optic neuritis and MS. Serology and molecular virology studies of Herpessimplex virus 1 (HSV1) were carried out in serum, tears and eye biopsies.Methods: Methodology used for serology study was commercially available classical ELISA for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against HSV1. Forthe molecular study nested PCR was performed using primers specific toamplify a DNA fragment inside the DNA polymerase gene of HSV1. The PCRwas followed by Southern blot and hybridization with specific radioactive probe.Results: All of the patients presented IgG antibodies against HSV1. The molecular study showed that 9 out of 13 patients were positive for the DNA ofHSV1 in serum. We investigated eye biopsy and tear samples of 5 patients. 4 ofthe patients presented HSV1 DNA in their tear sample and 3 out of 5 biopsieswere positive for the HSV1 DNA.Conclusions: We consider that these preliminary results suggest that the hypothesis of the eye being a possible entry for a neurotropic viral infection isworth to be investigated further.

P127 HHV-6A ACTIVE INFECTION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Roberto \u00c1a, Virginia Da, Eduardo Va, Juan Jos\u00e9 Pb, Rafael Aa aNeurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain;bMicrobiolog\u00eda, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain Background: Recent studies have reported a possible association between MS and HHV-6, an ubiquitous infectious agent highly prevalent in the human pop-ulation; however, other studies have not confirmed these results.Objectives: To establish the DNA prevalence and viral load of HHV-6 (and both variants A and B) in MS patients and two control groups: healthy blooddonnors (HBD) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Methods: We analyzed the whole DNA of blood and serum samples of 105 patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), 70 HBD and 52 patients withRA by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with a sensitivity of 1 copy to determine the presence of HHV-6 genomes. An absolute determination of the viral load was made with TaqMan probes andpreviously quantified HHV-6 DNA.Results: Results. HHV-6 and 1.9% vari-ant B. The mean HHV-6 viral load of the positive samples in HHV-6genomes / microgr. of input DNA were: 1) In blood: 5.9 in RRMS patients,5.6 in HBD and 6.2 g in RA patients. 2) In serum: 18.8 in RRMS patients and27.4 in RA patients.Conclusions: 1) HHV-6 DNA prevalence in blood was significantly higher in the MS patients group (p<0.01). 2) HHV-6 variant A is the responsible of thatstatistically significant difference in blood. 3) There is a 17.1% and a 9.6% ofMS and RA patients suffering a HHV-6 active replication at the sampling. 4)Almost all the HHV-6 positive samples in serum were variant A, which leadsus to think that is the only variant involved in MS. 5) Despite the differencein HHV-6 DNA prevalences, we did not find significant differences in theviral loads.

Virginia Da, Roberto \u00c1a, Eduardo Va, Juan Jos\u00e9 Pb, Rafael Aa aNeurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain;bMicrobiolog\u00eda, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain Background: Beta interferon (beta-IFN), an approved treatment for MS, may modify the clinical course of the disease, as demonstrate recent clinical trials.However, we do not completely know what immunomodulatory mechanismsmay be involve in the mediation of its positive effects in the treatment of MSpatients.Objectives: To know if beta-IFN treatment affects: 1) the DNA prevalence of the HHV-6; 2) the HHV-6 viral load.Methods: We made a prospective single center cohort study of 76 serum sam- ples of 76 consecutive patients undergoing RRMS. Forty one patients werereceiving beta-IFN treatment, but none received steroid treatment prior toblood sampling (14 were suffering an exacerbation at the time of blood draw-ing and 27 were on remission), and 35 did not receive beta-IFN treatment (17 inexacerbation and 18 on remission). To establish the presence of HHV-6genomes and quantify the viral load, the DNA of these samples was studied bya real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.Results: HHV-6 DNA prevalences were: 1) 14.9% for all the patients, 13.8% for MS patients in exacerbation, 15.7% forMS patients in remission. 2) In beta-IFN untreated patients: 19.6% for all thepatients, 16.9% for MS patients in exacerbation, 20.9% for MS patients inremission. The viral loads (in HHV-6 genomes / microgr. of input DNA) were:1) In beta-IFN treated patients: 16.7 for all the patients, 11.4 for MS patients in exacerbation, 18.1 for MS patients in remission. 2) In beta-IFN untreated patients: 20.4 for all the patients, 15.1 for MS patients in exacerbation, 19.3 forMS patients in remission.Conclusions: 1) There is a statistically significant difference (p<0.01) in serum HHV-6 DNA prevalence between patients treated and non treated with beta-IFN; therefore, there is almost five per cent more of MS patients that suffer aHHV-6 active replication when they are not treated with beta-IFN. 2) There isno difference in viral load between MS patients beta-IFN treated and nontreated once the virus begin an active replication. 3) beta-IFN treatmentreduces in the same proportion the viral loads and the HHV-6 DNA preva-lences of MS patients in exacerbation and in remission.

There- fore, we compared different non-radioactive assays using Evans blue dye fordiffusion across brain endothelial cell monolayers grown on tissue cultureinserts coated with different matrices.Methods: As an in vitro BBB model, the immortalized endothelial cell line bEnd5 from mouse brain capillaries was grown to confluence in DMEM fortwo days on semipermeable filters precoated with different matrices. Matricesincluded rat tail collagen, type IV collagen, and fibronectin dissolved in H 2O or PBS. Culture media was replaced with colorless DMEM, and Evans blue dye solution was added to the upper compartment for a final concentration of0.05%, before filters were successively transferred to other wells containingcolorless DMEM at various time points. Spectrophotometric absorbance wasmeasured at 650nm in aliquots from the lower compartments, and the resultswere calculated as optical density over time elapsed. Permeability was stimu-lated with either histamine or thrombin and was compared to unstimulatedcontrols.Results: Filters precoated with rat tail collagen exhibited an increase in para- cellular permeability upon both histamine and thrombin stimulus. On type IVcollagen coated filters, only thrombin but not histamine increased the perme-ability. Fibronectin did not lead to an elevated permeability across the endothe-lial monolayer.Conclusions: The results indicate that Evans blue dye diffusion across monolay- ers of brain endothelial cells grown on tissue culture inserts coated with rat tail col-lagen can be applied as an in vitro transendothelial permeability assay of the BBB.

New Clinical Trials (Part 1) P130 THE USE OF PHARMACOKINETIC (PK) MODELING AND EFFICACY DATA TO ESTABLISH OPTIMAL DOSING (ANTEGREN) aBiogen, Hanover, Maryland, USA;cElan, San Diego, California, USA Background: The interaction of 41 integrin (VLA-4) with VCAM-1 appears to be important for autoreactive T cell migration across the blood brain barrier into MS lesions. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody in the class ofselective adhesion molecule inhibitors (SAM-inhibitors) directed against the 4-subunit of VLA-4. Binding of natalizumab to VLA-4 and the resulting inhi- bition of binding to VCAM-1 may be a key element of the immunomodulatory effects of natalizumab. A clinical trial in which 213 relapsing MS patients wererandomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg of natalizumab monthlydemonstrated that natalizumab treatment led to significant decreases in the for-mation of new Gd-enhancing lesions on brain MRI scan and in clinicalrelapses. There were no significant differences in tolerability or efficacybetween the two dose groups.Objectives: To establish the optimal dosing regimen, in terms of safety and efficacy, for natalizumab in phase III MS trials. Methods: Population PK modeling was employed using PK and 4-integrin binding data from Phase II studies of natalizumab. Results: The results of the population analysis indicate that there are only small changes in natalizumab clearance across a broad range of body weights. An analysis of serum natalizumab concentration and 4-integrin saturation lev- levels increase with serum natal- izumab concentration, which was observed over a wide range of body weights. Significant overlap was seen between dose groups. The serum concentrationsof natalizumab achieved maintained adequate receptor saturation throughoutthe treatment period corresponding with similar efficacy seen in both MRI andclinical endpoints. Pharmacokinetic modeling demonstrated that fixed dosingof natalizumab every 4 weeks achieves more consistent serum concentrationsacross a wide range of body weights than mg/kg dosing. The result is adequate 4-integrin saturation required for efficacy while keeping drug exposure levels within the defined safety ranges established in prior studies. Conclusions: The PK features of natalizumab with its unique targeted mech- anism of action correlated with efficacy data from the Phase II studiesenabled fixed monthly dosing in the on-going Phase III natalizumab clinicaltrials.

Clinicalsafety assessments were performed every 4 weeks to week 24 and then every12 weeks to week 48. Blood tests were done at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 9and 12. Results: 339 patients received IFN beta-1a 44 mcg sc tiw (high dose) and 337 received 30 mcg IM qw (low dose). Flu-like symptoms were common but did notdiffer significantly between groups either in terms of incidence or severity. Injec-tion-site events were reported in 83% of high dose and 28% of low dose patients(p<0.001). 85% of injection site reactions on high dose were rated as mild andsimilar numbers of patients on high (n=4) and low (n=3) dose discontinued treat-ment because of injection site reactions. Overall, therapy was stopped in 25 highdose patients (7.4%) and 21 low dose patients (6.2%). The most common reasonwas for adverse events (16 high dose patients and 14 low dose patients). Eleva-tion of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was the most common hepaticadverse event (11.5% on high dose vs. 4.7% on low dose; p=0.001). Severe ALTelevations were seen in 6 patients in the high dose group (1.8%) and 4 in the lowdose group (1.2%) with 3 dropouts on the high dose and 1 on the low dose forenzyme elevations. Leukopenia (6.2% high dose vs. 0.6% low dose; p<0.001)was the most common white blood cell adverse event. Severe leukopenia wasnot seen in either group. Depression (16% vs. 18%) and headache (38% vs. 32%;p=ns) were approximately equal. Only one death occurred during the study (asolo plane crash).Conclusions: The advantage in efficacy seen clinically at 48 weeks with 44 mcg sc tiw compared to 30 mcg IM qw was not offset by clinically significantsafety concerns or reduced adherence to therapy.

Methods: Eighty-two SPMS patients from five centers participating into a European, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IFNb-1b inSPMS underwent brain T2-weighted and MT MRI at baseline. Follow up datawere available for 75 patients at 12, 54 at 24 and 47 at 36 months. MT MRIscans were post-processed and analyzed to obtain histograms of MTR valuesfrom the whole brain. A ROI-based analysis of MTR values from the NAWM was also performed.Results: In both the treatment arms, there was a decrease of average brain MTR values from baseline to month 24 (mean change=-4.9%) and month36 (mean change=-4.3%). These changes were statistically significant forthe placebo group at both the time-points and for the IFNb-1b group atmonth 24 only, with no significant treatment effect. A decrease of NAWMMTR was also observed, with no significant difference between the twotreatment arms.Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with SPMS, IFNb-1b as compared to placebo did not show an overall effect on the worsening of MT MRI measures.The data show that change in MTR is a promising tool for monitoring diseaseevolution in SPMS.

P134 SINGLE CENTRE, DBPC, RANDOMISED TRIAL OF INTERFERON BETA 1B IN PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE AND TRANSITIONAL PROGRESSIVEMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: AN EXPLORATORY PHASE II STUDY Montalban Xa, Brieva La, Tintore Ma, Borras Aymerich Xb, Jb, Horno Ra, Vicente Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain;bMagnetic Resonance Unit - IDI, University Hospital Vall d, Barcelona, Spain Background: The beneficial effects of IFN beta have been shown just for patients in the relapsing phase of MS. The role of interferon beta in the treat-ment of patients with secondary progressive MS still remains a controversialissue. The single phase II randomized controlled trial on PPMS using IFN beta1a (IM) shows no significant treatment effect on EDSS though some effect onT2 lesion load.Objectives: To investigate safety and hints of efficacy of interferon (IFN) beta1b given to patients with primary progressive (PPMS) and transitional pro-gressive multiple sclerosis (TPMS).Methods: 73 patients (49 PPMS/24 TPMS) with EDSS scores between 3.0 to 7.0, were enrolled and randomized to receive either 8MIU of IFN beta1b or placebo administered every other day subcutaneously for 2 years. Safety parameters including BDI and Ashworth's and Krupp's scales and bloodtests were performed every three months. Clinical outcomes (EDSS andMS Functional Composite (MSFC)) were also performed every threemonths and the Sickness Impact Profile every six months. MRI measures(T2 and T1-weighted brain lesion load, brain parenchymal fraction (BPF),T2 lesions, cord atrophy, MTR and spectroscopy) and neu-ropsychological assessment (BRNB) were undertaken Adverse events significantly associated with IFN-beta included injec- tion-site reaction, flu-like symptoms and lymphopenia. One patient on theplacebo arm died because of pulmonary infection. In all, 96% of the patientsreached study end and 93% completed the treatment period of the study. Treat-ment groups were comparable on all baseline variables. The proportion ofpatients with confirmed progression at 6 months was 22.2% in the IFN arm and32.4% in the placebo arm (p= 0.2). Statistically differences were foundfor T2 (p=0.006) (p=0.01) lesion load in favor of the IFN-treated group. MSFC and BPF data will be pre-sented.Conclusions: IFN-beta 1b is safe in the treatment of patients with PPMS and TPMS.

Before IFN betareduction the patients had to be on chronic IFN beta treatment for at least 3years, and without clinical and MRI signs of disease activity during the last 2years. MRI was performed before randomisation and at the end of the one yearfollow-up Results: One year after the reduction of IFN beta dose clinical outcome meas- ures were, for the group of patients switched to once-a-week IFN beta-1a, mean number of the gadolinium-enhancing lesions 0.92 \u00b10.95; for group of patients continually treated with IFN beta-1b, mean number of the new PD/T2 of the gadolinium- enhancing lesions 0.35 \u00b10.74. All these outcome measures were significantly lower (p< 0.01) for the patients who continued on IFN beta-1b except for the mean number of the enlarging lesionsConclusions: IFN beta treatment is a chronic one. The reduction of IFN beta- 1b dose is not advisable even in patients with years of absence of diseaseactivity Disclosure: A Pipieri has nothing to disclose. P136 3 TESLA MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING COMPARISON OF INTERFERON BETA-1B AND GLATIRAMER ACETATE - Newark, New USA;cPreventive Medicine Biostatistics/Epidemiology, UMDNJ, Newark, New Jersey, USA Background: Currently approved immunomodulatory therapies for relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) include two forms of interferon beta (inter-feron beta-1a and 1b) and glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone\u00ae), a synthetic poly-mer that mimics the structure of myelin basic protein. While recent comparativestudies have demonstrated the superiority of higher frequency, higher dose inter-feron beta formulations in the treatment of RR-MS, there have to date been no directrandomised comparisons of the efficacy and tolerability of interferon beta and GA.Objectives: The purpose of this presentation is to announce the initiation of a randomised, single-blind, 48-week study to compare the effects ofinterferon beta-1b vs. GA on MRI and clinical disease measures in patientswith RR-MS.Methods: 110 patients will be recruited to the study and receive the approved dose of either interferon beta-1b (250 \u00b5[8 million international units] subcuta- neously [sc] every other day) or GA (20 mg sc daily). MRI scans will be con- ducted 4 weeks before baseline, at baseline, and then every four weeks there-after for a period of 48 weeks, while clinical assessments will be performed atbaseline, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter. All MRI scanning will be car-ried out using ultra-high magnetic field strength (3 Tesla) and triple-dose gadolinium (Gd).Results: The primary endpoint variable will be the total number of com- bined-active lesions (Gd enhancing + new long TR lesions) over thetwelve, monthly scans with patient as the unit of analysis. Secondary end-points will include volumetric analysis, diffusion tensor imaging, neu-rocognitive function and clinical disease activity (relapses and progressionof disability).Conclusions: Enrolment is expected to be complete by August 2003, with the results expected in 2005.

Genetics (Part 1) P137 A SCANDINAVIAN GENOME-WIDE LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM SCREENIN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS University of Immunology, Oslo Hospital, University Oslo, Norway;gDepartment Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden;h8Department of Neurology, Hospital, Norway;iDepartment of Neurology, Gothenburg University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease. Unknown genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease. Objectives: The present study is based on a genetic homogenous Scandinavian population and part of a Genetic Analysis of Multiple sclerosis in EuropeanSstudy (GAMES). Methods: Two independent Scandinavian genome-wide screens for linkage disequilibrium have been performed, using pooled DNA and a dense map of6000 microsatellite. In the first screen, 199 cases were compared with 200 con-trols; in the second, a further 201 cases were compared with a second set of 200controls. Results: Statistical data were achieved from 4041 markers in the first and 4228 markers in the second screen. Results for both screens were available in the same3360 markers. Thirteen markers showed statistically significant differencesbetween case-control allele image patterns (AIP) in both screens, among thesethe HLA marker D6S2447. When additional AIPs were generated for the mostpromising of these markers, statistical significance was retained for two markers- the D1S1601 marker (1q42) and the D11S1986 marker (11q23). These twonovel genomic regions may contain susceptibility genes for multiple sclerosis.Conclusions: Two novel genetic regions possibly contributing to the genetic susceptibility to MS among Scandinavians has been identified. Further workis needed to dissect which genes are actually responsible for the observedassociation. Disclosure: P Datta has nothing to disclose.

P138 -384 INTERLEUKIN-2 POLYMORPHISMS IN Universitario Cellular Biology, Instituto de y Lopez Neyra, Granada, Granada, Spain;dNeurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Cecilio, Granada, Spain Background: Interleukin-2 (IL2) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with a key role in maintenance of self tolerance and in CNS. Recent findings suggest thatIL2-2RB locus contributes to the genetic susceptibility in some multiple sclero-sis (MS) patients. So far, only two il-2 polymorphisms have been identified, atposition -384 and 114 and it would be interesting to analyse their associationwith susceptibility to MSObjectives: To investigate the association of -384 polymorphisms in the IL-2 with the susceptibility to MS and its clinical characteristics (clinical form, gen-der, age at onset, symptoms at onset, disease duration, EDSS score at the momentof study, response to interferon therapy) as well as with HLA class II alleles Methods: DNA was collected from 90 patients with clinically definite MS (56 with relapsing-remitting (RR)and 34 with secondary-progressive (SP) clinicalform) and 153 controls, and was extracted by standard procedures. Thesequence containing -384 polymorphisms was amplified with oligonucleotideIP46 modified to create a restriction site for the Bfa-1 enzyme with the G allele.The forward primer was IP47. Amplification yielded a band of 131 bp that,after digestion with Bfa-1, gave products of 110 and 21 bp, that were separatedon 12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromideand visualized with ultraviolet light. The HLA class II subregions DRB1,DQA1 and DQB1 were investigated by commercial molecular biology methodsResults: No significant differences in the genotype frequencies between MS group and controls were found. A positive association between the heterozy-gous -384 genotype (G/T) and the SP clinical form (57% vs. 43%, p=0,009)was detected. There was a trend of association (p= 0,07) between the homozy-gous genotype (T/T) and the RR clinical form (66% vs. 47%). No associationof any of the three genotypes with any of the other clinical characteristics stud-ied or with the HLA class II alleles was observed (p> 0,05)Conclusions: -384 (G/T) polymorphism of the IL-2 is associated with the SP clinical form of MS, and not with other clinical characteristics or HLA alleles Disclosure: V Fern\u00e1ndez has nothing to disclose. P139 CTLA-4 GENE POLYMORPHISMS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN N. IRELAND Heggarty SVa, Silversides Ja, Vandenbroeck Kb, McDonnell Gc, Hawkins Sc, Graham Ca aRegional Genetics Centre, Belfast City Hospital Trust, Belfast, Co. Antrim, United Kingdom;bSchool of Pharmacy, Queens University of Belfast, Belfast, Co. Antrim, United Kingdom;cDept. of Neurology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Co. Antrim, United Kingdom Background: Polymorphisms within the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated (CTLA-4)gene have been implicated in a number of autoimmune diseases rangingfrom type 1 diabetes mellitus, Graves disease as well as multiple sclerosis. TheCTLA-4 and CD28 molecules are co-stimulatory T cell receptors that are involvedin the control of T cell activation. CD28 upregulates cellular activity by its interac-tion with the B7 ligand of the antigen presenting cell while CTLA-4 provides thenecessary down regulatory signal to reduce the ongoing immune response. CTLA- 4 is therefore a good candidate gene for investigation in autoimmune disorders.Objectives: The human CTLA-4 gene is located on chromosome 2q33. From literature the CTLA-4 gene contains the polymorphisms at positions -318(C/T) in the promoter (Genbank#M74363), +49(A/G) of untranslated region of exon 4 atposition 642 (Genbank#M37243). A case control study was proposed todetermine the influence of these polymorphisms in the N. Ireland popula-tion on MS risk.Methods: Alleles of the polymorphism within the promoter (-318C/T) were identified by PCR using sequence specific primers, the exon 1 (49A/G) poly-morphism typed was labelled PCR primers and sized on ABI3100. Statisticalanalysis was carried out by the Chi-squared test.Results: The promoter and exon 4 polymorphisms showed no significant dif- ferences between case and control populations however a strong association tothe A allele of the +49A/G polymorphism of exon 1 of the gene was demon- strated. There were significantly more homozygous A allele patients (42%) in comparison to the control population(29%; p=0.0031).Conclusions: The fact that different alleles of the same polymorphism show a positve association in different populations would suggest that these polymor-phism do not influence susceptibilty but that another as yet untested loci isinvolved.

P140 ASSOCIATION STUDY OF FAS AND FASL POLYMORPHISMS WITH MULTIPLE & Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, USA;bDepartment of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic & Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, USA;cDepartments of Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Molecular Neuroscience Program, Mayo Clinic &Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, USA Background: Fas and FasL expression leads to antigen activation-induced apoptosis of T-cells. Mutations in Fas and FasL cause autoimmunity and lym-phoproliferation in mice and humans. Others have reported association of poly- morphisms adjacent to or in FasandFasL with MS susceptibility. Objectives: To study the association of FasandFasL polymorphisms with sus- ceptibility to, gender bias, age at onset, course and severity (based on EDSSand duration) of MS.Methods: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per gene were selected from the SNP database to establish haplotypes that span the genes.Genotyping was performed in a population-based sample of 122 cases and 244gender, age and ethnicity-matched controls using restriction fragment lengthpolymorphism methodology. Results were not corrected for multiple compar-isons in this preliminary analysis.Results: There was linkage disequilibrium (LD) between 5'(-670) and alleles in LD, wasassociated with increased risk of MS in women but not men. There was a trendto association of the haplotype defined by these alleles with risk ofMS in women (p=0.053; OR: (p=0.057; OR: 3.92, 95%CI: 0.88-14.43). None of the Fas polymorphisms was associated with disease severity or age at onset. There wasLD between 5'(-663), Intron2(1153) and Intron2(2776) SNPs of FasL in both cases and controls (p<0.00001). Being a carrier for 5'(-663)*T was associatedwith susceptibility the effectMultiple SclerosisPosters S65 being primarily due to a difference in the frequency of heterozygotes. None of theFasL polymorphisms was associated with age of onset, severity or course. Conclusions: Two SNPs of Fasin LD with one another and a 5' region SNP ofFasL may be associated with susceptibility to MS. In the case of the Fas SNPs, the effect was evident only in homozygous women. Disclosure: O Kantarci has nothing to disclose.

We haverecently published the association of a CA repeats polymorphism of the FasLgene to relapsing multiple sclerosis.Objectives: The purpose of the present work was the search of intragenic markers of Fas since a polymorphic marker could be very useful in the study ofthe hypothetical association of the Fas death system to multiple sclerosis. Methods: The groups consisted of 172 healthy unrelated and 195 relapsing MS patients of Caucasian origin. The unknown intronic sequence of intron IV ofthe Fas gene was amplified with primers designed from the flanking sequencesand the sense and antisense strands of the amplified DNA were sequenced.SNP is detectable by endonuclease restriction analysis with MaeI that easilyallowed the screening of a large number of DNA. Results: The sequencing of both the sense and antisense strands of a 907 bp stretch, within the unknown sequence of intron IV of the Fas gene, identified anovel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A/T(735)G/C. By the endonucle-ase restriction determined the allele frequencies in 344 chromo- somes of healthy individuals and 390 chromosomes of relapsing MS patients. We found a higher frequency of the heterozygous TC genotype in MS patientsthan in healthy controls. The FasMaeI polymorphism was not associated to theClass II HLA DRB1*1501 and DQB1*602 alleles. A small but the intronic polymorphism Fas/MaeI and theFas/MvaI polymorphism of the promoter region of the Fas gene in MS patients.The T allele of the Fas/MaeI A/T(735)G/C SNP was associated to a CA repeatsallele of the FasL gene in MS patients. Conclusions: This polymorphism could be useful for examining latent associ- ations between specific alleles and MS susceptibility. Disclosure: M Lucas has nothing to disclose.

P142 GENOMIC Dc, Palacios Rd, Spanish Ma Barcelona, Catalonia, Dept., Hospital Carlos, Madrid, Neurology, Hospital de Donostia, Navarra, Spain analysis in MS patients have identified several genomic loci associated with the disease. Association studies and marker saturation ofthe genome are more powerful strategies in order to detect multiple MS sus- ceptibility genes with little contribution to the disease. Objectives: To identify the genome regions confering susceptibility in Span- ish MS patients by performing a genome screen using marker saturation inDNA pools.Methods: 200 MS cases (RR/SP), 200 healthy controls and 186 MS simplex families were studied. Individual DNAs were pooled (four pools: cases, con-trols, simplex cases and parents) and typed using 5503 microsatellites. PCRproducts were diluted twice and analysed on Genotyper\u00ae software. Single peak analysis and 2test (cut-off level: 23.9) were used to assess differences in electropherograms between cases and controls. Positive results were re- typed in order to diminish the rate of false positives.Results: Differences in single peaks between cases and controls were statisti- cally significant for 244 markers. Markers with the greatest evidence of associ-ation mapped to the HLA locus. Our study confirmed the association with 18loci identified regions of interest inchr. 13, 17, 21 and X.Conclusions: Our results provide support for the presence of regions encoding susceptibility genes for MS.

RANTES AND CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR 5 POLYMORPHISMS:SUSCEPTIBILITY TO AND OUTCOME IN SCLEROSIS Partridge JMa, Fryer Aa, Ollier Wb, Boggild Mc, Strange Ra, Hawkins Ca aMS Research Group, School of Medicine, Keele University, Stoke-on-Trent, ST4, United Kingdom;bARC Epidemiology Unit, Manchester University, Manchester, M13, United Kingdom;cWalton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, L9, United Kingdom Background: MS is a T cell dependent inflammatory disease of the CNS. Chemokines are molecules involved in leucocyte recruitment and activation ofinflammation in the CNS. Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a major receptor forthe chemokine RANTES, is expressed in normal CNS tissue. The receptor isoverexpressed in infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly the proinflammatoryTh1 type important in MS pathogenesis. RANTES is a chemoattractant for Th1cells in MS patients due to CCR5 overexpression. This effect can be blockedusing anti-CCR5 antibodies. Both RANTES and CCR5 demonstrate functional polymorphisms: the CCR5 32 is a truncated allele of the gene that encodes a non-functional receptor while the -403 G-A substitution in the RANTES pro- moter is associated with an 8-fold increase in transcriptional activity.Objectives: We performed candidate gene association studies to determine whether: (a) CCR5 32 confers protection from MS or reduced severity, (b) RANTES -403 G-A is associated with MS susceptibility and outcome and, (c) combinations of these genotypes are important.Methods: 346 patients and 204 controls of Northern European origin were recruited. DNA was extracted from leucocytes and PCR-based assays wereused to identify polymorphisms. with Kurtzke's EDSS. Cases stratified into mild/moderate(EDSS 0-5.5) and severe disability (EDSS 6-10) after disease duration of 10years. Results were analysed using logistic regression to correct for independ-ent covariants of age of onset, gender and disease duration. Significance levelswere set at p<0.05.Results: Significant association was found between possession of the -403 A allele of RANTES and MS (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.03-2.29, p = 0.03). No asso- ciation was seen between CCR5 32 and MS when considered alone. A com-Posters S66 Multiple Sclerosisbined genotype effect was dominated by RANTES. No association was found between genotypes and severity.Conclusions: This is the first report of an association between a RANTES polymorphism and MS indicating a possible role in its onset.

Inparticular, GSTM3 AA and the combination of GSTM1 null/GSTP1Ile105/Ile 105 are associated with a more severe disease course. Alpha classGST represent a further putative defence against the oxidative stress that isassociated with the inflammatory demyelination seen in MS pathogenesis.We describe a candidate gene approach examining a published promoterpolymorphism in GSTA1 (-69 C-T) and a novel polymorphism in exon 2 ofGSTA2 (G-C).Objectives: To investigate the association between susceptibility to and clini- cal outcome in MS and GSTA1 and A2 polymorphisms.Methods: 342 unrelated Northern European Caucasian MS patients and 225 healthy controls were studied. Disability was measured using Kurtzke's EDSSand was graded mild-moderate (EDSS performed on extractedfrom peripheral leucocytes. Chi-square analyses were performed to identifysignificant differences in genotype frequencies between cases and controls forsusceptibility, and between EDSS groups for disability.Results: No significant difference A1 -69 or A2 exon 2 genotype frequen- cies was demonstrated between cases and controls or EDSS groups. The allelefrequencies of the novel A2 exon 2 polymorphism were G = 0.960, C = 0.040 in cases and G = 0.962, C = 0.038 in controls ( 2= 0.023, p 0.88). A1 -69 and A2 exon 2 polymorphisms ( 22 = 14.5, p = 0.001). Conclusions: There was no association between GSTA1 or A2 and suscepti- bility to or outcome from MS.

MMP-9 MICROSATELLITE POLYMORPHISM INCREASES THE RISK OF MULTIPLE Altamura Medicine, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy Background: MMP-9 plays an important role in multiple sclerosis (MS) development. A microsatellite (14-27 AC repeats) in the promoter region rep-resents a polymorphic region modulating its expression.Objectives: To determine if MMP-9 microsatellite polymorphism (PM) is associated to MS susceptibility and to MRI characteristics of the lesions.Methods: In 95 MS patients and 95 age- and sex- matched blood donors, MMP-9 PM has been determined. In MS patients, clinical (age of onset, life-time relapse rate, EDSS) and MRI (BPF, T1- and T2- characteris-tics have been evaluated according to the MMP-9 PM.Results: Patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS and controls have a differ- ent pattern of MMP-9 microsatellite (p=0.0001). Prevalence of more than 21 ACrepeats in at least one allele was higher in patients than in controls (O.R. 3.44, 95% C.I. 1.59-7.47). MRI scan of RR patients showed that the ratio between T2-and T1-lesion load was higher in patients with more than 21 repeats.Conclusions: Compared to the controls, MS patients had higher prevalence of more than 21 repeats alleles in MMP-9 gene. MS patients who carry a highnumber of repeats showed more inflammatory/oedematous brain lesions. Disclosure: R Zivadinov has nothing to disclose. P146 HLA TYPING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. RELATION TO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FINDINGS Zivadinov of of Trieste, Trieste, Italy Background: It could be hypothesized that the HLA status can influence the heterogeneity and severity of MS pathological processes measured by the accu-mulation of disease activity on conventional and non-conventional MRI . Objectives: To examine the relationship between HLA status and brain MRI quantitative markers of demyelinating and destructive pathology in patientswith multiple sclerosis (MS).Methods: We studied 100 patients with definite MS and more than 5-year dis- ease duration, and 122 age-, sex-, ethnic- and residence-matched controls. TheDNA extraction and DQB1 loci) havebeen obtained with sequence-specific oligonucleotide a available reversible line blot assay (INNO-LIPA). All patients under-went a 1.5 tesla MR examination of the brain. Calculations of T2- and T1-lesion loads (LL) and brain parenchymal fraction were asso-ciated with MS. multiple regression analysis showed that a higher T2-LL wasassociated with the < 0.0001, respectively), whereas the BPFwas predicted DQB1*06 allele (p= < 0.00001).Conclusions: Our findings did not demonstrate any relation between HLA genotypes commonly associated with MS (DQB1 2/3 and DRB1 3/15) andMRI measures of outcome. The study showed that some different HLA allelespredicted the destructive pathological processes visible on MRI. Whether theHLA-DRB1*12 allele may increase the susceptibility to a more severe out-come on MRI measures sensitive to the accumulation of axonal loss, in patientswith RR/SP-MS, and HLA-DQB1*06 allele may predict a worse outcome onMRI measures in PP-MS, should be determined by further studies.

P147 APOE GENOTYPE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS AND MRI FINDINGS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Zwemmer Ja, van Veen Ta,b, van aNeurology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Netherlands;bClinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Netherlands;cClinical Chemistry, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Netherlands;dMS-MRI Centre, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Netherlands Background: In multiple sclerosis (MS), the ApoE polymorphism has been studied several times. With respect to disease susceptibility many studies haveMultiple SclerosisPosters S67 been performed, showing no role for this polymorphism. However only few studies focused on the role of the ApoE genotype in disease severity and pro-gression and these studies have shown contradictory results.Objectives: To study the relation of the ApoE genotype with disease character- istics in a large number of MS patients, using both clinical and MRI measures.Methods: In a group of 422 patients with clinical definite MS, demographic and clinical findings were recorded and related to the ApoE genotype. In alarge subgroup of these patients both cross-sectionally as well as longitudinallyobtained MRI parameters were related to the ApoE genotype. In addition theApoE genotype was determined in a group of 144 healthy controls.Results: No significant difference was found in the distribution of ApoE geno- types in MS patients and controls. Disease characteristics (including age ofonset and onset type), disease severity (progression index, time to reach EDSS6) and MRI findings (lesion volumes and atrophy measures) were not signifi-cantly influenced by the ApoE genotype.Conclusions: In this cohort the lack of impact of the ApoE genotype on disease susceptibility was confirmed. Moreover we did not find a relation between the ApoE genotype and disease characteristics, disease severity and progression asdetermined both clinically and by follow-up MRI scans.

IMMUNE REGULATORY EFFECTS OF GLATIRAMER ACETATE (GA) ON HUMAN MONOCYTES: BYSTANDER SUPPRESSION REVISITED? Kim H, Duddy M, Bar-Or A Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Background: GA is known to induce a Th2-shift in GA-reactive T cells of MS patients. These peripherally activated T cells are thought to suppress auto-reac-tive T cells in the CNS, the assumption being that such 'bystander suppression'is mediated by direct interaction between 'anti-' and 'pro-inflammatory' Tcells in the CNS. We wished to test an alternate hypothesis in which GA mayindirectly mediate anti-inflammation by modulating responses of antigen pre- senting cells (APC), such as monocytes (M ). or in-vivo Th1 or Th2 GA-reactive T cells may modulate immune responses of human M . Methods: Human CD14+ M were purified (MACS) and from polarized GA-reactive Th1 (pTh1) IL-12/anti-IL-4 mAb or IL-4/anti-IL-12 mAb,respectively, and with GA-reactive T Cell lines generated from untreated (pre- Rx), or GA-treated (GA-Rx) patients with MS. Subsequent M cytokine secre- tion and phenotype were analyzed by Results: Mexposed to sups from pTh2 GA-reactive cells produced less IL- 12 compared to M exposed to pTh1 sups (56 vs. 165 pg/ml; cell sups generated from GA-Rx patients increased M production of IL-10 compared to pre-Rx sups (460 vs. 290 pg/ml; n=4, p=0.016) and decreased production of IL-12 (43 vs. 168 pg/ml; n=3, p=0.038). Interest- ingly, the differential effects on IL-10 and IL-12 production were not mediated by IFN or IL-5, as blocking antibodies to these cytokines had no effect on the induced M cytokine pattern. FACS showed that pTh2 and Post-Rx sups induced M with lower levels of CD80 (B7.1), CD40 and class sups. Conclusions: recip- rocal changes in IL-10 and IL-12 production from, and phenotypic changes of,human monocytes, that would be predicted to confer anti-inflammatory proper-ties to these potential antigen presenting cells. We propose a model in whichGA therapy induces changes in T cell responses and that these may modulateAPC responses which, in turn, could contribute to anti-inflammatory responsesin MS, peripherally and/or centrally.

The European study showed a significant delay in the Expanded Disabil-ity Status Scale (EDSS) progression, the American study could not achieve anstatistical difference in this parameter. Objectives: We evaluated the effect of IFN 1b in SP-MS and compared our results with published data Methods: This was an open, multicentric, retrospective, observational 2 years study. 69 SP-MS patients with EDSS scores of 3.0-6.5 receiving 8 MIU IFN 1b every other day s.c. Primary objective was to assess the effect of IFN 1b therapy on the EDSS progression.The statistical method for the primary objec- tive was paired t test. Results: Mean age (SD, conversion to SP-MS: (4.3 12.7); median EDSS at baseline: 5.5 (4.5 6.0); median EDSS at endpoint: 6.0 (4.25 6.5). The mean of relapses 2 years previ- ously was 0.971, 88% of the patients were free of relapses at the first year of treatment and 80% at the second year. 75.4% of the patients presentedadverse effects, but 62.3% of them were mild. Non-steroidal anti-inflama-tory drugs or paracetamol were used to reduce flu-like symptoms. Sys-temic steroid treatment was standardised. Reason for dropping out or stop-ping was analyzed. Conclusions: The EDSS showed a lower progression after IFN 1b treatment in SPMS patients. The number of relapses also decreased after treatment. These findings are consistent with previous studies and support the usefulness of IFN 1b treatment in SPMS. Disclosure: Sotelo H.

Methods: Chronic EAE (induced in DA rats after spinal cord homogenate sc injection): 30 rats were iv treated on days 14, 21, 27 and 34 as follows: group 1:saline; group 2: BBR2778 16.25 mg/kg/day; group 3: MTX 1.2 mg/kg/day.Acute EAE (induced Lewis rats after myelin basic protein [MBP] sc injec-tion): 40 rats were divided into 2 groups and were iv treated with BB2778 32.5mg/kg/day on days 4 and 7 or were left untreated. Five rats/group were sacri-ficed on days 10, 14, 23 and 41.Results: Chronic EAE: both MTX and BBR2778 induced a marked reduction in total WBC and lymphocytes count vs. untreated EAE rats. During the 72-dayobservation period the incidence of relapses was significantly lower in theBBR2778 group vs. untreated EAE group (p=0.028). Anti-MBP Ab were signifi-cantly lower in the BBR2778 and MTX groups vs. controls (p=0.016). In most ofthe BBR2778 rats the in vitro studies evidenced a reduced proliferation of spleenlymphocytes. Despite each daily dose was equal to 1/4 of the single LD10 ofBBR2778 and MTX, histopathology confirmed that MTX was markedly car-diotoxic while BBR2778 not induce any relevant cardiotoxic change. hematological determinations evidenced a reduction in CD3+, CD4+ andCD8+ cells vs. untreated EAE rats, but the most impressive result was anextremely marked reduction in CD45+ cells. Accordingly, anti-MBP Ab titerswere lower in the BBR2778 group. The clinical signs of EAE were significantlyless severe in BBR2778-treated (p=0.021, day 14). In vitro proliferation testsdemonstrated that BBR2778 treatment markedly reduced the reactivity of spleenlymphocytes to MBP.Conclusions: Although further pre-clinical studies are still needed, our data are a proof-of-concept in favor of a possible future role of BBR2778 in the treat-ment of MS. Disclosure: G MS-PATIENTS Chan A, Weilbach FX, Toyka KV, Gold R Dept. of Neurology, Clinical Research Group for Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Bavaria, Germany Background: The immunosuppressant mitoxantrone is highly effective in the treatment of active multiple sclerosis (MS). Only few data are available con-cerning immunological mechanisms. Objectives: We investigated the effects of mitoxantrone on proliferation and cell death of peripheral blood leukocytes from MS patients ex vivo . Methods: Peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells (MNC) were obtained from 29 active MS patients (mean age 38.8 yrs., m: f 1: 1.4) before and imme-diately after 1h mitoxantrone infusion. Isolated MNC were cultured for 24h with and without phytohemagglutinin activation (PHA, 5 \u00b5g/ml). Proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine uptake. Cell death proliferation of MNC in 24/26 patients in comparison to control MNC from the same patient before mitoxantrone appli- cation (58 \u00b122 apop- totic/necrotic changes in MNC of 23/28 patients (p< 0.01), increasing the pro- portion of Ann/PI + cells by 16% (p< 0.01). In PHA-stimulated was more pronounced (21%, p<0.001). Subpopulation analyses (CD3,4, 8, 14, 19, 25, 56) performed in 7 de novo mitoxantrone-exposed patients so far revealed no significant differences in susceptibility towards apoptosis. Conclusions: Our data indicate that already a short 1h in vivo exposure to mitoxantrone induces a profound suppression of proliferative responses inMNC of MS patients. This suppression appears to be mediated by induction ofapoptotic/necrotic cell death. Disclosure: A Chan has nothing to disclose. P155 EPITOPE SPECIFICITY OF NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES AGAINST INTERFERON-BETA a subset of antibodies against interferon-beta (IFNb) - are supposed to bind to the receptor binding residuesof the IFNb molecule. This has, however, not been proven yet for human NAB.Objectives: To analyze the epitope-specific binding pattern of NAB and non- NAB to the IFNb molecule.Methods: Thirty-one 12-mer peptides and one 11-mer peptide with an offset of 5 amino acids representing the amino acid sequence of the human IFNb mole-cule (Mimotopes, France) were used as antigens in an ELISA antibody assay.Sera of 72 MS patients (37 with NAB and 35 with non-NAB) were investigated.Results: A significant difference of peptide binding between NAB and non- NAB was found at residues 1-12, 121-132, and 151-162. The strongest bindingwas observed between NAB and residues 1-12 and there was a highly signifi-cant positive correlation between NAB titers and titers against residues 1-12.Binding to residues 1-12 was more pronounced in patients on IFNb-1a than inpatients on IFNb-1b.Conclusions: Although interpretation of the results is limited due to linear epi- topes there is a difference between NAB and non-NAB with respect to bindingto amino acid sequences at the IFNb molecule. The difference between IFNb-1a and 1b treated patients supports our observation that residues 1-12 play animportant role in NAB binding since IFNb-1b lacks methionin at position 1.Several consequences may be considered: (1) Binding to residues 1-12 mightbe used as simple screening test for NAB; (2) Substitutions or deletions atresidues 1-12 (especially at residues 1-5 since there was no binding to residues6-17) might reduce the antigenicity of recombinant IFNb. If such a moleculewas biologically active this would be an interesting opportunity for future IFNb drug designs.

P156 Z, Akman-Demir G Neurology, Istanbul University, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey Background: Although the cause of multiple sclerosis(MS) remains uncertain, recent evidence has revealed that both genetic and environmental factors deter-mine susceptibility. Familial agregation of MS was found to be 5-20%. Therehas been some debate whether familial cases are separate entity or unsuitable for entry into clinical trials of therapeutic agents. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the demographics, out- come and benefit from treatment with immunomodulatory drugs of patientswith familial multiple sclerosis.The results were compared with 1596 sporadicMS patients in whom 256 were have been using immunomodulatory therapies.Methods: The demographics, clinical findings and responses to immunomodu- latory agents(IFNB and glatiramer acetate) of 44 patients with familial MSwere evaluated in a hospital based cohort in Istanbul.Results: The familial frequency of MS was 5.3% (n=175) of total 1755 patients with MS at April 2002. The familial MS patients were the members of94 families and these group was divided arbitrarily into the following threegroups: sibling pairs, parent-child pairs and second, third relatives. Consan-guinity was seen in fourteen families. The age at onset was 29.5 yrs.Female/male ratio was 1.7/1. Most of the patients(45%) were seen from onsetof the disease. The most common initial manifestations were sensory(45%),brain stem (20%) and optic neuritis (15%). According to Poser and co-work-ers' criteria 94% 0f the patients was clinically definite MS. Relapsing-remit-ting course was seen in 56% of 175 patients. The mean duration of disease was11 yrs, and Kurtzke's score was 3.0 at the last follow-up. The mean follow-upwas 9 yrs.Of 175(25%), 44 patients have been receiving immunomodulatorytherapy at least 1 yr.Conclusions: In conclusion, familial MS patients resembled those remaining sporadic in both clinical, demographic characteristics, outcome and responsesto immunomodulatory therapies.

P157 CAMPATH-1H IN THE TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Le Page Ea, Amanda Louise Ca, Coles Aa, Denys Va, Miller Da, Hale Gb, Waldmann Hb, Compston Aa aNMR Unit, Institute of Neurology Queen Square, London, united kindom, United Kingdom;bTherapeutic Antibody Center, Oxford, united humanised anti-leukocyte (CD52) monoclonal anti- body previously assessed in the treatment of patients with secondary progressivemultiple sclerosis (SPMS), did not alter disease progression (Coles et al., 1999).Objectives: To assess efficacy in patients with early active relapsing-remit- ting MS.Methods: This is a retrospective study of 47 MS patients treated by Cam- path-1H: cohort I 36 SPMS, cohort II 11 cases treated before confirmedprogression. Patients were evaluated every 3-6 months to record EDSS,Posters S70 Multiple Sclerosisnew relapses and lymphocyte sub-populations to monitor the depletion induced by Campath-1H. Serial MRIs were performed in 20 patients fromcohort I.Results: Cohort I: Campath-1H was started 12 and 4 years (means) after dis- ease and progression onset, respectively. The mean duration of follow-up was6 years. The majority of patients showed progressive disability within the first18 months or 2-5 years after treatment in those who were initially stabilised.Cohort II: Campath-1H was given 1.7 years (mean) after disease onset.Although cases were selected for active relapsing-remitting disease a progres-sion was subsequently confirmed in 3 patients (onset 4-8 months before treat-ment). Mean number of relapses was 3/patient in the year before treatment andmean EDSS changed by 2.5 points. The mean duration of follow-up was 12 (3-25) months in the 8 RRMS patients. Three of them had a single relapse 3, 12and 15 months after treatment (without change in EDSS) representing a changein annualised relapse rate from 2.9 to 0.36. Of the 3 with SPMS, one continuedto worsen progressively, one had a single relapse at 18 months with increased disability and the third remained unchanged after 3.5 months. Conclusions: This study strengthens the evidence for greater efficacy of Cam- path-1H at an early phase of multiple sclerosis, when disease activity is attrib-utable to inflammation. These principles are now being adopted in a multi-cen-tre randomised trial comparing Campath-1H with interferon beta. Disclosure: E Le Page has nothing to disclose. P158 INTERFERON BETA INHIBITS MONOCYTE-DERIVED DENDRITIC CELL MATURATION McClurg AEa, EMa, JAa, Armstrong MAa aMicrobiology & Immunobiology, Queens University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom;bMedicine, Queens University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom;cPathology, Queens University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom Background: MS has a wide range of presentations and a spectrum of clinical courses, which is characterised by multifocal CNS damage, postulated to bemediated by T cells. Dendritic cells (DC) are the mostpotent antigen presenting cell known and are unique in their ability to initiateprimary immune responses. They are thought to play a pivotal role in the deci-sion between T cell activation and anergy. We have identified mature CD83+ DC in active MS plaque tissue, and have shown in in vitro studies that IFN , a disease-modifying drug used in the treatment of MS, can interupt the differen- tiation pathway of peripheral blood monocyte-derived DC.Objectives: To investigate the role of myeloid DC in MS. To determine if the efficacy of IFN is due to its ability to affect DC maturation. Methods: Monocytes were separated from whole blood and cultured for six days with GM-CSF and IL-4 to induce differentiation to dendritic cells. IFN was added at a physiological concentration. Maturation was then induced by addition of LPS, at different concentrations, for varying times. Expression andinduction of CD83, CCR5 and CCR7 was studied by flow cytometry. The LPS pathway was examined by western blotting for I B, to show NF B activation. Results: The resultant cell after IFN addition is intermediate in size between a monocyte and a DC, and expresses CD14 low, CD1alow, CD40+, HLA-DR+and CD16low, in ferent concentrations of LPS, which stimulates immature monocyte-derivedDC to mature and upregulate CD83, did not change their phenotype to eithermature DC or macrophages.Conclusions: The inability of LPS to stimulate these intermediate cells may mean they are anergic and unable to potentiate the immune response. The abil-ity of this drug to disrupt DC maturation may contribute to its efficacy as a dis-ease-modifying drug in MS. Disclosure: A McClurg has nothing to disclose.

Objectives: To compare the long-term efficacy and safety of two IFN prod- ucts in patients with RRMS in Catania, Italy. Methods: A prospectively designed observational study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of IFN -1a 30 mcg IM once weekly and IFN - 1b 8 MIU SC every other day in patients with RRMS in Catania, Italy. A retro- spective analysis of clinical efficacy data is presented; MRI, safety, and neu-tralizing antibody data will be presented later. A total of 107 patients (ages 20 to 54) were enrolled (IFN -1a, n=52; IFN -1b, n=55) and followed for 4 years. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, including mean age, gender, age at diagnosis, disease duration, and years on treatment. Before treatment, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores ( \u00b1SD) for IFN -1b patients. After 4 years of therapy, there were no differences between groups in mean EDSS scores (IFN -1a, 2.68 EDSS (p=0.42). The percentage of patients who had 1-point increase in EDSS or whose EDSS remained unchanged or was improved was similar between groups. The mean number 20% of IFN -1b patients experienced 4 relapses. There was no difference between groups in the percentage of patients who shifted to secondary progressive MS (IFN -1a, 27%; IFN -1b, 24%; p=0.87). efficacy between IFN -1a and IFN -1b after 4 years of treatment in patients with RRMS.

P160 SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE PULSES IN MULTIPLE Piacentini S, Sorbi S, Ponziani G, Amato M Dept. of Neurology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy Background: Intravenous (i.v.) pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide (CPM), an alkylating agent, has been preliminarily reported to be effective in patientswith progressive MS. Objectives: To assess the safety and tolerability of CPM pulse therapy in a cohort of MS patients who have been treated and prospectively followed-up inour Department since 1997.Methods: Patients had a definite diagnosis of MS, a PP, SP or RR course with high relapse rate, and were non respondent to previous treatments. CPM was administered i.v. (700 mg/m 2) monthly for 12 months, then bimonthly for other 12 months. CPM was associated with i.v. methylprednisolone 1 g, ondansetron8 mg and mesna 800 mg. Monitoring tests included: complete blood count anddifferential, platelet count, hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, protein fractions, urineanalysis and urine cultures performed twice a month. Overall tolerability of thetherapy was assessed by the patients on a visual analogue scale.Results: We treated 108 patients (62 women; 6 RR, 102 SP or PP cases; mean age 47 \u00b19.4 years; mean EDSS score 5.9 \u00b10.9; mean disease duration 13.8 \u00b16.8 years). The mean number of pulses was 10 \u00b15, and the mean duration of the fol- low-up period 2.2 \u00b11.4 years. Side effects were cause of suspension of the ther- apy in 22 (20.4%) cases: infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts were observed respectively in 58 (54%) and 7 (6.5%) subjects. Moreover, 35(32.4%) patients suffered from nausea and vomiting. Microscopic or macro-scopic hematuria and hemorrhagic S71 (4.6%) and 3 (2.8%) patients. Reversible menstrual abnormalities were reported by 2 (3.2%) women while definitive amenorrhea occurred in 4 (6.4%)patients, all over 35 years. Finally, transient hair loss was observed in 2 (1.9%)cases. Lymphopenia occurred in 17 (15.7%), increase of hepatic enzymes in 12(11%) and hypogammaglobulinemia in 6 (5.6%) patients. A mammary and abasal cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 2 (1.9%) women, both previouslytreated with azathioprine. Finally, 67% of the patients judged the treatment reg-imen as acceptable and well tolerated.Conclusions: Our findings point to a reasonable safety and tolerability of pulse therapy with CPM. Further trials are needed to define the efficacy of CPM as atherapeutic option for the most active forms of MS. Disclosure: E Portaccio has nothing to disclose. P161 EXPERIENCES WITH MITOXANTRONE TREATMENT - SIDE EFFECTS IN SECONDARY CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Rajda C, Bencsik K, T\u00f6r\u00f6k M, antineoplastic agent, often characterized as an immunosuppressant drug, has been approved for treating patients with second-ary chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. Recent studies have been shown anameliorating effect on disease activity, indicated by MRI and clinical data.Objectives: Side effect and drug interactions in patients with multiple sclerosis are limited.Methods: We report on 15 secondary chronic progressive multiple sclerosis patients treated with 20mg mitoxantrone every third month in a prospective 9-month study (Sept., 2001 - April, 2002). The male: female ratio was 4: 11, meanduration of disease was 13 years. The initial EDSS score was between 5.5 and 8.Results: After the mitoxantrone treatment 9 patients were stabilized, 3 patients showed improvement in the EDSS score, and 3 patients felt amelioration with-out EDSS score changes. One dropout was because of diffuse myocardiallesion, but none of the other patients exerted significant differences in theLVEF. One patient at the first treatment reported neusea, but the other twoadministration of mitoxantrone was without side effects. Vomiting was thecomplaint by 2 patients, and 1 patient complained about mild hair thinningafter the 3rd administration. No drug interactions between the earlier adminis-tered drugs and mitoxantrone were found.Conclusions: According to our data mitoxantrone treatment is well tolerated with minor side effects, decreasing disease activity, stabilizing the progressionof secondary chronic progressive multiple sclerosis.

P162 INTERFERON BETA DOSE REDUCTION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS: IMMUNOLOGICAL PROFILE Ricci A, Verdun E, Oggero A, Clerico M, Pipieri A, A, Durelli L Department of Neurosciences, Torino University, Torino, Italy - Piemonte, Italy Background: The efficacy of Interferon (IFN) beta-1b at dose of 8 MIU on alternate days s.c. in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, compared to placebo, hasbeen shown by several trials. The chronic administration of a drug on alternatedays reduce the compliance of patients and encourage the decision to reducethe IFN beta dose. A study of the correlation of the immunological, clinical andMRI effects of IFN beta dose reduction in MS patients is needed.Objectives: To evaluate the cytokine profile in MS patients before and after IFN beta dose reduction.Methods: 10 MS patients, after 3 years of IFN beta-1b treatment at 8 MIU on alternate days s.c., without any clinical and MRI signs of disease activity (no relapses or progression at EDSS 1 for at least 2 years, no new T2 or gadolin-ium-enhancing lesions in last two yearly scans), were gradually switched to IFN beta-1a 30 mcg i.m. once a week. We examined the levels of IFN-gamma,TNF-alfa, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 in supernatant of stimulated peripheral bloodmononuclear cell culture, and the titer of neutralizing interferon antibodies(NAb) in serum before and one year after the IFN beta reduction.Results: 90% patients (9 out of 10), one year after IFN beta reduction, had disease activity resumption with the occurrence of clinical relapses, sustained EDSS wors-ening, or new lesional activity on brain MRI scan. Before IFN beta reduction 2patients (20%) were NAb positive at titer >60, and they remained positive still oneyear after, with lower titers. One year after dose reduction IFN-gamma levels weresignificantly higher than before reduction in all patients (p=0.019). IL-10 levelswere similar or lower than baseline in 9 patients with disease activity; while theywere increased only in the patient free from disease activity for the whole year offollow up. No significant differences were found in IL-4, IL-12, TNF-alfa levels.Conclusions: The reduction of IFN-beta dose was associated with the resump- tion both of clinical-MRI signs of disease activity as well as of the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokineslevels.

Vollmer Preiningerova Ja, Markovic-Plese Sa, Rizzo Ma, Cutter Gb aNeurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA;bUniversity of Nevada, Reno, NV, Nevada, USA Background: Interferon Beta 1a or 1b are the most common disease modifying agents for MS (DMAMS) used today. Biologic effects of orally administeredinterferon have been demonstrated in animals.Objectives: We investigated the safety and efficacy of orally administered interferon beta 1a (Avonex\u00ae) in multiple sclerosis.Methods: A randomized, phase IIb trial assessed the safety and efficacy of two doses (0.1 MIU or 6 MIU) of oral interferon beta-1a given daily toRRMS patients. A 3-month baseline phase with monthly brain MRI was fol-lowed by a 6-month treatment phase with monthly MRI. Inclusion criteria:age 18 to 65, EDS 0 to 6.0, at least 2 relapses in the previous 3 years and atleast 0.67 lesions/scan on EDSS, MSFC, MS Performance Scales,Patient Determined Disease Steps, total burden of disease, number of T-2lesions and brain atrophy PBMC were meas-ured.Results: Twenty one subjects met study criteria (75% female, mean age 41.8 years and mean EDSS 3.7). 19 subjects completed the study. Twosubjects withdrew at 3 and 5 months of treatment for reasons other thanside effects. There was no treatment effect on number or volume ofGadolinium enhancing lesions in either treatment group at any time point.We observed 5 relapses/63 patient months in the baseline phase, 7relapses/63 patient months during the first three months of treatment and 0relapses/59 patient months in the last three months of treatment. There wasa significant decrease in the production of INF-gamma (p=0.02) in compar-ison to the baseline period. Other cytokine responses were variable, but notclearly due to treatment. No clear treatment effects could be identified onsecondary MRI or clinical outcome measures. No significant toxicitieswere noted.Conclusions: Although oral interferon beta-1a appeared safe at doses of up to 6 million IU/day, we were not able to identify a definite biologicalor clinical effect in low or high dose groups over a 6-month treatmentperiod.

We and others have shown GA toinduce high GA specific proliferative and cytokine responses in vitro in PBMCs of all individuals tested. Proliferation is decreased and cytokines are shiftedtowards Th2 during treatment. Objectives: To investigate whether there is a correlation between in vitro immunological and clinical responses to GA.Methods: 9 RR MS patients were examined prior to and after 2, 4, 6, 12 and 14 months of standard GA treatment. Proliferative and cytokine (IL-10, IL-5 and IFN) responses iso- lated PBMCs with 1-300 \u00b5g/ml GA in 96 well plates. 5 untreated RR MS patients were also tested. Without knowledge of the immunological findings, the treated patients were subdivided into responders (R) and non-responders(NR) to GA treatment based on relapse rate, cycles of steroid treatment andEDSS change during the first year of GA therapy as compared to the year priorto treatment.Results: 2 of 9 patients were considered clinical NR. Proliferative responses prior to treatment were comparable in treated and control patients. Immediatelybefore the first GA injection, proliferative responses were higher in the 2 NRthan in the other treated patients at all GA concentrations tested. At the inter- mediate GA concentration of 30 \u00b5g/ml, values were 83.885 and 91.816 cpm in the NR; the range in R was 9.161-73.616, the median 39.209 cpm. NR as well as controls had higher fluctuations of GA specific proliferative responses thanR. Around relapses, proliferation was increased in most patients. No clear rela-tion between clinical and cytokine responses was observed.Conclusions: We hypothesize that high in vitro proliferative responses to GA prior to treatment and around relapses are likely due to a general MS relatedincrease in inflammation. If GA is first injected in this proinflammatory envi-ronment, the desired immunomodulatory effects may be delayed or abrogated.Despite the small number of patients we have studied, our results suggest thatthe immunological status of patients immediately prior to initiation of GA ther-apy may affect clinical response to the treatment.

Pathology P165 SERUM PARAOXONASE ACTIVITY Background: Free radical and oxidative damage have been suggested as a casual factor in the development of MS. Oxidative injury could mediatedemyelination and axonal injury in MS subjects and in animal model. IFN-betahas shown to inhibit iNOS activity and suppress endogenous NO production,suggesting a protective effect against oxidative damage. Paraoxonase (PON) isan enzyme associated with plasma HDL and plays an important role against lipid peroxidation of LDL and HDL; its plasma activity is inversely related tothe occurance risk of several disease such as atherosclerosis, hypercholes-terolemia and inflammation.Objectives: To investigate the activity of PON in plasma of MS pts, in order to verify modificatio of PON activity during IFN-beta treatment. Methods: 30 pts with definited RRMS with EDSS<3.5 were studied. 20 pts were treated with IFN beta (group A)and 10 did not assume any drug(group B). The activity of PON in plasma of the two groups was comparedwith the activity of PON in 60 healty subjects (control group) matched forage and sex.Results: The mean value of plasma PON activity in the control group was 2946 +/- 228 U/ml. PON activity was statistically lower in group B (mean value1953 +/- 400 U/ml), whereas the difference of PON activity between group A(mean value 3113.5 +/- 425 U/ml)and controls was not statistically significant.Conclusions: These results show that PON activity is significantly decreased in plasma of untreated pts, whereas PON activity in treated pts is similar to healtysubjects, suggesting that IFN-beta therapy could modulate the PON activity inMS pts.

P166 METALLOTHIONEIN EXPRESSION IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Espejo Ca, Martinez-Caceres Barcelona, Spain;cDept. of Medical The Copenhagen, Physiology and Autonoma de Barcel ona, Spain Background: Metallothioneins (MT) are proteins with antioxidant proper- ties, which are induced in the CNS of mice with EAE. MT-I+II KO mice have raised inflammatory response and increased neurodegeneration duringEAE. MT-II treatment during EAE induces remission and reduces tissuedamage.Objectives: To determine MT-I+II expression and to analyse its relation with oxidative stress, apoptosis and axonal damage in MS brain lesions.Methods: From three MS patient brains, we analysed both active (n=15) and non-active (n=15) MS lesions. As controls, 15 sections from three brains ofpatients with non-neurological disease were included. MT-I+II expression,oxidative determined by immunohisto-chemistry. Positive cells per 0.5 mm2 were quantified and statistical analysesperformed.Results: MT-I+II expression was increased in MS, more in non-active lesions, and limited to astrocytes and activated macrophages/microglia,though absent in T lymphocytes, oligodentrocytes, and neurons. In MS brainlesions, cells undergoing apoptosis were mainly neurons but also astrocytesand oligodendrocytes, all of which suffered from oxidative stress. In non-active MS lesions, oxidative stress levels and apoptosis were reduced com-pared to active lesions. Neurons undergoing axonal damage suffered fromboth oxidative stress and apoptosis and cells expressing MT-I+II did not suf-fer from either.Conclusions: These results agree with what described for EAE, so it would be of interest to study a possible role of these antioxidant proteins in MS therapy. Disclosure: X Montalban has nothing to disclose. Funding: Supported by Background: Current interest in multiple sclerosis pathology is focused in axonal damage since it is supposed to cause progresion of the disability in MSpatients even when inflammatory activity has disminished or disappeared andthere are no relapses. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explainaxonal damage, such as axonal transection during inflammatory injury and wallerian degeneration of the transected neuraxis.We hipothesized that other neurodegenerative processes might be implied. Alpha-synuclein is thought toplay a key role in several neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple systematrophy (MSA), Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, etc and it has beenrecently found in axonal swellings of Neuroaxonal distrophies.Objectives: To study the presence of alpha-synuclein in multiple sclerosis plaques. Methods: We have studied by immunohistochemistry the presence of alpha-synu- clein in white matter of 10 normal subjects and in 30 multiple sclerosis plaques.Results: We have found alpha-synuclein immunoreactive deposits in 80% of MS plaques, but not in white matter controls.Conclusions: Deposition of alpha-synuclein in axonal swellings of plaques may imply just the presence of axonal damage, but it could suggest a newmechanism for disability progresion in multiple sclerosis patients.

Friday, September 20, 2002 Posters Rehabilitation and Quality of Life P168 PRESSURE PAIN IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Armutlu Kb, Ankara, 06100, Turkey;bDepartment Ankara, 06100, Ankaran, Turkey Background: Pain sense is vital. Low levels of pain sense are important during everyday task to tell us that prolonged posture is putting too much strain on ourbody. The pain sense may be affected in early stages of neurological diseasessuch as peripheral neuropathy and Multiple sclerosis (MS). These types of neu-rological diseases, especially MS, may progressiveley restrict mobilisation ofpatients. In these patients, loss of pain sense may cause severe pressure sores.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) and Pressure Pain Tolerance (PPTO) in subjects with Multiple Sclerosis(MS) and healthy people. PPT and PPTO in different stages in MS patientswere also investigated. Methods: This study included 31 subjects diagnosed as clinically definite MS and 31 healthy subjects with same age range group. Study group including sub-jects with MS were divided into 3 subgroups. According to Expanded DisabilityStatus Scale (EDSS) scores between 1 and 3.5 (n=12), between 4 and 6 (n=10),between 6.5 and above (n=9) were classified as early, mild and late stages,respectively. MS patients who had trigeminal neuralgia, and whose scores below24 in mini-mental test, were excluded from the study. Measurement of pressurepain was used by algometer. Assessments were performed on masseter muscle,bicipital tendon, thenar area, tip of middle finger and anterior proximal of thigh.Results: MS duration was 8.96+6.41 years and MS types were relapsing-remit- ting type and primary progressive type of MS patients. There was a significantdifference between MS group and control group in PPT and PPTO of masseter muscle, bicipital tendon, thenar area, middle finger tip and thigh (p<0.05).When three MS groups according to the stages compared, there was no signifi-cantly difference between the groups in these parameters (p>0.05).Conclusions: Our results showed that PPT and PPTO were significantly increased in MS patients. Possibility loss of pain perception should be taken into consideration when planing physiotherapy rehabilitation programs for MS patients. Patients and caregiver should be informed for this aspect.

P169 ASSESSMENT OF RELATION BETWEEN HANDICAP STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN AMBULATORY MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTSIN TURKEY Armutlu Kb, Guclu Ab, Cetisli Nb, Bosnak Ra University, Ankara, 06100, Turkey;bDepartment Turkey Background: Multiple Sclerosis(MS) results with a significant decrease in quality of life(QOL) by various kinds of handicap status. Additionally physicalconditions, social and cultural characteristics of countries may affect thepatients QOL.Objectives: In this study the relation between handicap status and QOL of ambulatory MS patients in Turkey has been evaluated.Methods: 71 patients(40 female, 31 male) were included our study. The mean age of patients was 38+8.79 years and the mean duration of illness was 8.22+6.27 years, the mean score of Expanded Disability Status Scale(EDSS) was 4.5+1.87. Handicap status was assessed with The London Handicap ScaleQuestionnaire(LHSQ). QOL assessed with Functional StatusQuestionnaire(FSQ). Similar items, which were physical activity, mobility,social activities and occupation, were examined. The correlation betweenEDSS and each associated questions were also examined.Results: It was observed that, there was a correlation between EDSS and items of physical activities of FSQ(p<0.05), while there was no significant correla-tion with items of physical activities and occupation(p>0.05). When the corre-lation between EDSS and LHSQs items were examined, it was seen that therewas a significant correlation with all items except orientation(p<0.05). It wasobserved that a significant relation between ADL items of FSQ and mobilityand physical activities items of LHSQ, there was not a relation between occu-pation items of FSQ and LHSQ(p<0.05). There was not any significant correla-tion between FSQs social activities items and LSHQs social integrationitem(p>0.05).Conclusions: As a result, there was a significant correlation between all handicap status and QOL items of ambulatory MS patients except social activities item. Andalso we thought that because of cultural differences we could not found any rela-tion according to social activities. It can be concluded that when the handicap sta-tus and QOL levels were evaluated, the social activities seen lower than expected. Disclosure: K Armutlu has nothing to disclose. P170 QUALITY OF LIFE, DISABILITY AND DEPRESSION IN EARLY MS Deloire-Grassin M, Ouallet J, Salort Segalen, Bordeaux Cedex, France Background: Health-related quality of life (QOL) assessment seems to reflect better the broad impact of MS than disability and impairment scales (EDSS,MSFC). Little is know about the quality of life at early stage of disease.Objectives: To assess the QOL in patients with MS a few weeks after the diag- nosis. To determine the correlation between QOL and disability (EDSS,MSFC), depression (MADRS) and fatigueMethods: 69 patients have been included by the AQUISEP network less than six months after a diagnosis of MS. All signed a written consent. Their charac- teristics were : 58 RRMS (mean PPMS (mean age 48.25 \u00b13.59) Each patient underwent a complete clinical assessment, including QOL using the french validated SEP-59 scale (French adaptation of MSQOL-54), EDSS, MS Functional Composite(MSFC), depression (MADRS) and fatigue (fatigue items of UKNDS). Corre-lations between each item of QOL SEP-59 scale and EDSS, MSFC (global andindividual Z scores), MADRS scores and fatigue scores were calculated forRRMS patients using the Fisher correlation coefficient (r). A stepwise regres-sion analysis was performed with general well-being score of quality of life asthe dependent variable and EDSS, Kurtzke FFS, MFSC, depression andfatigue. Results: A reduction of more than 30% of QOL was observed for 10 out of 15 scores of SEP59 in RRMS patients and all 15 scores in progressive patients atthe time of diagnosis. The lowest scores were obtained for the followingscores: role limitation physical, energy, sleep, health perception. EDSS andeach KFS were correlated with different items of QOL but MSFC is only cor-related with physical functions and health distress scores. Regression analysisrevealed that the overall QOL is independently associated with MADRS score, KFS mental (reflecting mainly cognitive complaints) and EDSS score which is mainly an impairment scale at the stage of the disease. Overall QOL was notassociated with MSFC.Conclusions: Health-related QOL is strongly affected at early stages of MS. Depression, cognitive complaints and neurological impairment are independ-ent predictors of overall QOL. Disclosure: B Brochet has nothing to disclose.

P171 AEROBIC TRAINING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS - INFLUENCE ONMETABOLIC, ENDOCRINE AND QUALITY OF LIFE PARAMETERS Heesen Ca, Gold Germany;bMedical Psychology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany;cSports Medicine, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;dSports Medicine, University of Halle, Halle, Thueringen, Germany Background: In contrast to the earlier view that physical exercise may poten- tially exacerbate symptoms in MS and should thus be avoided, aerobic traininghas recently been suggested as a therapeutic intervention. It is however notknown which groups of patients may benefit from such programs. Further-more, metabolic and endocrine responses to acute physical exercise in MS havenot been studied.Objectives: To examine the effects of aerobic exercise on metabolic, endocrine and quality of life parameters in MS.Methods: We investigated acute effects of a step-by-step bicycle ergometry and a continued exercise with 60% VO2-max in MS patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, MS patients received an eight week low-level train-ing (interval training) in a wait-list control-group design with a second exer-cise test after the training period. Acute changes during exercise in meta-bolic, cardiovascular and endocrine parameters were measured. Effects onmeasures of motor and coordinative function and quality of life were alsoanalyzed.Results: 47 patients (32 women, 17 men, mean age: 45, mean EDSS 2.6) and 20 controls (14 women, 8 men, mean age: 43) participated in the study. Com-plete data were availabe from 18 patients who underwent the training and 13who remained in the control group. 16 patients did not complete the study.Physical fitness increased in the training group despite the low-level training.Coordinative functions slightly but significantly improved while declining incontrols. Furthermore a beneficial effect on quality of life was seen. Inresponse to acute exercise, beta-endorphin showed larger increases in healthycontrols compared to MS patients (ANOVA time x group p=.018). However,differential effects of physical exercise on catecholamines, ACTH and cortisolsecretion were insignificant.Conclusions: Low-level aerobic training does improve quality of life parame- ters and coordinative functions in a group of MS patients with mild physicalimpairment. Furthermore, our findings indicate subtle alterations of endocrine response to physical stress in patients with MS. Disclosure: S Gold has nothing to disclose.

P172 ONE-YEAR CHANGES ON THE FUNCTIONAL Hoogervorst E, Kalkers N, Uitdehaag B, Polman C Neurology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Netherlands Background: The MS Functional Composite (MSFC) is an outcome measure comprising three quantitative tests of: leg function (Timed Walk Test [TWT]),arm/hand function (9-Hole Peg Test [9-HPT]) and cognition (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [PASAT]). The Guy s Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS) is a questionnaire divided in 12 subcategories, directed to assess a patient s disability in the previous four weeks, is based on patient-self report and is driven by patient interview. Objectives: The aim of this study was to prospectively characterise the rela- tion between one-year changes in functional impairment (MSFC) and changes in the patient s own perceived disability (GNDS) and their corresponding components. Methods: Two hundred and ninety MS patients underwent MSFC and GNDS examinations on the same day at baseline and 1-year follow-up. We studiedcorrelations between change in MSFC and GNDS and their correspondingcomponents. In addition we studied the change in total number of GNDS-sub-categories with scores 3 or higher (indicating disability for which help by oth-ers is required) per quartile of MSFC change.Results: Mean MSFC at baseline was 0.14 and at follow-up 0.086, median GNDS-sum scores were equal at baseline and follow-up, 14.0. Good cross-sec-tional correlations were at baseline (-0.60)and follow-up (-0.63), whereas no significant correlation was found betweenchange in MSFC and GNDS (-0.06). Weak to marginal correlations were foundbetween change in the corresponding components: TWT vs. lower limb func-tion r = -0.22 and 9-HPT vs. upper limb function r = -0.12. No correlation wasfound between change in the PASAT and cognition. Analysing the number ofGNDS subcategories or higher per quartile MSFC change, indi-cates that there is a profile of more pronounced worsening on the MSFC beingassociated with greater increase in number of GNDS subcategories for whichhelp is required and that vice versa those who have improved on the MSFChave the lowest increase. Conclusions: Our longitudinal data suggest that one-year changes in the MSFC, especially with respect to leg and arm function, are associated withchanges in disability as perceived by the patient.

P173 HIGH LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND DISTRESS IN MS PATIENTS AND THEIR PARTNERS IN THE FIRST YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS Janssens Ca,b, van Doorn Pa, de Boer Erasmus MC, Rotterdam Background: Shortly after diagnosis, MS patients and their partners have to deal with many uncertainties and potential serious disability. This may prolongthe uncertain and stressful period that had already started before disclosure ofdiagnosis. It is unknown how stressful this period is.Objectives: To evaluate the psychological impact of MS for patients and part- ners in the first years after diagnosis.Methods: Quality of life (SF-36), anxiety and depression (HADS) and dis- ease-related distress (IES) were assessed in 101 recently diagnosed (< 2 years)Multiple SclerosisPosters S75 MS patients and 78 partners. Quality of life, anxiety and depression were com- pared with general population controls and related to clinical characteristics.Differences were evaluated between patients and partners as groups and withincouples.Results: MS patients reported significantly poorer quality of life on 6 out of 8 SF-36 scales compared to general population controls. Quality of life was notreduced in partners. A considerable group of patients and partners had clinicalrelevant levels of anxiety (34% and 40%) and distress (36% and 24%). On agroup level, differences between patients and partners were not significant.Within couples, however, differences in psychological well-being were large(p < 0.001): patients had higher scores than partners in some couples, but lowerin others. In patients but not in partners, quality of life and psychological well-being were significantly related to severity of disability, but not to time sincediagnosis or first symptoms.Conclusions: Already in the early phase of the disease when most patients have relatively mild symptoms, MS seriously interferes with psychological well-being in patients and partners: a substantial sub-group of patients and part- ners had clinically significant levels of anxiety and distress. The absence of arelation with time since diagnosis suggests that emotional problems mayendure the first years after diagnosis. Disclosure: C Janssens has nothing to disclose.

P174 THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE INVENTORY ANDDISABILITY AS MEASURED BY THE EDSS: EXPERIENCE IN A BRAZILIANMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SAMPLE. Lana-Peixoto MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) is a broad outcome assessment battery which includes not only evaluation of phys-ical capabilities but also a variety of quality of life goals. The EDSS on theother hand is a disability scale that predominantly emphasizes evaluation ofgait. The relative strength of the physical component of the outcome on thequality of life can be assessed by correlating the MSQLI with the EDSS. Objectives: To correlate the MSQLI with the EDSS in a sample of Brazilian MS patients.Methods: The MSQLI consists of a set of separate scales that assesses 10 domains from the patient's perspective. It was individually administered to a group of 39 CDMS patients. The EDSS score was assigned by the clinic neu-rologist. Results: Thirty-nine CDMS patients (27 women and 12 male) were selected at random from our MS Research Center. Their mean age was 42,08 years(sd=9,1), mean formal schooling was 10,23 years (sd=4,25) and the mean dis-ease duration 8,86 years (sd=7,83). There were 23 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, 11 with secondary progressive MS and five with primary pro-gressive MS. The median EDSS was 3.5 and the mean Ambulation Index (AI)1,9 (sd=2,51). The patients scored poorly in some domains such as visual, blad-der and bowel control, cognition, sexual satisfaction and pain (indicating betterfunctioning or less pain). The SF-36 Physical Functioning Scale, SF-36 BodilyPain Scale, SF-36 General Health Scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, PainEffect Scale, Bladder Control Scale, Bowel Control scale and Impact of VisualImpairment Scale significantly correlated with the EDSS while the PerceivedDeficits Questionnaire, the Mental Health Inventory and the Modified SocialSupport Survey did not correlate with the EDSS scoreConclusions: As EDSS primarily measures ambulation it shows poor correla- tion with the scales that measure cognition, mental health, social support, sex-ual satisfaction and emotional aspects. Although quality of life is affected byphysical disability the EDSS fails to give a real account other importantdomains in human life.

Lana-Peixoto Haase VG, Lacerda SS CIEM MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is markedly influenced by disturbances of vision and vision-specific quality of life (VSQOL) isdecreased in MS patients. Experience of the ONTT revealed that patients withhistory of optic neuritis have decreased VSQOL.Objectives: To assess the role of positive history of optic neuritis in the decreased VSQOL in MS patients. Methods: VSQOL was measured by the National Eye Institute Visual Func- tion Questionnaire 25-item version (NEI-VFQ-25). Mean scores were calcu-lated for each subscale and for the composite score. Vision tests included cor-rected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision and automated perimetry.Only patients with CDMS and no history of other ophthalmic disorder wereincluded. The cohort was divided into two groups: Group I comprised MSpatients with previous history of optic neuritis; and Group II consisted of MSpatients with no history of optic neuritis. Results: There were 19 patients in Group I and 20 in Group II. MS was relapse-remitting in 23, secondary progressive in 7 and primary progressive in8. In Group I there were 16 women and 3 men; the median age was 44 years,and median EDSS was 4.0. In Group II there were 10 women and 10 men withmedian age of 40.5 and median EDSS of 3.0. Visual acuity in Group I rangedfrom 20/20 to NLP (median 20/20); in Group II it ranged from 20/15 to 20/40(median 20/20). Twenty patients had color vision disturbance (13 in Group Iand 7 in Group II) and contrast sensitivity function was abnormal in 17patients in Group I and 5 patients in Group II. The NEI-VFQ-25 CompositeScore was 82.9 (SD 23.2) (median 92.9) in the whole cohort, 72,9 (SD 28,9)(median 82.8) for patients in Group I, and 92.5 (SD 9,2) (median 96.7) in Group II. Comparison between score in the MS cohort and the Reference Group showed that the composite score and scores in most of the subscaleswere significantly lower in patients with MS. The NEI-VFQ-25 scores werenot significantly different in MS patients with or without previous history ofoptic neuritis.Conclusions: Previous history of optic neuritis seems not to play a role in the decreased VSQOL in MS patients.

McGuigan C, McCarthy A, Hutchinson M Dept. of Neurology, St Vincents, Dublin, Co. Dublin, Ireland Background: The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) is a validated outcome measure of the physical (MSIS 20) and psychological (MSIS 9)impact of MS. It's construct validity has not previously been independantlyexamined against recognised measures of physical and psychologicalimpact.Objectives: To assess the construct validity of the MSIS physical and psycho- logical components in a community based population with MS.Methods: 73 patients with clinically definite or probable MS (Poser criteris) were enrolled during the course of an epidemilogical study. The author individ-ually assessed each patient. A Kurtzke EDSS score was rated, Multiple SclerosisFunctional Composite (MSFC) score compiled and each participant was askedto complete a Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II), MSIS 20 and MSIS 9.Results: Study group characteristics included: average age 47.5 years (19-72); years since diagnosis 13.4 (1-41); female to male ratio 2.4: 1 and average KurtzkeEDSS 4.3 (0-9). The MSIS 20 showed a moderate correlation with the EDSSresults (r2 = 0.6808) and a weaker but significant correlation with the MSFCPosters S76 Multiple Sclerosisscores (r2 = 0.323). The psychological impact scale, MSIS 9 correlated well with the BDI-II (r2 = 0.6341). There was however an unexpected correlation betweenthe MSIS 20 (physical impact scale) and the BDI-II, significant at p = 0.022.Conclusions: Our study indicates the the convergent validity of the MSIS 20 and MSIS 9 are acceptable but suggests problems with the discriminant valid-ity of the MSIS 20, as it appears to be significantly influenced by mood. Fur-ther longitudinal studies are required to assess the validity of the MSIS beforeit is widely accepted for clinical trials. Disclosure: C McGuigan has nothing to disclose. P177 THE RELATION OF HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION IN A PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL Miller DMa, Cohen JAa, Tsao ECb, Kooijmans MFb aMellen Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, Ohio, USA;bBiogen, Inc, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Background: Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is increasingly used as an end point in MS trials. The influence of HRQoL on study discontinuation hasreceived far less attention. IMPACT was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded 2-year trial of IFN -1a in secondary progressive MS. Benefits of IFN -1a were shown on disease progression, relapse rate, MRI, and health related quality of life using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI). Objectives: Subject retention has an important effect on trial outcomes; little is know about factors that precipitate subject drop-out. These analyses assess theassociation of HRQoL and study discontinuation.Methods: MSQLI includes the generic SF-36 (2 component measures) and 9 disease-specific scales. The MSQLI was administered to english-speaking sub-jects in IMPACT at baseline, month-12 and month-24. Differences in baselineand change scores from baseline to month-12 were examined for completers(COMs) and non-completers (NON-COMs). Between group differences werecalculated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. Results: 325 subjects provided HRQoL data; 258(79%) were COMs. baseline and month-12 data; the remainderprovided only baseline data. At baseline, COMs had greater perceived cogni-tive deficits (P=.02) and this trend, while not significant, was present withinboth treatment groups. In contrast, there was a trend for greater baseline tomonth-12 problems with perceived deficits in the NON-COMs. SignificantMSQIL change factors included: worsening fatigue in NON-COMs (overall (P=.021) and the IFN -1a group (P=.047)) and in the IFN -1a NON-COM group (P=.015). Conclusions: There is evidence that HRQoL factors affect subject retention in this study. The pattern of influence appears to change over the course of thestudy. It is recommended that future investigations of factors that influenceretention should include HRQoL. Disclosure: Drs. Kooijmans and Tsao are employed by Biogen, Inc.

P178 AN OBJECTIVE FOLLOW-UP OF UPPER LIMB FUNCTION of Medicine, Technion, Haifa Background: In Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite the function of the upper limb is assesed by the 9-Hole Peg Test (9PHT).Objectives: To assess the use of a computerized visuo-motor test (VMT) for the quantitative longitudinal follow-up of ar function in multiple sclerosis (MS).Methods: Mild-to-moderate relapsing remitting MS patients (EDSS< 5.5) were evaluated every 3 months for 9 months, excluding those whose recent relapsesinduced a clinical change in arm function. Each time the 9HPT and the VMT were administered. The VMT consisted of a sinusoidal tracking task performedwith unseen hands, in which feedback was given through a screen cursor. Vari-ables of arm movement direction and error were derived from each perform-ance to calculate a Global Performance Index (combined from 50% directionalerror and interruptions) at each session. Performance at baseline was comparedto that at the end of follow-up. All patients were right handed and tests wereadministered for both hands.Results: 21 patients (17 female), mean age+ SD: 41+ 11 years were examined. The duration of disease was 11+ 8 years. The mean performance at baseline in the 9HPT was 29+ 9 seconds for the right arm and at the end of follow-up 29+ 10 sec- onds(p=0.365).For the left arm the mean 9HPT was 24+ 12 seconds and 32+ 14 at the end of follow-up (p=0.480).The Global Performance Index was 3485+ 3556 for the right hand at baseline and worsened to 4707+ 3796 (p=0.085). For the left arm, baseline performance and declined to 4675+ 5791 (p=0.065). Conclusions: The VMT was able to detect sub-clinical decline in arm function in mild to moderate MS patients who did not apparently worsen in the 9HPT.Objective and subtle methods of measurement are mandatory for the longitudi-nal follow-up of MS patients.

P179 THE RELATION BETWEEN DECONDITION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLEWEAKNESS AND FATIGUE Sportive Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic;cSAS Institute, Prague, Czech Republic Background: The decondition and respiratory muscle weakness can be poten- tial causes of fatigue in MS.Objectives: We monitored functional and respiratory parameters, their relation to fatigue and location of reliable prognostic factors associated with dyspnea in MS.Methods: 54 MS outpatients (14 men, 40 women) without recent clinical relapse and acute respiratory illness were studied. Disability was evaluatedaccording to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), fatigue according toModified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Fatigue severity scale (FSS), respira-tory parameters on spirometer by flow/volume method, functional parameterson bicycle spiroergometer using the anaerobic threshold method. Obtained val-ues were compared with the normal controls. Statistical analyses were carriedout using Statistical Analysis System. Results: EDDS of subjects RQ, from the normal controls. PEF (p<0,001) and MEF75, ERV, FVC, FEV1 did not differ from the normalcontrols. We found a correlation between fatigue and functional parametersVTex, VO(2)/kg/ml, MET, O(2)HR (p<0,05), W/kg, VE/kg and relativeweight (p<0,1). We did not find any correlation between fatigue and respira-tory parameters, even though a larger percentage (53,71%) of the patients com-plained of dyspnea. The 10% reduction of value VTex increases the probabilityof respiratory dysfunction 1.353 times. Conclusions: The decondition occurs even in people with relatively low degree of disability. It participates in the origin of fatigue. Significantly decreased values of the expiratory flow, which may reflect muscle weakness, do not participate in the origin of fatigue. Value VTex seems to be prognosticfactors associated with dyspnea in MS. The confirmation of results could helpto find an advisable prescription of load and lead to global changes in theapproach to rehabilitation of MS people.

Second, MS has an unpre-dictable nature makes it difficult for patients to gain a sense of control overtheir illness. Over the past decade health related quality of life (HRQOL)instruments have become increasingly popular as end-point tools in clinicalstudies for measuring patient-assessed health status. Research on quality of lifeassessment in MS is still limited. Recently the SF-36 was supplemented by 18additional items (MS-18 modul) MS of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) questionnare spesific for MS patients. Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine the correlation between HRQOL and clinical status.Methods: We have used MSQOL-54, which was culturally adapted for Turk- ish MS population, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). 184 clini-cally definite MS patient (139 female, 45 male) were included in the study.They were over 18 years of age. Mean age was 39.2 (18-68 years), mean dis-ease duration was 6.69 (2-29 score 4.4% Results: Mean mental health composite was 63.48 (13.64-100), mean physical health composite was 60.70 (5.08-98.3). The EDSS was significantly associ-ated with both physical and mental health composite (p<0.05). Sensory func-tional system was significantly associated with physical health composite(p<0.05). Conclusions: We concluded that pyramidal and cerebellar functional disorders are the main factors to have negative effects on HRQOL in MS, and sensoryfunctional disorder has a marked negative effect on physical health compositeof HRQOL in MS.

P181 CROSS-CULTURAL ADAPTATION AND VALIDATION OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (MSQOL-54) IN TURKISHMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS POPULATION Idiman E, Uzunel Oguz Z of Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease with multiple neurologic impairments. The disease can also dramatically affect thequality of life of the patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the validation of the trans- lated and cross-cultured adapted MS Quality of life-54 (MSQOL-54) on 183Turkish MS patients.Methods: One hundred eighty-three of MS patients who met the inclusion cri- teria were enrolled into the study. Patients were classified into three severitygroups according to the expanded disability status scale (EDSS): Group I(EDSS 0-3.5), 6-8). MSQOL-54 ques-tionnaire were translated into Turkish, culturally adapted, and validated in 183patients. Working, health insurance, marital status and education level werecompared with the MSQOL-54. Results: The mean age of the 183 patients (138 female and 45 male) were 39 years. The questionnaire were well accepted, but small cultural adaptations were required.From the different groups, only in the group I EDSS score was significantly associ-ated with the physical health composite. None of the other groups and parametersshowed correlation with physical health composite nor mental health composite.Conclusions: Assessment of quality of life of MS patients is indipendent from disease severity, and disability level is important in the general evaluation pro-cedure. The MSQOL-54 was easily administered and well accepted in the Turkish MS population. Disclosure: S \u00d6zakbas has nothing to disclose. P182 QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MS PATIENTS: REFERENCE STANDARDS FROM A LARGE PANEL OF PATIENTS Pierre C, DIDIER V, Laurent G, Maryline L, Dominique A, Aur\u00e9lien M CHU, CLERMONT FERRAND, France Background: Quality of Life (QoL) assessment for MS patients is a major part of the evaluation of therapies and care. The QoL questionnaires are nowapplied to a large number of patients, leading to standards reference that maybe closer to every type of patients. We have known a valid QoL questionnaire,such as the SEP59, a French trans-cultural adaptation of Barbara Vickrey's MSQoL 54.Objectives: We analyzed a 423 patients large database in order to define the various profiles for QoL and to group the patients in homogeneous clustersaccording to the main characteristics of their disease.Methods: We considered patients having a confirmed MS from various cohort surveys at their first assessment. They all have fulfilled the SEP59QoL ques-tionnaire. We have also collected data from their clinical assessment such asdefined in EDMUS (European Database for MUltiple Sclerosis). Analysiscombined one and two ways analysis to select the clinical variables, which per-mit to create homogeneous QoL group of patients, and multiple linear regres-sions as well as logistic regressions in order to create the groups and to check their validity. Results: The main variables related to QoL were the EDSS score (0-3, 3.5 - 6, > 6), the age of the disease. (+ 10 years), a remittent or a progressive form andthe period since the last peak of the disease. By combining these variables,Multivariate analysis revealed 8 clusters of homogeneous QoL patients.Conclusions: It is now possible to compare every patient to his QoL group and we have to assess how this comparison helps to improve both patients' care andmedical decisions.

P183 FRONTAL SYNDROME AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN MS PATIENTS Pierre C, Didier D, Delphine L, C\u00e9line T, Florence B, CHU, CLERMONT FERRAND, France Background: QoL assesment is an important issue for the evaluation of thera- pies and care strategies in MS. But, cognitive disorders, mainly frontal, are fre-quent in MS patients, and they can modify their reponse to QoL question-naires. Those aspects of frontal dysfunction could be important in relation totheir QoL.Objectives: To determine in MS patients, with stables motor handicap and global cognitive state, if frontal dysfunction impairs their perception of qualityof life (QoL).Methods: The survey was made among 101 MS patients, 21 male and 80 female, 19 - 70 years-old (m=44 +/- 10). EDSS score was less than 7.5 (3.55 +/-2.18), Mini Mental State more than 24, and the Hamilton depression scale lessthan 14. Neuropsychological batteries were : WAIS.R, Grober and Buschke,Stroop, Wisconsin card scoring test, and categorial fluency test. QoL assesmentused SEP-59, a valid QoL questionnaire which is adap-tation of Barbara Vickrey's MS QoL 1/ Significant correlations between neuropsychological tests ; 2/ No correlation between the dimensions in QoL scale and neurospychological tests, whatever the EDSS score was (< 4 or ? 4).Conclusions: A possible dissociation in the frontal syndrome, i.e. cognitive and comportemental dysfunctions, could explain these results.

A number of studies have been published whichhave examined qol in patients with ms suffering from low to moderate physicaldisability (EDSS < 5.5). The investigators found a decrease in various qol-domains. Little is known about qol of severely disabled ms-patients and aboutthe predictors of qol in this population. Objectives: The sample consisted of 21 ms-patients (11 men) with a mean EDSS-Score of 6.905 (range, 5.5 - 9.0), a mean disease duration of 19.05 years(range, 7 - 38) and a mean age of 51.38 years (range, 35 - 76).Methods: We assesed qol with the Euroqol, symptoms anxiety and depression with the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), cognitive functionwith the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), social support with theMOS Social Support Survey (MSSS), a linear regression analysis depression was the by far strongest pre- dictor for qol (R2= .405; p= on depres- sion, cognitive performance and coping, qol of severely disabled ms-patientscan be improved. This is an importang finding, because this sample does notfulfill the criteria of new disease-modifying drugs. Disclosure: S Ritter has nothing to disclose. P185 QUALITY OF LIFE AND COST OF ILLNESS IN MITOXANTRONE TREATED MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS. Vollmer TLa,b, Hadjimichael Oa, Buenconsejo Ja aNeurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA;bNeurology, VA Conn Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA Background: Progression of disability in MS is associated with deterioration in quality of life (QOL). Mitoxantrone is an FDA approved therapy for aggres-sive relapsing and secondary progressive MS patients. Objectives: We are conducting a five year study to evaluate the relationship between disease activity and progression of disability/handicap, cost of diseaseand the quality of life (Q&C study) among patients who are participating in theRENEW (Mitoxantrone Safety Trial) trial. We report on a comparison ofdemographic characteristics of study patients treated with mitoxantrone (Q&C)to NARCOMS Registry patients also treated with mitoxantrone (NRM) and toNARCOMS patients who are currently treated with interferons or glatirameracetate (ABC). Methods: After informed consent, patients complete a set of questionnaires measuring disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS)), handicap(Performance Scales), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), QOL (SF12and Health Utilities Index). The PDDS estimates the EDSS. The PerformanceScales measure handicap in ten neurological domains. Results: The mean age of the 162 Q&C patients currently enrolled and that of 174 NRM participants is similar (46 years, sd=8.7). For the 10,607 ABCpatients the mean age is 44 years. Q&C patients include slightly more femalesand more Caucasians, have higher income and more have private insurancethan the other two groups. The two mitoxantrone treated groups have more col-lege and post-college graduates. However, 43% of the ABC group is employedversus 27% of the Q&C and 18% of the NRM patients. Both mitoxantrone treated groups had more relapses within the last year (2.5 and 2.6 vs. 2.0), and both had a higher disability score (PDDS=5.0 and 5.5) than the ABC group(PDDS=3.4). Conclusions: Patients enrolled in the RENEW study are similar to mitox- antrone treated patients in the Registry, and both these groups have moresevere MS than the average ABC treated patients. Mitoxantrone treatment may be more available to those who have adequate insurance and income to coverits cost. Data will be presented on cost of disease, fatigue, depression, and QOLin mitoxantrone treated MS patients.

P186 EVOLUTION OVER A 3 MONTH PERIOD OF GLOBAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL,AND SOCIO-PROFESSIONAL FUNCTIONING IN PATIENTS WITHRELAPSING REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, DURING AVONEX\u00aeTREATMENT INITIATION Warter Ja, Gentin Mb aService de Strasbourg, Strasbourg cedex, France;bBIOGEN, Nanterre, France Background: This open, non comparative, multicentric study has been per- formed on patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), new to any interferontreatment.Objectives: Study's objective was to evaluate the evolution of global, psycho- logical, and socio-professional functioning in these patients during the firstmonths of Avonex\u00aetreatment. Methods: After a 2 week pre-inclusion period, patients were receiving a weekly intramuscular injection of 30 \u00b5gram of Avonex\u00ae for 12 weeks. GFS (global functional evaluation), MADRS (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale), CGI-S (clinical global impression, severity) and tolerance wereassessed every 4 weeks visit 1(V1) to visit 4 (V4). Results: 594 patients (71.9 percentage (%) women) aged 39 \u00b110 years have been included between May 2000 and May 2001. At V1 and V4 respectively, GFS score was was 4.9 \u00b14.5 and 4.5 \u00b14.6. Conclusions: There is no significant statistical change between V1 and V4 for the principal efficacy outcome (GFS) which remains stable. In addition,MADRS and CGI-S scores do not show any significant change from baseline.45 patients (7,5%) were withdrawn from the trial, 36 for adverse events (AE)and 9 for other reasons. Flu-like symptoms have been the main AE reported, by69.4% of patients at V2, 44.4% at V3 and 35.8% at V4, their frequency andintensity decreasing along with Avonex\u00ae treatment continuation. This study,carried out on a large number of patients shows no change in global, psycho-logical, and socio-professional functioning assessed by GFS in MS patientsduring the 3 first months of treatment with Avonex\u00ae. In addition, there is nochange in depressive mood assessed by MADRS nor in global psychologicalfunctioning assessed by CGI-S.

P187 SITUATION OF MEDICAL CARE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLESCLEROSIS Until now the state of medical care, rehabilitative medical care and socio-medical care of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in Germany has notbeen subject of a study. Objectives: This investigation gives an overview of the situation of MS patients in north-eastern Germany. Methods: The study is based on a structured questionnaire containing 64 items in the following categories: epidemiological-medical, psychological andMultiple SclerosisPosters S79 socio-medical. Data of 128 questionnaires were retained for this study. The following evaluation focuses on socio-medical aspects and rehabilitative med-ical care.Results: Mean age of the enrolled 33 male and 95 female patients 47.4 years (range 22 to 80 yrs). At onset of the disease the patients mean age was 30.4years (range 10 to 60 yrs). The mean interval between onset and diagnosis was4.6 years. Of 42 patients with primary relapsing-remitting MS and 55 patientswith secondary progressive MS 40.2 % do not receive causal oriented medica-tion. 53.1% of patients find the provided care good or very good. Only 2.3 %were poorly cared for. The overall majority (77.3%) has a sound fnancial situ-ation. 21.9% of the enrolled patients however, find their financial situationinsecure. For more than 75% of all patients physiotherapy is important, butonly 43.7% receive regular treatment. 37.7% did not participate in medicalrehabilitation and 93.7% were not professionally rehabilitated. 48.4 %expressed total dissatisfaction with the information obtained about the disease.Whereas 33.6% of MS patients feel accepted by the general public, 24.2 % think that public acceptance is bad. For 30.6% quality of support by the authorities is good, 21.6% of the surveyed patients find provided support bad.Conclusions: Only a part of the patients is receiving a causal oriented medica- tion for multiple sclerosis. Partially, disputed medical treatments (long termsteroid treatment) are applied for a part of the examined patients (6.3%). Only43.7% of the patients receive regular physiotherapie.

Symptomatic Management P188 GLATIRAMER ACETATE [GA] TREATMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON CONTROLLING FATIGUE-INDUCED TREMOR AMPLITUDEIN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Dogan S, Konopacki R, Brooks BR Neurology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA Background: Tremor and fatigue are the most common movement disorders found in MS patients due to pathological changes in specific myelinated tracts. Fatigueand tremor interfere with activities of daily living. To date, no research has beenconducted to determine the effects of fatigue on tremor amplitude in MS patients.Objectives: Evaluate the efficacy of GA therapy in controlling the amplitude of postural tremor [PT] after fatigue-inducing task in MS patients.Methods: Each patient underwent a standard computerized tremor assessment before and after 30-40 seconds of fatigue task. The accelerometer was attached to the dorsum of the hand. The patient was instructed to keep the accelerometer attached arm out-stretched in front for five seconds of data collection at 200samples per second. There was a five seconds of relaxation period after eachrepetition. In order to induce fatigue in tested arm, the patient was instructed tokeep his/her arm in front out-stretched for 30-40 seconds. Three consecutiverecords were collected without rest period in between. The amplitude and fre-quency of bilateral hand PT was determined offline using standard algorithms(FFT) employing uniaxial accelerometer input for computer analysis. The dis-tribution of ratio of post-fatigue/pre-fatigue PT amplitude data was obtainedfor each patient to determine the effect of fatigue on PT amplitude.Results: The amplitude of PT worsened after fatigue tasks in both GA-treated and non-GA-treated MS patients (N=96;GA=52,non-GA=44). The amplitude of PTworsened in each group after vs post-non-GA=.0725g g=9.81 m/s/s). Paired t-test no significant difference (p=.132) betweenpre- and post-fatigue GA-treated patients group indicating GA-treated MS patientsdid not get fatigue much during 30-40 seconds of fatigue task. Howevere, therewas a statistically significant difference (p=.0196) between pre- and post-fatiguenon-GA-terated patients group indicating fatigue made PT amplitude much worse.Conclusions: GA treatment has a beneficial effect on ameliorating the post- exercise fatigue-induced PT amplitude seen after 30-40 seconds of sustainedposture in MS patients.

P189 OSTEOPOROSIS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TREATED WITHCORTICOSTEROIDS Havrdova Tyblova M, Stepan J, Zikan V, Horakova D, Ticha V, Novakova I Dpt. of Internal Medicine, Charles University, Praha, Czech Republic Background: Corticosteroids (CS) used for treatment of acute relapses in MS may induce loss of bone as a result of inhibition of gastrointestinal absorptionof Ca, reduction of tubular reabsorption with hypercalciuria, suppressionof gonadal hormones secretion, and inhibition of recruitment and activity ofosteoblasts. The combination of CS administration and immobility in MS maylead to higher incidence of osteoporosis. Objectives: To determine mineral bone density (MBD) loss in patients with MS. Methods: 299 patients with MS (59 males, age 41.7 \u00b112.3 yrs and 240 females, age 44.1 \u00b110.7 yrs) followed in MS Center, Dpt. of Neurology, First School of Medicine, Charles University, Praha, underwent MBD density exam- ination (neck, lumbar region, femoral trochanter). The dose of CS used in thetreatment of MS, administered either orally or intravenously, was counted.Kurtzke EDSS was used to determine the ability of MS patients to move in ver-tical position. All fractures were documented.Results: Osteoporosis defined as loss of bone mineral - 2.5 SD of age and sex- matched controls was found in 25% of patients, 30% of them had a history ofbone fractures. Most of them were in SP MS. 38% of postmenopausal femalepatients with osteoporosis had a history of bone fracture. Only 2,7% patients inRR MS had osteoporosis. The average amount of CS used in the MS therapy in these patients was 27 \u00b116 g. Osteopenia (- 1 to - 2.5 SD) was found in 45% of patients, the fractures occured in 10% of these patients. Kurtzke EDSS was lower than in patients with osteporosis - 4.42 \u00b11.97. The amount of steroids used for MS treatment did not differ from the whole group. 28% of patients had no decrease in MBD. The amount of steroids used in their treatment was 21 \u00b1 19g, their Kurtzke EDSS did not exceed 4.0, half of them were still in remittent phase of the disease. Conclusions: MBD loss in MS patients occurs not only due to repeated use of CS but also due to decreased mobility. Female postmenopausal patients withcombination of CS administration and loss of ability to walk are in danger ofbone fractures. The most effective method of bone density examination was themeasurement of MBD in trochanter. Osteoporosis found in this region is pre-dictive of bone fractures.

P190 BOTULINUM TOXIN IN THE TREATMENT OF DETRUSORHYPERREFLEXIA IN CASE Republic;bUrological Clinic, University Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) often affects the genitourinary tract. The most common finding is the detrusor hyperreflexia and detrusor-sphincterdyssynergia. The patients suffer from urgency, frequency, urge incontinence,difficulties in emptying the bladder and urinary infections. Under these condi-tions the upper urinary tract could be occasionally damaged. Objectives: Most extended therapeutic concept is treatment with anticholiner- gic drugs, but its effectiveness could be insufficient. Since few years the detru-sor intramusculary injection of the botulinum toxin (BT) has been described asPosters S80 Multiple Sclerosisa therapeutic option in the patients with detrusor hyperreflexia following the spinal cord injury, not responding to anticholinergic therapy. We reffer aboutuse of the BT in MS patient. Methods: M.J. 32 years old, MS patient. The voiding symptoms are present for 4 years. She suffered from urgency, frequency and urge incontinence. Intermit-tent catheterisation and different anticholinergic effect. 10/2001 BT-1.000 IU have been injected intothe 40 locations of the detrusor. Results: The patient is continent, urge-symptom-free and very satisfied 8 month after the BT application. She empties the bladder by intermitent self-catheterisation 5x per day, without any need of anticholinergic drugs. No uri-nary tract infections were observed, catheterised volumes are 500-600 ml. Bothcystometric capacity (180ml to 577 ml) and residual volume have significantlyincreased (100 - 150 ml to 500 - 600 ml), intravesical pressure has significantlydecreased (65 cm H2O to 15 H2O).Conclusions: Botulinum toxin was successfully administered in our MS patient with good relief from urinary symptoms We consider this therapy use- ful for patiens with refractory incontinence due asso-ciated with P Hradilek has nothing to disclose. P191 SPASTICITY IN MS PATIENTS IN THE NARCOMS REGISTRY: PREVALENCE, SEVERITY AND TREATMENT PATTERNS USING ORALAGENTS aNeurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA;bNeurology, VA Conn Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA Background: Systematic survey of treatment of spasticity and related quality of life issues is lacking in MS patients. Objectives: We investigated the prevalence, severity and treatment patterns of spasticity in 21,130 MS patients in the NARCOMS Registry. Methods: The Registry collects data on demographics, MS related history, dis- ability status, and immunologic and symptomatic therapy. Results: MS patients with moderate to severe spasticity are more likely to be male and older in age, with longer disease duration, more frequentrelapses, and more MS related disability than patients with mild or minimalspasticity. Among those with relapsing-worsening MS, 21% report moder-ate spasticity that affects their activities several times a week, and 27% report severe or total spasticity. Overall, 44% of patients use oral anti-spas- ticity agents, most frequently baclofen; 17% use more than one oral agent(tizanidine, gabapentin, diazepam, clonazepam). In addition, those withmoderate to severe/total levels of handicap due to spasticity, 1.6% 3.2%respectively, use intrathecal administration of baclofen (ITB), frequently incombination with an oral drug. Patients treated with ITB have more educa-tion, but are less likely to be employed (20% vs. 29%), and more likely tobe disabled (65% vs. 50%) than those using oral drugs only. Their meandisability score is significantly higher than the oral drug group (PatientDetermined Disease Steps=6.2 vs. 4.7), and their handicap score is worsewith respect to mobility, hand function, bladder and sensory symptoms.Those using ITB have an elevated mean spasticity score compared to thoseon oral medication only (2.9 vs. 2.5). Logistic regression analysis showsthat given similar disability and spasticity levels, patients with higherincome, younger age, who are treated by MS specialist neurologists, andvisit physiatrists and physical therapists are more likely to be prescribed anITB pump.Conclusions: Spasticity is associated with higher levels of disability in MS patients. Sociodemographic factors and healthcare resources used influencetreatment strategies recommended by physicians. Quality of life issues will beexplored in relation to specific treatments.

However, little is known about the variability in the qualities ofthe neuropathic pain experience. The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS), is a 10item numerical rating scale (each item is rated 0-10, range is therefore 0-100),which we have previously shown to be valid and reliable in assessing the qual-itative and quantitative aspects of neuropathic pain in MS.Objectives: To determine the variation in the components of chronic neuro- pathic pain in people with MS, using the NPS.Methods: Thirty one patients with MS and neuropathic pain, were interviewed to determine the presence and location, using a body map, of their (mostsevere) neuropathic pain and then invited to complete the NPS on seven con-secutive days, at the time of day when their identified pain syndrome wasexpected to be at its worst.Results: Six patients were male, mean age 47 years (range 32-71), mean EDSS 5.4 (2.5-8.5), 3 had primary progressive, 9 secondary progressive and 19relapsing-remitting MS. The sites of neuropathic pain were as follows: 21lower limbs, 3 upper limbs, 3 hemi body, 3 neck, 1 back, 16 pains were bilat-eral. The average duration of pain was at least 9.9 years (range 1.5-30, SD 7.6).During the 7 day period, the mean of the 10 item NPS total varied between 47.4and 51.8 for the group. We have previously shown that 64% of the variance inthe NPS is accounted and \"Cold\". During the 7 day assessment period, the mean offactor 1 (maximum 40) varied between 23.6 and 26.4 (range 0-40, average SD8.6), factor 2 (maximum 40) between 15.3 and 18.4 (range 0-40, average SD9.8) and factor 3 (maximum 30) between 12.8 and 13.9 (range 0-30, averageSD 6.4). The mean correlation between the 10 item NPS total was r=0.735, forfactor 1, r=0.658, factor 2, r=0.7512 and factor 3, r=0.833.Conclusions: Chronic neuropathic pain in MS can achieve relatively constant levels of severity adding to the burden of illness in these patients.

P193 BURDEN OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN IN MS Rog DJa,b, Young CAa,b aNeurological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom;bWalton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom Background: Central neuropathic pain occurs in between 17 and 52% of peo- ple with MS. However, little is known about the burden of neuropathic pain inMS, in terms of its qualities, duration, intensity, exacerbating factors, associ-ated subjective sensory phenomena and response to treatment.Objectives: To establish the burden of neuropathic pain in people with MS. Methods: A convenience sample of 31 patients with MS and neuropathic pain, were interviewed and indicated the presence of any (neuropathic and non-neu-ropathic) pain syndromes on a body map. For each pain syndrome, its duration,time course, severity, qualities, response to treatment and therapy, presence ofassociated numbness, allodynia, hyperpathia, hyperalgesia and likely aetiologywere determined.Results: Six patients were male, mean age 47 years (range 32-71), mean EDSS 5.4 (2.5-8.5), 3 had primary progressive, 9 secondary progressive and 19relapsing-remitting MS. A total of 113 pain syndromes (mean 3.6, range 109)were identifed, 89 (79%) of which were felt to be in origin (meanMultiple SclerosisPosters S81 2.8, range 1-7). Neuropathic pains were located as follows: 42 lower limbs, 27 upper limbs, 6 neck, 4 each for back and eye, and 2 each for head, trunk andhemi body pains. Thirty-nine (44%) were paroxysmal and the mean duration ofneuropathic pain was 8.7 years (range 0.02-40, SD 8.5). Mean severity of neu-ropathic pain on a 0-10 numerical rating scale was 5.2 (range 1-10, SD 3.7).Thirty-five pains (39%) were spontaneous and 54 (61%) were evoked, mainlyby fatigue in 27 (50%), changes in temperature 15 (28%), touch 12 (22%) andmovement 7 (13%). Two neuropathic pains were evoked by menstruation. Sev-enty percent of neuropathic pains were associated with subjective numbnessand 39 (66%) with a form of allodynia, 41 (46%) with hyperpathia and 21(24%) with hyperalgesia. Only 2 neuropathic pains were completely relieved(temporarily) by analgesia, 21 were mildly and 14 moderately relieved. Othertherapies including TENS and acupuncture were tried in only a small minorityof patients and brought mild to moderate relief of only 3 neuropathic pains. Conclusions: Neuropathic pain remains a considerable burden to people with MS with respect to its long duration, multiple locations, severity, associated unpleasant sensory phenomena and resistance to analgesia and therapy.

P194 FATIGUE ASSESSMENT BY MECHANICAL AND MYOELECTRICAL OUTPUT DURING SUSTAINED MAXIMAL ISOMETRIC VOLUNTARYCONTRACTION IN AJa,b, Performance Lab, Dept Med Sch, Madison, Wisconsin, USA;bNeurol Svc, Wm S Middleton Memorial VA Med Ctr, Madison, Wisconsin, USA Background: Motor fatigue(F) measured as the decline in maximal isometric voluntary contraction [MVIC] has been reported in MS as FFI. Surface elec- tromyography (sEMG) is used to study F by measuring changes in sEMG sig-nal in time and frequency domain. During MVIC, sEMG amplitude decline andthe median frequency (MF) shift to lower values. The decline in amplitudereflects F induced by decrease in recruitment and/or firing rate. The shift in MFreflects decline in muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). As F progresses,changes in the muscle-fiber-membrane permeability interfere with the normalpropagation of action potentials leading to a decrease in MFCV.Objectives: To simultaneously measure changes in mechanical and myoelec- trical output in elbow flexors and foot dorsiflexors in MS.Methods: MVIC was collected from 16 normal control (NC) and 18 MS patients, using a force transducer. sEMG signal was measured by connectinga preamplifier with integral electrodes to the surface of the skin on testedmuscle with a reference electrode on the back of the hand. The EMG signal isamplified (gain = 1000) and filtered (band pass = 25 to 250 Hz) before beingsampled. Both signal voltages are connected to the computer via 12-bit dataacquisition board for display. Digital signal processing (plotting and analyz-ing) was implemented using custom made software (Visual Basic). Declinein force was expressed as FFI = 100 * [1 minus (AUC 25 to 30 / AUC 2 to7)]. Compression in the power spectrum of the sEMG signal in the last 5 sec-ond as compared to the first 5 seconds was tracked by Fast Fourier Analysis.The shift in MF was calculated as MFS = 100 * [1 minus (MF 25 to 30 / MF2 to 7)]Results: MVIC was similar in MS and NC indicating comparable strength. FFI was higher in MS (p<0.05)indicating excess fatigue. MFSwas not different in MS and NC(p<0.05). Results were similar in bothmuscles.Conclusions: Excess F in MS associated with normal MFCV may be due to pathological changes to a more fatiguable type IIa muscle fiber.

A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINALMS CLINIC-BASED STUDY Sanjak Ma, Belden Da, Konapacki Ra, aMotor Performance Lab, Dept Neurology, University of Wisconsin-Madison Med Sch, Madison, Wisconsin, USA;bNeurol Svc, Wm S Middleton Memorial VA Med Ctr, Madison, Wisconsin, USA Background: The effect of GA on maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)as a measure of strength has not been studied. MVIC measured bycomputerized isometric muscle strength (CIMS) testing can detect changes in aclinically important range not adequately represented by changes in EDSS. Objectives: To study the effects of GA on MVIC in patients with MS . Methods: CIMS testing was performed on 70 (14 M, 56 F) MS patients with relapsing- remitting MS before and after GA was added to their therapy with-out changing their existing drug treatment during the observation period. Overthe counter medications and concurrent physical and occupational therapywere not considered to be exclusion factors. MVIC was obtained from 10 upperextremity [UE] and 10 lower extremity (LE) muscles . Patients were selectedfor analysis in a pre-post design when GA was their only new drug treatmentand they had two test dates prior to and the two test dates following the initia-tion of GA. Results: In the two testing session prior to the onset of GA (average - 247.52 days(d) between tests), the percent MVIC in the UE did not significantly change[- 0.77%]. The percent MVIC in the LE, however, declined significantly [-5.29%] (p = 0.0173. On GA treatment, (average - 286.59 d) there was a signifi-cant increase in MVIC [UE +4.00% (p=0.0073) and LE +5.7% (p=0.000143)respectively] from the second test to the third test. Following these patients forone more testing session [average - 1.60% and- 3.41%, respectively (not significant) from the third test to the fourth test.Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that GA may have a direct treat- ment effect on increasing and maintaining strength in MS patients. A prospec- tive pre-post design with randomized delayed start of GA treatment may pro- vide insight to mechanism of action of GA, as well as the role of otherergotropic agents in combination with GA, in the treatment of MS.

Clinical Aspects of MS (Part 2) P196 PREDICTIVE FACTORS TO SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLESCLEROSIS POINT OUT THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF THEINFLAMMATORY PROCESS Coustans M, Le Duff F, Taurin G, Le Page E, Leray E, Edan G Neurology, CHU Pontchaillou, Rennes, France Background: There are two hypothesis to explain progression of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). The first is that progression of disability does notdepend on the inflammatory process, the second is that recurrent inflammationcauses permanent axonal damage which contributes to the irreversible deficitthat occurs later in the secondary progressive phase. In relapsing remitting(RR) MS patients, the early disability due to sequellae after relapses and thePosters S82 Multiple Sclerosisnumber of relapses during the first years are indicators of th inflammatory process. Objectives: To look for whether some predictive factors of early secondary progressive (SP) MS give arguments favouring either the degenerative hypoth-esis or the inflammatory process.Methods: In Brittany (France), we collected extensive data in EDMUS (Euro- pean database for multiple sclerosis) for 1019 RR MS patients since 1992 to 31December 2000. The data were analysed using Kaplan Meyer method to evalu-ate progression to a SP course.Results: Among these 1019 RR MS patients, 334 (32.8%)reached a SP course in December 2000. Age at onset of MS in this SP population was 29.2. Themost common symptoms at presentation was sensory deficit (35.9%), opticneuritis (33.2%) and disability at lower limbs (29.6%). The male female ratiowas 0.52. The mean disease duration was 12 years (y). In the 334 SP MS pop-ulation, 50% reached the SP course 9 y after the onset of the disease. Theshorter time to reach the SP course for RR MS was significatively correlated for patients which had an EDSS more than 3 due to relapses in less than three y after onset (3.8 y Vs 10 y) (p<0.002), and for RR MS patients who had 2relapses or more as opposed to 1 relapse in the first y (6.6 y Vs 11 y)(p<0.0001).Conclusions: The unfavourable pronostic factors related to the inflammatory process found in this study favoured the hypothesis that recurrent inflammationcause permanent axonal damage which contributes to the irreversibe deficitthat occurs later in the disease. This study gives arguments for early treatmentswith active drugs against inflammatory process. Disclosure: M Coustans has nothing to disclose. P197 MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMIC MASTOCYTOSIS: A SINGLE CASE REPORT Cristina Z, Carlo F Neurology, CIVIL Hospital, Mirano, Italy Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoim- mune demyelinating disease of central nervous system. The pathologicalprocess underlying the disease involve dysregulation of the immune systemand it is predominantly a T cell-mediated immune disorder. On the other hand,Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) is a heterogeneous rare group of stem cell disor-ders characterized by abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in moreorgan systems (skin, bone marrow, bone, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleenand lymph nodes), and is considered to be a hematologic disease.Objectives: We present a clinical definite relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) case with associated SM.Methods: CASE: F.L., a 40 years old man in whom MS developed in 1991 with dizziness, diplopia with right medial rectus palsy and omolateral nistag-mus, sensorial disturbance of the left leg. MRI showed typical findings, CSFthe presence of IgG oligoclonal bands and increased IfG index, and VEPs pro-longed latencies in both eyes. Afterwards the disease had a RR course, with thelast relapse in 2001, characterized by right hemiparesis, with complete recov-ery after high-dose corticosteroids therapy. 4 years later the onset of MS thepatient developed also maculopapular cutaneous lesions, but only during thelast relapse was supposed the diagnosis of mastocytosis, confirmed by cuta-neous biopsy; he showed also a systemic involvement, with multifocal histo-logical lesions in the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and skeletal infiltra-tion, increasing serum total tryptase levels. Results: Mast cells originate from pluripotent hemopoietic progenitor cells that express the CD34 antigen, while MS patients have a dysregulation of someselect T-cells subpopulation. Although no effective therapy for patients withSM is known, some of them may benefit from treatment with corticosteroidand Interferon (IFN)-alpha 2b, which can exhibit anhibitory effects on factor-dependent growth of mast cells progenitor cells, and such therapies have alsobeen used for MS patients. Conclusions: A better knowledge of the complex immunoregulatory net- work implicated in both diseases could hepl us to understand if this asso-ciation is the expression of two non-independent events or only a mere coincidence.

P198 PREDICTIVE VALUE OF THE ONE-YEAR CLINICAL RESPONSE TO BETA- INTERFERON IN RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Etienne R, Iliu-Florin T, Dominique P, Jean-Christophe O, Claire G, Olivier H MS Clinic, Hopital Tenon, Paris, Ile de France, France Background: There are no established criteria for therapeutic response to Beta- Interferon (IFN) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, clinical outcomes after oneyear are often part of the definition of \" responders \" (Waubant E et al, Neurology,2002 ; 58 : A189), or part of the inclusion criteria in add-on or rescue therapeutictrials with immunosuppressants (Smith DR et al, Neurology, 2002 ; 58 : A455).Objectives: To evaluate the predictive value of the One-Year clinical response to IFN in Relapsing-Remitting (RR) MS patients on the further course of MS.Methods: We selected all RR patients from our MS Clinic data base fulfilling the following criteria : first-ever prescription of IFN ; follow-up by the sameneurologist ; duration of follow-up : one year or longer. Clinical response atone year was defined as : group 1. responders (no relapse, no increment ofEDSS score) ; group 2. treatment failures (1 full point increment of EDSS ; 0.5if initial EDSS 5 or higher) ; partial responders (unchanged EDSS at one year)were stratified according to their relapse-rate : group 3 : unchanged of higherthan during the year preceding treatment ; group 4 : lower. Results: Preliminary results for 87 patients followed-up for 12 to 73 months by 2 (out of 4) neurologists (Avonex | *regis* | : 52 ; Betaseron | *regis* | : 12 ;Rebif | *regis* | : 22) are presented. Six patients stopped IFN before one yearbecause of side-effects or pregnancy. In group l (24 pts, 30%), the EDSS of allevaluable patients was stable at 2 and 3 years, and 82 % (14/17, 2 years) and 85% (11/13, 3 years) were still relapse-free. IFN was stopped in all group 2patients (12 pts, 15 %); 7 of them (46 %) received rescue imunosupressive ther-apy. In partial responders (45 pts, 55 %), no pre-treatment characteristics pre-dicted outcome at 2 or 3 years. However, IFN was stopped for non-efficacymore often in group 3 than in group 4, either at 2 years (7/21 vs. 2/15) or at 3years (5/9 vs. 0/8). There was no apparent efficacy of increasing IFN dosage.Conclusions: A relapse-free status at one year is highly predictive of continu- ing efficacy at 2 and 3 years. The decision to stop IFN in still-relapsing but EDSS-stable patients might be taken after one year on treatment in some patients. Full updated results will be presented. Disclosure: Etienne Roullet received honoraria for therapeutic trials from Schering AG, Biogen Inc, Ares-Serono and Teva P199 EFFICACY OF MS THERAPY IS KEY DRIVER IN THERAPY CHOICE Eyring Sa, Wood Cb, Sherman Inc., Rockland, Massachusetts, USA Background: Research indicates that efficacy is the key driver for neurologists and MS patients in therapy choice. Historically, the switch rate between diseasemodifying drug (DMD) therapies was low (~11% over 2 years), based on a per-ceived lack of differentiation. Since the launch of IFN beta-1a 44mcg tiw in theUS in March 2002, the percent of switches from other therapies and reasons forthe switches have been evaluated. Objectives: Identify the influence of efficacy on choosing a DMD therapy for the treatment of MS and quantify the impact of efficacy on switching from oneDMD therapy to another.Methods: Research was conducted by an independent market research agency via face-to-face interviews in early 2001 with 198 neurologists and 122patients from 9 countries. All respondents were asked questions regarding effi-cacy and convenience (type/frequency of injection, product form). These dataMultiple SclerosisPosters S83 were compared against records of rationale for switching to IFN beta-1a 44mcg tiw, collected by a patient support program during its first 2 months ofoperation.Results: The survey results found that 72% of neurologists and 86% of patients reported that they would choose a DMD that offered even a 10%increase in efficacy - even if the drug profile was not their initial choice withrespect to frequency of injections, route of administration and formulation.These findings are borne out by records of patient rationale for switchingDMD which were submitted to the IFN beta-1a 44mcg tiw patient support pro-gram at the time of initiating Rxs. Of the first 350 patients who volunteeredinformation on their past drug history, over 90% of Rxs were switches fromother therapies. The to therapy. Lack of efficacy was the number one reason cited for therapyswitch.Conclusions: Real-life experience confirms research that both neurologists and MS patients base their new and switch treatment decisions on efficacy. It appears that the switch rate may be increasing in the US based upon interest inoptimizing MS treatment efficacy. Disclosure: All authors are employees of Serono.

P200 CORRELATION BETWEEN VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIALSABNORMALITIES AND PHYSICAL HANDICAP PROGRESSION INMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW-UP OF 65 PATIENTS Ferriby sclerosis patients presenting with optic neuritis (ON) at the onset of the disease seem to have a lower handicap progression (Con-favreux et al., 2000). However, it remains unclear if infra- or clinical ON,occurring during disease course, may influence the outcome of the disease.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine if visual evoked potentials (VEP) evaluation during the course of the disease can be a predictive factor ofhandicap progression.Methods: We prospectively studied, during 3 years, clinical and VEP data of 65 patients (18 male, 47 female) presenting with clinically definite multiple sclerosisaccording to Poser et al. (1983) criteria. All had neuro-ophtalmologic and VEPassessment at entry and outcome. Mean age and disease duration at inclusionwere respectively 35 years and 57 months. Mean EDSS at entry and outcomewere respectively 2.4 and 3.2. 44 patients presented with uni- or bilateral ON atinclusion. 5 patients had uni- or bilateral uveitis. 28 patients presented handicapprogression defined as 1-point EDSS increase or at least 3 relapses during 3 years.Results: We did not observe any correlation between VEP data and handicap progression during the 3 years of follow-up (p=0.2). Uveitis was not signifi-cantly correlated with better prognosis.Conclusions: Handicap progression does not seem to be associated with VEP data. Furthermore, VEP data does not seem to be a predictive factor of handi-cap progression. Disclosure: D Ferriby has nothing to disclose. P201 IMPAIRED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND FATIGUE Flachenecker PMa, Rufer Ab, Rehabilitation Center, Valens, St. Gallen, Switzerland Background: Fatigue is one of the most common disabling symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but the mechanisms of this compleximpairment remain to be determined. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is also frequent in MS, but its causal association to fatigue is not clear. Objectives: To evaluate cardiovascular autonomic function in MS patients with (MS-F) and without (MS-NF) fatigue.Methods: 69 MS patients (52 women, 17 men) were studied by parasympathetic (heart rate response to Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing and active change of pos-ture [HR-post]) and sympathetic function tests (blood pressure responses to activechange of posture and sustained handgrip [BP-grip]) as well as by measures of heartrate variability during rest and during standing in the time- and frequency-domain(low-frequency power [LF], and high-frequency power [HF]). Results were com-pared to those obtained in 36 age-mateched healthy volunteers (21 women, 15men). Fatigue was assessed by Krupp's Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), with a score> 4.0 indicating fatigue, and by Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS).Results: Median HR-post and BP-grip were lower in MS patients than in con- trols. The results of both autonomic tests were inversely related to both fatiguescores, FSS and MFIS, particularly to those measuring physical fatigue (r = -0.46, BP-grip vs. MFIS). The median LF/HF ratio was lower in MS-F than inMS-NF patients indicating reduced sympathetic outflow in MS patients withfatigue. Worsening of symptoms with heat (\"Uhthoff's phenomenon\") wasassociated with elevated fatigue scores.Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the high prevalence and pattern of abnormalities in cardiovascular reflex tests in MS patients as a whole andsuggest that sympathetic nervous system activity may be reduced in MSpatients with fatigue.

P202 MEASURING THE OUTCOME OF INTERFERON THERAPY FROM THE PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVE Ford HL, Johnson MH, Denton S Department of Neurology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom Background: It is accepted that patient-perceived quality of life is important, and that self-report measures may provide reliable and valid information aboutthis. Thus a self-report questionnaire of QoL, based upon patients' own experi-ences and views, may be a valuable addition to outcome measurement for thosewith multiple sclerosisObjectives: To assess the effectiveness of interferon treatment using a disease- specific patient-centred measure of quality of life and to compare this withphysician-centred measures of disability.Methods: All patients treated with interferon beta in the Leeds Multiple Scle- rosis Programme had a comprehensive pre-treatment clinical assessment. Thisincluded a self-report disease-specific measure of quality of life, the LeedsMultiple Sclerosis Quality of Life scale (LMSQoL) and the Guy's Neurologi-cal Disability Scale (GNDS). These measures were completed at three monthlyintervals on treatment. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) wasassessed annually. Patients eligible for treatment had relapsing-remitting MS(RRMS) or active secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Results: 73 patients had been started on interferon beta and observed for at least 2 years. 57 patients had RRMS and 16 had active SPMS. The mean baselineLMSQoL score was 22.8 (median 23) and this improved significantly to 26.1(median 26) at one year. This improvement was maintained at 2 years. The base-line mean GNDS score was 12.9 (median 13) and at one year this had improvedto 11.3 (median 11) and this was maintained at 2 years. The baseline meanEDSS was 4.1 (median 4.5) and there was no significant change at 1 or 2 years.Conclusions: The EDSS, a physician-centred measure of impairment and disabil- ity, did not change significantly in this prospective clinic study. The Leeds MSQoLimproved significantly in this population. The limitations of the EDSS have beenreported but of particular relevance in this population is the failure of the EDSS tocapture changes in fatigue and energy levels, and the insensitivity of the scale at itslower end. The ability to detect change is an essential requirement of any outcomemeasure. Patient-centred outcome measures may show significant effects of treat-ment which would be missed if physician-centred measures alone are used.

Diagnostic criteria for MS were recently revisited and MRI data were integrated with clin-ical and paraclinical methods (McDonald 2001). In the last few years manyclinical reviews showed that hypercoagulable states, especially Activated Pro-tein C Resistance (APCR) and Hyperomocysteinemia, could be considered asrisk factors for cerebral ischemia. Nevertheless possible relationships betweenthese conditions, CNS pathology and aspecific changes in MRI should beinvestigated. Objectives: To verify the incidence of coagulation abnormalities in a cohort of patients with MS and Possible MSMethods: A cohort of pts with MS and possible MS according to McDonald's MS diagnostic criteria (MSDC), consecutively observed during a period of 12months, was studied. The pts with possible MS were classified, according toMSDC, as isolated syndromes including: optic neuritis, spinal cord and brain-stem syndromes. Furthermore, we considered as possible MS two more groupsof patients with \"pure sensory symptoms\" and \"unusual symptoms\". BrainMRI was performed in all pts. Moreover, laboratory tests for C and S protein levels, APCR and homocysteine were collected. Minor Prothrombotic Coagu- lopathy (MPC) was defined as reduction of C and S proteins, APCR abnormal-ity or hyperomocysteinemia. Results: 69 pts had MS and 51 possible MS. The age was >18<50 yrs. MPC was observed in 14/69 pts with MS and in 21/51 pts with possible MS (p<0.05).The not fulfilling MSDC(35/51). MPC was found in 4/16 pts with normal MRI and in 17/35 pts withMRI changes not fulfilling MSDC (P=NS). Pure sensory symptoms groupshowed the highest incidence (16/34) compared to isolated syndromegroup (5/20), p<0.05Conclusions: MPC was significantly more frequent in pts with possible MS compared to pts with MS and significantly more common in pts with pure sen-sory symptoms compared to pts with isolated syndromes. Our preliminary datasuggest that screening tests for MPC should be performed in cases clinicallysuggestive for MS. Disclosure: F Corsi has nothing to disclose. P204 THE RANGE OF INFLAMMATORY MYELOPATHIES. CLINICAL, MRI,CEREBROSPINAL FLUID AND IMMUNOLOGICAL FINDINGS IN 35CONSECUTIVE M, Tiberio Tzintzeva E, Ranzato F, P & Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy Background: Inflammatory myelopathies (IM) constitute a quite heteroge- neous group of diseases characterized by inflammatory lesions in the spinalcord, whose etiopathogenesis remaines often undetermined.Objectives: We analyzed clinical, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid and systemic immunological parameters in 35 consecutive patients presenting with IM, inorder to define a diagnostic protocol.Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients (21 male, 14 female, M/F=3/2; mean age at onset 44 yrs) were studied. Immunological and virologicalscreenings consisted in the determination ofESR,PCR,RF,ANA,ENA,CIC,ATA,ANCA,ACA,LAC,ACE, antibodies, detection of viral genome by PCR.Spinal cord imaging was obtained by conventional MRI with T1,T2,DP,Gadolinium-EDTA, FLAIR sequences. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examina-tion consisted in cell count and differentation, calculation of CSF/Serumalbumin ratio and IgG indexes, demonstration of IgG oligoclonal bands by IEF, detection of antibodies to an genomic sequences of neurotropicviruses.Results: The onset was monosymptomatic in 25% and polysymptomatic in 75% of the cases; acute in 16, subacute in 16 e chronic-relapsing in 3cases. A postinfectious origin of the myelitis was documented in 10patients.In only one case an associations with an autoimmune disease (thy-roiditis) was observed. In 2 patients an association with HHV6 infectionwas demonstrated. IgG OB were detected in one third of the CSF analyzed,but never in the post-infectious and in the chronic-relapsing cases. Thediagnosis of Neuromyelitis optica was definitely achieved in threepatients, while in one case IM was the presenting case of a Behcet's dis-ease. Postinfectious myelitis had the most extensive MRIabnormalities.Only IM having IgGOB in the CSF evolved to clinically def-inite multiple sclerosis.Conclusions: While confirming the large clinical, MRI and immunological heterogeneity of IM, our study suggests that detailed immunological tests inblood and CSF, and neuroimaging may lead to the definition of more appropri-ate diagnostic procedures.

P205 FATIGUE AND AXONAL LOSS IN CORPUS CALLOSUM IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Greg C, Minier D, Walker P, Brunotte F, Giroud M, Hospitalier de Dijon, Dijon, Bourgogne, France Background: Recent imaging studies showed that disability correlates with axonal loss in white matter in multiple sclerosis. Magnetic resonance spec-troscopy can estimate the axonal pathology with the measurements of the reso-nance intensity of N-Acetyl-Aspartate. Axonal damage in corpus callosum cor-relates with cerebral white matter lesion. Few studies showed the mechanismof the fatigue, a prominent symptom in multiple sclerosis. Objectives: The aim of the study was to correlate the fatigue with the N- Acetyl-Aspartate in corpus callosum.Methods: Twenty seven patients with relapsing remitting or primary progres- sive multiple sclerosis were include in a longitudinal study. We matched twopatients groups on the basis of the disease duration. One subgroup with elevenpatients have a short disease duration (<2 years) and an another subgroup withsixteen patients have a more long standing disease duration (>4 years). Fatiguewas estimate with a quantitative scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale. Conven-tionnel brain imaging and single voxel proton magnetic resonance of the cor-pus callosum were obteined at intervals of one year with concurrent fatigueevaluation.Results: At the onset of the study we doesn't found any relation between fatigue and the chemical changes in the subgroup with short disease duration. Strong correlation was found in subgroup with long disease duration betweenFatigue Severity Scale and results that indices of axonal damage or loss in cor- pus callosum may provide a specific measure of pathological changes relevantto fatigue in patients with long disease duration. This relation is evaluate afterone year.

On the contrary, there is anincrease during the three following months after delivery. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate if those variations are linked to the hormonal changes.Methods: We report three cases of exacerbation of relapses in women with MS, treated with clomiphene.Results: Patient 1, a 27 years old women, was diagnosed with clinically defi- nite MS according Poser's criteria in 1997. She suffered two relapses in 1997but no relapse in 1998 and 1999. She received clomiphene citrate with beta fel-litrapin in march 2000. The patient had presented three relapses the four fol-lowing months. A MRI was performed showed new gadolinium enhancinglesions. Patient 2, a 29 year old women, was diagnosed with a definite MS innovember 1990, four months after her childbirth. There were no relapses since1999. She received clomiphene citrate in May 1999. She presented threerelapses, in july, november and december 2000. Patient 3, a 32 years oldwomen, was diagnosed with a definite MS in January 1998. She receivedclomiphene and citric acid in june 1998. After this treatment, she presentedmonthly legs paresthesia, during more than 24 hours responding to Poser's cri-teria of relapse from July to November 1998.Conclusions: First choice treatment of chronic anovulation is an anti-oestro- gen such as clomiphene or tamoxifen. has an antioestrogenic effecton hypothalamus. As shown in PRIMS study, there is a significant decrease ofrelapses frequency during pregnancy. This may be secondary to physiologicalhyperoestrogenia wich results is an immunosuppressive effect by reducing proinflammatory cytokines release. In post partum, there is a rapid decrease of sexhormone's levels. This might explain the relapses rate increase by an inversion of cytokines balance in favour of the TH1 proinflammatory cytokines. The clomiphene treatedwomen. Clomiphene antioestrogenic effect may cause hormone imbal-ance and a release of proinflammatory cytokines. Disclosure: c greg has nothing to disclose. P207 ACUTE DISSEMINATED ENCEPHALOMYELOPATHY AND PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC HCV INFECTION Giannesini C, Schelp C, Heinzlef O, Roullet E Tenon Hospital, Paris, France Background: Hepatitis C virus is associated with different neurological disor- ders, most often peripheral neuropathies and in some case central nervous sys-tem disease ; but in both cases, the mecanism of neurological involvement is avasculitis. Only one case of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis associatedwith hepatitis c virus has been reported.Objectives: To describe a case of ADEM and peripheral neuropathy associated with HCV infectionMethods: case report Results: A 33 years old man developed in a few days a severe cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria, distal and asymetrical motor deficit and altered mental state.Chronic active hepatitis C had been diagnosed seven years before but nottreated. He was complaining for three month of paresthesia in both feet andhands. On examination he had a static and kinetic cerebellar syndrom,dysarthria, nystagmus and axial hypotonia, bilateral babinski signs ; ankle jerkswere absent and others were weak. The patient was disoriented and had visualhallucinations. General examination was normal. Usual biological tests werenormal, without inflammatory syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging of thebrain and spinal cord showed multifocal lesions, some of wich enhanced aftergadolinium injection. Cerebral spinal fluid revealed an aseptic lymphocytic meningitis 93 cells g/l protein, normal glu-cose. a diffuse axonal and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Allinvestigations failed to identify any infectious agent in blood or cerebro-spinalfluid. Polymerase chain reaction for hepatitis C virus was positive in blood.Immunologic tests were negative, in particular cryoglobulinemia. A sural nervebiopsy was performed and showed recent axonal degeneration without any signof vasculitis. The patient received high dose intravenous methylprednisone andrapidly improved Conclusions: This the first case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis asso- ciated with peripheral neuropathy during an active chronic virus C hepatitis.

P208 SAPHO SYNDROME ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS France Background: Multiple Sclerosis(MS)is sometimes associated with auto- immune diseases and MS-like syndrome have been reported with inflammatoryrheumatological disorders. We report on the first case of SAPHO (Synovitis,Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, Osteitis) syndrome associated with MS.Objectives: To describe the association between SAPHO syndrome and MS Methods: Case report Results: A 36 years old woman was admitted in april 2002 for recurrent neu- rological symptoms. SAPHO syndrome has been diagnosed in july 2001 andthe patient received Methotrexate 15 mg per week since that time.Neurologi-cal symptoms occured in april 2001. She complained of bilateral transientvisual loss. In july 2001, she had paresthesia in hands, feet and face, and feltunstable. She improved after IV corticosteroid but had an other relapse injanuary 2002. Neurological examination in april 2002 showed a static cere-bellar syndrome with dysarthria, a bilateral pyramidal syndrome in the lowerlimbs and a bilateral optic neuropathy. MRI of the brain showed demyelinat-ing periventricular lesions in supra and infra-tentorial regions. Cerebro-spinal fluid showed a mild hyperproteinorachia with oligoclonal bands byisoelectrofocusing. Visual Evoked Potentials were abnormal. Anti-Nuclearfactors were positive but double strands anti-DNA and anti-ECT antibodieswere negative. The patient was treated with intravenously high dose Methyl-prednisone and partially improved. SAPHO syndrome could be associatedwith spondylarthropathies, inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis. Asso-ciation with Neurological disorders is unusual : spinal cord injury complicat-ing vertebral involvement and meningitis secondary to cranial osteomyelitishave been reported so far. Association between ankylosing spondylitis andmultiple sclerosis has previously been reported suggesting it is more thancoincidental. Central nervous system involvement is also described ininflammatory bowel diseases but this is not the case in our patient, who didnot have any signs of digestive disorder and fulfilled criteria of clinically def-inite multiple sclerosis Conclusions: This observation suggests that common auto-immune mecha- nisms could be implicated in the pathophysiology of both diseases suggestingthat in this patient similar genetic or infectious factor might be implicated.

P209 MITOXANDRONE FOR PROGRESSIVE TYPE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TREATMENT Giannoulis C, Sarafianos A, Hatzidaki G, Kargadou A, Stavropoulos D, Karageorgiou KE Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, Athens General Hospital, Neurology Departement, Athens, Greece Background: During the last decade, most of the new therapies in MS are tar- geted at the relapsing-remitting type of MS. However, the progressive type is aPosters S86 Multiple Sclerosissevere expression of the disease, and thus there is a great need for therapies against it.Objectives: In this study, the aim was to evaluate mitoxandrone for the treatment of the progressive type of MS, in cases where other treatmentsfailed.Methods: Twelve patients (7 men and 5 women), mean age 39.9 yo (26 to 50), with primary progressive (7 patients) and secondary progressive MS(5patients), with a mean duration of the disease 13 years, were enrolled in anopen study of mitoxandrone. All patients were examined before with heartecho, Chest X-ray and blood tests, and were evaluated for their disabilityaccording to the EDSS scale. Seven patients were under treatment with inter-ferone, two under azathioprine, two under IVIG and one patient was withouttreatment for 2 years. All of them had a deterioration of their clinical pictureduring the last few months and wanted to try a different treatment. The inclu-sion criteria were: age up to 50 yo, goodcardiac function, white and red cellswithout abnormalities, progressive type of MS, failure of previous treatments, no pregnancy or breast feeding. The dose was 12mg/m^2 for every session. Six sessions were held (one every month) during which, all laboratory examina-tions were done.Results: After the six month period, there was an improvement of the dissabil- ity, according to the EDSS scale, from 7.29 (5.5-8) to 6.7 (5-7). Side effectswere reported only in two patients, myocardiopathy and leucopenia. Duringthis time only one had a moderate relapseConclusions: Mitoxandrone is a promissing therapeutic drug in the progessive type of MS. However, it is necessary to have a long-term follow-up of thesepatients to create a more certain opinion, concerning the efficacy of mitoxan-drone in patients with the progressive type of MS.

P210 ACTIVE HUMAN HERPESVIRUS SIX (HHV-6) INFECTIONS AND MS Knox K, Carrigan D Institute for Viral Pathogenesis, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA Background: Our and other laboratories have linked MS to active HHV-6 infections. It has also been suggested that the A variant of the virus (HHV-6A)may play a special role in the disease.Objectives: These studies sought to confirm active HHV-6 infections in a sig- nificant proportion of patients with MS, to determine which variant of the virusis involved and to correlate the presence of the active HHV-6 infections withclinical parameters.Methods: Plasma samples from a cross section of patients with relapsing- remitting MS (RR-MS) and healthy controls were analyzed for active HHV-6infection using a viral variant specific PCR assay.Results: Plasma samples of 15% (11/74) of patients with RR-MS were positive for HHV-6 DNA compared to only 3% (2/75) of samples from healthy adultcontrols (p < 0.01). Of the 11 HHV-6 positive samples from the MS patients, 6were HHV-6A alone, 3 were HHV-6 variant B (HHV-6B) alone and 2 were acombination of both HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Thus, HHV-6A was involved in73% (8/11) of the infections. In a second study, plasma samples were obtainedat the time of new clinical relapse in patients with RR-MS and assessed foractive HHV-6 infection by plasma PCR. Then, several weeks later (mean: 68days), a second plasma sample was obtained from the same patients andassessed for active HHV-6 infection. Five of 39 (13%) patients had at least onesample positive for active HHV-6 infection. HHV-6A accounted for 75% (3/4) and HHV-6B for 25% (1/4). One of the positive samples could not be variant typed for technical reasons. Four of the five (80%) positive samples wereobtained at the time of relapse whereas only one (20%) positive was observedin a patient after relapse. The HHV-6 positive patients suffered a larger changein their EDSS (mean change of 1.4) than the HHV-6 negative patients (meanchange of 0.7). Patients receiving either beta interferon or glatirimar acetatewere less likely to be HHV-6 positive (2/30; 7%) the patients receiving notreatment (3/9; 33%). Since most (>75%) of the patients on therapy werereceiving beta interferon, the decrease in active HHV-6 may reflect the antivi- ral properties of beta interferon. Conclusions: Patients with RR-MS have active, systemic HHV-6 infections at a significantly increased rate compared to healthy control subjects and themajority of the infections involve the A variant of the virus.

Results: 18 children (67%) were diagnosed with MS, 3 (11%) with acute dis- seminated encephalomyelitis, 3 (11%) with clinically isolated syndrome ofMS, and 3 (11%) with other neurological disorders. All MS cases were diag-nosed with clinically definite relapsing remitting disease. In the MS group withavailable MRI results thus far, 10 / 12 (83%) meet the recent McDonald (2001)criteria. Mean age at initial diagnosis was 13.7 (SD = 2.2), and 15 / 18 (83%)are female. Racial backgrounds were: Caucasian (22), African-American (5).Two persons (1 male, 1 female) had a first degree relative with MS (mother inboth cases). All were on disease modifying therapies, and 3 (11%) were oncombination therapy with novantrone. All were administered a neuropsycho-logical test battery assessing: general intellectual functioning, academic func-tioning, executive functions, language, memory, visuospatial skills, and motorabilities. Two had coincident learning disabilities. Among the rest, all dis-played deficits in at least one of the areas of cognitive functioning specifiedabove, as defined by performance less than or equal to 1.5 SD below the meanof healthy normative samples. Subjects averaged 2.3 areas of cognitive dys-function, with fine motor abilities among the most affected (64%), and generalintellectual functioning among the least impaired (7%).Conclusions: Much more needs to be learned about the characteristics of child- hood onset MS, including specification of diagnostic criteria, collection of epi-demiological data, assessment of behavioral manifestations, and developmentof effective interventions.

P212 CORRELATION OF THE GUYS NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITY SCALE WITHTHE EDSS IN A SAMPLE OF BRAZILIAN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Lana-Peixoto MA, Ara\u00fajo MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: Neurologists need a multidimensional, reliable and practical tool to assess MS patients. EDSS has been the most widely used measure in MSMultiple SclerosisPosters S87 patients but it fails to evaluate a number of functions such as cognition, mood, vision and upper limb dexterity.Guys Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS)may turn out to be a good alternative both to EDSS and MSFC if it proves tocorrelate well with EDSS and the MSFC domains. Objectives: To report the results of GNDS on a sample of Brazilian MS patients, correlating it with the EDSS.Methods: GNDS is a multidimensional clinical scale which provides informa- tion on 12 functional domains. The domains were graded according to theirseverity and their impact on patients. The total score ranges from 0 (no dis-ability) to 60 (maximum possible disability). GNDS was individually admin-istered to a group of relapse-free MS patients in whom the EDSS score hadbeen shortly assigned. Additional clinical data were collected from medicalrecord.Results: Thirty-nine CDMS patients (27 women and 12 male) were selected at random from our MS Research Center. Their mean age was 42.08 years(sd=9.1), mean formal schooling was 10.23 years (sd=4.25) and the mean dis- ease duration 8.86 years (sd=7.83). There were 23 patients with relapsing- remitting MS, 11 with secondary progressive MS and five with primary pro-gressive MS. The median EDSS was 3.5 and the mean Ambulation Index (AI)1.9 (sd=2.51). The GNDS mean total score was 12.9 (sd=9.79). In patients withEDSS below 3.5 the mean total score was 8.86 (sd=6.89); in patients withEDSS between 4.0 and 6,5 the mean total score was 14.67 (sd=9,08) and withEDSS 7.0 or higher the mean total score was 32.33 (sd=2.52). The mostimpaired domains were fatigue, mood, other disabilities, lower limb and sexualfunction and cognition. Conclusions: In our sample GNDS total score correlated well with EDSS scores. Further studies correlating the various domains of the GNDS with func-tion-specific scales or tests may provide better information about the value ofthe GNDS as a definite outcome measure tool.

P213 ACUTE DEAFNESS REVEALING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Lebrun Ca, France;bCHU Lille, Lille, N, France Background: Hearing loss is an uncommon presenting symptom (1%) declar- ing MS, while symptoms of brain-stem demyelination occur in more than 20%of cases during either one of the first relapses of the disease. Objectives: To determine the frequency and clinical evolution of patients revealing MS by acute deafness.Methods: Documented MS patients who has revealed MS with acute deafness were selected out of the files of 950 patients in Northern (Lille=L) and South-ern (Nice=N) french MS databases. Every patients had documented MSaccording to Mc Donald criteria, positive brain MRI according to Barkhof cri-teria and recording of brain-stem evoked potentials.Results: Twelve patients (1.2%) were identified: 10 females, 2 males, mean age 32.5 years, median age N=32 (24-54) ; L=33 (22-48), unilateral deafness(11/12). MS diagnosis was suspected after this first symptom for 3 of them whopresented subacute signs of myelitis or brain stem involvement simultaneously.All patients had brain T2 hypersignals corresponding to MS and CSF examina-tion with for 6/12 positive oligoclonal bands. 4/6 had increased IgG index. Inall cases, hearing loss subjectively recovered completely after intraveinousmethylprednisolone administration but BAEPs remained abnormal. The timebefore a second relapse was about 27.25 months (L median time 27.5 : 9-54 ; Nmedian time 27 : 12-48).Conclusions: Although unilateral or bilateral hearing loss may occur in MS, it has rarely been reported as an initial solitary manifestation. After a mean fol-low-up of 7 years, all patients remain in relapsing-remitting form with meanEDSS score of 2.5. Clinical prognosis appears to be good despite MRI Barkhofcriteria are fullfilled at presentation. Patients profiles in North and South ofFrance are identical. Disclosure: C Lebrun has nothing to disclose.P214 MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS France;bRadiology, CHU Pasteur, Nice, Am, France Background: The use of new MRI criteria is recommended to confirm diagno- sis of multiple sclerosis. Some patients have experienced relapsing neurologi-cal symptoms but white matter lesions are not visible on brain or spinal MRI toensure MS. Nevertheless, other paraclinical investigations (CSF sample orevoked potentials) can be in favor of dissemination of the disease in space andtime according to McDonald criteria (2001).Objectives: We collected prospectively in Nice MSdatabase patients with relapsing or progressive neurological symptoms fitting with MS but hypersig-nal-free brain and spinal T2-weighted MRI.Methods: Fifteen cases have been gathered and studied for demographic char- acteristics, blood tests, CSF analysis, Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP), brainand spinal MRI with 6 month-interval, 5-yrs MRI follow up and brain spec-troscopy of normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Results: The demographic features and characteristics of MS patients were: age: 16-49 5/15. Ten patients had CDMS according toPoser criteria, 11 were MS according to Mc Donald criteria, 3 were correspon-ding to Devic syndrom according to Wingerchuck criteria.Conclusions: : Absence of MRI hypersignal in FLAIR or T2-weighted sequences in patients with objective neurological relapsing polysymptomaticsymptoms is confusing if we considered them as potential MS patients. Manyhypothesis can be envisioned: MRI sensitivity, pre-MS state with clinical goodprognosis, expression of axonal lesions. Until now, we considered those patientsas authentic relapsing or progressive MS. Given the above-mentioned difficul-ties, indications for immunomodulatory treatment should be carefully evaluated.

A HIERARCHICAL MODEL. de Llobregat,Barcelona, Spain Background: Some clinical varibles may be related with the long-term out- come in patients with MS.Objectives: To analyze the prognostic variables related to three different end- points in patients with MS: a) incomplete recovery after the first relapse b) timeto EDMUS Impairment Scale (EIS) 6, and c) time to the onset of secondaryprogressive phase in a series of patients with RRMSMethods: Clinically-based series of 452 patients with RRMS at onset. Stan- darized follow-up was performed by means the EDMUS. No patients weretreated with disease modifying agents. Variables were included in a hierarchicalway, based on the sequence in wich clinical information is generally revealed.Statistics: Logistic regression and Cox regression for survival models.Results: Variables with independent prognostic relevance for incomplete recov- ery after the first relapse severeresidual disability (EIS 6) were related to: Incomplete recovery after Sclerosis0.94), and at the MS'unit (1 yr.): ROR=0.92 (0.88-0.97). Parameters associated with early conversion secondary MS were: Age at onset(10 yrs.): ROR=1.40 (1.06-1.86); incomplete recovery after first interattack interval (1 yr.): ROR=0.92 (0.86-0.98)Conclusions: In patients with RRMS, an incomplete recovery after the first relapse and a short first interattack interval are related with an earlier onset ofSPMS and with a shorter time to reach a severe residual disability.

P216 CLINICAL ISOLATED MYELITIS: EARLY PREDICTION OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BASED ON MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING ANDCEREBROSPINAL FLUID FINDINGS 2nd Medical School, Motol Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic;bRadiology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School, Motol Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic Background: The term myelitis is used to describe inflammatory involvement of the spinal cord. Etiology of this disorder can be variable and it may occur as thefirst attack of multiple sclerosis (MS). Whether the patient presenting with myelitisas the first symptom develops in later course MS is often difficult to predict.Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess if MS patients presenting in onset with myelitis can be distinguished on the basis of MRI findings from patientswith myelitis of another aetiology.Methods: 34 patients presenting with clinical isolated myelitis were included in this study. MRI of the spinal cord and MRI of the brain and CSF analysiswere performed at the onset of the disease in all the patients. After 6 months to6 years of follow-up diagnosis of MS or myelitis of another cause was con-cluded.Results: Spinal cord MRI was abnormal in all the patients, brain MRI was abnormal in 13 patients, CSF finding was abnormal in 29 patients: pleiocytosisand/or higher protein level were found in 22 patients, positive oligoclonalbands (OB) in 23 patients. Six patients were diagnosed as having MS on fol-low-up. Retrospectively 5 of them had abnormal brain MRI, all of them hadmore then one lesion on spinal MRI and all of them were OB positive whenexamined for myelitis.Conclusions: In patients with clinical isolated myelitis the association of abnormal brain MRI with multifocal spinal cord lesions and with positive OBis highly predictive for later progression to MS. Isolated spinal cord lesionaffecting multiple thoracic segments seems to have better prognosis and lowprobability for progression to MS. Disclosure: E Meluzinova has nothing to disclose.

P217 COLLABORATIVE STUDY ON CHILDHOOD ONSET MULTIPLE SCLEROSISIN FRANCE (KIDMUS): ABOUT A COHORT OF 495 CHU, a child presents a first episod of CNS inflammation the most important issue is the risk of evolution to multiple sclerosis (MS) and ofirreversible disability. Childhood onset MS (before 16 years of age) represents2-4 % of total MS. Objectives: Objectives. To precise characteristics and evolution of childhood onset MS.Methods: Methods. An historical cohort was constituted from main french pediatric and adult neurology centers. We included patients with diagnosis ofMS (Poser criteria) and those with an onset compatible with MS. A computer- ized system (EDMUS and a specific database)was used to collect anamnestic,demographic, clinical and paraclinical data. Survival and prognosis factors forrelapse and disability were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods.Results: Results. We present data about 495 patients from to cohorts: 317 from pediatric centers (group1) and 178 from adult neurology centers(group2). For all patients, there was 62% girls, 6.5% familial MS, meanage at onset was 11 years (1-16). Onset was before 10 years in 41% ofgroup1 and 8% of group2. Date at onset was before 1985 in 6.5% and 56%.Initial course was relapsing-remitting for 99 and 94%. Definite MS con-cerned 47 and 77%. Oligoclonal bands were found in CSF in 23 and 24%.In the pediatric cohort, 33 % had an MRI strongly suggestive of MS atonset ; in the other 43 % had such MRI during evolution. In the pediatriccohort, there was an initial acute disseminated encephalomyelitis presenta-tion (ADEM) for 38% that relapsed in 11%. For all patients, Kaplan-Meierestimates of the mean time from the onset to a score EDSS 4 was 27.8years (95% CI 24-31.5). The analysis will be completed for the meetingpresentation.Conclusions: Conclusions. Differences between pediatric and adult neurology cohorts have to be considered. The first contribute more for precise initialdescription and the second for long-term follow-up. ADEM presentation maybe an onset of MS in childhood. The disability prognosis tends to be better inchildhood onset MS than in classical adult onset. Disclosure: Y Mikaeloff has nothing to disclose. Funding: Supported by ARSEP Foundation. P218 PATTERNS OF MS TREATMENT WITH DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPIESBEFORE ENTRY INTO AN OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL Mc University USA;bData Management, Serono, Inc., Rockland, Massachusetts, USA;cClinical Development, Massachusetts, USA Background: Disease modifying drugs (DMDs) approved for MS in the US include Rebif\u00ae Avonex\u00ae algorithm exists for use of DMDs, and patientsmay be treated with one or all of these during their course.Objectives: To assess previous use of DMDs in MS patients entering a study of Rebif\u00ae injections. Methods: 1870 patients with RRMS group, open-label, the tolerability injections TIW) with and without Rebiject TMMini, an auto-injection device. Injection site reactions are assessed on a weekly basis. Previous DMDtreatment was recorded at the time of entry. The study is ongoing.Results: Preliminary results are available for 991 patients. Previous DMD Treatment: Of 991 patients 277(28.0%) had no previous DMD treatment;714(72%) had one with Specific DMDs: At study start Rebif\u00ae was not commercially avail-able in the US. Of 991 patients 516(52.1%) had previous treatment withAvonex\u00ae, had received other therapies not other-wise specified.

P219 FATIGUE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. A LONGITUDINAL STUDY Tellez N, Rio J, Tintore M, Sastre-Garriga J, Pericot I, Nos C, Montalban X Clinical Neuroimmunology Unit, University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain Background: Fatigue is one of the most troubling symptoms in patients with MS. Longitudinal studies of fatigue are scarce. Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the changes on fatigue over time in a cohort of consecutive MS patients and to correlate them with changesin disability and mood status.Methods: The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and EDSS were applied to144 consecutive MS patients. After a period of at least one year, all patientswere re-assessed. Patients suffering a relapse at the time of evaluation wereexcluded.Results: Fatigue (FSS*5) was observed in 58% of MS patients at baseline and in 59% after a mean follow-up period of 17 months. Most patients (83%) withfatigue at baseline remained fatigued after follow-up. Sixty-one percent ofpatients without fatigue at baseline remained without fatigue after follow-up.Although EDSS score was significantly higher (3,1 vs 2,6, p<0,0001) overtime in the total cohort, no significant differences were observed in BDI, FSSand MFIS scores over this period of time. Changes in fatigue (MFIS score)correlated significantly with changes in BDI (r= 0.48, p<0.0001). correlations were seen between disability changes and fatigue scorechanges.Conclusions: Patients with MS and fatigue remain fatigued after short-term follow-up. Changes in mood status, though not in disability score, may influ-ence changes in fatigue over time. Disclosure: X Montalban has nothing to disclose. P220 RELAPSING MYELITIS: A DEMYELINATING SYNDROME DISTINCT FROM MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Nicholas R, Fletcher N, Boggild M The Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom Background: Relapsing myelitis (RM) is a rare demyelinating syndrome that con- sists of recurrent episodes of spinal cord symptoms and signs. Unlike MS, which ischaracterised clinically by recurrent neurological symptoms and signs disseminatedin time and place, in RM the deficits appear to relate to a single spinal cord lesion.Objectives: To establish the clinical features, imaging and immunological characteristics of RM and ascertain its response to immunological therapy. Methods: Retrospective review of the case notes of patients with a diagnosis of RM who are currently under review at the Walton Centre.Results: 8 patients (5 women, 3 men) were identified with RM in whom the mean age of onset was 45 years (range 37-57). There were on average 3.5relapses/patient (range 2-7 relapses) during a mean follow-up of 4.5 years(range 2-8 years), no patients showed evidence of progression betweenrelapses. MR imaging of the brain was normal in 5 and in the remaining 3patients abnormalities atypical for demyelination were seen. Spinal cord imag-ing revealed a single inflammatory lesion in 7 and in the remaining patientimaging was normal on two occasions. CSF analysis showed oligoclonal bandsin 4 and increased lymphocytes and/or elevated CSF protein in 3. Acute relapses responded to intravenous or oral steroids. In 5 patients long-termimmunosuppression was initiated and has been continued for a mean of 2 years(range 4 months - 4 years) this consisted of azathioprine +/- prednisolone in 4and cyclosporin + prednisolone in On immunosuppression the relapserate fell from 1.1 relapses/year to 0.2 relapses/year. 1 patient had two relapses whilst on immunosuppression whilst no relapses were seen in the remaining 4. Conclusions: This is the largest group of RM patients presented. During the period of follow-up no patient with RM has developed MS as defined by theMacDonald criteria. This entity appears to represent a distinct demyelinatingsyndrome. Follow-up to date would suggest there is a response to long termimmunosuppression in this group Disclosure: RS Nicholas has nothing to disclose. NA Fletcher has nothing to disclose.

Data wereanalysed after 6 months (1995 IFN-treated and 824 placebo patients) and 2years (789 IFN-treated and 389 placebo patients) for haematological laboratoryabnormalities reported as adverse events (AEs). The overall safety populationof 3996 patients was analysed for AE dropouts and serious haematological AEs(SAEs).Results: In the pooled safety population, 6-month data revealed leucopenia in 1.8% of placebo patients, 0.3-2.0% of once weekly IFN patients (22, 30, and44mcg) and 7.3-10.2% of three times weekly (tiw) IFN patients (22 and44mcg). Lymphopenia was of 22mcg tiw patients 13%/4% placebo. Of patients on 22 and44mcg tiw with WBC abnormalities, 12.5% and 18%, respectively, thrombocytopenia (>75,000 platelets) was seen in 7.2%and 2.5% of patients on 44 and 22mcg tiw on placebo. Anaemia wasreported in of on 44 22mcg tiw vs. 3% on placebo.Data demonstrate that hemotological abnormalities diminish over time andare not associated with increased risk of infectious events. Although the pro-portion of patients on 44 mcg tiw with any grade lymphocyte abnormality isup to 45% over two years, only 23% are abnormal at the end of year 2demonstrating tachyphylaxis for lymphopenia. Of those developing lym-phopenia, 61% did so within 3 months of starting therapy. Cytopenias wereasymptomatic and reversible with dose adjustments. Only 0.3% (12/3996) ofpatients stopped therapy due to SAEs reported, 7were lymphopenia.Conclusions: Cytopenia, predominantly affecting the WBC lineage is com- mon with IFN therapy and is dose related. Events are asymptomatic, notassociated with increased infections, and rarely lead to discontinuation oftherapy.

It is widely believed that monosympto-matic ON(MON) is usually a first manifestation of multiple sclerosis(MS). Theproportion of patients with MON who will ultimately develop MS, is still amatter of debate.Objectives: To analyze the findings of automated perimeter and neuroimaging in patients with ON and define possible prognostic factors that can predict theevolution of ON or its progression to MS.Methods: Twenty patients with ON(3men-17women,aged 17-52 years) were studied retrospectively. Findings of the examination of visual fields with auto-mated perimeter and of brain, spinal cord(cervical and thoracic), optic nerves and paranasal sinuses with magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) during the acute phase of the disease were evaluated. Optic nerves were examined by MRI forabnormal enhancement and signal, atrophy or swelling and/or enlargement ofits subarachnoid spaces. The ON was a manifestation of MS with relapsing-remitting course in 8 of the 20 patients(all women); the remaining 12 hadMON(3men-9women). Other pathological causes of ON were excluded duringa 2-year follow-up. Results: Out of 12 patients with MON, 7 had brain and/or spinal cord demyelinating lesions revealed by MRI, and pathological visual fields(3bilateral); 5 of them later developed MS and all had positive brain and spinalcord MRI. Out of 8 patients with MS, 7 had pathologic visual fields and 3 hadpositive MRI of the optic nerves. In 4 patients we observed paranasal sinusi-tis, in two of which MON was associated with enhancement of the opticnerve.Conclusions: Asymptomatic regions in the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord revealed by MRI increase the likelihood for the progression of ON to MS. Cor-respondingly, the type of optic nerve MRI findings(atrophy or swelling) corre-late with the severity of initial visual loss and could be predictive of visualrecovery.

P223 ASSOCIATION OF UVEITIS AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS COULD INFLUENCE THE CLINICAL COURSE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Patrick V, Jean-yves G, Pierre L, Didier F, Tanya S, Albert V, J\u00e9r\u00f4me D Neurology, University of Lille, Lille, France Background: Uveitis is more common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) than in the general population. Objectives: The aim of the study was to compare the clinical data of MS patients with or without uveitis. Methods: MS patients were included according to the McDonald criteria. In the subgroup of patients with uveitis (MS-U), only patients with clinicalsymptoms of uveitis were included and classified according to the interna-tional uveitis study group. Other inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis, Behcetdisease) were excluded in all patients. To avoid biases, for each MS-Upatients, we included two MS patients consecutively seen at the same outpa-tient clinic.Results: Fifteen MS-U patients and 30 MS patients were compared. Types of uveitis were panuveitis, pars planitis and anterior uveitis in 9, 4 and 2 casesrespectively. In 9 cases, neurological signs occurred before onset of uveitis. Mean ages at onset of neurological symptoms were 29 years in both groups.Mean disease durations were 11.6 and 10.3 years in the MS-U group and in theMS group respectively. In the MS-U group, the evolution was relapsing-remit-ting (RR) in 14/15 cases and secondary progressive (SP) in one case. In the MSgroup, the evolution was RR in 16/32, SP in 11/32 and primary progressive in5 cases (p < 0.01). The mean EDSS scores were 2.6 and 5 (p < 0.002) and themean relapse rates during the first two years of MS were 1.8 and 2.6 (p < 0.05)in the MS-U and MS groups respectively.Conclusions: MS patients with uveitis seem to have a better prognosis than MS patients without uveitis.

P224 THE EFFECT OF CORTICOSTEROID ON CONDUCTION IN THE VISUAL PATHWAYS. A VISUAL PyeEMb, Weatherby Db, Foster United Kingdom Background: Acute relapses of MS are characterised by episodes of neurolog- ical dysfunction secondary to CNS inflammation, oedema and demyelination.IV corticosteroid is the mainstay of treatment, hastens resolution of acuteinflammatory change and promotes more rapid recovery. Subclinical involve-ment of the visual pathways in MS is common. Visual psychophysics providesan established measure of sensory deficit, which may be selective for differentfunctional pathways. A course of corticosteroid might be expected to improvesignal conduction in affected pathways, leading to measurable improvementsin vision.Objectives: To further elucidate the nature of the sensory deficit and effect of corticosteroid on conduction in the visual pathways during an acute MS relapsewe undertook a serial study using visual psychophysics. Methods: 5 patients (10 eyes) experiencing an acute, non-visual MS relapse having a three-day course of IV corticosteroid, had visual psychophysics per-formed at baseline, after the third dose and again one week later. Contrastthresholds were measured at three spatial frequencies (0.25, 1.0 and with counter-phase (chromatic-modulated) and in-phase (0.25 cyc/deg) throughout the study, chro- matic thresholds were significantly lower than corresponding achromaticthresholds (p < 0.0003). At low and medium spatial frequencies a non-signifi-cant improvement in both chromatic and achromatic thresholds from baselinewas seen following the third dose and was sustained at one week. At high spa-tial frequency (4.0 cyc/deg) improvements in chromatic and achromaticthresholds from baseline were not seen until one week post-corticosteroid.Conclusions: MS patients have subtle, subclinical deficits in vision that are not significantly improved by a course of corticosteroid. We suggest this isbecause chronic visual deficit may result from permanent structural injury e.g. gliosis and axonal loss. A degree of acute inflammatory change may, however, still be present as shown by the trend towards improvement in contrast thresh-olds. This trend favoured neither chromatic nor achromatic pathways.

PyeEMa, Weatherby Foster Staffs Royal Manchester, United Kingdom Background: Bilateral optic neuritis (BON) affects eyes either psychophysics provides an established measure of sensory deficit, which may be interpreted in terms of large and small fibre pathways.Objectives: We wished to investigate the nature of the visual deficits in BON using visual psychophysics and determine whether these differed in the twoclinically distinct forms of BON. Methods: Visual psychophysics was performed on 4 patients (7 eyes) with BsimON, i.e. both eyes affected within one week and 4 patients (8eyes) with BseqON, i.e. second eye affected more than 3 months after thefirst (range 3-72), and 5 controls (10 eyes). Mean time from optic neuritisto psychophysical testing was 41 months for BsimON and 31 months forBseqON. Contrast thresholds were measured at 3 spatial frequencies(0.25, 1.0 and 4.0 cyc/deg) with counter-phase and in-phase red and greengratings.Results: recovered to at least 6/9 in 5/7 BsimON eyes and 7/8 BseqON eyes but all eyes had thresholds higher than controls at all spatial fre-quencies. Mean thresholds were 7 times greater than controls in BsimON eyes (p<0.0001), although not significantly different from controls in BseqON eyes (p=0.04). BsimON eyes appear to have a preferential parvocellular deficit at0.25 cyc/deg (p=0.05). Conclusions: Despite good recovery of visual acuity in most eyes, visual psychophysical thresholds were much higher in BsimON eyes than Bse-qON eyes. The small fibre parvocellular pathway seemed preferentiallyaffected. Disclosure: E Pye has nothing to disclose. P226 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FATIGUE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS INITIATING INTERFERON BETA-1A THERAPY. Riskind P, Brown V, Kevin K Neurology, UMMHC, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA Background: One limitation in understanding MS fatigue is the lack of any objective measures, other than standard questionnaires. Objectives: We postulated that assessment of physical activity might be a use- ful objective means of assessing changes in MS fatigue. Since initiation ofinterferon therapy may be associated with transiently increased fatigue, westudied activity and energy in patients initiating interferon beta-1a therapy (30mcg IM once weekly). Methods: Twenty-five RRMS were moni- tored actigraphic devices for 2 weeks pre-therapy and 6-monthspost treatment. Subjective energy (VAS) was documented daily by eachpatient.Results: Post-injection day energy levels were lowest during the first week of treatment, but increased in a linear manner, reaching baseline at 5 weeks. Incontrast, activity on the days pre- or post-injection did not significantly changeover the initial 10 weeks of therapy. Daily energy and activity was signifi-cantly but minimally correlated (r=+0.11, p <0.001). Median weekly energyand activity scores in individual patients over 10 week epochs were moreclosely correlated than daily scores being either positive or negative (r=-0.809to +0.836). Activity and energy decreased during flares (both p<0.001). Activ-ity, but not energy scores were also significantly lower during flares than theweek before flares (p<0.001). Mean energy scores throughout the study corre-lated with entry assessments of global fatigue (Schwartz J, Jandorf L, Krupp L1993) (r=+0.62, p<0.001) but not with entry BDI or other fatigue subscales. Mean activity during the study did not correlate with entry BDI or fatigue scores.Conclusions: These results suggest that subjective energy does not substan- tially limit or modulate daily physical activity in MS patients initiating inter-feron beta-1a therapy. However, activity is a more objective and dynamicmeasurement than energy assessment and may be of value as an independentoutcome measure in MS patients.

Simone ILa, Carrara Da, Tortorella Fa, Livrea Pa aDepartment of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences, Clinical of Neurology, Bari, Italy;bDepartment of Clinical Pharmacology and Epidemiology, Istituto Chieti, Italy Background: Older age at onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) is frequently asso- ciated to a poor prognosis; by contrast the role of an early onset MS (EOMS)with regard to long-term outcome is not well defined.Objectives: To assess the prognostic role of clinical and demographic factors in MS patients categorized by age at onset.Methods: We analyzed a hospital-based historical cohort of 793 MS patients. Eighty-three patients were classified as EOMS ( 16 yrs) and 710 as adult onset MS ( 16 65 yrs) (AOMS). Patients were observed for a mean period of 5 yrs. Univariate and multivariate analyses of predictors for rapid progression (sec- ondary progressive-SP- course) and disability (EDSS 4) were performed usinga stepwise COX regression model with time dependent covariates. Results: Female/male ratio did not differ in EOMS and AOMS, however a female predominance occurred in puberal period. Despite a longer diseaseduration in EOMS (p=0.0006), the EDSS evaluated at last examination was lower (p 0.0001) than in AOMS. The probability to reach growth disability and SP course was lower in EOMS than in AOMS (p 0.001). Median times to reach EDSS 4 and SP were longer in EOMS than in AOMS (p 0.001), but the age at both end points was significantly lower in EOMS (p 0.002). In both MS groups an irreversible disability was associated with SP course (p 0.001) and sphincteric system at onset (p=0.041,p=0.007); in AOMS other factors were an older age at onset (p=0.001), a pyramidal system at onset (p=0.002) and high relapse frequency in the first two yrs (p 0.001). The risk of entering SP course was influenced by high relapse frequency in the first two yrs (p=0.016) in EOMS and by a higher age at onset (p 0.001) and a short first inter-attack interval ( 1 year) (p=0.022) in AOMS. Conclusions: A slower rate of progression disease characterized EOMS, sug- gesting a more plasticity to recover than AOMS. Nevertheless early clinicalmanifestation cannot be considered as a positive prognostic factor. Disclosure: I Simone has nothing to disclose. P228 MS PHENOTYPE : AN AGE-DRIVEN DISEASE ? Vukusic P, Gignoux L, Durand-Dubief Renoux Cedex 03, France Background: Age at onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been shown to be a good predictor of the time spent to reach different levels of disability. How-ever, it can be questioned if disability could be mostly age-driven.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether ages at which MS patients reach DSS 4, DSS 6 and DSS 7 were different according to their age atonset of the disease.Methods: The Lyon MS database was closed in April 1997 for the purpose of epi- demiological studies. It contained then data of 1844 definite or probable MSpatients, with a mean follow-up of 10 years. Eighty five percent had a relapsing-remitting onset and 15 % a progressive one. Patients were stratified according totheir age at MS onset in five classes : less than 20 years, 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49,50 years or more. For each patient, we determined the age at entry into irreversiblelevels of disability, as measured by the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale. Three keylevels of disability have been chosen : DSS 4, DSS 6 and DSS 7. When a patientwas lost to follow-up or had not reached the defined level of disability, censoringwas done at the age of the last visit. We performed survival analyses by the Kaplan-Meier method to determine the median age at DSS 4, DSS 6 and DSS 7, for eachinitial course and class of age at onset, and compared the results by the log-rank test.Results: A total of 1026 patients (56 percent), 595 (32 percent), and 380 (21 percent) reached DSS 4, DSS 6 and DSS 7 respectively. In relapsing-remittingPosters S92 Multiple Sclerosisonset patients, the median age at DSS 4, 6 and 7 were 44.8, 55.3 and 62.8 respectively. In progressive onset ones, they were 42.1, 53.0 and 63.1 respec-tively. These results were significantly different for DSS 4 and 6 (p < 0.0001and 0.002), but not for DSS 7 (0.24). However, even when statistically differ-ent, it can be underlined that the differences were not significant at the clinicallevel.Conclusions: Analyses for the role of age at MS onset are still in progress. Results will be available in September 2002. Disclosure: S Vukusic has nothing to disclose. P229 NEUROGENIC Stipal Rb aNeurological Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic;bInternal Clinic, University Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic Background: Heart disorders with reduction of cerebral blood flow raising neurological symptoms are widely known. The same attention should bedevoted to the opposite situation, when brain pathology could influence heartfunction. Objectives: Various central nervous system (CNS) disorders could result in important cardiac dysfunction. Electrocardiographic changes in brainischemia and subarachnoideal haemorrhage or in brain tumours are referred.CNS lesions could cause autonomous failure in degenerative diseases like ShyDrager syndrome, systemic atrophy or in high cervical spinal injuries. Wesuggest, that CNS lesion in multiple sclerosis (MS) could also circlearising cortex through hypothalamus, limbic structures, oblon-gata funicules of spinal cord. These changes could presentas abnormal reflex, which could result in syncope. Syncope is defined as tran-sient loss of consciousness and postural tone, which is caused by globalreduction of cerebral blood flow. There are two types of syncope: 1) cardio-genic 2) neurogenic. The second one could have trigger zone in peripheralreflex circle or could be result of activation of central part of autonomousnervous program.Methods: We present case report of MS woman with syncopes. During repeated head up tilt table test 25- second asystoly occurred with need of resus-citation. Malignant form of neurocardiogenic syncope was disclose.d and car-dio stimulator was implanted. Results: We have got other 10 MS patients who experienced noncardiogenic syncope categorized as autonomous disorders. Conclusions: Generally mechanism of CNS disorders resulting in syncope is not entirely clear. We are not able to determine, which part of reflex system inMS patients could cause this disorder and if syncope could be included to MSsigns. Anyway, connection is not possible to exclude.

Imaging (Part 2) P230 CORRELATION BETWEEN BRAIN ATROPHY AND APOLIPOPROTEIN E GENOTYPES IN WITH Ac, De Stefano Nc aDept. of Neurology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy;bNeurology Unit, Hospital of Empoli, Empoli, Florence, Italy;cInstitute of Neurological Science, University of Siena, Siena, Siena, Italy Background: Recent studies have suggested that MS patients who carry the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 4 allele may have a more severe disease course compared to those without the ApoE 4 allele. This might be related to moreextensive tissue damage and less efficient mechanisms of neuronal repair in 4 carriers. Objectives: To assess differences in axonal and tissue integrity in patients in the early stages of MS with different ApoE genotypes.Methods: We determined the ApoE genotype in 41 RRMS patients with short disease duration (<10 years) and mild disability (EDSS = 3). Each patient underwent combined proton MRI and MR spectroscopic imaging examina- tions to obtain measures of cerebral volumes and central brain levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA, a reliable measure of axonal integrity). Measures of thepatient group were compared to those of 14 demographically matched normalcontrols (NC). Results: We identified 11 patients with and 30 without the 4 allele. Clinical and demographical characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Both groups showed similar significant (p<0.003) decreases in central brain NAA levels (normalized to creatine [Cr]) with respect to NC (NAA/Cr in 4 patients = 2.83 \u00b10.18, NAA/Cr in patients without 4 allele = 2.77 \u00b10.14, NAA/Cr in NC = 3.05 \u00b10.25). In contrast, patients carrying the 4 allele showed significantly lower normalized brain volume (NBV) values than NC (NBV in 4 patients = ues of NBV were not significantly different between patients without the 4 allele and NC (NBV in patients without 4 allele = Decreases in NAA/Cr, similar in the two patient groups, suggest that a relevant axonal damage is present in patients in early disease stages inde-pendently of their ApoE genotype. In contrast, significant brain volume loss was found only in patients carrying the 4 allele, confirming that this genotype can influence more severe tissue destruction in MS.

P231 THE RELATION BETWEEN BRAIN MRI LESIONS AND DEPRESSIVESYMPTOMS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Bene\u00f6ov\u00e1 Ya, Niedermayerov\u00e1 Ia, Mechl Mb of Neurology, Brno, Republic;bDepartment of Radiology, University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic Background: This study investigates the relation between involvement of the specific areas of the brain and the depression in multiple sclerosis (MS)patients.Objectives: Magnetic resonance (MRI) regional lesions between the depressed and nondepressed groups of MS patients were compared.Methods: We studied 20 (10 depressed and 10 nondepressed) patients, 14 females and 6 males, average age (37.3+-7.2 SD) with definite relapsing-remitting MS, treated with interferons. EDSS score ranged from 1.0 to 4.0(mean EDSS 2.5 in the whole group, 2.8 in depressed group and 2.2 in nonde-pressed group).All patients underwent 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance examina-tion, including T1 and T2 weighted images. MRI data were analyzed by meas-uring the regional frontal, temporal, corpus callosum and total number and area(in mm2) of lesions and the side of lesions. The emotional state of the patientswas assessed with the following psychological tests: Hamilton Depression Rat-ing Scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and Montgomery DepressionScale.Results: There were 10 patients with the diagnosis of depression (three of them with severe depression, two of them with moderate depression and five of themwith light depression). Besides, there were ten nondepressed patients. The data from MRI scans showed that all patients had several demyelinating lesions. There were detect statistically significant differences in the regional frontal lesions area between the two groups (p =0,02) but not in temporal and corpus callosum location.The data from MRI scans showed that the diagnosis of major depression correlated with frontal lesion load.Conclusions: Our findings showed that depressive symptoms were associated with specifis brain lesions.

ASSESSMENT WITH MSFC AND H1-MRS Casanova Ba, Martinez Cc, in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) is a measure of the axonal loss. The MSFC is a more objective andsensitive measure of disability in MS patients because it integrates threeaspects: the arms function, the legs function and the cognitive functionObjectives: To study the presence of axonal loss, measuring the NAA/Cr ratio in the NAWM in early RRMS and its correlations with the MSFCMethods: We studied 23 RRMS patients, 69% females and 31% males, mean age 29.7 years old, mean evolution time 2.6 years (1-5) and mean EDSS 1.5 (0-3.5). The Z-score of our series was compared with the Z-score for a normalizedpopulation according the guidelines published by Fischer et al. The third Z-score obtained after two previous exams performed one year and six monthspreviously was used for comparisons. MRS: a two-dimensional phase encoded turbo spectroscopic image (2DTS1) was performed in a 1.5 T superconductive unit. A slice of 60x50x20 mm (volume of interest -VOI-) was located parallelto the transversal plane which contains the anterior and posterior commisureplane, at the pons and the cerebellar peduncles. The FID's from voxels wereFourier transformed and absolute metabolites were determined using thejMRUI softwareResults: The correlation between our MSFC Z-score and the normalized Z- score was 0.931 (Spermann rank). Linear regression analysis between theNAA/Cr ratio and the Z-score was significant (r2= 0.194, p=0. 035 -ANOVA)-. As we expected no correlation was reached between Z-score and EDSS (-0.35 p=0.09). No correlation between EDSS and the NAA/Cr ratio, r2= -0.225,p=0.302, and with any of the compounds of the Z-score was reachedConclusions: The MSFC is a reproducible and sensitive scale to measure the disability in MS, and it correlates with axonal loss in the NAWM in earlyRRMS patients. Realization of proton MRS at this location is easy, not expen-sive and reliable in clinical practice, and gives us an objective measure of thepathological state of patients \"in vivo\" that correlates with his disability Disclosure: B Casanova has nothing to disclose.

Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy;cClinical Neurology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, United Kingdom;dNeurology Empoli, loss of neurons due to cortical demyelination have been demonstrated in MS brains. Thus, cortical pathologymay contribute to neurological impairment in MS. Objectives: To assess cortical atrophy in patients with the relapsing and pro- gressive forms of MS at different disease stages and evaluate its relationshipwith clinical disability. Methods: We obtained conventional MRI examinations in 90 patients with definite MS who had either the relapsing remitting (RR, n= 65) or the primaryprogressive (PP, n= 25) form of the disease. Conventional T1-weighted MRimages were used to obtain cortical brain volumes normalized for head size using a method for computing measurements of brain volume. Proton densityand T2-weighted MR images were used to assess total brain lesion load. Results: Normalized cortical volumes (NCV) were significantly lower in both RR and PP MS patients than in age matched normal controls(p<0.001 for both), but similar in the two patient groups (p= 0.5).Signifi-cant NCV decreases were seen in both RR and PP even when MS patientswere grouped for early disease duration significant (p<0.0001) NCV decreasesin the RR MS group only. In addition, measures of NCV showed a closerelationship with those of T2-weighted lesion volume only in RR MSpatients, whereas NCV correlated with EDSS better in PP than in RR MSpatientsConclusions: These data confirm decreases in cortical volumes in MS patients and suggest that cortical grey matter pathology may occur earlyin the course of the disease. The significant negative correlation betweenclinical disability and NCV suggest that, especially in PP MS patients,grey matter pathology may contribute significantly to neurologicalimpairment Disclosure: N De Stefano has nothing to disclose.

Although somereproducibility studies have been performed, little is known about the repro-ducibility in structures such as the thalamus and hippocampus. Objectives: to investigate within what ranges of error metabolite concentra- tions of healthy subjects, as measured with Methods: Using single voxel 1H-MRS ms, 64 aver- ages, Siemens Vision 1.5T), 13 healthy subjects were measured, mean age 28years. In total, 10 spectra were obtained from parietal cortex (12 ml), 10 fromhippocampus (6 ml) and 7 from thalamus (7 ml). After a time lapse varyingfrom 1 day to 2 months, subjects were re-examined and spectra were obtainedfrom the same brain regions. Metabolite concentrations were calculated usingLCModel. For each metabolite, variation between the two measurements wasexpressed statistically by the coefficient of variation (CoV). In addition,metabolite concentrations were compared between brain regions using anunpaired Student's t-test.Results: Significant regional differences were observed for most of the metabolite concentrations. For the major metabolites tNAA, tCr, Cho and myo-Ins, the CoV ranged from 8-20% in all regions, with highest values in the hip-pocampus. For Glu and Gln the CoV was as low as 15 and 35% in cortex, but up to 60 and 75% in hippocampus. Mean concentration of tNAA was 7.4 \u00b10.6 mM in the cortical grey matter 10%), 6.7 mM in the \u00b10.8 mM in the thalamus (CoV: 8%). No systematic bias in the measurements was found. Conclusions: Clear regional differences exist both in metabolite concentra- tions in reproducibility in cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of healthyhuman subjects. This has to be considered when studying these brain regions infollow-up studies of MS patients. Disclosure: J Geurts has nothing disclose. Multiple SclerosisP235 INCREASED MEASURED BY 1H-MRS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BRAIN. Greenstein JIa, Luo Smith SAd, OBc aMultiple Sclerosis Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA;bNeurology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA;cDiagnostic Imaging, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA;dDepartment of Occupational Therapy, Temple University College of Allied Health Professions, Philadelphia,Pennsylvania, USA Background: Glutamate excitotoxicity may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS by producing oligodendroglial loss, axonal dystrophy; factors which maycontribute to disease progression. Elevated CSF and increased tissue glutamatelevels have been found in MS. In active lesions, macrophages are the majorproducers of glutamate and are associated with oligodendroglial loss andaxonal dystrophy. AMPA receptor antagonists have afforded neuroprotectionwithout reduced inflammation in EAE, suggesting that glutamate antagonismmay be a viable therapeutic option in MS in addition to anti-inflammatoryagents. Objectives: This study evaluated glutamate/glutamine levels in MS brain using 1H-MRS. Areas of acute inflammation; of chronic axonal loss and ofnormal appearing white matter (NAWM) were examined and compared withnormal white matter.Methods: Sixty one MS patients (RRMS=36, SPMS=24, PPMS=1) and 10 normal controls were studied. Eighty five lesions and 10 normal areaswere examined using single voxel 1H-MRS. All studies were performedwith GE 1.5TLx MRI using TE=35msec, TR=1150msec. resolved. Gadolinium-enhancing,T2+/T1-, T2+/T1+ lesions as well as NAWM were compared with normalcontrol white matter.Results: Both alpha and beta/gamma glutamate/glutamine peaks were elevated in all MS areas examined. Levels were elevated in RRMS, SPMS and PPMS. Much greater elevations were seen in gadolinium-enhancing lesions when compared with the other MS lesions and NAWM. Increased glutamate levelswere particularly associated with acute T1 hypointense areas. Conclusions: Diffusely elevated levels of glutamate/glutamine are present in both acute and chronic MS lesions as well as NAWM as measured by 1H-MRS. Particularly elevated levels are associated with acute inflammation.This confirms and extends the histopathological evidence for glutamate tox-icity and suggests that glutamate antagonism should be further investigatedin MS.

P236 GLOBAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY METABOLIC VARIATIONS AS INDICATORS OF DISEASE ACTIVITY IN RELAPSINGREMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Inglese M, Rusinek H, Babb JS, Grossman RI, Gonen O Radiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York City, New York, USA Background: The widespread, diffuse activity of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), even during its clinically stable phase, potentially leads to continual accumu-lation of neuronal and axonal damage. Although not visible on conventionalMRI, this activity also involves the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM)and plays an important role in the evolution of the disease from the initialrelapsing-remitting (RR) to the later, more debilitating, secondary progres-sive phase.Objectives: To ascertain the presence and the extent of disease activity in the NAWM of the brain of patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS using protonmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS)Methods: The concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), Creatine and Choline (Cho) were obtained with with 3-dimensional 1H-MRS at 1.5 Tesla from a large, 0.5L, brain volume of eleven RR MS patients (median EDSS: 2.5; range: 0.0-6.0) and nine age and sex matched healthy con-trols. Results: The NAA level in the NAWM of the patients was significantly lower than the controls' while their Cr and Cho were significantly higher (p=0.04,0.001 and <0.0001, respectively). The Cho level was the only metric able to dif- ferentiate RR MS patients from the controls at 100% specificity and sensitivity exceeding 90%.Conclusions: The NAA, Cho and Cr deviations from controls' \"normal\" indicate that even the clinically silent phase of the disease is characterized byabnormal elevated metabolic activity. Specifically, the elevated Cho and Crprobably reflect microscopic inflammation/demyelination and remyelinationprocesses. Therefore, they are potential prognostic indicators of diseaseactivity.

How-ever, progressive clinical cognitive deficits have always suggested gray-mat-ter (GM) involvement in addition to sub-cortical dementia from WM pathol-ogy. Indeed, recent pathology and MRI studies have shown lesions in theGM as well.Objectives: To ascertain the extent of gray-matter (GM) involvement in MS, from the concentration of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a metabolite found almostexclusively in neuronal cells, over the whole brain of MS patients versusmatched controls. Methods: The whole-brain-NAA (WBNAA) concentration: The ratio non-localizing proton MR spectroscopy, tothe parenchymal volume from high resolution MRI, was measured in 71 relaps-ing-remitting (RR) MS patients (51 women, 20 men, 25-55 years old) and 41controls (27 women, 14 men, 23-55 years old).Results: The average WBNAA difference between the patients and the controls was -2.9 mM (-22%, p<0.0001) GM constitute ~30% and 60% of the brain vol- ume, respectively, and the NAA concentration in the former is 2/3 the latter's,then losses greater than 32% cannot be explained in terms of WM pathologyalone and must include widespread GM deficits. Therefore, the concept of MSas a WM disease might need to be reexamined to be reclassified as a diffuse \"whole brain disorder.\" Disclosure: M Inglese has Supported by Shering.Multiple SclerosisPosters S95 P238 BRAIN VOLUME CHANGES AFTER SUPPRESSION OF MRI-VISIBLE INFLAMMATION IN PATIENTS WITH SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MSTREATED WITH AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION Ospedale San Raffaele, Neuroimaging Research Unit, Milan, Italy;bDepartment of Neurological Sciences and Vision, University of Genova, Genova, Italy;eNeurological and Psychiatric Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy;fOncology and Neuroscience, University of Chieti, Chieti, Italy;gBone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Careggi Hospital, Florence, IT, Italy;hNeurometabolic Unit, University of Siena, Siena, Italy Background: Magnetic resonance (MR)-based brain volumetric measures have the potential to quantify the destructive pathological aspects of MS, thusproviding reliable surrogate markers of disease progression. A recent, multi-center, phase I/II, trial of patients with secondary progressive (SPMS) hasshown that autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has adramatic and sustained effect on disease activity, as measured by counting thenumber of enhancing lesions seen after the injection of a triple dose (TD) ofgadolinium (Gd). Objectives: To investigate whether brain atrophy continues to occur even in the unique condition of complete and sustained suppression of MRI-visible inflammation. Methods: Ten patients with severely-disabling and rapidly evolving SPMS from 5 centers participating into this trial underwent brain post-contrast T1-weightedscans one month after the treatment and 12 and 24 months later. Normalized brainvolume (NBV) was measured using a fully automated technique called SIENA.Results: The mean percentage change of NBV from baseline to month 12 was -1.8 % (range: -5.2% to 1.0%; 7 patients) and from month 12 to month 24 was-1.9 % (range: -1.3% to -2.5%; 5 patients).Conclusions: This study shows that continuous and marked brain tissue loss can occur even in the absence of activity on TD enhanced MRI, thus suggestingthat, at least in SPMS, \"neurodegeneration\" occurs also in absence of overtinflammatory changes.

P239 COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL STATUS IN A POPULATION OF PATIENTSPRESENTED WITH CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES SUGGESTIVEOF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Jean Pa,b, La,b, Florence Aa,b, Jean Philippe Cb Background: Cognitive and emotional dysfunctions are frequent findings in multiple sclerosis (MS) that can occur even at the early stage of the disease. Objectives: To investigate the potential cognitive and emotional dysfunctions in a population of patients presented with clinically isolated syndromes sugges- tive of MS (CISSMS). Methods: We compared the of forty-five patients presenting with CISSMS and twenty-for sexe-age-sociocultural matched healthy volun-teers for an extensive neuropsychological battery (memory : Selective Remind-ing Test, Delayed Recall of SRT, 10/36 Spatial Recall Test, Delayed Recall of10/36 -R subtest,WMS-R subtests, Stroop test, Trailmaking test (A and B), Wisconsin CardSorting Test ; language : Boston naming test ; visuo-spatial functions : WAIS-R subtest, Symbol Digit Modalities Test). Emotional status was assessed with Toronto Alexithymia Scale and emotional visual task. Results: No significant difference was found between CISSMS and controls for emotional tasks, language, memory, executive functions and visuospa-tial abilities. However, patients with CISSMS had a significant impairmentof PASAT (2s and 3s) than did control volunteers (p<.05 for each condi-tion).Conclusions: These findings suggest the potential value of PASAT as surro- gate marker of cognitive dysfunction at the very early stage of MS.

Objectives: We hypothesized that neural substrates underlying motor perform- ance in MS patients include nonprimary motor regions, particularly premotorcortex, to a larger extent than in healthy controls. Methods: We studied BOLD fMRI activation patterns associated with carefully controlled performance of the same hand motor task (voluntary thumb flexionmovements) in nine patients with multiple sclerosis and nine healthy controls (HC).Disease stages, duration and EDSS scores were variable, but all patients were capa-ble of performing independent thumb movements with the right hand (dominant).Thumb movement kinematics and EMG activity were monitored during scanning.Task specific activations were identified using random effects analysis in SPM99.Results: Thumb movement kinematic measures (magnitude of first peak accel- eration, movement direction and frequency) were comparable in patients andcontrols indicating task consistency across groups in the absence of EMG mir- ror activity. Performance of thumb movement was associated with more acti- vation in contralateral premotor (area 6) and association (BA 46) cortices inMS patients relative to controls. Conclusions: These results are consistent with the idea that activity in nonpri- mary motor areas, particularly premotor cortex, may play a compensatory rolein recovery of motor function in multiple sclerosis.

P241 INTERCAUDATE NUCLEUS RATIO (ICR) IN MS PATIENTS AS A LINEAR MEASURE OF BRAIN ATROPHY Khan O, Zvartau-Hind M, Caon C, Ching W, Lisak R, Tselis A Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA Background: Brain atrophy is being investigated as an outcome measure in MS therapeutic trials. It has been suggested that measurement of ICD and ICRis a potentially reliable linear measure of brain atrophy in MS patients. Mea-surement of ICD does not require software application and is independent ofimage acquisition techniques. We performed ICR measurement to confirmPosters S96 Multiple Sclerosisreproducibility of this technique and to examine potential association with dis- ease variables in our MS patient population.Objectives: To study the reliability of ICR as a linear measure of brain atrophy and to examine the relationship between ICR and disability in MS patients withdifferent disease types.Methods: 190 MRI scans of MS patients seen in our clinic were analyzed for the measurement of ICD (defined as the distance between the medial border ofcaudate nuclei identified on the most caudal axial slice) and ICR (defined asICD divided by the inter-inner table of the skull distance at the same level).Correlation between ICR and multiple disease variables including EDSS, dis-ease duration, sex, and age, were examined. Comparison of ICR in RRMS withSPMS patients was also performed. Results: Of 190 patients analyzed, 167 patients had RRMS and 23 had SPMS. Mean EDSS was 3.2 (SD 1.7 ), mean age was 40.2 years (SD 9.3), mean dis-ease duration was 8.5 years (SD 7.2). Mean ICR was 0.11 (SD 0.04). 142patients were female. Male patients had significantly higher ICR (Means 0.12 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively, p<.001). There was a significant correlation between ICR and EDSS (Rho=.67; p<0.0001). There also was a significantalthough weaker correlation between ICR and disease duration (r=.32;p<0.001). There was a significant difference between the mean ICR of RR andSP MS patients, 3.9 mm vs. 7.1 mm, respectively (p<0.0001). Conclusions: ICR appears to be a reliable and reproducible linear measure of brain atrophy. ICR appears to correlate with disability and disease duration inMS patients. Furthermore, patients with SPMS have a larger ICD (ICR) thanpatients brain atrophy. ICD and ICR measure-ment can be performed in an outpatient setting and may be a useful clinical toolin the management of MS patients. Further longitudinal studies are necessaryto validate this technique. Disclosure: O Khan has nothing to disclose. P242 CEREBRAL ATROPHY IN SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: EFFECT OF Nottingham;bEuropean Charcot Foundation, Nijmegen, Netherlands Background: Several studies have demonstrated the importance of measuring brain volume as a surrogate marker of disease progression in MS. The recentlycompleted European study of IVIG at the dose of 1g/kg/body weight monthlyin patients with secondary progressive MS has provided an opportunity toassess the effect of IVIG treatment on cerebral atrophy using 3-dimensional (3-D) MRI. Objectives: To assess the effect of IVIG on brain atrophy in secondary pro- gressive MS.Methods: A subgroup of 43 patients from 5 centres underwent and completed T1-weighted magnetisation prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo(MPRAGE) images at 12-month intervals from month 0 to month 24.Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were acquired at 3-month intervals. The volumes of supratentorial and infratentorial structures and the lateral ventricles were estimated using modern design stereology and pointcounting on 3-D MPRAGE images. Results: The placebo (n=22) and treated (n=21) groups were well matched for the baseline demographics and the volumes of supratentorial (902+/-53vs 911+/-45 ml), (27.1+/-17.4 vs 23.4+/-10.8 ml). There was a significantenlargement of the lateral ventricles at month 24 in both placebo and IVIGtreated groups, with a mean increase of 9.8 and 7.4%, respectively. In paral-lel, there was a smaller reduction of supratentorial brain volume in IVIGthan placebo treated patients (-0.5 vs -2.1%) over 24 months, but this differ-ence was not significant (p=0.25). However, the placebo group showed a sig-nificantly greater infratentorial volume reduction at month 12 (-1.8 vs+2.1%, p=0.022) and month 24 (-3.3 vs +0.8%, p=0.026) compared with theIVIG treated group. In the total cohort, the percentage change of lateral ven-tricles was correlated with the change in EDSS over 24 months (r=0.58, p<0.0001).Conclusions: Brain volume reduction was smaller in the IVIG treated group with a statistically significant difference regarding changes in infratentorialbrain volume over 24 months. The mechanism(s) responsible for the impact ofIVIG on brain atrophy are to be elucidated.

P243 CORRELATES OF MAGNETIZATION TRANSFER IMAGING METRICS INPRIMARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE Rovira Ab, Spain;bMagnetic Resonance Unit (IDI), University Hospital Vall d, Barcelona, Spain Background: Weak correlations between clinical and MRI parameters in PPMS have been reported.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to establish correlations between normal appearing gray (NAGM) and white matter (NAWM) mag-netization transfer (MT) metrics and clinical measures in a cohort of PPMSpatients.Methods: Proton density, T2- and T1-weigted and MT images of the brain were obtained from 38 PPMS patients. MT histograms from NAWM andNAGM were calculated. Clinical assessment was performed by means of theEDSS and the MSFC. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) was alsoadministered.Results: No correlations were demonstrated between brain MTR measures (mean, mode) and the MSFC or the PASAT. The SDMT showed (r=0.347; p=0.03)MTR mean values.Conclusions: This study suggests that the alterations observed in the NAGM of patients with PPMS might play a role in cognitive impairment when meas-ured with the SDMT.

P244 DISSEMINATION SPACE IN BRAINSTEM SYNDROMES Sastre-Garriga Ja, Tintore Ma, Rovira Ab, Ja, - Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain;cInstitute of Neurorehabilitation, London, UnitedKingdom Background: Barkhof criteria have been adopted in the new multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostic criteria to demonstrate dissemination in space (DIS) becauseof their high specificity for predicting conversion to MS. One of the Barkhofcriteria is the presence of infratentorial lesions which, in clinically isolated syn-dromes (CIS) of the brainstem (CISB), does not demonstrate DIS. This would suggest that Barkhof criteria would have less specificity in CISB as compared to other CIS.Objectives: To determine the specificity of Barkhof criteria in a cohort of CISB and to compare it with other CIS; and to assess the performance of eachone of its four parameters.Methods: 153 patients with CIS (51 CISB, 46 myelitis, 56 optic neuritis) were longitudinally studied. Barkhof criteria (cut-off: 3 out of 4) were applied. ToMultiple SclerosisPosters S97 find out the performance of each one of the four parameters of Barkhof criteria we analysed fulfilling of four subsets of modified Barkhof criteria using onlythree parameters at a time and setting positivity in 2 out of 3.Results: A specificity of 61% in CISB versus 73% in other CIS was found. The modified subsets of Barkhof criteria that retain the infratentorial lesion and 42%)than the subset not including it (61%). In other CIS all four subsets of Barkhofcriteria performed similarly (66%, 70%, 68% and 66%).Conclusions: When applied to CISB, Barkhof criteria are not as specific as in other CIS, and should be differently applied. We hypothesize that another cri-terion demonstrating DIS in CISB might be more specific. Disclosure: X Montalban has nothing to disclose. P245 COMPUTER ASSISTED VOLUMETRIC ANALYSIS OF GADOLINIUM ENHANCEMENT IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Preiningerova Ja, Ding Zb, Cannistraci Cb, Sun Hb, Vollmer Ta, Anderson Ab aNeurology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA;bDiagnostic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Background: Quantification of gadolinium enhancement (gd) in provides an important outcome measure in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Auto-mated quantification of Gd enhancement on brain MRI is technically challeng-ing due to several reasons including a range of signal intensities within orbetween lesions or among scans, and misclassification of vessels as enhancinglesions.Objectives: The goal was to develop and evaluate a computer-assisted method of quantitative analysis of Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI in MS. Methods: Contiguous 3 mm, axial scans of T1 pre and post gd, FLAIR, and proton density weighted images were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla GE scanner. Thelocations of enhancing lesions were first identified by an expert reader, and thethree dimensional extent of gd+ lesions was determined with a computer-assisted algorithm using a combination of seed-growing and local thresholdingtechniques. The number and volume of Gd+ lesions were then automaticallycalculated. An interface is provided for simultaneous display of the three seriesof MR images, and identification of corresponding pixels, which facilitate cor-rect and efficient determination of lesions by the reader.Results: A total of 18 monthly scans of two consented subjects who participate in a clinical trial was included in the validation study. An expert reader can regis-ter the location of lesions and determine the volume in 2-8 min/per scan depend-ing on the number of lesions. Variability in the method is introduced at the levelof expert reader when localizing lesions and at the level of volumetric analysis.Intrarater variability of a trained operator performing the volumetric quantifica-tion based on the expert determined locations of lesions is 5.6%. Variabilityintroduced in localizing lesions by the expert reader is much larger. Our datashow that such variability is as large as 37.8% for subjects with small lesion load.Conclusions: Volumetric analysis with expert identified lesions is highly reproducible. Variability in this method is largely introduced by differentthresholds an expert reader applies when identifying lesions. We are making aneffort to develop a well defined protocol to assist in localization of lesions so asto reduce this source of variability. Disclosure: J Preiningerova has nothing to disclose.

P246 COMPARISON OF CEREBRAL PERFUSION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSISUSING A NOVEL TECHNIQUE Rashid Wa, Parkes Lb, Ingle Ga, Chard Da, Symms Ma, Miller Da aNMR unit, Institute of Neurology, Queen Square, London, United Kingdom;bFC Donders Centre for of Nijmegan, Nijmegan, Nijmegan, Netherlands Background: Cerebral perfusion in multiple sclerosis (MS) has never been estimated using Continuous Arterial Spin Labelling (CASL), an MRI techniqueusing endogenously labelled arterial water. It is potentially a more accurate methodology, as it allows quantitative measurements and is less susceptible tocontrast loss in blood brain barrier disruption.Objectives: To compare perfusion changes between MS and its subgroups against controls using CASL.Methods: 33 controls and 59 MS subjects (12 primary progressive (PP), 21 relapsing remitting (RR) of which 11 were on beta-interferon (RRi) and 10 not(RRn), 13 benign and 13 secondary progressive (SP)) were compared. Seg-mentation based on the differing T1 relaxation times of white (WM) and greymatter (GM) produce averaged perfusion values for these areas. Also, voxelbased morphometry (VBM), using SPM99, was applied to compare perfusionmaps between groups.Results: Multiple linear regression accounting for age and gender effects, show a significant increase in whole white matter perfusion (WMP) in RR (p=0.02) and SP (p=0.04) groups using T1 relaxation map values. In RRi thereis no significant increase in WMP compared with controls, whereas in RRnthere is a significant increase (p=0.03). However, there is no significant differ-ence in WMP between the two RR subgroups. No significance is seen in wholeGM perfusion. From VBM, significant decreases (p<0.03) are seen comparingall MS subjects to controls in bilateral thalami, cingulate gyri and in regions ofboth frontal and parietal with both WM and GM affected. In RRn, signif-icant increase (p=0.01) is seen in a WM area in the left frontal lobe, no increaseis seen in RRi. SP shows significant increase around the left superior temporalgyrus (p=0.01) and decrease mainly at the right superior frontal gyrus (p=0.01).In PP, significant decreases (p<0.04) are seen in areas of the left frontal lobe.Conclusions: This is the first study to show such a widespread pattern of per- fusion change in both GM and WM. The increase in whole WMP may reflectinflammatory activity particularly in RR and SP patients. This suggests CASLhas potential in monitoring disease activity.

P247 FUNCTIONAL CORTICAL CHANGES IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND NON-SPECIFIC CONVENTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SCANS OF THE BRAIN Rocca Institute and University Milan, di University HSR, Milan, 93, Italy;dDepartment of Neurology, Scientific Institute and University HSR, Milan, 93, Italy Background: Cortical adaptive changes have been shown in patients with MS and different clinical courses.Objectives: To evaluate, using fMRI, the movement-related brain patterns of cortical activations in patients with clinically definite MS (CDMS) and non-specific conventional MRI abnormalities of the brain. To quantify tissue dam-age of the normal appearing white (NAWM) and gray (NAGM) matter of thesepatients, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).Methods: We investigated 12 right-handed patients with CDMS and 12 sex- and age-matched controls. Patients were included if they had three or fewerlesions on brain T2-weighted scans. In each subjects we acquired: 1) fMRI(flexion-extension of the last four fingers of the right and left hands, respec-tively). 2) dual-echo sequence and 3) pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence.FMRI data were analyzed using SPM99. Lesions were measured using a localthresholding segmentation technique. Mean diffusivity (MD) histograms ofNAWM and NAGM produced. Results: In CDMS patients, the mean T2-weighted lesion load was 0.3 ml. MS patients had lower MD histogram peak height (p<0.0001) and higher peak posi-tion (p=0.03) of the NAGM than healthy subjects. When performing the simplemotor task with the dominant hand, MS patients had more significant activationsof the ipsilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), the ipsilateral superior frontalsulcus, the contralateral superior temporal gyrus, and the thalamus than controls.Posters S98 Multiple SclerosisOn the contrary, controls showed more significant activations of the medial part of the contralateral parieto-occipital fissure and the ipsilateral primary sensori-motor cortex (SMC) than patients with MS. In patients with MS, the relative acti-vation of the ipsilateral SMA was correlated with the peak height (r=-0.88,p<0.001) and position (r=0.87, p<0.001) of the GM mean diffusivity histogram.Conclusions: Cortical reorganization occurs over a rather distributed sensori- motor network in MS patients with non-specific abnormalities on conventionalbrain MRI scans.

P248 THE ROLE OF SPINAL CORD DAMAGE ON BRAIN CORTICAL PLASTICITY: A FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STUDY Filippi Mezzapesa Gb aNeuroimaging Research Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Institute and University Milan, di University HSR, Milan, 81, Italy;dDepartment of Neurology, Scientific Institute and University HSR, Milan, Italy Background: Functional cortical changes have been demonstrated in patients with MS and diffuse white matter abnormalities of the brain and the spinalcord. The contribution of spinal cord damage, taken in isolation, on brain adap-tive changes, has not been elucidated yet.Objectives: To assess, using fMRI, the brain pattern of movement-associated cortical activations in patients with a previous remitting episode of acutemyelitis of possible demyelinating origin.To investigate whether the extent ofcortical functional reorganization is associated with the extent of cervical cordpathology measured using magnetization transfer imaging (MTI).Methods: We studied 12 right-handed patients in a chronic phase after an iso- lated myelitis and 12 healthy controls. In each subject, we obtained: a) fMRI(repetitive flexion-extension of the last four fingers of the right hand), b) braindual-echo scans, c) cervical cord fast-STIR and MT-MRI scans. FMRI datawere analyzed using SPM99.Results: No brain abnormalities were detected in the two groups studied. In comparison with healthy subjects, patients with myelitis had lower averagecord MTR (p<0.0001) and cord MTR histogram peak location (p<0.0001).They also had more significant activation of the ipsilateral primary somato-motor cortex (SMC), supplementary motor area and middle frontal gyrus(MFG). Relative activation of the ipsilateral MFG was correlated with MTR (r=-0.91, p<0.001) and cord MTR peak location (r=-0.87,p<0.001).Conclusions: This study demonstrates that cervical cord damage can elicit functional cortical changes that could have an adaptive role in limiting the clin-ical consequences of cord structural pathology.

P249 SHORT-TERM CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CLINICAL AND MRI FINDINGS IN Neuroscience, University HSR, Milan, Italy;bTEVA Pharmaceutical Industries, Petah Tiqva, Israel;cHealth Science Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas, USA;dClinical Trials Unit, Department of Neurology, Scientific Institute and University HSR, Milan, Italy Background: The relationship between clinical and MRI findings in MS patients has not been fully elucidated yet.Objectives: We investigated the short-term correlations between clinical and MRI-measured disease activity in a large sample of patients with RRMSby analysing the dataset from the European/Canadian glatiramer acetate (GA) trial.Methods: The trial was a nine-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, where 239 RRMS patients were randomized to receive either 20 mg GA(n=119) or placebo (n=120). Brain dual echo, pre- and post-gadolinium (Gd)T1-weighted MRI scans were obtained at baseline and every month. Gd-enhancing and new T2-hyperintense lesions were counted and total T1-hypointense lesion (LV) found number of relapses during the study period and number of Gd-enhancing lesions at base-line (r=0.25) and during the follow-up (r=0.30) in the study population. Whenthe two study arms were considered in isolation, the degree of the correlationswas higher in the placebo than in the GA group. A multivariable modelshowed that the independent factors more strongly correlated with the fre-quency of relapses during the study period were the number of relapses duringthe two years before study entry and the number of on-trial Gd-enhancing lesions, both in the study population as a whole and in the placebo group. In the whole patient sample, both T2 and T1 LV at baseline were significantlycorrelated with baseline EDSS. Changes of MRI lesion volumes and EDSSwere significantly correlated in the whole patient sample and in the GA group.Both T2 and T1 LV at baseline were significant predictors of the amount ofMRI activity during the study period. T2 and T1 LV at baseline were signifi-cantly correlated with the lesion volume changes during the subsequent ninemonths.Conclusions: In RRMS, MRI-measured inflammatory activity is only mod- estly, but significantly correlated with the occurrence of clinical attacks over ashort-term period.

P250 PROTON MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY IN FAMILIAL AND SPORADIC MS Siger-Zajdel M, Selmaj K Neurology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland Background: There are some indication that familial and sporadic multiple sclerosis (MS) patients might differ in clinical and MRI features of the disease.These differences might be explained by the heterogeneity of white matterpathology in both form of MSObjectives: The aim of this study was to compare abnormalities of normal- appearing white matter (NAWM) between familial and sporadic MS patientsusing water suppressed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS).Methods: Fifteen familial MS (male/female ratio 0.6, mean age=35.0, mean disease duration 5.9, mean EDSS=2.3) and fifteen sporadic MS patients(male/female ratio=0.87, mean age=34.6, mean disease duration=6.63, meanEDSS=3.63) were including in the study.Additionally, thirteen age and sexmatched healthy individuals were selected as control. H-MRS was performedusing a point-resolved slice-selective (PRESS) sequence (TE msec, 256 averages). Volume of interest (VOI)(8ml, 20x20x20mm3)was located in the left centrum semiovale. Using post peak compounds(NAA/Cho), N-acetyl-aspartate/Creatine (NAA/Cr)and phoshocreatine(Cho/Cr) were estimatedResults: In group NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr were signif- icantly lower than in control group (NAA/Cho 1.88 vs 2.35 p<0.05; NAA/Cr1.90 vs 2.28 p<0.05). In familial MS NAA/Cho was significantly decreasedcompared with control group (NAA/Cho 1.86 vs 2.35 p<0.05). Similarly insporadic MS group NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr were significantly decreased com-pared with control group (NAA/Cho 1.90 vs 2.35 p<0.05; NAA/Cr 1.87 vs 2.28p<0.05). A comparison of the familial and sporadic MS group showed thatNAA/Cho was slightly lower and NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr were slightly higher inMultiple SclerosisPosters S99 familial patients than sporadic 1.90; NAA/Cr 1.94 vs 1.87; Cho/Cr 1.03 vs 1.01)Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that there are some subtle differ- ences in white matter metabolic concentration between familial and sporadicMS detected by H-MRS Disclosure: M Siger-Zajdel has nothing to disclose. P251 A COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT QUANTITATIVE MRI TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE WHOLE BRAIN ATROPHY IN RELAPSING-REMITTINGMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Zivadinov Ra, Italy;bBuffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center, University of Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA Background: A variety of techniques for measuring brain atrophy have been applied to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objectives: The goal of this study was to compare the correlations between clinical and MRI characteristics among three different normalized measures ofwhole brain atrophy obtained by semiautomated and automated segmentationprocesses.Methods: We studied 34 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (median dis- ease duration 8.5 years, median age 36.5 years, median EDSS 1.5). T2- andT1-lesion loads (LL) were obtained using a reproducible semiautomatedtechnique. Whole brain atrophy was measured on conventional spin-echoT1-weighted axial sequences by three different software programs devel-oped to measure brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The Buffalo and Triestesoftware programs are semiautomated methods, whereas inter- and intra-observer variability (COV) wasestimated for all three methods and ranged 0.32 to 0.44 (inter-observer) and 0.33 to 0.44 (intra-observer), the lowest for the SIENAXmethod.Results: Mean T2- and T1-LL were 23.1 ml (SD 19.7) and 2.7 ml (SD 3.9), respectively. Mean BPF was 0.830 (SD 0.04) with Buffalo, 0.824 (SD 0.04)with Trieste and 0.826 (SD 0.04) with SIENAX method (p= NS). Buffalo andTrieste slightly higher for Buffalo and Trieste BPF In stepwise multiple regressionanalysis semiautomated brain atro- phy methods showed significantly stronger correlations with physical disabil-ity than the fully automated SIENAX method. This study suggests the utility of computer assisted semiautomated methods in determining whole brain atro- phy in MS. Disclosure: R Zivadinov has nothing to disclose.

P252 REGIONAL BRAIN PARENCHYMAL ATROPHY D, of Neurology, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy Background: Recently, several regional brain atrophy measures have been applied in natural history studies and clinical trials in patients with multiplesclerosis (MS). Differences in quantitative segmentation morphometry of brainparenchymal regions may be an important limit in studies which correlate cog-nitive function and MRI measures in neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, there is still a controversy regarding the optimal regional brain parenchymalatrophy measurement technique.Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a reproducible regional brain parenchymal atrophy method of measurement.Methods: We studied 27 patients with relapsing-remitting (RR)- MS (median disease duration 9 years). T1- and T2- lesion load (LL) of frontal lobes weremeasured using a reproducible semiautomated technique. The neuropsycholog-ical performances and the disability of the patients have been assessed Theregional brain parenchymal volume (RBPV) of frontal lobes was obtainedusing a computerized interactive program, which incorporates semiautomatedand automated segmentation processes. A normalized measure, the regionalbrain parenchymal fraction (RBPF) was calculated as the ratio of RBPV to thetotal volume of the parenchyma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the frontallobes. A digital 3D version of Harvard Medical School Atlas was used as a ref-erence for the segmentation of the frontal lobes after the coregistration. Theboundaries have been outlined on each anatomic slice using a 1 mm computerdisplayed atlas image protocol based on standard neuroanatomic landmarksThe mean CV for RBPF of demonstrated remarkably stronger correlation with neuropsycho- logical functioning, disability and quantitative MRI lesion measures significant correlation between T2-LL of the frontal lobes and both regional parenchymal atrophy measures.Conclusions: These data suggest that RBPF is a sensitive and reproducible method for measuring regional brain parenchymal atrophy.

Trieste, Italy;bDepartment of Neurological Sciences, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, RO, Italy;cEuropean Biomedical Foundation, Rome, RO, Italy Background: Several studies have demonstrated that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) can develop brain atrophy (BA) within a time frame of six totwelve months. Recently, it has been reported that BA can progress even in ashorter time period of three months.Objectives: To demonstrate whether monthly brain atrophy changes can pre- dict physical disability changes in a short time period.Methods: We studied 30 patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS (median disease duration 4.9 years, median age 34.4 years and median EDSS 1.4).Patients were assessed at baseline and monthly for a period of three monthswith clinical, EDSS and MRI examinations. Calculations of T2-lesion performed. No immunomodulatory drug was administered six monthsbefore the study entry. Three patients were treated with intravenous methyl-prednisolone for a relapse during the study period. Results: EDSS remained stable during the study period (p= 0.980) and the patients experienced a mean rate of 0.3 (SD 0.5) exacerbations. Mean andmedian BPF did not change significantly at any timepoint of the study, althoughBPF slightly decreased from baseline scan to scan 3 0.111). Meanand significantly differentat any timepoint of the study. Longitudinally, a correlation between changes inT2-LL and T1-LL was not correlate cross-sectionally and with any MRI measure. Changes in BPF were notcorrelated with changes in physical disability at any timepoint of the study.Conclusions: We did not observe significant brain atrophy progression in our group of patients during a three months period. We failed to demonstrate anyPosters S100 Multiple Sclerosiscorrelation between disability and brain atrophy changes in a short-time period. Probably, a larger cohort of patients and a longer period of observation areneeded to demonstrate the relationship between brain atrophy development andaccumulation of physical disability in RR-MS.

A SHORT-TERM OBSERVATION Italy;bDepartment of Neurological Sciences, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy;cEuropean Biomedical Foundation, Rome, Italy Background: Several conventional and non-conventional MRI measures have been used to monitor disease activity in phase II and III clinical trials of patientswith multiple sclerosis (MS). Gd-enhancement is a good predictor of the occurrenceof relapses, but not a strong predictor of the development of cumulative impairmentor disability, indicating that different pathogenetic mechanisms are operative in theoccurrence of relapses and in the development of long-term disability in MS.Objectives: To investigate which MRI measure change is the best predictor of physical disability accumulation in a short time period.Methods: Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS (median disease dura- tion 4.9 years, median age 34.4 years and median EDSS 1.4) were included in thestudy. Patients were assessed at baseline and monthly for a period of three monthswith clinical, EDSS and MRI examination. The following monthly changes ofMRI measures have been calculated: number of (BPF). No immunomodulatory drug wasadministered six months before the study entry. Three patients were treated withintravenous methylprednisolone for a relapse during the study period.Results: The only MRI measure that significantly increased from baseline scan to scan 3 was the number of FLAIR lesions (+ 4.7%, p= 0.04). In stepwise mul-tiple regression analysis, EDSS changes during the three months period werepredicted only by the changes in number of T1 Gd-enhancing (R= 0.30,p= 0.032), only bythe changes in T1 Gd enhancing-LL (R = 0.54, p= 0.0008).Conclusions: Although different quantitative non-conventional MRI measures have been recently proposed to monitor disease activity in phase II and III ofclinical trials, Gd-enhancement remains the best monitoring tool for determin-ing short-term disease activity changes.

Immunology (Part 2) P255 NEW CANDIDATES IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IDENTIFY BY AN ANALYSIS OF IGG REPERTOIRE COUPLED WITH A PROTEOMIC APPROACH France Background: of the myelin-associated antigen (Ag) targets defin- itively discriminates the immune response observed in MS patients and inhealthy subjects. However, it has recently been shown that the analysis of global immune Ab profiles can distinguish between normal individuals andpatients suffering from various immune diseases. Objectives: To compare the global autoantibody response to central nervous system (CNS) Ags in sera from 82 MS patients and 27 healthy subjects, and toprocess to define these antigenic targets. Methods: The analysis of the immune profiles was performed by Western blot- ting. Data were submitted to linear discriminant analysis, and a proteomicapproach was realized to characterize the relevant antigens. Results: Our analysis could discriminate IgG antibody responses towards CNS Ags between healthy subjects and MS patients (sensitivity: 96.3%; specificity: 95.1%). Moreover, this approach separated the three clinical forms of MS with a high concordance rate with the clinical data (Kappa value = 77.8%). Seven-teen auto-antigens were pointed out for the discrimination of profiles betweenhealthy subjects and MS patients and 26 Ags were exhibited for separation ofthe three clinical forms of MS. A proteomic approach allowed us to identifysome of these auto-antigens. Conclusions: Our study suggests, that the serum Ab repertoires discriminate between MS and normal subjects and model the pathological processes associ-ated with the various forms of MS. The antigen identification related to thisspecific immuno-pathological recognition could be used to develop a biologi-cal diagnostic test for MS.

P256 IMMUNOPATHOGENIC AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF ANTIBODIESAGAINST MOG IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Berger T, Egg R, Rubner P, Hochfilzer A, Lutterotti A, Schanda Innsbruck Background: Recently, 4 different neuropathological subtypes were defined in MS, one among them characterized by antibody mediated demyelination.A potential target antigen for autoreactive antibodies might be the CNS spe-cific MOG.Objectives: Recently we demonstrated that in 130 MS patients a sub- group mounted a persistent autoantibody response to the extracellular Ig-domain of MOG in CSF and serum. We were further interested whetherthese antibodies exert biological features commonly seen in other autoim-mune diseases. If f these antibodies are pathogenic, we anticipated that weshould demonstrate clinical effects regarding disease activity and treat-ment influences.Methods: 261 MS patients were analysed for immunogloblin subclasses of anti-MOG and anti-MBP antibodies. In another study 95 MS patients weremeasured for their antibody ability to fix and activate complement. Patientssuggestive of MS were investigated for the prognostic value of initiallydetected anti-MOG antibodies regarding development of a second relapse andregarding the effects of early treatment. Finally, selected patients with highantibody titres were treated by plasma exchange and followed longitudinally. Results: Analysis of anti-MOG antibody subclasses revealed anti-MOG IgM antibodies as dominant. IgG analysis exhibited a predominance of anti-MOG IgG1 corresponding to the prevailing IgG isotypes in otherautoimmune diseases. In addition, we found that anti-MOG positive MS seraable to fix complement correlate with anti-MOG IgM titers and that some anti-MOG positive MS sera effectively activate the terminal complement pathway.Clinical relevance is suggested by a) the prognostic value of anti-MOG anti-bodies in patients suffering from a first demyelinating event and b) successfultreatment with plasmaexchange in selected MS patients suggestive of anti-body-mediated demyelination. Conclusions: Our studies may contribute for an immunopathogenic subtyping of MS and thus stratifying MS patients within a differentialtherapeutic conceptin the future.

P257 DECRYPTING THE SPECIFICITY OF THE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS BY PROTEIN ARRAYTECHNOLOGY Cepok S, Stei S, Sommer N, Hemmer B Department of Neurology, University of Marburg, Marburg, Hesse, Germany Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyeli- nating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with an as yet unknown aeti-ology. Studies on immune cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and CNSlesions of MS patients have demonstrated oligoclonal expansion of B cells andhypermutations of the B-cell receptor genes compatible with extensive antigenmaturation. Similarly, oligoclonal intrathecal immunogloblin G (IgG) synthesisis observed in most MS patients. Both findings are consistent with an ongoinghumoral immune response in the CNS of MS patients to as yet unknown targetantigens.Objectives: To investigate the antigen specificity of the local humoral anti- body response in MS patients.Methods: We applied a novel protein array technology. The arrays, compris- ing 35,000 inserts from a human foetal brain library, were probed with CSFand serum of 15 MS patients and 5 controls. Proteins with high immunreactiv-ity in CSF of MS patients were used for further ELISA and immunoblotanalyses.Results: Immune responses to 25 proteins were identified in MS patients, which were not observed in controls. Further analyses disclose.d a higher reac- tivity in the CSF of MS patients than controls for some of the possible target antigens. Interestingly, different patterns of immune reactivity were observedamong individual MS patients, suggesting heterogeneity in the intrathecalimmune response.Conclusions: The protein array technology provide a new tool to decrypt the antigen specificity of the intrathecal immune response in MS patients. Theidentified candidate antigens will be ivestigated for specificity of oligoclonalbands and for encephalitogenicity in experimental animal models to supportthe role of these antigens in the pathogenesis of MS.

P258 PREVALENCE OF HERPESVIRUS DNA IN MS PATIENTS Daskalovska VA, Daskalovski ZV, Petkova-Boskovska T Multiple Sclerosis, Clinic of Neurology, Skopje, Macedonia Background: MS is probably virus induced disease. Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the DNA prevalence of different members of Herpesviridae in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients andto describe the possible effect of beta-interferon treatment on such preva-lence.Methods: With a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay we have stud- ied the DNA of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 64 wholeblood samples, [34 from patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), ofwhich 28 were treated with beta-interferon]. Results: We only found a statistically significant difference for human her- pesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) DNA prevalence (P < 0.0001): HHV-6 is 1.18 timesmore frequent in MS patients. There was no difference in the HHV-6 preva-lence between beta-interferon treated and untreated patients.Conclusions: 1. Among the herpesviruses, HHV-6 was the only one show- ing altered prevalence. This either indicates that HHV-6 is involved in the pathogenesis of MS. 2. Treatment with beta-interferon does not make a dif-ference on the DNA prevalence of the herpesviruses studied in our MSpatients.

Sex hormones have proved trophic/repair actions and are capable ofcytokine synthesis modulation. Objectives: To assess whether serum sex hormones at and after MS relapse correlate with a specific Th1/Th2 cytokine pattern. Methods: To overcome the oscillations in sex hormones during menstrual cycle, we studied 7 men (mean age, 32.3 years) with relapsing-remitting MS, and 7 age-matched healthy men controls. No patient had taken immunosuppressive nor hor-monal drugs at least 3-mo prior to the study. Serum cortisol, testosterone, estradiol(E2), TNF-a and IL-10 by at MS relapse and 2-mo later in parallel.Results: All hormones measured and IL-10 were significantly higher in the MS group than in controls at relapse (cortisol p<.001, P p<.005, E2 p<.005 andtestosterone all of them but progesterone at 2-molater. P levels were systematically increased over the reference range for males (0.1 to 0.3 ng/ml) in all 7 MS patients (mean, 1.8 \u00b10.4). Cortisol levels fell to 38% after relapse (p=0.04), and E2 from relapse to 2-mo follow-up correlation was observed among hormone levels and cytokines duringrelapse. A strong inverse correlation between P levels and P/E2 ratio and TNF-a/IL-10 ratio after relapse was noted (p<0.01, r=0.95, and p=0.02, r=0.82,respectively). Conclusions: We show an activation the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and gonadal axis during relapse not correlated to any cytokine pattern. In thefollow-up study, maintained higher levels of sex hormones than controlswere observed, and P and P/E2 ratio strongly correlated with a Th2 cytokinepattern, suggesting or/and an anti-inflammatory role. de Andr\u00e9s has nothing to disclose. P260 CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR EXPRESSION ON T CELLS IS RELATED TO NEW LESION DEVELOPMENT IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Eikelenboom MJa, Killestein aNeurology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands;bRadiology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands;cImmunology, CLB, Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands Background: In multiple sclerosis (MS) the expression of specific chemokines and their receptors is thought to play an important role in the mechanism bywhich antigen driven T cells can migrate to sites of inflammation, but as yetdata to support this concept are limited. Therefore studies of chemokineexpression in well documented patient groups are important to obtain furtherinsight in its role in MS.Objectives: To investigate the expression of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 on T cells in patients with different sub forms of MS and to correlatethis expression to changes in lesion load on MRI.Methods: In 124 MS patients, the expression of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was measured by flowcytometry andcorrelated to clinical characteristics. In a subpopulation of 69 patients that wasPosters S102 Multiple Sclerosisfollowed longitudinally for about 3 years this expression was correlated to annualised changes in positive lymphocytes is increased in patients with progressive disease compared to patients with relapsing remitting(RR) MS. The annualised change in T2 p<0.01), cells patients. No lesion and thechemokine CD4 positive and CD8 positive lymphocytes has significant impact on annualised increase in T2 lesion load inMS, but no impact on T1 lesion load. Our observations suggest that interaction ofspecific chemokines and their receptors, probably by regulating the trafficking ofinflammatory cells into the CNS, is one of the crucial mechanisms involved in new lesion development in MS, reflecting demyelination, gliosis and inflammation.

Allergology and Clinical Immunology, University of Messina, Messina, side effects after Interferon- (IFN- ) adminis- tration in the site of injection are quite common in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Up to now, an urticarial IgE-mediated reaction to Interferon- -1b has been reported in a MS patient with multiple drugs allergies and asthma while no urticarial reaction to IFN- -1a has been described. Objectives: Case report: a 30 years old woman affected by Relapsing Remit- ting MS had received IFN- -1a, 6.000.000 UI i.m. once a week for 13 months and then withdrew treatment because of pregnancy. About one and half year later the same therapy was re-started. Thirty minutes after the second adminis- tration of IFN- -1a the patient exhibited severe widespread and pruri- that ameliorated after corticosteroids and antihistamines. IFN- -1a was discontinuated. The patient was not atopic and she didn't take any other drug.Methods: The patient risulted negative to tests for inhalant and food allergens. Total IgE levels were within normal ranges, routine laboratory investigations,autoantibodies and serum complements levels were also normal. Skin prick testand intradermal test were performed (istamine as positive control, physiologic saline as negative control) and, after giving informed consent, IFN- -1a and its diluent were tested. Results: The diluent was negative but the IFN- -1a resulted positive at 1: 100 I.D. dilution. The patient underwent, successively, a challenge test to Glati- ramer acetate as alternative drug with negative resultes and therefore startedsuch therapy. She has been undergoing this treatment for nine months withoutdeveloping, up to now, any adverse drug reaction.Conclusions: We suppose that in our not atopic patient it has been an IgE- mediated reaction to IFN- -1a administration with urticaria as clinical manifes- tation.

Higher levels of serum 2-MG have been reported in malignant, infectious, and autoimmune disorders; however, data regarding the value of 2- MG as a biologic marker of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have been inconsistent. Objectives: To evaluate the role of 2-MG as a biological marker of disease activity in MS. Methods: We studied 30 MS patients (male/female: 10/20, mean+/-SD for four consecutive months. Samples'sera were concomi- tantly collected for the evaluation of 2-MG, by the means of an enzyme- linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Results: Out of the 30 patients, three (10%) experienced a clinical relapse and were treated with steroids. A mean monthly number of 1.2+/-0.9 Gadoliniumenhancing lesions was detected, for total of 39.2% of active scans. A mean monthly value of 1.4+/-0.08 mcg/ml of 2-MG was found in the sera of these MS patients. Such a value was within the range already reported in the healthy subjects (<2 mcg/ml) and did not change over time, regardless the Gd-diseaseactivity. Conclusions: Besides its role as inflammatory marker in several disease, 2- MG cannot be considered a specific marker of disease activity in MS. Disclosure: L Finamore has nothing to disclose. P263 LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF SPONTANEOUS AND INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN LYMPHOCYTES OF PATIENTS WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING ANDSECONDARY-PROGRESSIVE MS Background: Dysregulation of apoptosis has been reported in MS lesions and in peripheral blood lymphocytes of MS patients. It has been hypothesized thatone of the mechanisms by which IFN-1b could exert its effect in MS is by mod-ifying the apoptotic rate of lymphocyte subpopulations. Objectives: To quantify spontaneous and mitogen-induced apoptosis in patients prior and after interferon beta 1b (IFN-1b) therapyMethods: Blood samples of 37 out of a 48 patient cohort were analyzed in a central laboratory at baseline and after 1 and 6 months of IFN-1b treatment.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified and characterized usingmonoclonal and the FACScalibur analyzer. Apoptotic index (theproportion antigens, and for B-cells expressing CD19 and CD5antigens. The AI was determined after 24 hour culture under two conditions:spontaneously, and after phytohemagglutinin induction. A variance analysisand the Scheffe multiple comparison test were applied to show statistically sig-nificant differences.Results: There was a significant reduction (p<0,01) after 6 months of treatment in the spontaneous apoptosis of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+,CD4+CD45RO+ and CD8+ . These differences were already significant after 1month of therapy in the CD3+CD4+, and CD4+CD45RA+ subsets (p<0.01).Induced apoptosis was also significantly reduced after 1 and 6 months of ther-apy in the CD3+CD4+, CD4+CD45RA+, CD8+CD45RA+, CD8+CD45RO+Multiple SclerosisPosters CD3+CD8+ and CD45RO+ sub- sets. reduced inthe CD19+CD5+ subset after 6 months of treatment.Conclusions: These data show that after 6 months of therapy, IFN beta-1b exerts a profound reduction of both spontaneous and mitogen-induced apoptosis in severalspecific T-cell subpopulations, already evident at one month for some subsets.With regard to B cells, we only found a reduction of induced apoptosis at 6 months.

P264 Dysregulation of lymphocyte apoptosis has been reported in MS, but there are no studies regarding the incidence of apoptosis in specificlymphocyte subpopulations of these patients. The currently used apoptoticindex (AI) measures the presence of apoptosis in a phenotypically defined cellpopulation.Objectives: To quantify spontaneous and induced apoptosis in lymphocytes of MS patients with regard to a control population of healthy individualsMethods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 46 interferon-naive patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS and 6 healthycontrols were purified and characterized in a FACscalibur analyzer using mon-oclonal antibodies. The AI was calculated for expressing CD3, and CD45RO/RA antigens and for B-cells expressing CD19/CD5 anti-gens. These AI were determined after 24 hour culture. All studies were per-formed in two different conditions: spontaneously, and after phytohemagglu-tinin induction. Comparisons between MS patients and healthy controls werecarried out using the non parametric Wilcoxon test. Results: A significant increase in spontaneous ex vivo apoptosis was found in peripheral blood lymphocytes from MS patients (p<0.05). This increaseoccurred in T lymphocytes (p<0.05) but not in B lymphocytes, wasobserved in the CD4+ subpopulation for the CD4+CD45RO+subset well subpopulation for the CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ subsets(p<0.05). Similar increases apoptosis in the CD19+/CD5+ subset (p<0.01)Conclusions: We have found an impressive increase of apoptosis in sponta- neous and mitogen induced apoptosis subpopulations ofMS patients. For cells, was increased only after mitogen induction. Disclosure: A Garcia-Merino has nothing to disclose. Funding: Supported by Schering Espana, SA. P265 INTERFERON BETA-1A REGULATES G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTORSIN MONONUCLEAR CELLS FROM HEALTHY DONORS AND MULTIPLESCLEROSIS PATIENTS. Giorelli M, Livrea P, Defazio G, Ricchiuti F, Mola A, Di Monte E, Trojano M Dept. of Neurologic and Psychiatric Sciences, University of Bari, Bari, Italy Background: Beta-adrenergic and chemokines systems play a relevant part in the modulation of immune responses in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Both beta-adrenergic and chemokines receptors belong to the large family of the G pro-tein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are regulated by G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), -arrestins, and regulators of G protein signaling(RGS). Lymphocytes activation modify responses to GPCRs agonists through regulation of the expression of GRKs, -arrestins and RGS. Interferon beta is known to counteract effects of mitogens on limphocytes in vitro and in vivo in MS patients. Objectives: To verify whether interferon beta-1a can regulate the activity of GPCRs through the tuning of GRKs, -arrestins and RGS in mononuclear cells (MNL). Methods: MNL from healthy donors were stimulated in vitro up to 72 h with none, phitoemmaglutinin (PHA) 5 \u00b5g/ml, interferon beta-1a (Rebif) 1500 U/ml, or both. Differently, freshly ex-vivo isolated (0,3,6 months) MNL were used for all studies on Multiple Sclerosis patients (10) who underwent to interferon beta-1a (Rebif 22 \u00b5g/3 times a week) treatment. Expression of GRKs and -arrestins was assessed either by Western Blot- ting and semi-quantitavive RT-PCR. Receptor activity was tested by meas- uring cAMP accumulation upon cells exposure to the -adrenergic agonist isproterenol. Results: In in-vitro experiments on donors, PHA-induced activation downregulated (10 folds) -adrenergic receptors through the over- expression of GRK 2 (4 folds), GRK 3 (5 folds), and RGS 16 (12 folds) and the down-regulation (6 folds) of -arrestin 1. Interferon beta-1a ( 1500 U/ml) counteracted all the mitogen-induced modifications. In Multiple Sclerosis patients, GRK2 levels increased (2 folds) at the third month, whereas turned tobasal levels at the sixt month of interferon beta-1a treatment. No modifications were found analysing GRK3 and -arrestin 1. Conclusions: Beta-adrenergic, chemokines, PAF and substance P receptors are GPCRs involved in the control of MNL functions. Modulation of signallingthrough GPCRs suggests a novel antinflammatory property of Interferon betatherapy in MS patients. Disclosure: M Giorelli has nothing to disclose. Funding: Ca, Sondermann Ja, Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany;bMedical Psychology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Background: Increasing evidence supports the notion of autonomic dysfunc- tion in multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, an increased density of beta-adrener-gic receptors (beta-AR) has been demonstrated in MS. Beta-receptor agonistswere found to have therapeutic effects in EAE.Objectives: To investigate the effects of oral terbutaline administration on inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in MS patients and healthy con-trols. Associations of cytokine response with measures of disease activity anddisability were examined. Methods: Terbutaline (5mg) was administered orally to 10 healthy controls and 48 MS patients classified according to disease course and disability. Blood sam-ples were taken before and 2 hours after administration. PHA-stimulatedcytokine production (IL-10, IFNg, TNFalpha, IL-12) was analyzed in wholeblood culture.Results: While all subjects showed increases in heart rate and blood pressure, no significant difference was observed between patients and controls. IL-10 and IL-12 were significantly induced in controls but not in MS patients (p=0.03and p=.001 respectively). These differences were seen in patients with or with-out ongoing immunomodulatory therapy. Furthermore, we found some indica-tion that the reported neuroimmunological dysregulation in MS may be associ-ated with the extent of handicap and disability.Conclusions: We conclude that a single dose terbutaline administration induces TH-2 (IL-10) as well as TH-1 (IL-12) cytokine production in healthycontrols but not in MS patients. Our findings might reflect a disturbed auto-nomic control of the immune system in MS. Disclosure: S Gold has nothing to disclose.

The microbes Acinetobacterand Pseudomonas have been shown to carry amino acid sequence similaritiesto brain components, inlcuding myelin basic protein. Antibodies to both Acine-tobacter and Pseudomonas (Hughes et al. 1181)and specific peptide mimicry bacteria (Wilson et al. Pro-ceedings of Acinetobacter 2000; abstract 1: 1) have been previously demon-strated in multiple sclerosis patients.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine cross-reactivity between bacterial peptides and brain antigens.Methods: analysed using ELISA.Results: Peptide antiserum raised against myelin basic protein was inhibited by preincubation with 100ug/ml of both the Acinetobacter andPseudomonas peptides. Prior to incubation, antisera to myelin basic proteinhad a mean antibody binding activity of 0.752+/-0.005 at a dilution of 1: 25and reacted at a dilution of up to 1: 6400. After incubation with Acinetobac-ter and Pseudomonas peptides the binding activity was reduced to 0.38+/-0.005 and 0.34+/-0.012 respectively at a dilution of 1: 25 and reacted atdilutions up to 1: 800. Pre-incubation with an irrelevant peptide did notaffect binding activity.Conclusions: The results obtained demonstrate cross reactivity between simi- lar amino acid sequences in Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and myein basic pro-tein. Further work needs to be carried out in order to assess the role, if any, ofantibodies to these peptide sequences in the aetio-pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

P268 THE PLASMA LEVELS OF ALPHA-2-MACROGLOBULIN AND THETRANSFORMED FORM ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEENPATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND CONTROLS Jensen PH, Datta P, Jorgensen S, Oturai AB, Sorensen PS MS protease inhibitor and cytokine-binding protein in the human body fluids. Its involvement in the immune system may be of importance for the regulation of immuneresponses.Objectives: Determinations of the concentrations of a2M and the transformed form were performed in plasma samples from MS-patients and controls for theanalysis of a possible increased protease activity and an possible a2M-depend-ent regulation of the immune system.Methods: Measurements of a2M and the transformed form in plasma samples from 60 MS-patients and 132 control individuals were performed by use of sin-gle radial immunodiffusion, and by ELISA using an a2M transformation spe-cific monoclonal antibody.Results: Measurements of the a2M concentration in plasma from MS-patients and controls demonstrated a significantly lower concentration in the patients.When the concentration of the transformed a2M was measured, there was a sig-nificant difference between the MS-patients and controls, but in this case theconcentrations were highest in the patients. The significant difference betweenthe patients and controls was still valid, when the fractions of transformed a2M to total a2M was compared.Conclusions: The significant differences in the a2M concentrations may sug- gest that a2M is of importance for the regulation of proteases and cytokines inthe immune system in MS-patients.

P269 LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT GLYCOCONJUGATES IN BRAIN HAVEIMMUNOREGULATORY ACTIVITY Lindsey JWa, Waxham MNb, Stephens Weiser Sa aNeurology, University of Texas-Houston, Houston, Texas, USA;bNeurobiology and Anatomy, University of Texas-Houston, Houston, Texas, USA Background: Our hypothesis is that normal brain tissue contains immunoreg- ulatory signals which prevent autoimmune damage. A defect in the presenta-tion or recognition of these signals could contribute to the pathogenesis of mul-tiple sclerosis. In previous work we demonstrated that homogenized braintissue has profound immunoregulatory activity in culture. The activity was inthe insoluble fraction and became soluble with NaOH treatment. Objectives: Our objective was to further characterize the immunosuppressive activity found in brain tissue.Methods: Brain tissue from naive mice was homogenized, solubilized using NaOH or detergent, and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography. Frac-tions were tested for activity in suppressing antigen driven proliferation oflymph node cells in culture. Fractions were visualized on polyacrylamide gelsstained with Coomassie to demonstrate proteins to demonstrate gly-coconjugates. Results: After solubilization with NaOH and separation on a gel filtration column, maximum activity was in a high molecular weight fraction containing many differ-ent proteins and low molecular weight material which contained glycoconjugates.These components were presumably part of a macromolecular complex. When thisactive fraction was treated with the detergent CHAPS and refractionated on the gelfiltration column, activity was in fractions containing few proteins and the major-ity of the glycoconjugates. Alternative methods of solubilization were tried, andactivity always correlated closely with the presence of glycoconjugates. Thin layerchromatography demonstrated that these glycoconjugates contained glycolipids.Conclusions: A low molecular weight glycoconjugate appears to be a major immunoregulatory component of normal brain tissue. These may be either glycol-ipids or small glycopeptides. Further work is needed to identify the active mole-cule and determine the relevance of these findings for immune regulation in vivo.

Results: In controls mean sAPO-1 level was 22.51 pg/ml. During the relapse mean sAPO-1 level was 23.43 pg/ml and after steroid treatment mean level ele-vated to 32.66 pg/ml. No differences were detected in mean serum sAPO-1 lev-Multiple SclerosisPosters S105 els between multiple sclerosis patients and controls, however high sAPO-1 level was stated in the serum of MS patients after steroid treatment as com-pared to sAPO-1 level before treatment and the difference was statistically sig-nificant ( p = 0.004 ).Conclusions: Results of this preliminary study suggests that resistance of peripheral blood lymphocytes to apoptosis mediated by sAPO-1 is not likely tobe a major factor in the development of autoreactive cells in MS, but increasedsAPO-1 level after the use of steroids may protect the cells against apoptosis.

P271 UPREGULATED SURVIVIN EXPRESSION IN ACTIVATED T LYMPHOCYTES CORRELATES WITH DISEASE ACTIVITY IN MULTIPLESCLEROSIS Noori M, Sharief MK Dept of Neuroimmunology, GKT School of Medicine, Guys Hospital, London, United Kingdom Background: Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is critical for the normal development and homeostasis of the immune system. There is emerging evi-dence that failure of apoptosis to eliminate potentially pathogenic, autoreactiveT lymphocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. This failure isrelated to multiple abnormalities of apoptosis-regulatory molecules that involvesurvivin, a recently described cell cycle-regulated anti-apoptosis protein.Objectives: To investigate the relationship between survivin expression in peripheral T lymphocytes and clinical features of MS. Methods: Using combined dot-blot immunoassays and Western blotting, we analyzed the expression of survivin and other apoptosis regulatory proteins inmitogen stimulated T lymphocytes from patients with MS and relevant controls.Results: We detected a significant over-expression of survivin in mitogen stimulated T lymphocytes from patients with active MS when comparedto corresponding expression in patients with stable MS or those withinflammatory and non-inflammatory neurologic disorders. This overex-pression of survivin in patients with active MS correlated with cellularresistance to apoptosis and with features of disease activity, such as dis-ease duration and the number of enhanced lesions on cranial magnetic res-onance imaging. There was no correlation between cellular survivin levels and the expression of other apoptosis-inhibitory proteins, such as Bcl-2 and FLIP.Conclusions: Findings presented here indicate that cellular overexpression of the novel anti-apoptosis protein survivin is a feature of clinically active multi-ple sclerosis. Disclosure: Sharief P272 DYSREGULATION OF PROGAMMED CELL DEATH ACTIVATION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS saresella m, clerici m, trabattoni d, speciale l, piacentini p fondazione don c. dongnocchi, milano, Italy Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disease charac- terized by multifocal inflammation and damage involving the myelin sheath.An immunopathologic mechanism, mainly mediated by the activation of cellmediated immunity (CMI) and secondary to molecular mimicry with cross-reacting and yet undefined epitopes, is linked to destruction of the myelinsheath. Apoptosis of autoreactive T lymphocytes is hypothesized to be a majormechanism of tolerance, and in particular, programmed cell death (PCD) ofantigen-specific immune cells in MS could modulate immune-mediateddestruction of the myelin sheath. Objectives: In this study we analyzed markers of susceptibility to PCD in 28 MS patients with either acute (AMS; N= 14) or stable (SMS; N=14) disease,and in 6 other patients undergoing IFN&#61538; therapy. Methods: Thus, we performed cytofluorimetric analysis of AAD-permeability and we evaluated the percentages of FAS and bcl-2 expressing CD4+, CD8+,and CD14+ cells. PBMC (5x105/ml) were cultured for 24 h in the presence of: a) medium alone; b) and CD14+ cells (apoptotic is signifi-cantly augmented in SMS compared to treated patients; and 2) the percentageof PMA+IONO-stimulated AAD-permeable and Fas-expressing CD8+ andCD4+ cells is significantly increased in AMS and SMS compared toIFN&#61538; treated MS patients. Conclusions: These observations suggest that PCD of myelin-specific lym- phocytes could reduce immune-mediated destruction of the myelin sheath inSMS patients, and that augmented PCD could be one of the beneficial mecha-nisms associated with IFN therapy.

P273 THE EXPRESSION OF CD5 ON PERIPHERAL B LYMPHOCYTES CORRELATES WITH DISEASE ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLESCLEROSIS Seidi OA, Sharief MK Dept of Neuroimmunology, GKT School of Medicine, Guys Hospital, London, United Kingdom Background: Although activated T lymphocytes play a key role in the patho- genesis of MS, there is growing evidence that implicates B lymphocytes andtheir products in this disease. A subpopulation of B lymphocytes expressing theCD5 antigen are involved in several autoimmune disorders through the releaseof autoantibodies. Objectives: To examine the relationship between CD5 expression on periph- eral B cells and MS disease activity.Methods: In this study, we used three-color flow cytometry to examine the expression of CD5 antigen on B lymphocytes from patients with relapsingremitting MS, and correlated this expression with features of disease activityand circulating levels of autoantibodies against myelin basic protein.Results: CD5 expression on B lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with active MS when compared to patients with clinically stable MSor those with inflammatory or non-inflammatory neurologic disorders. CD5+B lymphocytes from patients with active MS correlated significantly with thenumber of gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions, and inversely with diseaseduration. The expression of CD5 on B lymphocytes in MS patients also corre- lated with circulating levels antibodies against myelin basic protein.

Both endogenous production and treatment with GC may suppress inflammatory activity in the central nervous system. In earlier studies increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity leading to higher endogenouscortisol levels has been described in MS patients probably secondary to inflamma-tion. This may lead to a decreased GC sensitivity and an increase in disease activity.Objectives: To study the GC sensitivity in patients with MS in comparison to healthy subjects and to evaluate differences between subgroups of MS patients.Methods: GC sensitivity was determined by an in vitro dexamethasone (DEX) suppression of LPS stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) productionand expressed as IC 50. Blood samples from 130 MS patients and 49 healthycontrols (HC) were collected between 9-11: 30 am in endotoxin free,Posters S106 Multiple Sclerosisheparinized tubes. Blood was diluted 1: 1 in RPMI-1640 containing 1% L-glu- tamate and subsequently stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml final concentration)for four hours with different concentrations DEX 10-9M, 10-8M,10-7M, 10-6M, 10-5,5M aconcentration enzyme linked immunoabsorbent (Biosource). A sigmoidal curve-fitting equation was used to calculatethe IC 50. IC 50 is determined as the concentration DEX causing 50% of themaximal inhibitory effect. Results: Preliminary analyses show that relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients as well as secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients had signifi-cantly lower IC 50 values compared to HC and primary progressive MS(PPMS) patients. Additional analyses evaluating potential confounding factorsare ongoing. Secondary, data collected to investigate whether in vitro GC sen-sitivity can predict clinical outcome of methylprednisolone treatment is still tobe analyzed. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that relapse-onset MS patients are less sensitive to GC than PPMS and HC. This may be related to the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease in these patients. Disclosure: L Winsen has nothing to disclose.

Morra Mb, Coppola Ga, Orefice Ga Federico II University, Naples, Italy;bDept. of Radiology -CNR, Federico II University, Naples, Italy Background: Cognitive dysfunctions have already been reported in MS. Prevalence may vary between 30 and 70%. Previous reports showed correla-tions between neuropsychological and MRI data. Brain atrophy has been demonstrated in MS, mainly involving the White Matter (WM). Non conven-tional and automated segmentation MRI techniques have been produced inorder to quantify the extension of abnormal WM and the degree of brain atro-phy. Objectives: The aims of our study were (1) to evaluate the prevalence and the profile of cognitive impairment, (2) to quantify the lesion load and the brainatrophy and (3) to analyse possible correlations between cognitive and neurora-diological data in a group of RR-MS patients. Methods: A group of 48 RR-MS patients, with a mean age of 35.4 \u00b17.9 years (21-50) underwent to EDSS evaluation, conventional MRI with an automated unsupervised segmentation post-processing in order to quantify lesion load andabsolute and fractional WM, grey matter (GW) and CSF volumes, neuropsy-chological evaluation by means of Mini Mental State Evaluation, Story RecallTest, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Delayed Memory Test (from theWechsler Memory Scale), Standard Raven Progressive Matrices and Ideo-Motor Apraxia Test. Fifty-five normal subjects were the MRI control group.The statistical analysis was performed by Pearson Coefficient and Mann-Whit-ney U test.Results: We found at least one abnormal neuropsychological test in 29 patients (60.4%), in accordance to the literature. The mean lesion load was 23.0 \u00b125.5 ml. GM percentage was lower in MS than in controls (49% vs. 51%, p<0.01), despite of the older age of the control group. WM percentage was lower in MSthan in controls (36% vs. 38%, p<0.01). We found a significant inverse corre-lation between the lesion load and the GM volume (r= -0.37, p<0.01). Ideo-Motor Apraxia Test showed a slightly significant correlation with lower GMvolume (p=0.05). Conclusions: As a main and unexpected data, we found a significant reduction of GM volume, in accordance to the hypothesis of retrograde axonal degenera-tion in MS.Moreover, we confirmed the high prevalence of cognitive dysfunc-tion in MS. GM atrophy seems to correlate with some of the cognitive func-tions investigated. Disclosure: V Brescia Morra has nothing to disclose. P277 COGNITIVE PERFORMANCES ARE ALTERED IN EARLY MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Salort Deloire-Grassin Bordeaux, Bordeaux Cedex, France;bINSERM U 330, University Victor Segalen, Bordeaux, Aquitaine, France;cF\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Neurosciences Cliniques, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, Aquitaine, France Background: 40% to 60% of patients with established MS exhibited cognitive deficits. Very few studies describe cognitive functions at early stages of multi-ple sclerosis. Objectives: To determine the cognitive skills of MS patients at the time of the diagnosis.Methods: 69 MS patients (58 RRMS, 7 TPMS, and 4 PPMS) were recruited by the AQUISEP network less than six months after the time of diagnosis.After written informed consent, they underwent a comprehensive neuropsy-chological examination. Patients were individually matched with healthy con-trols, who undertook the same cognitive tasks. The neuropsychologicalassessment comprised Rao Brief Repeatable Battery (Selective RemindingTest (SRT), 10/36 Spatial Recall Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test(SDMT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), Word List Genera-tion Task), the Boston Naming test, the Ruff Figural Fluency test and theSimilarities WAIS-R subtest. battery including a reac-tion time test, Stroop tests and the negative priming test was also adminis-trated.Results: The RR patients performed significantly worse than the controls in SDMT (complex attention), SRT (verbal immediate and delayed recall mem-ory), 10/36 spatial recall test (spatial delayed recall memory), SimilaritiesWAIS-R subtest, Ruff test part 1 ( non verbal fluency), PASAT 2s (sustainedMultiple SclerosisPosters S107 attention). On the contrary, patients did not performed worse than controls in PASAT 3s. 18 patients (26,1%) scored &#61502; on PASAT2s. 15(21,7%), 13 (18,8%) and 13 (18,8%) scored > 2DS below the control mean onlong-term storage, consistent long term retrieval and delayed recall SRTrespectively. No patients scored below 2 DS on Ruff test. Other results as wellas correlations with other clinical data and quality of life scores will be pre-sented at the congress.Conclusions: Significant cognitive dysfunction is observed in multiple sclero- sis at the time of the diagnosis Disclosure: B Brochet has nothing to disclose.

Callegaro Da, Fuso Sc, Otaduy Cb, Bueno Oc aNeurology, Medical of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil;bRadiology, Medical School of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil;cPsychobiology, Medical School of S\u00e3o Paulo EPM, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Background: The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) represents an efficient tool for evaluating information processing speed in MS patients.However the literature on the correlation between PASAT performance and lesion burden on brain MRI has been contradictory. A recent study suggested that by using the Mean Dyad Score (MD) on the PASAT the correlationbetween the test and disease burden found on brain MRI could be improved.Objectives: To correlate a series of MRI findings in MS patients to the PASAT results using the MD score system. Methods: Eight MS patients, two male and six female, (mean age = 35 \u00b18 years, mean disease duration = 8 \u00b14 years, mean EDSS = 3.5 \u00b12.0 and years of education = 12 \u00b13) were chosen for the combined neuropsychological and MRI study. The PASAT was applied to all patients on the same day of the MRI exam. Performance on the PASAT was quantified using the MD score.The MRI exam, performed on a 1.5 T scanner, included acquisition of axialT2, T1, PD and diffusion weighted images. The total area of lesions on PDweighted images was quantified by two radiologists. Firstly a treshold wasapplied to the image and after manual selection of the lesions the correspon-ding area was calculated automatically by the software Scion (NIH, USA).Diffusion weighted images were post-processed on a workstation in order togenerate Aparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps and histograms. MeanADC, ADC peak position and peak height were calculated from the diffusionhistograms. Results: The mean MD score was 8.75 \u00b111.06 (range 0 to 31.75). The mean total area of lesions was 1706 \u00b11955 mm 2(range 142 to 5564 mm2). Mean ADC was 992 \u00b145 x 10-6mm2/s, mean ADC peak was 791 \u00b126 x 10-6mm2/s and mean ADC peak height was 44.9 \u00b17.4. The MD score presented a ten- dency to decrease with total lesion area, but this was statistically insignificant. The correlation between MD and ADC parameters was stronger but still statis-tically insignificant.Conclusions: No significant correlation was found between MD scores on the PASAT test and MRI parameters quantifying MS disease burden. A larger number of patients need to be studied in order to confirm these findings.

Effective screening tools are needed to identify patients who mightbenefit from treatments to enhance cognition. Objectives: To describe baseline characteristics of MS patients screened for mild cognitive dysfunction enrolled in a 6-month clinical trial of an acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI).Methods: 64 participants without major depression met the following cogni- tive screening criteria: scores at least 0.5 standard deviations (SD) below pub-lished age and gender based normative data on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learn-ing Test (RAVLT), and Mini Mental State Examination score > 25 (to excludeseverely impaired persons unable to comply with protocol). Subjects com-pleted a modified version of the Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB). Their per-formance was compared to published data from demographically similarhealthy persons as well as another large MS sample. Results: Mean age was 44.5 (SD=8.6), education 14.6 (SD=2.3), EDSS 3.7 (SD=1.8), and 69% (56%), and (2%). Approximately 90% on disease modifyingagents, and 55% were employed. Mean RAVLT performance was 1.6 SDbelow norms. Not surprisingly, the most impairment on a BRB task wason the Selective Reminding Test (SRT), another verbal learning/memorytask, with scores 2 SD below healthy controls (Boringa, 2001; Camp,1999) and 1.3 SD below a large RR MS sample (Weinstein, 1999). Perfor-mance on other BRB tasks ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 SD below healthynorms and from 0.3 to 0.7 SD below the other MS sample. More than 90%of the sample scored 1.5 SD or more below each healthy sample on atleast 1 of 4 BRB tests, and 67% compared to Weinstein's MS sample. 33subjects underwent baseline MR. Overall BRB scores correlated stronglywith central cerebral atrophy (r = -.70, p < .000) and the ratio of n-acety-laspartate over creatine (indicative of axonal injury and/or loss) (r = .64, p< .000).Conclusions: The screening criteria selected persons with substantial cognitive impairment. Self-selection may have contributed to the level of impairment,since participants had enough concern about their cognition to participate in a6-month clinical trial.

Few Authors have investigated if IFN treatment affects cognitive func-tions in MS. Objectives: To monitor cognitive functions in MS pts undergoing IFN-beta treatment for at least 2 yrs, and compare them with untreated subjects.Methods: 52 pts with definite MS were studied. Clinical data were: M/F: 20/32; median EDSS: education: 11,3 yrs (4-18). 27 pts received IFN-beta;25 did not assume any drug. Cognitive functions were assessed using DigitSymbol, Buschke-Fuld Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), VerbalFluency FAS Test and Kohs'cube Test, tested at baseline (TO) and 2 years laterPosters S108 Multiple Sclerosis(T1). The two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was applied to assess both time and treatment effects on cognitive parameters.Results: 15 subjects were excluded from the study because of protocol viola- tion. However, their performances were evaluated in order to allow intention-to-treat analysis. No differences were found between treated and controls atbaseline with respect to disease course prevalence, EDSS score or cognitivetest average performances. At T1, no changes were found in cognitive testscores of either treated or controls. In the IFN-beta group, average Digit Sym-bol score passed from 45 to 41, Buschke-Fuld score for short term recall from132 to 133, the Buschke-Fuld score for long term recall from 8 to 9, FAS scorefrom 29 to 31, Kohs'cube score from 31 to 32, WCST score from 4 to 4. Eventhe intention-to-treat analysis did not succeed in demonstrating any significantneuropsychological changes. Conclusions: Our findings seem to rule out any significant influence of IFN- beta on cognitive performances, in contrast to what suggested in a previoustrial reporting a beneficial effect of the treatment on verbal learning and on executive and visuospatial abilities. Such discrepancies could be attributed to different sample features, with respect to baseline EDSS score, disease courseand education. Disclosure: M Danni has nothing to disclose. P281 COGNITIVE IMPAIREMENT IN ACTIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS de seze J, Bouillaguet S, Dubois G, Cabaret M, Ferriby Nord, France Background: Cognitive deficits are frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS) with a prevalence between 43 to 60%. However, there is no data concerning activeMS, a particular subgroup of MS. Objectives: To evaluate the frequency of cognitive dysfunction in active MS compared to progressive forms of the disease and healthy control subjects.Methods: A battery of 23 tests assessing general cognitive efficiency, memory, planning abilities, visuo-spatial processing and executive function was adminis-tered to A battery of 23 tests assessing general cognitive efficiency, memory,planning abilities, visuo-spatial processing and executive function was adminis-tered to each participant. Nineteen patients with active MS, defined as an increaseof EDSS score higher than 1.5 during the last year in patients with relapsingremitting MS, participated in the study. Their performance was compared to thatof 41 patients with progressive MS (14 primary progressive and 27 secondaryprogressive) and 15 healthy control subjects. The subjects performance at eachtest was transformed as a z-score in order to operationalize their deviation fromthe control group. A score higher than 1.5 was considered as a significant decline.Results: We did not observe any difference of EDSS score between the 3 subgroups (mean EDSS=5.9 +/- 0.8). Disease duration was longer in the secondary progressive group. Age at onset was higher in the primary progressive MS group. After a mean disease duration of 6.5 years, all the patients of the active MS subgroup had a z-score higher than 1.5 in one subtest or more. The z-score was significantly impairedat 7 among the 23 tests mainly on visuo-spatial processing and executive functiontests. Although cognitive impairment was more important in secondary progressiveMS, active MS patients were not different compared with primary progressive MS.Conclusions: Cognitive deficits are frequent in active MS and involve visuo-spatial and executive dysfunction. It should be interesting to evaluate the effect of intensiveimmunosuppressive drugs (mitoxantrone) in this subgroup of MS patients. Disclosure: J de seze has nothing to disclose. P282 EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Pires-Barata S, I Neurology, Hospital Espirito Santo, EVORA, Portugal Background: Psychopathological disorders are described in the literature in MS patients. It is difficult to make a retrospective evaluation of the psy-chopathology of the patient, but an evaluation after the diagnosis can help find- ing a trait that might improve the psychological treatment and counselling ofthese patients.Objectives: We pretended to screen for possible psychological traits in patients with multiple sclerosis.Methods: We interviewed 6 patients with MS (3 women and 3 men), at least 6 months after the diagnosis. Age varies between 24 to 41 years. We used the SCL-90 scale as a screening to search for psychopathology signs.This scale is validated for our country population and evaluates emotionaladjustment items, such as somatization, obsessive/compulsive, interper-sonal relations, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoidideation, psychoticism, eating disorders, sleep disorders, thoughts ofdeath and guilty feelings. We performed a 30 minutes interview to eachpatient.Results: We observed after performing the scale that the most prevalent items were obsessive/compulsive behaviour and sleep disorders (independently ofeither it was on the awake, in falling a sleep or a restless sleep) that were pres-ent in all patients. Eating disorders (either eating too much or loss of appetite)were also present in 5 patients. Conclusions: These results suggested that the obsessive/compulsive behav- iours and sleep disorders are common in MS. Further research is needed to ver-ified the association between obsessive/compulsive and sleep disorders in MSpatients. Inclusion of a group control, enlarging the sample and using specificscales for the psychopathology disorders that we found, will reinforce this pre-liminary results. Disclosure: Nothing to disclose. P283 SUCCESSFUL ADULT DEVELOPMENT AS A FRAMEWORK FOR NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Lana-Peixoto Lima EP CIEM MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: The chronic and progressively incapacitating nature of MS, poses a major challenge to rehabilitative efforts. Approaches based solely onthe pursuit of functional restitution have a high risk of failure and additional dis-tress. Compensatory approaches have consistently shown effective in theempowerment of individuals both to cope with daily life in the short run and toplan their life courses in the long run, thus regaining control and autonomy aswell as improving their sense of well-being. Compensation requires the estab-lishment of a positive agenda.Objectives: To establish a parallel between the processes of cognitive impairment and psychosocial adaptation to MS and normal adult development and aging.Methods: A selective literature review, a conceptual analysis and a compari- son between the patterns of psychosocial adaptation and cognitive impairmentin MS and normal aging individuals were conducted. Results: In MS and normal aging individuals deficits are observed preferen- tially in the domains of mechanic intelligence, such as episodic memory andexecutive functions. In both situations most severely affected cognitive per-formance relates to efficient and speeded information processing. On the otherhand, cognitive functions related to the construct of pragmatic intelligence,such as verbal expression and comprehension, insight, social abilities andsocial cognition or wisdom, remain relatively preserved. Conclusions: Focusing on the profile of cognitive impairment and assets in the broader context of adult development may help health professionals to estab-lish an effective framework for neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS. Neu-ropsychological counseling in MS may benefit from incorporating a model of successful adult development which foresees the selection of domains in which there is a prospect for development, the optimization of investment andresources in the selected domains, as well as compensation for domains withdeclining performance.

MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is an out- come measure in MS which assesses cognitive function (PASAT) in addition tomotor function of the legs (T25) and arms/hands (9-HPT). The wasdesigned to achieve better and sounder psychometric foundationsthan traditional measures of disability. Objectives: To report initial efforts to develop a Brazilian version of the MSFC, herein named MSFC-BCTRIMS. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional correlation analysis of the MSFC comparing performance by 15 MS patients and 15 demographically matchedcontrols. The mean age of patients in the MS Group was 39.3 years (sd=10.4)and 38.6 (sd=11.8) in the Control Group. The mean formal schooling was 9.5years (sd=3,6) for MS individuals and 11.9 (sd=4.6) for control participants.Women comprised 60% of participants in the MS Group and 67% in the Con-trol Group. Patients had a mean disease duration of 8.21 years (sd=8.08), meanEDSS scores of 3.31 (sd=2.33) and mean Ambulatory Index (AI) scores of 2.08(sd=2.33). Eighty seven percent of MS participants had relapsing-remitting dis-ease. Z-scores were calculated using values from the international databaseemployed to build the MSFC.Results: A series of Mann-Whitney tests showed significant between-group differences both for the MSFC well as between MSFC and EDSS (0.801, not between the MSFC and the AI (rho=0.908, p<0.076). Significant corre-lations were also observed between the EDSS and all MSFC partial scores, butnot between these and the AI.Conclusions: Results of this pilot study suggest that the MSFC-BCTRIMS version is an appropriate disability measure for administration in Brazilian MSpatients. Further studies are required to validate this version for clinical andresearch use in Brazil. Disclosure: M Lana-Peixoto has nothing to disclose. P285 BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY AND GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE: RESULTS OF A COMPARISON BETWEEN MULTIPLESCLEROSIS PATIENTS AND CONTROLS EP CIEM MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: Major depression is highly prevalent in MS. Although many depression scales have been developed there is still a need for a reliable self-reported diagnostic measure. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) have been validated and are widely used in Brazil. BDI results in MS may reflect some somatic disease manifestations.Objectives: To compare performances of MS patients on the BDI and GHQ with that of a control group.Methods: MS sample consisted of 34 patients with mean age of 42.6 years (sd=9.1), and mean formal schooling of 11.1 years (sd=4.4). There were 26women and eight men. Twenty patients had relapsing-remitting MS, 9 second-ary progressive MS and 2 primary progressive MS. The mean disease durationwas 9.2 years (sd=5.0). Mean Ambulation Index (AI) scores were 2.5 (sd=2.0)and mean EDSS scores were 3.0 (sd=2.47). Controls included 24 individuals(16 women and 8 men) with mean age of 39 years (sd=11.6), and mean formalschooling of 12.6 years (sd=3.3). BDI and GHQ were applied individually. MSparticipants were also also evaluated by the Cognitive and Physical Fatigue Scales (CPFS) and the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSE).Results: Eight patients (23.53%) had BDI scores above 20 and death cognition scores above the 90th on the GHQ. Both BDI, GHQ and GHQ-subscales dis- criminated between the MS and Control groups (t between 2.038 and 2.895,p<0.046 to p<0.003). In the MS Group, correlations between BDI, GHQ and dis-ease markers (disease duration, AI and EDSS) were not significant. Intercorrela-tions between BDI, GHQ and GHQ-subscales all between and 0.597, to p<0.009). Croup, BDIand GHQ scores also correlated significantly with the MSSE and fatigue scores.Conclusions: BDI scores may be a useful tool to compare patients with MS and other neuropsychological disorders, but its scores may lack specificity todepression in MS. Alternatives may be either to factorially discriminate andconstruct subscales or to use other self-reported measures for depression. Disclosure: M Lana-Peixoto has nothing to disclose. P286 PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN MS: PSYCHOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS OF Lima EP CIEM MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: Assessment of psychosocial functioning in MS requires sound psychometric instruments. Self-reported measures are simple and practicalways to evaluate a number of functions but may be jeopardized by limitedschooling and other social and economical conditions of the population.Objectives: To investigate the psychometric properties of some self-reported measures of psychosocial functioning adapted for use in Brazil. Methods: Method: The sample comprised 34 MS patients with a mean age of 42.6 years (sd=9.06) and mean formal schooling of 11.06 years (sd=4.39).Females comprised 76.5% of the cases. Twenty patients had relapsing-remittingMS, 9 e secondary progressive MS and 2 primary progressive MS. The meanduration of the disease was 9.18 years (sd=5.0); the mean AI scores 2.47(sd=2.00) and the mean EDSS score 3.00 (sd=2.47). Measures assessed includedGeneral Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),which had been previously validated for the general Brazilian population. Spe-cific MS self-report measures used were the Cognitive and Physical FatigueScales (CPFS) and the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSE), whichhave been specifically translated and adapted for the present investigation.Results: Estimated Cronbach Alpha values were 0.8612 for MSSE, overall fatigue, 0.8634 for cognitive fatigue, and 0.8946for physical fatigue. Disease duration did not correlate with any self-reportmeasure. Function Both GHQ and BDI scores correlated moderatelyand significantly with all fatigue and self-efficacy scores (r between 0.406 and0.616, p between p<0.001 and p<0.02).Conclusions: The assessed self-reported instruments presently in use in Brazil- ian MS patients exhibit reliable psychometric characteristics and can beemployed confidently.

P287 PSYCHOSIS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Niedermayerov\u00e1 Ia, Bene\u00f6ov\u00e1 Ya, Mechl Mb aDepartment of Neurology, Brno, Republic;bDepartment of Radiology, University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic Background: The presence of psychiatric symptoms as a part of the picture of multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been recognized. The commonest symptom isPosters S110 Multiple Sclerosisdepressive mood state but psychotic disorders occur far less frequently. Some authors believe that although psychotic disturbances which take form of majordepression or acute psychosis onset in many cases a number years beforeapperance of MS, they directly attributable to the organic disease.Objectives: To find a frequency of psychosis in a group of MS patients and to evaluate location and size of brain lesions detected by MRI to recognize a rela-tion between MS and psychotic disorders.Methods: We analyzed retrospectively all the MS patients of our center (595 persons) and found those with psychosis before or after onset of neurologicalsymptoms of MS. We excluded iatrogenic psychosis for example due to corti-costeroids. The group of MS patients with psychosis and control MS groupformed with respect to age, sex, disability and duration of MS, underwent MRIof the brain. We evaluated areas of leasions on T2-weighted scans in frontaland temporal lobe and in corpus callosum.Results: We found 7 patients with psychosis (3 schizoaffective, 2 paranoid and 1 maniodepressive psychosis and 1 paraphrenia) in 5 cases was onset before neurological symptoms (3-11 years) and in 2 cases during neurological illnes (1 resp. 5 years). The mean age of onset was 33 years (range 18-52). The preva-lence of psychosis in MS patients was slightly higher than in common popula-tion (1,17% versus 0,5-1%) but was more often in women than men (6: 1),while in common population is the same in both sex. We found statisticaly sig-nificant differences between the psychotic and control groups for areas of lesions in temporal lobe (p =0,04). The psychotic group had greater areas of lesions in corpus callosum, but this was not statistically significant. We obtained no differences for frontal lobe.Conclusions: Psychosis is more often in MS women than in common popula- tion. In psychotic MS patients were demyelinating lesions larger in temporallobe than in other areas of the brain. This might suggest that psychosis could bea part of MS disease process.

P289 HOPELESSNESS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Patten SBa, Metz LMb aCommunity Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada;bClinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada Background: Hopelessness ratings can predict suicide risk. In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), suicide rates are elevated relative to the general popu-lation. In one study of interferon (IFN) beta-1b, suicide attempts were seenonly in patients on active drug. Two recent, randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled clinical trials of IFN beta-1a in MS have obtained BeckHopelessness Scale (BHS) ratings. One of these, the PRISMS trail, evaluatedIFN beta-1a 22 or 44mcg three times weekly for 2 years in relapsing-remitting(RR) MS. Another, the SPECTRIMS trial, evaluated the same medication anddoses in secondary progressive (SP) MS over 3 years. Objectives: To describe changes in hopelessness ratings during two random- ized, controlled trials of IFN beta-1a in MS, and to compare levels of hopeless-ness in patients with RRMS and SPMS.Methods: Raw data from both clinical trials were obtained from the study sponsor (Serono). Median BHS ratings, and the proportions exceeding a 9/10BHS cut-point were calculated over a 2-year (PRISMS) or 3-year(SPECTRIMS) follow-up period. Depressive symptoms were examined usingthe Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Rating Scale and the Gen-eral Health Questionnaire.Results: Ratings of hopelessness were higher in the SPMS (SPECTRIMS) than in the RRMS (PRISMS) group). Changes in hopelessness were unrelatedto treatment group or IFN beta dose. Hopelessness ratings increased over timein the SPMS group, but not in the RRMS group. Depressive symptom ratingsdid not increase over time in either study and were not related to treatment.These findings suggest that suicide risk may be greater in those with SPMSthan RRMS, and that suicide risk may increase over time during the secondaryprogressive phase.Conclusions: Hopelessness, as measured by the BHS, is a different concept than depression. Whereas levels of depression appear do not increase over timein SPMS, hopelessness ratings do. These findings indicate a need for suiciderisk surveillance and psychological support that increases over time and isindependent of IFN beta-1a Serono.Funding: by Serono.

The most frequent cognitive abnormalitiesin MS are subtle defects in abstraction, memory, attention and word finding.Objectives: To determine cognitive dysfunction in MS patients. Methods: 30 MS patients suffering from a relapsing-remitting (R-R) (12 patients), a secondary progressive (SP) (17 patients) or a primary progressive(PP) form of the disease (1 patient), were assessed using a neuropsychologicalbattery of the main cognitive areas: general intelligence functioning, memory,attention and concentration, executive functioning, language, visual-spatialfunctioning, visual-motor functioning and personality.Results: Memory (episodic and semantic), executive functioning, visual-spa- tial perception have been impaired more than visual-motor functioning andattention, whereas short term memory, language and global intellectual effi-Multiple SclerosisPosters S111 ciency were normal. 6 patients showed no deterioration of cognitive function- ing. All of them were R-R MS patients, except one who presented PP form ofMS and has no deterioration.

Previous studies atour department have also indicated a relationship between whole brain glucosemetabolism and clinical function.Objectives: This cross-sectional study of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) was initiated in order to assess the correlation among cognitive func-tions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomogra-phy (PET).Methods: Twentyone newly-diagnosed, clinically definite, MS patients with the mean age of 35.6 [range 22-48] years old and with a mean EDSS score of1.8 [range 0-4] were neuropsychologically tested and scanned metabolic rate) and MRI (whole brainFluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) within 30 days. A group of 75 normalindividuals, matched for age, sex and educational level, served as controls inregard to neuropsychological test results. Results: . From the cross-sectional data we show that the studied population of MS patients compares to a control-group of 75 normal individuals whencontrolling for age and sex, but that out of 26 cognitive measures, 11 MSpatients failed 0-3 tests (<1.5 SD below the normal controls), 6 patients failed4-7 tests, 3 patients failed 8-11 tests, and 1 patient failed more than 12 tests.No correlation was found between PET-FDG (glucose metabolic rate) andMRI (measured by lesion volume or ratio of lesion volume to brain volume).The only neuropsychological test that correlated significantly with both MRIratio of lesion volume to brain volume (rho=-0.42; p=0.059) and PET-FDGmetabolic rate (rho=0.40; p=0.074) was verbal fluency (words with s in 1minute).Conclusions: This cross-sectional study of patients with MS showed a minor correlation between cognitive measures, MRI and PET, althoughalmost half the MS patients had cognitive deficits compared to a matchednormal control group.

EAE in the SJL mouse is a relapsing remitting model of multiple scle-rosis. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to detect magnetically labeled encephalitogenic T-cells in an adoptive transfer EAE in the SJL mouse byMRM.Methods: EAE was induced by proteolipid protein 139-151 that were intracellularly node cultures from PLP-immunized mice werelabeled after 3-4 days of restimulation agent Feridex (Berlex,USA) and PolyL-lysine. Labeled cells wereinfused into recipient mice. In vitro and in vivo studies were done in parallel tocompare the phenotype, proliferative and encephalitogenic properties of mag-netically In vivo and ex vivo MRM was per-formed at 7 Tesla disease exacerbation and remission with T2*w gradi-ent-echo images. Prussian blue (PB) for the presence of iron in cells androutine histology was performed.Results: Magnetic labeling of T-cells did not interfere with the development of EAE in the AT model. Animals with clinical score 2 at time of relapse demon-strated diffuse hypointensities of the thoracic and lumbar cord due to susceptibil-ity effects of PLL-Feridex consistent with infiltration of labeled cells. In addition,white matter hyperintensites with focal dark can be appreciated in animals at timeof remission. Histology showed extensive cellular infiltrate on H&E and PB pos-itive mononuclear cells in nerve roots and white matter with perivascular cuffing.Conclusions: These results provide the basis for tracking magnetically labeled encephalitogenic T-cells in EAE by MRI. This approach should further ourunderstanding of T-cell mediated autoimmune CNS diseases and potentiallyvisualize the host response to under various experimental conditions.

P293 EXPRESSION OF THE ACTIVATION MARKER J, Washington R Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA Background: The ability of inflammatory cells to migrate through CNS tissue involves proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. At least oneenzyme used for this purpose is Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA).When bound to its receptor (uPAR) uPA is an active cell surface protease. Wehave previously upregulation pericyte, microglial activation aswell Activated uPAR+ monocytes are increased in multiple scle-rosis (MS).Objectives: To study the expression of uPAR during EAE. Methods: Lewis rats were immunized with myelin basic protein (MBP), and CNS microvessels (MV) were isolated at various times post immunization.CNS pericytes (PC) were subcultured from freshly isolated MV. Results: uPAR were detected by 7 days post immunization (PI). Positive stain- ing was associated with MV in cells with the morphological appearance of PC.Posters S112 Multiple SclerosisuPAR+ PC cific fluorescence situ hybridization(FISH). uPAR protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistryand western analysis. The number of uPAR+ PC, as assessed by the PC: ECratio, was decreased at 10-14 days PI. During the recovery phase, MHC ClassII+,uPAR+ PC were again observed in MV fragments and the PC to EC ratiowas normal. Results indicate that CNS MV PC became activated during theinduction phase of EAE. uPAR+ PC were detected before leukocyte infiltration.Conclusions: The appearance of activated PC correlates with activation of the endothelium. Decreased PC: EC ratios during the clinical phase suggests thatPC may have migrated from the vessel using uPA and/or that activated PCupon interacting with T-effector cells are selectively killed. Recovery is associ-ated with renewed pericyte coverage. Disclosure: P Dore-Duffy has nothing to disclose. Funding: This study is supported in part by NIH and NMSS. P294 TREATMENT OF of Neuropathology, Copenhagen University hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark Background: have shown that intravenous administration of polyclonal immunoglobulin (IVIG) has the potential to reduce the diseaseactivity in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the mechanisms by whichIVIG may interfere with the pathophysiology of MS are not yet fully under-stood. In the present study we evaluated IVIG treatment of experimentalautoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the primary animal model forhuman MS.Objectives: The objectives of the study were to assess the effects of IVIG on: 1) the incidence and severity of active EAE and 2) the EAE pathology in thecentral nervous system.Methods: EAE was induced in rats by immunization with incomplete Freunds adjuvant and a spinal cord homogenate. Control rats were immunized withsaline. At day 0 and 1 post immunization, animals were treated with infusionsof polyclonal human IVIG (1 g/kg) or placebo (0.1% albumin in 10% maltose).The animals were weighed and observed daily, and the clinical disease severitygraded on a scale 0-6. During the acute attack at day 11, the rats were sacri-ficed and the brain and spinal cord dissected and cut for histological examina-tion. The tissue sections were blinded and scored for inflammation anddemyelination.Results: Treatment with IVIG significantly suppressed the development of EAE as measured by incidence (placebo 92%, IVIG 50%), day of onset, weightloss and maximal average EAE score (placebo 2.6, IVIG 0.7). In the placebogroup, the development of active disease was associated with severe inflamma-tion and demyelination in the spinal cord, brain stem and cerebellum. When animals were treated with IVIG, the pathological changes in the central nerv- ous system were significantly reduced as measured by the average histologicalscore (placebo 8.8, IVIG 5.3).Conclusions: In conclusion, IVIG treatment of EAE did not simply ameliorate the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune disease but had a protec-tive effect against the pathological changes in the CNS.

Ctr., Portland, Oregon, USA Background: CNS inflammation and paralysis are induced by activation of myelin-specific T cells in EAE. Myelin-specific T cells are also associated withpathogenesis in MS, but earlier etiologic triggers which precede pathogenicchanges remain uncertain. Factors governing susceptibility of the CNS toattack by myelin-specific T cells have been identified in EAE but mechanismswhich modulate susceptibility prior to disease onset are not fully understood inEAE or MS.Objectives: Identify pre-pathogenic hematopoietic and immune cellular controlling susceptibility to CNS inflammation.Methods: Transplantation of xenogeneic rat bone marrow (BM) cells alone or with non-myelin-specific rat T cell lines into severe combined immunodefi-cient mice was used to generate experimental subjects which differed greatly intheir susceptibility to CNS inflammation induced subsequently by myelin-spe- cific rat T cells. Clinical severity and number of myelin-specific T cells required to induce disease were used to assess disease susceptibility. Specificlabeled monoclonal antibody staining with flow cytometry was used ex-vivo toidentify CNS cells associated with elevated disease susceptibility. DNAmicroarray analyses were used to assess gene expression patterns in human Tcell populations which differed in their ability to migrate to the CNS. Results: Non-myelin-specific T cells rapidly entered the CNS parenchyma and caused a greatly accelerated accumulation of BM-derived, antigen-presentingcells (APC) to functionally significant levels in the CNS. Elevated numbers ofBM-derived CNS APC were associated with a significantly elevated suscepti-bility to CNS inflammation. Certain human T cells also entered the CNS andcaused an increase in BM-derived CNS APC. Gene expression patterns differedbetween human T cells which migrated to the CNS and those which did not.Conclusions: Non-myelin-specific T cells modulate susceptibility to CNS inflammation by regulating indirectly, through effects on CNS APC develop-ment, the threshold number of myelin-specific T cells required to initiatepathogenesis. Human T cells expressing a particular pattern of genes may mod-ulate disease susceptibility through a similar, indirect process. Disclosure: R Jones has nothing to disclose.

P296 AXONAL PROTECTION BY FLECAINIDE ., Kingdom;bDepartment of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom Background: Axonal degeneration is a major cause of permanent neurological deficit in MS. The events that cause degeneration remain unclear, but it islikely that axons are vulnerable to the effects of inflammatory mediators suchas nitric oxide (NO). Indeed, we have shown that axons can degenerate if theyare exposed to exogenous NO while electrically active. We have also shownrecently that the sodium-channel blocking agents lidocaine and flecainide canprotect axons in spinal roots from such degeneration, as expected from themechanisms which are likely to underlie the neurotoxic effects of NO.Objectives: This study examined the possibility that treatment with flecainide could also limit the axonal degeneration which occurs within the CNS in an experimental demyelinating disease (chronic relapsing experimental encephalomyelitis, CR-EAE, and model of MS).Methods: CR-EAE was induced in dark agouti (DA) rats by immunizing with spinal cord homogenate and complete Freund's adjuvant. CR-EAErats were randomly assigned and received flecainide (15 mg/kg twice perday, s/c) or control solution from 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), a stage atMultiple SclerosisPosters S113 which the animals start to show signs of neurological dysfunction. The neurological deficit was assessed daily, and the extent of axonal loss wasassessed 29 dpi using immunohistochemical and electrophysiologicaltechniques.Results: Morphometric examination of neurofilament-labeled axons in the fasiculus gracilis of the spinal cord of severely affected animals revealed that sig-nificantly more axons survived in the flacainide-treated animals (97axons/1000um2 +/- axons) than controls (67 +/- 24, p<0.01). The amplitudeof the compound action potentials recorded from tail nerves in response to tho-racic spinal stimulation was also greater in flecainide treated rats than in controls.Conclusions: These findings indicate that blockade of sodium channels may be associated with axonal protection in EAE, and suggest a novel way to limitaxonal degeneration, and thereby possibly the progression of disability, inpatients with MS.

A SYNTHETIC ANDROSTENE DERIVATIVE WITHOUT GENDER-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS INHIBITS EAE. CANDIDATE FOR Offner Ha,b, aNeurology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA;bNeuroimmunology Research, Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, USA;cHollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, California, USA Background: Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a Th1 polarized demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), shares manypathological and clinical similarities with multiple sclerosis (MS), and thusrepresents a relevant animal model for this disease. A number of observationssupport the idea that fluctuations in sex hormone levels are related to changesin autoimmune disease status, and estrogen and testosterone can both inhibitclinical signs of EAE.Objectives: The goal of this study was to evaluate suppressive effects on EAE of fluasterone (HE2500), a synthetic androstene derivative without gender- related Methods: SJL mice were immunized with PLP-139-151 peptide/CFA to induce EAE. Starting on day -7, animals were given daily injections (s.c.) ofHE2500 (3.0 mg) in vehicle, or vehicle alone for 33 days.Results: HE2500 significantly delayed the onset, reduced peak clinical score and cumulative disease index of EAE, and prevented or significantly attenuatedrelapses. Moreover, T cells from treated mice had significantly reduced PLP- 139-151 specific T cell proliferation responses and reduced numbers of TNF- and IFN- producing cells in the CNS. Additionally, HE2500 given daily from day 0 completely suppressed development of EAE induced by MBP-Ac1-11 peptide/CFA in B10.PL mice. Finally, SJL mice treated with HE2500 afteronset of clinical EAE had significantly reduced mean clinical scores.Conclusions: In conclusion, HE2500 can prevent and reverse clinicl and histo- logical signs of EAE, apparently by decreasing Th1-like immune responses.Fluasterone is practically devoid of toxic, estrogenic, or androgenic side effectsand retains the potent anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and immune regula-tory activities on EAE of the parent androstene module and derivative sex hor-mones, estrogen and testosterone. Thus, fluasterone would appear to be anideal candidate for clinical trials in MS.

EAE is mediated by CD4+ T cells that recognize CNS self-antigens (Ag) in association with MHC class II molecules. Astrocytes are the mostabundant CNS glial cell population. Their contribution to class II restricted Agpresentation in vivo is unknown. CIITA, directs constitutive and IFNg-inducibleexpression of MHC class II genes. The potential role of CIITA in Ag processingand presentation by astrocytes has not been directly addressed in previous studies.Objectives: Using CIITA-deficient mice, we tested the hypothesis that CIITA- directed class II expression is necessary for T cell activation in CNS inflamma-tion. We also tested the possibility that constitutive CIITA-directed class IIexpression could promote CNS inflammatory disease.Methods: Newly created GFAP-CIITA Tg mice and CIITA-deficient mice were used to examined the role of CIITA in CNS class II expression and Agpresentation by astrocytes and in EAE susceptibility.Results: CIITA-deficient mice were resistant to EAE by immunization with CNS autoantigen. Adoptive transfer of wild-type CNS autoantigen-specificCD4+ T cells into CIITA-deficient mice did not induce EAE, indicating that CIITA-dependent class II expression was required for CNS Ag presentation. GFAP-CIITA-Tg mice did not develop spontaneous EAE or more severe dis-ease than control mice when immunized with CNS peptide. Whereas IFNg-activated astrocytes could present Ag, CIITA-trans-fected astrocytes could present peptide Ag only.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that although CIITA-directed class II expression is required for CNS Ag presentation and EAE induction,CIITA-directed class II expression alone in astrocytes may not be suffi-cient for Ag processing and does not support induction of CNS autoim-mune disease.

P299 TREOSULFAN IN MYELIN-OLIGODENDROCYTE-GLYCOPROTEIN- INDUCED EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS:POTENTIAL NEW TREATMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Weissert Ra, Pfrommer Ha, Wiendl Ha, Baumgart autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced in DA (RT1av1) ratsresembles multiple sclerosis in many aspects since central nervous systempathology shows inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Morevover DArats develop a relapsing-remitting disease course. Objectives: We explored the potential beneficial effect of treosulfan in the treatment of MOG- induced EAE in DA rats.Methods: EAE induction with MOG; i.p. treatment with serum titers; quantitative analysis of white and red blood cells, reticulocytes and thrombocytes. Results: A single i.p. administered dose of treosulfan (1000 mg/kg body weight) at the day of immunization significantly reduced disease severity com-pared with PBS treated controls. Three repeated injections of treosulfan onconsecutive days after disease induction (each 333 mg/kg body weight) did notfurther increase the therapeutic benefit. After disease had evolved, a singledose of treosulfan (1000 mg/kg body weight) given i.p. on day 14 p.i. improvedlong term disease outcome. Treatment with treosulfan resulted in reducedmRNA expression of IL-12 and IFN-gamma in draining lymph nodes andreduced numbers of IFN-gamma secreting MOG specific T cells. Treatmentdid not affect MOG specific antibody titers. Myelosuppression was notobserved. Conclusions: Taken together treosulfan is well tolerated and has beneficial effects on the disease severity and disease course in DA rats. Based on theseexperimental data treosulfan should be explored in multiple sclerosis patientswho have failed conventional treatment.

Robert Weissert or members of his group and staff of the Departmentof Neurology at the University of Tuebingen Pharma International SA, GENEVA, Geneva, Switzerland;bCorporate Pharmacoeconomics, Serono SA, Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland Background: A cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed, based on the comparative, randomized, controlled clinical trial (EVIDENCE)comparing: IFN beta-1a beta-1a 30 mcg IMqw (n = 338) in the treatment of RRMS. Over 48 weeks, 62% of 44 mcg tiwpatients mcg had a 30% reduction in the rate offirst relapse relative to the for 30 mcg qw patients (HR=0.70, p= 0.003).Placebo relapse trial comparingIFN beta-1a 44 mcg tiw and placebo at 1 year (37% relative reduction).Objectives: To assess the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness ratios of two interferon beta-1a formulations in RRMS.Methods: Cost calculations integrated the cost of drugs, cost of care (physician visits, symptom-related medication, MRI, Lab tests) and specific costs duringone relapse. Mean costs for one relapse was assessed by a specific cost study onmanaged care organization databases in the USA.Results: The cost-benefit using IFN 30mcg qw (total cost per patient / costs avoided per patient). If onlypatients with relapses are considered, the cost avoided per relapse avoided was$3,600 using 44 mcg tiw rather than 30 mcg qw of 48 weeks (difference of totalrelapse costs / difference in relapse number). If the whole study population isconsidered a cost per relapse avoided is $28,100 taking into account all costs(drug, cost of care and relapse related costs). This value is comparable to previ-ously reported differences between or placebo (Brown MG et al, 2000, Nicholson T et al, 1999). Thecost per time to first relapse was $1,100 per month with 44 mcg tiw and $1,400per month with 30 mcg qw (IFN treatment cost / time to first relapse for 39thpercentile, 48 weeks). This means that 44 mcg tiw treatment is more cost-effec-tive in delaying time to first relapse than 30 mcg qw treatment.Conclusions: mcg tiw has a better cost-benefit IFN beta-1a 30 mcg qw in RRMS. employees of Serono International S.A. P301 A RELAPSE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST IN CATALONIA? Casado de Viladecans, Viladecans, Barcelona, Spain Background: Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) available today are effective but expensive. We consider of high relevance to estimate their effi-ciency.Objectives: To calculate direct and indirect costs of a MS exarcebation in our cohort of patients (Baix Llobregat, Catalonia, Spain) and how they relate toimmunomodulatory treatment.Methods: We collected data from patient questionnaires, hospital charts, Cat- alonian Public Healthcare System tariffs and Catalonian Statistics Institute.The Human Capital Approach is used to estimate indirect costs, including mor-bidity and mortality costs attributable to MS.Results: We analysed 148 patients with MS (Poser) from EDMUS database, clinically controlled in our MS Unit, with similar characteristics to general MSpopulation. 69% were on interferon beta during the previous year. A relapse ofMS needs, average, 1 visit to Emergency Ward, 1 to General Physician, 2 toNeurology outpatients and the administration of standard relapse treatment; weobtain a value of 1209,2-1079,8 euros for direct costs (hospitalization andambulatory, respectively). Each relapse causes an average of 23,5 days missedfrom work, traducing a value of 1530,6 euros for indirect costs for patient andrelapse. We estimate an average total cost of 2675,1 euros for patient andrelapse. Patients in our MS Unit, treated with interferon beta and followed-upduring 4 years, reduced their relapse-rate from 1,5 (before treatment) to 0.5.This would represent, in our cohort, saving 2675,1 euros per patient and year.Conclusions: Total cost of a MS relapse -2675,1 euros- in our population is lower than previously reported in literature. Impact of MS is mostly the conse-quence of disability progression; cost-effectiveness of new treatments willdepend on their ability to avoid not only relapses but also disease progression,which generates direct, indirect and intangibles costs.

HAWKINS S(1), MACLURG K(1), WHITTINGTON D(2), UNIVERSITY Whittington Db, Evason Eb, Reilly PMa aQueens University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom;bUniversity of Ulster, Jordanstown, Belfast, UK, United Kingdom Background: There is a percepton that disabled patients, particularly those with MS are inhibited from, or unable to participate in health screening pro-grammes. Cheng et al. BMJ 2001 showed impairments in mobility related to areduced use of preventive services. We wished to investigate how patients in adifferent system of healthcare complied with our NHS screening standards.Objectives: To audit how a representative sample of MS patients in the com- munity, registered with general medical practitioners, comply with a range ofhealth screening standards.Methods: There is a network of general practices in Norrthern Ireland with com- puterised diagnostic registers - the N I General Practices Framework. They aresituated in inner city, suburban & rural sttings, having 193,300 patients - about13% of the total population of N Ireland. All practices were asked to identify allMultiple SclerosisPosters S115 patints with MS, whether they were actively using hopital - based neurology clin- ics or not. Case notes were studied to identify compliance with key screeningissues.Results: 167 patients were identified - 59 males & 108 females. 85.3% of eli- gible women had had cervical screening within 5 years. 73% of eligible womenhad mammograms within 5 years. Of 158 scheduled to have BP checks, 82%had valid records. 14% were overdue, according to NHS standards. More dis-abled patients were less likely to comply.Conclusions: The uptake of screening in N Ireland was comparable to that observed in the Los Angeles study. There is some room for improvement.

P303 THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF RELAPSE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS PER EPISODE IN THE UNITED STATES O'Brien J, Patrick A, Duran P, Caro J Caro Research Institute, Concord, Massachusetts, USA Background: In todays health care environment it is necessary to consider economic, as well as clinical consequences when making management deci-sions related to multiple sclerosis.Objectives: To determine the cost of managing a relapse of multiple sclerosis. Methods: A combination of direct data analysis and cost modeling was employed to derive typical resource use profiles and direct medical costs in2002 US dollars, from the perspective of a third-party payer responsible forcomprehensive health-care. Place of care and scope of resource use definedthe relapse management level. A high relapse management level consists ofacute hospitalization and post-acute care (i.e., sub-acute inpatient care,rehabilitation, home health care services, outpatient follow-up, related read-missions). Outpatient care including symptom-related medications. consul-tations; physical, occupational and speech therapy; tests; emergency roomand observation unit stays comprise a moderate relapse management level.A mild relapse management level is defined by physician visits and symp-tom-related medications only. Data were obtained from many sourcesincluding all payer inpatient, ambulatory and emergency room databasesfrom several states, physician and laboratory fee schedules, governmentreports and surveys, and literature. All charges were adjusted using cost-to-charge ratios.Results: The average cost per person for high management level was $12,719, based on an analysis of 4,634 hospital cases (mean age 48 years, 73% female).Hospital care comprised 71% of that cost. At discharge, 36% required inpatientsub-acute care, rehabilitation or home care. The typical cost per moderateepisode was $1,847 and mild episodes were $243.Conclusions: The cost of managing relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can be substantial. Thus, avoiding relapses will have a major impact on the cost- effectiveness of treatment. Decision makers concerned with evaluating newtherapies for this disease must consider this.

Little is known about this care load.Objectives: To assess the burden of nursing care for hospitalized patients with MS and to analyze the potential relationship between this burden and sex, age,disease severity, MS form and duration since MS diagnosis.Methods: During 18 months, all consecutive patients hospitalized in our Department of Neurology (Besan\u00c7on University Hospital, France) wereincluded. The daily burden of nursing care of each hospitalization was prospec-tively evaluated with a direct explicit Canadian method: the Nursing ResearchProject software. Patients were classified into 3 groups, according to theExpanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS): I (EDSS 0 to 3.5), II (4.0 to 6.0)and III (6.5 to 9.0). The daily burden of nursing care in relationship to sex, age,disease severity, MS form and duration since MS diagnosis was compared by ananalysis of variance.Results: 129 patients were included: sex ratio M/F = 39/90, mean age (y) = 44.9\u00b112.1; mean duration (y) since MS diagnosis = 12.5 \u00b19.7; and average EDSS = 5.3 \u00b11.9. 83 (64%) patients had a relapsing-remitting form, 36 (28%) secondary progressive form, 6 (5%) primary progressive form and 4 (3%) sus- pected MS. 389 hospitalizations were analyzed: mean number of hospitaliza- tions for each patient was 3.0 \u00b12.6 and the average length of each hospitaliza- tion was 3.4 \u00b13.8 days. The mean total daily burden of nursing care was 200\u00b1126 minutes per patient: nursing care secondary to physician's prescrip- tion = 60 \u00b133 min, secondary to nurses' own activity = 70 \u00b175 min and second- ary to the communication relationship with the patient = 70 \u00b120 min. The total daily burden of care increased significantly with disease severity [group I = 147\u00b1134 per patient; group II = 207 \u00b1120 min; group III = 220 \u00b1121 min (p=0.0002)] and was significantly different according to the MS form [relaps- ing-remitting = 186 \u00b1124 min; secondary progresive = min; primary progressive = 222 \u00b1110 min (p=0.03)], but not according to sex, age and dura- tion since MS diagnosis Conclusions: This study suggests that the nursing care of hospitalized patients with MS require many human resources. It should help to increase the qualityof this care. Disclosure: L RUMBACH has nothing to disclose. Funding: ARSEP P305 THE NEW ZEALAND BETA-INTERFERON PROGRAM. AN APPROACH TOEQUITABLE PROVISION OF TREATMENT FOR MS WHERE FUNDING ISRESTRICTED Willoughby EWa, Abernethy DAb, Wright ARc, Anderson NEa aNeurology, Auckland Hospital, Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand;bNeurology, Wellington Hospital, Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand;cNeurology, Dunedin Hospital, Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand Background: Since 2000, New Zealand (NZ), funding for beta-interferon (BIF), either Avonex or Betaferon, has been provided for a limited number ofpatients with MS - approximately 10 - 15% of the total. Applications for BIFare reviewed by a national panel of 3 neurologists who also review progressannually. Strict criteria have been set: Starting: relapsing MS (secondary pro-gression may be present) with 2 significant relapses in the previous year andEDSS score of 3.0 to 6.5. Stopping: stable or increased relapse rate or sustainedincrease in EDSS by 1 point or worsening to EDSS 7.0. The starting criteria areconsiderably more restrictive than those used in the major treatment trials,especially with respect to the frequency and duration of relapses (must persistmore than 1 week) and the EDSS range. The rationale, with funding limited,Posters S116 Multiple Sclerosiswas to treat patients considered at high risk of significant increase in disability in the short term. Continued BIF treatment in worsening patients was notthought to be justified in these circumstances.Objectives: To describe the program for provision of BIF for MS in NZ which is, we believe, unique. Methods: Review of the national database of MS patients treated with BIF. Results: 231 patients are currently on BIF, 20 have stopped voluntarily and 11 (of 190) have had BIF stopped at the first annual review (increased disability 7,frequent relapses 1, both 3). On BIF the overall frequency of relapses hasdropped by 80% vs the pre-treatment year. Of patients with baseline EDSS of3.0 to 5.5, 26% improved and 8% worsened by 1 EDSS point or more. Patientswith baseline EDSS of 6.0 to 6.5 had less marked benefit, but 29% improvedand 13% worsened by 0.5 point or more.Conclusions: Where funding for BIF is limited, development of guidelines and a system to apply them equitably is difficult. Key components in the NZ programhave been open discussion of the issues, and agreement among neurologists nation- ally to use it, despite reservations by many. An important problem is the increasing perception that BIF may be more effectively used earlier in the course of the disease.

New Clinical Trials (Part 2) P306 THE INDIPENDENT COMPARISION OF INTERFERON (INCOMIN) TRIAL:MRI TURIN, Italy,;bINCOMIN, trials once-a-week IFN beta-1a or of on-alternate-day IFN beta-1b compared to Recently,we evaluated the clinical comparision of the two drugs.Objectives: To compare and analyse at the MRI the frequency occurrence of new PD/T2 lesions in the RRMS treated with two IFN beta preparations.Methods: Prospective 2-years follow-up of 188 consecutive relapsing-remit- ting patients randomized by MS centers to recive IFN beta-1a (30 MIU subcutaneously on alternatedays), 79% of these patients had baseline and every year MRI. The scans wereevaluated in blind at the end of 2-year of follow-up.Results: At the end of the 1-year of the study follow-up the mean number of new PD/T2 lesions was in the IFN beta-1a (p 0.003), in the second year of follow-up the mean number of new PD/T2 lesions was 0.86 +1.73 in the IFN beta-1b group, mean of new PD/T2 lesions with concomitant enhancement 0.3 \u00b10.9, lesions that were new PD/T2 lesions without concomitant enhancement 1.3 \u00b12.2, enhancing lesions 0.9\u00b12.2 and enhancing lesions that were not new lesions on PD/T2 scans 0.6\u00b11.7. For IFN beta-1a group the mean of new PD/T2 lesions with concomi- tant enhancement were 0.9 \u00b11.6, lesions that were new PD/T2 lesions without concomitant enhancement 3 \u00b13, enhancing lesions 1.8 \u00b12.9 and enhancing lesions that were not new lesions on PD/T2 scans 0.8 \u00b11.4. Secondary outcome measures were all significantly (p 0.05) better for IFN beta-1b group except for the mean of enhancing lesions that were not new lesions on PD/T2 scans (p=n.s.). Conclusions: The results of MRI analysis showed that IFN beta-1b reduced signs of disease activity more effectively than IFN beta-1a and confirmed theclinical results.

However, the long-term impact of interferon beta treatment at thefirst episode and the benefits of a high dose/high frequency treatment have yetto be evaluated. A high dose/high frequency treatment was recently shown tobe more efficacious than a once weekly treatment in established RR MS(INCOMIN, EVIDENCE). Objectives: BENEFIT (Betaferon\u00ae/ Betaseron\u00ae in Newly Emerging MS for Initial Treatment) is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup, multicenter, phase III study in patients with a first demyelinating eventsuggestive of MS and an abnormal MRI.Methods: The trial is designed to: (i) investigate the efficacy of high dose/high frequency interferon beta-1b relative to placebo, assessed by onsetof a second clinical event, development of new MRI lesions, changes inEDSS and MSFC, and quality of life; (ii) explore long-term effects beyondthose on the second event and MRI lesion development; (iii) reveal the rela-tionship of the two primary endpoints (time to diagnosis of MS according tothe McDonald criteria, and time to clinically definite MS (CDMS) accordingto the Poser criteria) in the presence or absence of immunomodulatory treat-ment; and, (iv) compare treatments initiated before and after conversion toCDMS and evaluate the prognostic relevance of new lesions on follow-upMRI scans.Results: Approximately 400 patients from Europe and Canada will be enrolled, 150 to receive placebo and 250 to receive 250 \u00b5g (8 MIU) interferon beta-1b every other day (eod). The maximum duration of the double blind phase will be 2 years, or until both primary endpoints are reached (i.e. afterCDMS). Patients with CDMS, and all patients completing the 2-year study,will enter a long-term follow-up study, and be offered open-label interferonbeta-1b eod for at least 3 years.Conclusions: It is the goal to maintain all patients in the extension study regardless of therapy.

PLACEBO-CONTROLLED DOUBLE-BLINDED DOSE RANGING STUDY OF FAMPRIDINE-SR IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Goodman ADa, Blight Ab, Cohen JAc, Cross AHd, Katz Mb, Rizzo MAe, Vollmer Te aNeurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA;bAcorda Therapeutics, Inc., Hawthorne, New York, USA;cMellen Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA;dNeurology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA;eNeurology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Background: Previous studies of the potassium channel blocker, fampridine (4-aminopyridine), in MS have reported finding improvement in variousaspects of neurological function. However, the safety and efficacy of higherdoses are not known. Objectives: The primary aim of this trial was to determine the safety and toler- ability of escalating doses of a sustained release (SR) formulation given orallyto patients with MS. The secondary aim was to explore efficacy over a broaddose range using measures of fatigue and motor function. Methods: Inclusion criteria were clinically definite MS with EDSS < 6.5 and Fatigue Severity scores > 4. Thirty-six patients at 4 centers were randomized toMultiple SclerosisPosters S117 active (25) and placebo (11) treatment cohorts. The parallel group, dose escala- tion protocol started with a placebo run-in for the first week, 20 mg/day (10mgpo BID) the second week, and then increased in weekly increments of 10 mg/dup to 80mg/d during week 8. Results: The most common adverse effects reported at least once at any dose level in the fampridine-treated group were dizziness (36%), insomnia(36%), and paresthesia (32%). Five subjects withdrew because of seizure(2), tremor (1), dizziness and nausea (1), and leg pain (1). Adverse effectstended to be more severe at doses of 50 mg/day and higher including the 2occurrences of seizure (at doses of 60 and 70 mg per day). The fampridine-SR group showed statistically significant improvement from baseline com-pared to placebo in functional measures of mobility (timed 25 walkingspeed; p=0.04) and lower extremity strength (manual muscle testing;p=0.01). Dose response curves showed increasing benefit in both measuresin the 20 to 50 mg/day range. No other measures showed significant treat-ment effects. Conclusions: The safety profile of fampridine SR was consistent with previous experience. Doses above 50 mg added little benefit and increased adverseeffects. There was significant improvement in measures of mobility and musclestrength.

P309 DISABILITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE (FLAIR STUDY) ANDNEUROPSYCHOLOGY (COBRA STUDY) IN RELAPSING MS Research, Reading, England, United Kingdom Background: It is not known 1) how disability relates to quality of life (QoL), and 2) how neuropsychological functions change in relapsing MS patientstreated with interferon-beta (INFb) in general neurological practice. Objectives: To study 1) the relationship between disability and QoL (FLAIR study) and 2) neuropsychological functions (COBRA study) in relapsing MS patients before and during treatment with INFb-1a (30 micrograms/week i.m.). Methods: Patients with relapsing MS fulfilling indication criteria for INFb treatment and decided to start INFb-1a 30 micrograms/week i.m. were eligible.Evaluations at baseline and months 6, 12, 18, and 24 included EDSS andMSFC (disability), and MSQo54 and AMSQoL (QoL) (FLAIR), and attention(reaction time, digit vigilance), short term memory (numeric and spatial work-ing memory), long term memory (word recall, word, picture, and face recogni-tion), and complex semantic processing (logical reasoning) (COBRA).Results: Recruitment ended December 2001. 284 patients were included in the FLAIR study in 37 centres, located in the Netherlands (17), Belgium (17), UK(1), Ireland (1), and Luxemburg (1). 27 centres in general hospitals, 9 centreswere academic or specialised MS centres. Forty-four FLAIR patients wereenrolled in the COBRA study. Both studies are ongoing. Analysis of baselineFLAIR data include: 1) relation between EDSS and MSFC, 2) interrelation-ships between MSCF, QoL, and clinical and demographic patient characteris-tics, 3) comparison between general hospitals and academic/MS centres, 4)comparison with patient characteristics of the pivotal fase 3 INFb trials. Analy-sis of baseline COBRA data include interrelationships between neuropsycho-logical measures, disability, QoL, and patient characteristics. Conclusions: A large cohort of 284 relapsing MS patients, treated with INFb- 1a 30 micrograms/week i.m., is under study for disability and QoL, with a sub-group being studied for neuropsychological changes.

P310 TREATMENT OF EAE AND MS BY RAISING SERUM URATE LEVELSTHROUGH ADMINISTRATION OF INOSINE. Spitsin GS, Koprowski H Microbiology and Immunology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA Background: The administration of uric acid (UA), a peroxynitrite (ONOO-) scavenger, has been shown to have therapeutic effect in experimental allergicencephalomyelitis (EAE). Several independent researchers have also shownthat serum urate levels are inversely correlated with the incidence of MS inhumans. Attempts to raise serum urate in humans by oral administration of UAto MS patients have not been successful. This prompted us to look for alterna-tive approaches. Objectives: To develop a methodology to raise serum urate levels by adminis- tration of UA precursors such as inosine and inosinic acid and evaluate thera-peutic potentials of such approaches in MS and EAE.Methods: ONOO- scavenging properties of UA and its precursors were evalu- ated by the ONOO- dependent oxidation of dihydrorhodamine orally. Inosine and were adminis-tered to mice orally and i.p. Serum urate concentrations were byHPLC or by colorimetric assay.Results: Both inosine and inosinic acid were efficiently taken up when administered orally to humans or mice and rapidly metabolized appearing inthe serum as urate. Neither of the UA precursors inhibited ONOO- mediatedactivities in a series of in vitro tests. UA precursors were shown to have ben-eficial effect in EAE as well as in MS in a limited phase I human clinical trial.Conclusions: Serum urate levels in MS patients and mice with EAE can be readily and safely elevated by administration of the UA precursors inosineand inosinic acid, both of which are approved for human consumption asfood supplements. Since neither inosine or inosinic acid showed effects onchemical reactions associated with ONOO- or the activity of inflammatorycells implicated in the pathogenesis of EAE we conclude that the therapeuticeffects of these precursors are manifested through their metabolism to UA.

P311 INTERFERON- TREATMENT IN RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: RESULTS OF AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY IN SOUTHERN ITALY Trojano Ma, Paolicelli Da, Liguori Ma, Zimatore Va, Ruggieri Ma, Livrea Pa aNeurol. Psychiatric Sci., University of Bari, Bari, Italy;bNeurology Section, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy Background: Pivotal phase III trials of three interferon beta (IFN ) products showed that each agent produces similar reductions of relapse-related measures in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Recent head-to-head clinicaltrials seem to not confirm these results.Objectives: To evaluate whether the results of an observational study on a large cohort of mildly disabled (EDSS 0-3.5) RRMS patients confirm the mag- nitude of effects observed in randomized, controlled clinical trials of IFN products. Methods: A total of 1,033 patients from 15 MS centers in Southern Italy par- ticipated in the study. Relapse rate, EDSS, adverse events, presence of neutral-Posters S118 antibodies serum, and dis- continuations were evaluated every 3 months. follow-up (n=209) and Avonex(n=169). Results: The proportion of relapse-free patients resulted not different (p=0.10) among the three treatment groups (53.7% for Betaferon, 54.4% for Avonex and49% for Rebif 22mcg) after the first year, and between the two treatment groups (37.5% for Betaferon and 33% for Avonex) after two years. All IFN products reduced (p<0.001) relapse rate at 12 months and 24 months compared to baseline. There were no differences among the three IFN (p=0.17) groups in mean changes in relapse rate and EDSS scores at 12 or 24 months. In gen- eral, IFN -1b patients had a higher incidence of adverse events during the first 3 months of treatment compared with IFN -1a patients (p<0.05), and more patients -1b (10% Betaferon vs 5% Avonex at 24 months). The frequency of NAB+ patients (with a titre higher than 20 NU/ml in at least two consecutive samples, 3 months apart) resulted of 14,8%in Betaferon, 2,2% in Avonex and 6.7% in Rebif groups (p<0.00005). Conclusions: The results of the present observational study confirm those of the controlled phase III trials of IFN in RRMS, and they also are in agreement with those of other presented, independent European open-label studies on large populations.

P312 WITHINTRAVENOUS METHYLPREDNISOLONE (MP) IN THE TREATMENT OFRELAPSES IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) Visser Noord-Brabant, Netherlands;cneurology, VU University, Amsterdam, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands Background: Treatment with MP increases the rate of recovery of acute relapses in patients with MS, however some patients do not show a clearimprovement after treatment.Objectives: Our trial was designed to compare the efficacy of the combination of IVIg and MP with the standard treatment of MP alone in promoting recoveryfrom acute moderate to severe relapses in MS.Methods: MS patients with a relapse with at least one increase in EDSS in comparison to the pre-attack EDSS were randomized to IVIg-MP or MP treat-ment. Neurological disability was assessed at entry, week 1,2,4,8,12 and 6months by EDSS, Scripss neurological rating scale (SNR), 9-HPT and ambula-tion index. The primary outcome was the difference in EDSS grades at 4 weeksbetween the two treatment groups. The predetermined interim analysis wasperformed after inclusion of 19 consecutive patients to accurately calculate thenumber of patients needed to treat to show a difference between the treatmentgroups.Results: The baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. The primary outcome showed that both groups had improved 1 point on the EDSS 4 weeksafter start of treatment (p=0,81). By this outcome one of the stopping rules atinterim analysis was reached. Also the median time to improve 1 or moreEDSS points, the difference in SNR, 9-HPT and ambution index did not differbetween the treatment groups at any endpoint. Logistic regression revealed thatthe patients with a more severe relapse were more likely to improve at least 1 point on the EDSS in comparison to those with a milder relapse (p=0,0028). During follow-up of 6 months five patients in the IVIg-MP group had a newrelapse in comparion to two patients in the placebo group.Conclusions: Although based on a small number of patients our study, stopped after interim analysis, shows that IVIg-MP and MP are equally effective in thetreatment of acute moderate to severe relapses in MS.

P313 EFFECTS OF INTERFERON BETA-1B DOSE TITRATION ON EFFICACY AND Wroe is an effec- tive treatment for relapsing remitting (RR) and secondary progressivemultiple sclerosis (MS). Initial dose titration is an effective approach forlimiting the occurrence of adverse events associated with interferon beta-1b therapy.Objectives: To establish whether a slower titration regimen (62.5, 125, and 187.5 \u00b5g subcutaneously [sc] every other day [eod] sequentially over 4 weeks, then 250 g \u00b5sc eod) offers improvements in tolerability over the standard titra- tion regimen (125 \u00b5g interferon beta sc eod for 2 weeks, then 250 \u00b5g sc eod), we conducted a 3-month, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study in patients with relapsing remitting MS. Methods: Of the 98 patients recruited to the study, 65 received interferon beta- 1b (31 standard titration, 34 slow titration) and 33 received placebo. Patients inthe placebo group underwent the same titration regimens. Results: The frequency of adverse events was generally similar between the two titration regimens. Significantly fewer patients receiving interferon beta-1bexperienced relapses relative to those receiving placebo (9.2% vs 27.3%, p=0.0204). Patients receiving interferon beta-1b by the standard titration method had significantly fewer relapses compared with placebo (6.5% vs33.3%, p=0.0291). However, the reduction in the number of patients experi-encing relapses in the slow dose titration group was not significant (11.8% vs22.2%, p=0.4248).Conclusions: Rapid and significant improvements in relapse rates compared to placebo are achieved using the standard dose titration method. In contrast, theslow dose titration regimen does not reduce the frequency of adverse eventsand may reduce efficacy. Patients should therefore receive high frequencyinterferon beta-1b at the full dose as soon as possible to gain maximum benefit. Disclosure: S Wroe has nothing to disclose.

TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR II POLYMORPHISM IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Ehling of Innsbruck;bBlood Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria;cNeurology, Austria;dNeurology, Vienna, Austria;eNeurology, SMZ Ost, Vienna, Austria Background: Several studies have suggested a role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and recently, theTNFRII (p75 TNF-a) receptor, which is a mediator of TNF effect, was shownto play an essential role in pathology and progression in experimental autoim-mune encephalomyelitis (EAE). So far, MS association with TNFRII polymor-phism has only been investigated using microsatellite markers. Our main pur-pose was to type TNFRII polymorphism directly and to correlate our findingswith clinical data of MS patients in comparison to healthy controls (HC).Objectives: To investigate the role of TNFRII polymorphism in MS, genomic DNA from more than 300 patients of the Austrian Genetics in MS StudyMultiple SclerosisPosters S119 Group, 25 samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematodes and samples of 191 white blood donors, which served as healthy controls, was genotyped.Methods: Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood leukocytes. Nucleotide sequencing of the TNFRII gene revealed the presence of 5 poly-morphic sites, which have been previously reported: T/G, exon 6 nt (both of the latter are associated with noncon-served amino acid substitution), exon 10 nt 1663 genotyped using sequence-specific priming (SSP). Data were statistically analyzed using Mann-WhitneyU test.Results: Our group is the first to present data on TNFRII polymorphism in association with MS. Clinical characteristics of MS patients were correlatedwith the investigated polymorphism. We are able to confirm the allelic fre-quencies of the investigated polymorphism found by other study groups. Inaddition, analyzing TNFRII polymorphism regarding disease progression,exon nt 676 T homozygous individuals were found to have a pronounced aggressive progression. Conclusions: For the first time we report a potential role of TNFRII polymor- phism in the pathogenesis of MS. It seems possible that TNFRII polymorphismplay a role in MS disease progression.

P315 ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO MYELIN OLIGODENDROCYTEGLYCOPROTEIN AND MYELIN BASIC PROTEIN DEPEND ON FAMILIALBACKGROUND AND ARE PARTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HUMANLEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN ALLELES IN MULTIPLEX FAMILIES ANDSPORADIC MULTIPLE Gassner Poustka Ka, Schanda Ka, Deisenhammer Fa, Berger Ta aNeurology, University of Innsbruck;bBlood University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Increased intrathecal immunglobulin synthesis in multiple scle- rosis (MS) patients and the raised incidence of antibodies against myelin oligo-dendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin basic protein (MBP) in CSF andsera of MS patients suggests a relevant biological role for these antibodies inMS. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS,antibody responses to MOG and MBP were shown to be under genetic control.Objectives: To elucidate a possible genetic influence on the humoral immune response to MOG and MBP we analyzed the sera of MS patients and membersof 12 multiplex families for antibodies against these antigens, and typed thiscohort for HLA class II antigens.Methods: The MS cohort included 41 patients with sporadic MS (sMS, 29 females, 12 males; mean age 35.4 years) and 24 patients (fMS; 19 females, 5males; mean age 43.7 years) with 33 healthy/asymptomatic relatives (HR; 13females, 20 males; mean age 47.8 years) and 65 healthy controls (HC; 38 females,27 males, mean age 39.8 years). Antibodies against MOG and MBP were detectedby western blot analysis. HLA genotyping was performed by PCR technique.Results: We found a significantly increased IgM and IgA antibody response to MOG and IgM antibody response to MBP in fMS patients without any differ-ence to HR. Anti MOG IgM was significantly increased in sMS patients. Therewas a significantly raised incidence in antibody response to MOG in combina-tion with MBP when comparing fMS and HR with HC and sMS respectively.HLA DRB1*04 was associated with IgM reactivity to MOG in MS patients,and DRB1*15 and DRB5 with anti-MOG IgA in HR.Conclusions: We conclude that antibody responses to MOG and MBP depend on familial background. Moreover the humoral immune reactivity against MOG is partially under control of certain HLA class II alleles. However, whether the MS phenotype in these multiplex families reflects a reaction tocommon environmental triggers or is controlled by shared genes in and outsidethe HLA in remains to be elucidated.

P316 LACK OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CTLA-4 SCLEROSIS IN SARDINIAN Cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated 4 (CTLA-4), expressed exclusively on activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, functions to down-regulate T cell activity. The human CTLA-4 gene maps to chromosome 2q33;its structure comprises 3 exons and a leader sequence. Genetic variations of theCTLA-4 locus have been implicated in human autoimmune diseases. Conflict-ing results of the CTLA-4 role have been reported in various studies in MS.Thus, its possible that an increased risk is carried by CTLA-4 variants only inseveral ethnically different populations.Objectives: In order to test a relationship between two CTLA-4 gene's poly- morphisms and MS susceptibility, we performed an association study on Sar-dinian MS patients from a large set of trios families (one affected offspring andboth healthy parents). Sardinian population is a genetically different and homo-geneus one, having a high prevalence of MS and particular HLA-DR3 and DR-4 MS association.Methods: Peripheral blood DNA was extracted from 416 MS trios families. Both polymorphisms, one located at the -318 position of the promoter regionand the second one at the 49 position of the exon 1, were typed using standardPCR allele specific dot-blot hybridization. HLA DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 analysiswas performed using a high molecular typing with ASO probes and dot blothybridization. The transmissio disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to analyzedeviation allele from the expected 50: 50 transmissionResults: No deviation transmissio of alleles and the C/T and A/G genotype was found in these sample of families. Moreover, stratifica-tion of patients and controls according to predisposing/not predisposing HLA-DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 of CTLA-4 C-318T and A49G polymorphisms failed to demonstrate a significant contribution to MS susceptibility in Sardin-ian families. Moreover, stratification of sample by HLA predisposing/not pre-disposing haplotypes did not reveal possible association, confirming that Sar-dinian CTLA-4 does not influence susceptibility to MS Disclosure: E Cocco has nothing to disclose. P317 A49G CTLA-4 GENE POLYMORPHISM IN SARDINIAN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND TYPE 1 DIABETES Cocco EE, Fadda EE, Rolesu (CTLA-4) has been investigated in vivo in both animal model and in human autoimmune dis-eases starting from biochemical and physiological functions of the molecule. Inautoimmune insulin- dependent diabetes (T1D) from Italian and Spanish popu-lation of patients, an association between T1D and A49G CTLA-4 exon 1 poly-morphism has been reported. However, in the same study no association wasfound in a group of Sardinian T1D families. Recently we reported that Sardin-ian multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are at high risk for T1D. In Sardinia, anItalian island, a very high prevalence of MS and T1D has been described.Objectives: We analyzed the A49G CTLA-4 polymorphism in 28 patients having both MS and T1D, all Sardinian and of Sardinian ancestry, to test thehypothesis of a role of the CTLA-4 in susceptibility to both the diseases.Methods: Peripheral blood DNA was exctracted from 28 patients with MS and T1D, 788 MS patients and 145 healthy control (HC). Moreover, A and G alle-Posters S120 Multiple Sclerosisles were evaluated in 954 control chromosomes using the affected family based control (AFBAC). the 49 position exon 1 was typed using standard PCRallele specific dot-blot hybridization. Association was tested by two side chisquare test.Results: The AA genotype was found in 46.4% of MS and T1D patients, in 61.5% MS patients and in 58.6% of HC, without differences between groups.Conversely, the AG genotype was found in 46.4 of MS and T1D subjects, in32.2% of MS and in 35.9% of HC, while the GG genotype was found in 7.1%of MS and T1D subjects, in 5.2% of MS and in 5.5% of HC. The A allele wasfound in 69.6% of MS and T1D, in 78.2% MS, in 76.5% of HC and in 79.6%of AFBAC, while the G allele was in and 23.4% analysis of CTLA-4 A49G polymorphisms did not demonstrate a role of this gene in susceptibility to the co-morbidity of MSand T1D in a group of Sardinian patients having both the diseases, con-firming data observed in patients having only one of the two autoimmuneconditions.

P318 INFLUENCE OF MHC/HLA ALLELES IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CLINICAL VARIABLES Cocco EE, Fadda E, Rolesu M, Melis C, Solla M, MM neuroscience, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, Background: Despite a general agreement about the association between mul- tiple sclerosis (MS) predisposition and certain HLA class II alleles, theinvolvement of these genetic markers and clinical variable influencing MScourse is discussed. Recently, we reported an independent association betweenMS predisposition and several alleles located in the MHC at theclass II (DRB1, DQB1, DPB1) or last markedby D6S1683 microsatellite. Objectives: To examine the relationship between several clinical variables and presence of haplotypes and genotypes at the MHC/HLA loci in Sardinian were typed for DPB1, DRB1, DQB1, D6S1683. Logistic regression analysis was assessed to describe the relation betweenpredisposing/not predisposing alleles at these loci and several covariates: sex,age at onset, time to reach EDSS 6 from onset, bout onset (relapsing remittingand secondary progressive)or primary progressive course, presence of MS infirst degree relative. DRB1-DQB1 predisposing alleles were analyzed DRB1*0405-DQB1*0301, and genotypes. Conversely,we considered the positively associated DPB1*0301 and the positively asso-ciated D6S1683 allele 4 (186 bp) and negatively associated (protective) allele3 (184 bp). Results: An association with several MHC/HLA allele was observed only in patients having other relatives with MS (familial disease). In these patients, wefound an association with the D6S1683 allele a (p=0.03). Lower age at onset(p=0.001) and progressive course (p=0.01) was associated with DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 haplotype. Early onset was increased by a factor=1.94 in patientscarrying 2 predisposing DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes. Lower age in reachingEDSS 6 was associated (p=0.01) with one of the five DRB1-DQB1 predispos-ing haplotypes. Finally, in women allele was found.Conclusions: MHC/HLA loci seem to influence age at onset, type and severity of course in familial MS, suggesting that genes contributing to MS predisposi-tion might also modulate several clinical variables.

Brazilian black population originated from three million immi-grants from different regions and tribes of Africa. Almost 30% of Brazilian MSpatients are Afican-Brazilian. Objectives: To determine distribution DQB1, DQA1 and DRB1 loci association in African-Brazilian and White Brazilian populationand discuss probable association or protection of theses alleles with diseases asmultiple sclerosis according to the ethnic background.Methods: 132 African-Brazilian and 147 White individuals from Rio de Janeiro City enrolled in a genetic study for multiple sclerosis were analyzed.Typing of HLA class II DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 genes was made by amplifi-cation of the DNA using PCR followed by hibridation with SSOP for locus.Results: and p=0.00004). DQB1 0303-0304-0305-0503-0604-0697-0608 alleles were absent among African-Brazilian population,but present population, with relatively high frequency DQB1*0401 (7.48%), present in White Brazilians (p=0.00001), and conversely,the DRB1*1503 was significantly present in African-Brazilians(p=0.000001).Conclusions: Positive association with DQB1*0602 in both groups can reflect the admixture of American colonization. DRB1*1501, common inMultiple SclerosisPosters S121 Europeans and in DR2 haplotype was present almost exclusively in White Brazilian group. DRB1*1503, unusual in both Europeans and African-Ameri-cans was significantly associated with African-Brazilians. Our African-Brazil-ian population differs from African-American samples with no presence ofDR2 haplotype.

Genetic and environmental factors are thought tobe involved in the pathogenesis of MS, with the disease considered rare in trop-ical countries, including Brazil. Which gene(s) present in this region areresponsible for MS susceptibility in the brazilian population is still an unsettledissue. Heterogeneity distribution of HLA class two alleles was previoslyshowed. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the frequencies of HLA class II alle- les (DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPA1* 0301, DRB1*1501, DRB1*1503) in anew group of MS patients from the Rio de Janeiro city Methods: It was included 42 individuals (73.8% female and 26.2% male) with clinically definite MS, age range of 15 to 55 years. In relation to ethnic back-ground, MS patients were 72.6% White/Caucasian and 23.8% African-Braziliandescendants. White/Caucasian (CA) and 41.7% African-Brazilian (AF). HLA typing was performed by amplification of the DNA isolated from periph- eral leukocytes with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) followed by SSOPhybridization.Results: MS patients showed a positive alleles DQB1*0602 (Pc=0.021; RR=2.40) endowed strong correlation of this allele disease susceptibility in CA patients. DR2 (DRB1*1501,DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602) haplotype frequencies among healthy individ-uals and MS group was low.Conclusions: Since both ethnic groups of MS patients showed very low frequen- cies of DRB1*1501 and DRB1*1503 it is suggested that another DRB alleleassociation may be conferring susceptibility to MS in this population. Finally thevery low frequency (RR=0.36) of DPA1*0301 allele consistently observed in ourMS patients indicate that such allele may rather have a protective role against MS.

P322 PRIMARY ASSOCIATION OF A TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR GENEPOLYMORPHISM WITH MS SUSCEPTIBILITY Rafael Aa, Virginia Da, Alfonso Mb, Ana Rb, Miguel Fb, Xavier Mb, Emilio Gb aNeurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Inmunolog\u00eda, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos. Hospital Vall, Madrid. Barcelona,Madrid. Barcelona, Spain Background: MS is a multifactorial disease in which many genetic loci may contribute to susceptibility. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene is located in theMajor Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class III region, within a cluster of genes encoding several inflammation-related proteins. We have reported a pro-moter region polymorphism in the TNF gene, TNF-376A, associated with sus-ceptibility to MS in Spanish white individuals (Fernandez-Arquero et al, Neu-rology 1999;53: 1361). This was not confirmed in a well Olmsted County, MN (Weinshenker To perform a second case-control study with different patients of the same ethnicity to exclude a chance (false-positive) result. To study whetherprimary/progressive (PPMS) patients carried this susceptibility locus. Methods: 150 MS patients (100 of them PPMS) and 133 healthy controls eth- nically matched were studied. Three single nucleotide TNF promoter polymor-phism at position 238, 308 and 376 and HLA-DRB1 alleles were typed byDNA methods. Results: Our data confirmed the association between MS and TNF-376A (17.33% vs 6.77% in controls; OR=2.89; p=0.007). As we had enriched ourpatients population with PPMS, we could observe that the association wasequally significant between TNF-376A and PPMS (16% vs 5.95%; ancestral haplotype (i.e. TNFa1,b5 and HLA-B18). Conclusions: The presence of adenine at position 376 on the TNF promoter (TNF-376A) is associated with MS, both PPMS and relapsing-remitting MS.This polymorphism is carried by a well known MHC extended ancestral haplo-type (AH) present mainly in Spain, Southern France and Sardinia called 18.2AH. As ancestral haplotypes are conserved chromosomal segments and that their coding and non-coding sequences are identical by descent from a remote ancestor, the locus responsible for susceptibility to MS may be either TNF orany other gene haplospecific or haplotypic for 18.2 AH.

P323 MHC GENE MODULATING MS SUSCEPTIBILITY CONFERRED BY HLA- DRB1*1501 Rafael Aa, Virginia da, Alfonso Mb, Ana Rb, Xavier Mc, Emilio Gb aNeurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain;cNeurology, Hospital Vall d'Hebr\u00f3n, Barcelona, Spain Background: MS is a complex disease with a polygenic mode of inheritance. Genomic scans have shown that the main susceptibility locus is located withinthe Major Histocompatibility region (MHC), where the HLA-DRB1*1501allele has been seen consistently associated with MS in different populations.TNF-alpha is an important inflammatory cytokine and TNF gene, located in theMHC, could be a second susceptibility geneObjectives: To determine whether TNF genetic markers might modulate sus- ceptibility conferred by HLA-DRB1*1501Methods: We studied 2 groups of Spanish MS. First 286 patients and 340 eth- nically matched controls. Sixty-three MS were studied together with both par-ents, and the 4 parental haplotypes were identified for each family. The secondstudy comprised 100 patients, all primary progressive MS (PPMS). HLA-DRB1 and TNFa,b microsatellites were typedResults: As expected HLA-DRB1*1501 was found to be associated with MS (33% vs 19%; p<0.001; OR=2.08). We also observed AH7.1. We then analyzed thesusceptibility of HLA-DRB1*1501 in individuals positive and negative forTNFa11b4, and a striking difference was observed. The association of HLA-DRB1*1501+TNFa11b4+ with MS was weaker (16% vs 12% in controls;p=0.18; OR=1.36) than the (16% vs 6%; p<0,001; OR=2.08). Theseresults were confirmed in a second group of 100 white Spanish PPMS patientsand 101 ethnically matched controls. Susceptibility ofDRB1*1501+TNFa11b4- individuals was higher (19% vs 3%; p<0,001;Posters p=0.13; OR=1.95). Moreover, 63 MS family trios were included in the study. Again,transmission disequilibrium was higher in HLA-DRB1*1501+TNFa11b4-haplotypes (11T indicate that TNFa11b4 microsatellite alleles are a marker for a gene modulating MS susceptibility conferred by HLA-DRB1*1501. Haplotype studies suggest that this gene is carried in the7.1AH. Disclosure: A Rafael has nothing to disclose. P324 IL10 GENE AND RESPONSE TO IFN BETA IN MS de las Heras Va, Rafael Aa, Mart\u00ednez Ab, Rubio Ab, G de la Concha Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Background: IL-10 is anti-inlammatory cytokine and 1L-10 gene could succeptibility gene for MS.Several studies on IL-10 polymorphims associa-tions with MS have already been published.It has been reported also an increase production of IL-10 after MS treatment with IFN- in association with downregulation of Th1 responses and clinical benefit. The cytokine production depends on IL-10 genotype.Our group has previously reported a higher fre-quency of IL10G12 allele in the group of MS patients compared to controls,and recently has found that this IL10G12 allele is mainly linked to ACC andGCC promoters. Objectives: To study whether the IFN- response is dependent on IL-10 genotype Methods: A pilot,retrospective study over 44 recurrent-remiting MS patients that has completed 2 years of IFN- treatment. One patient is considered as non responder if has not shown a reduction of attacks number or has had 1 point (for EDSS <5,5) or 0,5 point (for EDSS >=5,5) increase in the EDSS.IL-10microsatellites were amplified using primers and conditions described byEskdale et al. IL-10 promoter polymorphisms were analysed according to Mul-lighan et al. Results: 75%(33/44)are responders.We found significant differences between IL-10G12+ patients and allele: of responders is higher among those IL-G12-, althoug not reach statistical significance: 42.9%(3/7) of in IL- 10G12/GCC group vs 78,1%(25/32) in IL-10G12/GCC-(p=0,12).Conclusions: In our study population it seems that IL-10 polymorphisms could influence the efficacy of IFN- treatment. This is true at least for IL-G12 allele, and probably for the IL-10G12/ACC haplotype, the presence of wich deter- mines a worse response. These polymorphisms could provoke a downregula-tion of IL-10 production and a more severely unbalanced towards a Th-1 response. To know wether the IFN- -mediated modulation of the cytokine net- work, and therefore its efficacy, is dependent on IL-10 genotype would deserve further study.

ASSOCIATION OF APOLIPOPROTEIN E AND MYELOPEROXIDASE GENOTYPES WITH THE CLINICAL COURSE OF FAMILIAL ANDSPORADIC MULTIPLE Mb, Ha Medical Academy of Warsaw, Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland;bDepartment of Neurodegenerative Disorders, The Medical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland Background: Recently the importance of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) genotypes in the clinical characteristics of multiplesclerosis (MS) has been empahsized.Objectives: These results prompted us to re-examine in a large group of Polish Caucasian patients the hypothesis that allelism in APOE and MPO genes influ-ences the course of the disease. Genotypes were determined in 117 MS patients(74 females and 43 males; 99 sporadic and 18 familial cases) with mean EDSSof 3.6, mean age of 44.1 years, mean duration of the disease - 12.8 years andmean onset of MS of 31.2 years.Methods: The relationship between the APOE and MPO genes polymorphism and the MS activity (increase in EDSS during 2 years of follow up) as well asthe presence and the degree of cognitive function changes and defect ofremyelination on MRI were analyzed.Results: The APOE epsilon 4 allele presence was not related to the disease course nor the APOE epsilon 2 - to the degree of the demyelination on MRI.The MPO G-G allele was found in all familial MS and in 56 sporadic cases. Itwas related to more pronounced brain atrophy on MRI (p<0.05). The MPO G-G subpopulation was characterized by significantly higher proportion of SPMS (p<0.05) and by significantly higher value of EDSS.Conclusions: According to our results the MPO allele is frequently found among Polish MS patients. The MPO G-G form is probably related, by themechanism of accelerated oxidative stress, to more severe nervous tissue dam-age and may determine worse clinical course of MS. We postulate that the MPO G-G allele may be one of genetic factors having a major impact on the progression of disability in MS patients. Disclosure: B Zakrzewska-Pniewska has nothing to disclose. Immunotherapy (Part 2) P326 RAPID ONSET MITOXANTRONE-INDUCED CARDIO TOXICITY IN SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Avasarala JR, Cross AH, Clifford DB, Siegel B, Abbey EE Neurology, Washington U School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, USA Background: Mitoxantrone is a recently approved drug for patients with sec- ondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Cardiac side effects limit its useand lifetime cumulative dose should not exceed 140 mg/m2. Mitoxantrone iscontraindicated in patients with a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) of < 50%. Prior treatment with anthracyclines, mediastinal radiother-apy and pre-existing cardiovascular disease are some of the potential risk fac-tors that could contribute to cardiac dysfunction in patients on mitoxantrone.treatment. Objectives: We opted to follow LVEF evaluations at baseline and at the end of one year of treatment since the potential side affects of mitoxantrone therapy in SPMS patients is largely unknown. Methods: SPMS patients on mitoxantrone received baseline LVEF evaluations by radionucleotide ventriculography (RVG) and just prior to their 4th dose. Wefollowed 31 (21 F: 10 M) patients with SPMS being treated with i.v. mitox-antrone at the approved dose of 12 mg/m2 every 3 months. Patients receivingmitoxantrone for SPMS ranged in age from 37-54 years; the mean diseaseMultiple SclerosisPosters S123 duration was 13.2 years. Baseline LVEF was above > 60% in 27/31 patients and < 57% in 4/31 patients. Results: We found that 4/14 patients (28.5%) had a significant drop in LVEF. No patient who had a drop on their repeat LVEF had any cardiac riskfactors. The mean age (40 vs 43.2), gender, and duration of MS (10 vs 9.4yrs) did not differ between those who had a significant drop in LVEF andthose that did not.Conclusions: We suggest that in patients receiving mitoxantrone, more strin- gent cardiac monitoring than currently accepted standards is necessary.

P327 ANTI MOG AND ANTI MBP ANTIBODY SUBCLASSES IN MULTIPLESCLEROSIS PATIENTS DURING INTERFERON BETA THERAPY Khalil M, Reindl M, Lutterotti A, Egg R, Schanda K, Deisenhammer F, Berger T Neurology, University of Innsbruck Background: Antibodies against MOG and MBP seem to play a role in a sub- set of MS patients. Own previous data suggested a partial influence of inter- feron-beta on the antibody response against MOG and MBP, measured at a sin- gle time point, in a large cohort of 261 MS patients. Objectives: The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether inter- feron-beta therapy influenced the antibody response against MOG and MBPafter one year of treatment. Methods: Until yet we have analysed IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgM and IgA serum antibodies against MOG and MBP in 22 MS patients (mean age32.8 years; mean duration 5.5 years; disease course: 1 PPMS, 2 SPMS, 19RRMS) before and after one year of interferon-beta therapy. The controlgroup consisted of 12 MS (mean age 34.7 years; mean duration 5.4 years;disease course: 12 RRMS) patients without any immunomodulatory ther-apy. None of the patients had suffered a relapse or received any immuno-suppressive treatment within 3 months before blood samples were taken.All antibody isotypes and subclasses were detected by western blot analy-sis. IgG and IgM isotypes were additionally analysed by ELISA.Results: We found significantly raised IgA antibodies in the control group before and after 1 year. No significant differences were found for any otherantibody response between the treatment and control group. No significant dif-ferences in the frequency of antibody response to MOG and MBP were foundwithin each group comparing baseline and 1 year data. However there was atrend towards a reduction of IgM antibodies after 1 year of interferon-betatreatment when performing a paired t-test. Furthermore, disease courses,relapse rates and EDSS are currently analysed.Conclusions: In this prospective 1 year follow-up study we could not demonstrate a significant reduction of the anti-MOG and/or anti-MBP anti-body response after one year of interferon-beta therapy in a group of yetanalysed 22 MS patients. However as we see a trend towards a reduction ofanti-MOG IgM antibodies, we are reluctant to completely exclude any influ-ence of interferon therapy on the anti-MOG antibody response. An exten-sion of the number of patients and of the follow-up period might reveal aninfluence of interferon-beta on immune responses against MOG and MBP. Disclosure: T Berger has nothing to disclose. Funding: This study was supported by an unrestricted research grant fromSchering Austria GmbH. Univ Department Veterans Affairs, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Background: Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be mediated by anti-inflammatory GA-reactiveTh2 cells that enter the brain, cross react with myelin antigens and produce bystander suppression. Experimental and MRI studies suggest a neuroprotec-tive effect possibly mediated by neurotrophic factors. BDNF is produced bycells from both the nervous and immune systems.Objectives: To examine BDNF production in GA-reactive T cells. Methods: BDNF levels were examined by ELISA and confirmed by RT-PCR. Results: BDNF production was examined in 73 GA- and 33 MBP-reactive short-term T-cell lines from 12 MS patients. Mean level pg/ml compared to 20.42+11.11 pg/ml in MBP-TCL (p=0.046). growth factor levels (examined as a control neurotrophic factor)did not differ between the two groups. Six of 73 GA-TCL but none of the MBP-TCL produced BDNF levels two standard deviations above the mean. All sixGA-reactive TCL were Th2 as determined by the IL5/IFNg levels ratio. RT-PCR analysis confirmed BDNF expression in the GA-reactive TCL. Regressionanalysis showed a positive correlation between BDNF and IL-5 (Th2 indicator)(p=0.006) but not with IFNg levels GA-TCL derived from GA treated MSpatients.Conclusions: While autoreactive T-cells may have a dual role in autoimmunity and neuroprotection, GA-reactive Th2 TCL are more likely to produce BDNF,which is consistent with a neuroprotective effect for the drug.

P329 IMMUNOMODULATORY TREATMENT INMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Cs\u00e9p\u00e1ny Neurology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary Background: The most important therapeutic aim of any disease-modifying treatment of MS is to prevent or postpone long term disability. Clinical trialsstudy patients for only short periods of time (2 or 3 years) and, use only short-term outcome measures to asses efficacy. There are no clinical data to supportthe possible importance of continous treatment.Objectives: Five year follow up of 23 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with interferon beta-1b in our study (group A: n=12, sub- cutaneously (s.c.) injected 8 MIU every other day, mean age: 38 years, dura- tion: 3.3 years) and copolymer-1 (group B: n=11, s.c. injected 20 mg every day,age: 41.5 years, duration: 5.5 years).Methods: We compared the yearly outcome by measuring the EDSS scores, the number of exacerbations 2 years prior the initiation of therapy and followup to 5 years. While group A patients had continous treatment, the othergroup of patients was treated for 3 years and withdrawn for a year andrestarted again.Results: EDSS scores were not icreased in the first two years in neither group after the immunomodulatory treatment, whereas it was increased (p<0.05) ingroup B in the next 2 years. The relapse rate was less during the follow up thanthat in the pretreatment period, but it was markedly increased during the with-drawal phase in group B (p<0.005).Conclusions: Our data support the continous favourable effect of immunomodulatory treatment by modifying the course of multiple sclerosis.The possibility that the withdrawal of efficent immunomodulatory therapy canincrease the progression of MS needs to be proved by studying a larger numberof patients.

Recently, Copaxone has alsobeen demonstrated to be active when administrated orally in an EAE model. Objectives: to evaluate whether oral administration of Copaxone can shift from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory in vitro cytokine profile in MSpatients. Methods: As a part of a phase III trial, we performed a prospective study in 31 MS patients. We evaluated interferon gamma and interleukine (IL) 10 produc-tion by mononuclear cells on contact with different myelin antigens by anELISPOT method. Twenty-one patients were treated with oral Copaxone (11with 50 mg per day and 12 with 5 mg per day). The remaining eight patientswere treated by placebo. Dosages were performed at baseline, month 2 (M2)and month 14 (M14).Results: We did not observe any modification in both placebo and 50 mg oral Copaxone groups at M2 and M14. Moreover, we did not observe any modifica-tion with 5 mg oral Copaxone at M2. By contrast, at M14, we observed thatpatients treated with 5 mg oral Copaxone had a significant decrease in term ofreactive T-cells producing interferon gamma against the entire MBP (p=0.009). We did not found any significant modification of IL-10 production throughout the study. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates, for the first time, an in vitro decrease of interferon gamma secretion of T cells in presence of MBP in MS patientstreated with 5 mg oral Copaxone but only after 14 months of treatment. Theseresults argue for a delayed effect of Oral Copaxone on immunological evalua-tion in MS. Disclosure: J de seze nothing to disclose. Funding: Supported by Teva Pharma. P331 A RETROSPECTIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ON THE EFFICACY OFTHREE INTERFERON BETA TREATMENTS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Giray S, Demirkiran M, Sarica Y Neurology, \u00c7ukurova University, Adana, Turkey Background: Although all three interferon beta treatments are effective immunomodulating therapies in multiple sclerosis, a comparison of the three regarding the relative efficacy of each is lacking. Objectives: To analyse and compare the effects of different interferon beta treatments on clinical parameters and MRI findings in multiple sclerosis. Methods: The effects of three different interferon beta therapies on 40 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis have been retrospectively analysedand compared. Twenty two patients received interferon beta-1b (Betaferon) 8MIU every other day subcutaneously, 18 patients were treated with interferonbeta-1a, 12 of them with Rebif 22 mcg three times a week sc and 6 of them withAvonex 30 mcg once a week intramuscularly. These three groups were com-pared according to relaps frequency and disability scores before and after treat-ment, relaps-free time after treatment and the MRI findings. The patients werefollowed for a mean of 18 months. Results: Relaps-free time after initiation of interferon treatment was a mean of 17 months for Betaferon, 12 months for Rebif and 10 months for Avonex.Although it did not reach statistical significance, the frequency of relaps-free patients was higher in Betaferon and Rebif groups than Avonexgroup (respectively 63.6%, 83.3%, 33.3%). Furthermore, the number ofrelapses after treatment was lower in patients on Betaferon and Rebif than it was in Avonex by 25% and 10%, respectively. Betaferon was found to beeffective on disability scores; the difference in disability scores before andafter treatment was found to be statistically significant (P=0.006). More-over, 25% of the patients on Betaferon therapy improved 1 point in theirdisability scores, while there was no considerable improvement in either ofthe other treatment groups. All treatment groups had positive effects onMRI findings and there were no statistical differences among them on thisaspect.Conclusions: These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the retrospective nature of this study, to the small number of patients, espe-cially on Avonex and also to the differences in the follow-up durations ofeach treatment group. Randomized controlled and prospective studies canprovide conclusive data on the relative efficacies of these interferon betatherapies. Disclosure: M Demirkiran has nothing to disclose.

Themedian duration of MS and the median duration of progressive course, before ini-tiating Mito, were respectively 14 years and 8 years. The mean worsening of EDSS within the 24 months before Mito was 1,5. 67 patients (60%) had superim- posed relapses 2 years prior Mito. 36% had gadolinium enhanced lesionson MRI. Clinical and MRI data were collected yearly in EDMUS.Results: The mean EDSS didn't change significantly from baseline: from 6,0 to 6,1 at 1 year(108 patients), from 6,0 to 6,2 at 2 years (74 patients) and from 5,9 to6,2 at 3 years (39 patients). 1 point EDSS worsening at time point from baselinewas 23% of patients at 1 year, 18% of patients at 2 years, and 20% of patients at3 years of follow-up. the mean annual relapse rate decrease from baseline : from0,7 to 0,1 at 1 year, from 0,9 to 0,2 at 2 years and from 1,0 to 0,3 at 3 years of fol-low-up. 10% of MRI after discontinuing Mito, has gadolinium enhanced lesions.Data according to the 2 different protocols will be also presented.Conclusions: This open trial supported the conclusion of the previous con- trolled trials, that Mitoxantrone has a clinical and MRI impact on the inflam-matory markers of the disease.

P333 NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES TO INTERFERON BETA-1B AND THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS Hern\u00e1ndez-Regadera JJa, Barcelona, Spain Background: beta (IFNB) became an important progress in expec- tations of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, the developmentMultiple SclerosisPosters S125 of neutralizing antibodies (NAB) in some patients could inhibit the biological activity of IFNB.Objectives: To determinate whether the development of NAB on long-term therapy with IFNB-1b in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is associated withtreatment from 90 RRMS patients receiving IFNB 1b at least for two years were collected before, at 3 months and every 6 months after initi-ating treatment. ELISA and immunoblotting were performed to detect bindingantibodies to IFNB-1b. Positive sam-ples were tested for NAB by viral cyto-pathic effect inhibition assay. Results were re-lated with clinical responseparameters.Results: 77/90 patients developed antibodies to IFNB-1b. NAB developed in 27/90, generally during the first year, with higher titles during the second year.NAB disappeared in all but 9/65 patients in the fourth year of treatment, with amean time of disappearance of 29 months. In the second year, 16/27 patientswith NAB were bad responders to IFNB-1b therapy. Interestingly, only 11/63 patients without NAB were bad responders (p<0.001). In the fourth year, 4/9 patients with sustained high levels of NAB were bad responders. In contrast,only 7/56 patients without NAB were bad responders (p=0.038).Conclusions: Most MS patients developed anti-IFNB-1b antibodies. Only a small group of patients developed NAB. Since the frequency of bad response toIFNB-1b was greater in this group, alternative treatments may be considered inpatients with sustained high levels of NAB.

P334 LONG-TERM TOLERABILITY OF INTERFERON Clinic Neurology-N euro- surgery, Basel, Switzerland;bSerono International S.A., Geneva, Alabama, USA Background: Patients completing PRISMS-4 were offered to continue on dose-blinded treatment for up to 2 years (PRISMS-6) to provide long-termsafety data. Objectives: To assess the long-term safety of IFN beta-1a (Rebif, Serono). Methods: Adverse events (AEs) were assessed and laboratory tests performed every 3 to 6 months. Serious (S)AEs and terminations due to AEs were docu-mented. Safety comparisons focused on patients on 22mcg (n=273) or 44mcg(n=271) at any point in the 6 years. Results: 560 patients enrolled in the original cohort. 79% of 560 patients ini- tially enrolled completed 4 years on study (77% on treatment). 57% enteredyear 5, and 48% completed 6 years on dose-blinded therapy (many patientsstarted on marketed product and are not included in this analysis). Total expo-sure was 1050 patient-years for 22mcg tiw and 1002 patient-years for 44mcgtiw. In years 5 to 6, the most frequent IFN-related AEs were injection-siteinflammation (50% on 22mcg vs. p=0.22), (25% vs. 19%, p=0.23). All values arelower than reported during the placebo-controlled phase. Most common labora-tory abnormalities reported as AEs were lymphopenia (11% for 22mcg vs.18% for 6.5%, p=0.41). Over 6 years, 55/544 and 69 (25.3%) for 44mcg.Conclusions: Over 6 years, treatment terminations due to AEs imply a dose- relation trend but are infrequent given the route, frequency and chronicity of dos-ing. Total treatment adherence was nearly identical between doses. Dose-relatedAEs show a trend only for lymphopenia. Although incidence of all AEs appearsto decrease over time, reduced patient numbers and less frequent visits maypartly contribute to this finding. An ongoing Phase IV study that will include theoriginal cohort will also collect efficacy data including MRI and EDSS assess-ments. is Swiss MS Society; LK has received honoraria and compensation as speaker, consultant, member of various com-mittees and study investigator for the sponsor of this study and many other pharmaceutical companies; these payments were used exclusively for supportof research activities at his department.

P335 ALGORITHM FOR LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF EARLY MULTIPLESCLEROSIS Koehler J, Wicht S, Hey W, Holger S Neurology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany Background: Current studies support the impression of different therapeutical power of different interferon-beta drugs in several stages of MS. Furthermoredifferent efficacy of interferon-beta-1a could demonstrated in patients withclinical defined MS. Nevertheless a concept for individual long-term treatmentstrategies is needed.Objectives: The aim of this analysis was to outline an algorithm which can support individual long-term treatment strategies in early stages of MS.Methods: Based on peer reviewed papers and latest data of interferon-beta studies in MS an algorhythm was designed. Single steps within this algorhythmwere linked to the studies on which they based. In case of unclear data alloptions were listed.Results: It is evident that long-term treatment in early MS is useful in case of first relapse and distinct MRI abnormalities. Interferon-beta-1a (Avonex) isthe primary drug which is approved for this stage of disease. If this therapyfails we suggest to favourite the treatment with Rebif 22 three times a week asan escalating therapy followed by Rebif 44 three times a week. Interferon-beta-1b or Glatiramer acetate data are not available for patients in this stage ofMS. MRI-follow-up should be done every 6 to 12 month. Progress of initialnormal electrophysiological recordings could be used also for follow-upinvestigations.Conclusions: Criteria for long-term treatment in early MS are present in litera- ture. Avonex seems to be the first choice after the first relapse and distinct MRIabnormalities (McDonald criteria). Frequent follow-up investigations by MRIor electrophysiological studies are necessary to detect non responder. Rebif22/44 should be the alternative for escalating therapy regime. In a currentongoing study interferon-beta-1b is proofed with respect to efficacy in patientswith risk of developing CDMS (Benefit). Furthermore treatment options inCDMS were discussed in this algorhythm. Disclosure: J Koehler has nothing to disclose. P336 THE BRAZILIAN EXPANDED CONSENSUS ON TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Lana-Peixoto MA, Callegaro D, Moreira MA, Marchiori MINAS UFMG Center for Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis, Brazilian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Belo Horizonte,MG, Brazil Background: THe increasing number of therapeutic trials have prompted neu- rological societies in some countries to discuss guidelines for its treatment. Asthe presently available DMA have a high cost and a modest effect a number ofquestions has been risen about their prompt use. Treatment reimbursement mayPosters S126 Multiple Sclerosisrepresent an extra burden to developing countries. In 2000 BCTRIMS pub- lished guidelines which have oriented Brazilian Health Authorities to define areimbursement policy for the country. An Expanded Consensus has recentlybeen approved. Objectives: To describe the main points of the Brazilian Expanded Consensus on Treatment of MS Methods: Brazilian MS experts reviewed the literature on MS treatment and suggested general guidelines for treatment. Papers on MS treatment weresearched from MEDLINE and analyzed according to classes of evidence andtypes of recommendation as set out by the American Academy of Neurology.Information about the cost of the DMA was obtained from the Departmentof Health. A Consensus Meeting was attended by 56 Members of theBCTRIMS.Results: An Expanded Consensus for Treatment of MS, suited for Brazil pre- vailing economical and health conditions was approved. Its main points are: (1)treatment may be prescribed only to patients who fulfill the International Panel criteria; (2) MS diagnosis and treatment must be conducted only by neurolo- gists with expertise in the area in referral centers; (3) decision regarding theonset of treatment must be taken in an individual basis; (4) there is noimmunomodulating agent of choice and neurologists are encouraged to takeaccount of the cost of the different DMA; (5) use of immunomodulating agentsmust be restricted to ambulatory patients (EDSS 6.5 or less). Other items aresimilar to those previously published.Conclusions: The Brazilian Expanded Consensus for Treatment of MS empha- sizes concerns about the diagnosis of MS, decision about the onset of treatmentand the financial cost of the DMA. It may turn out to be a model in other devel-oping countries. Disclosure: M Lana-Peixoto has nothing to disclose. P337 INDUCTION TREATMENT WITH MITOXANTRONE DURING 6 MONTHS IN WORSENING RELAPSING REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: ARESCUE THERAPY FOR SUB-OPTIMAL RESPONDERS TO INTERFERONBETA ? A PILOT STUDY Le Page E, Leray E, Coustans M, Mitoxantrone Trial, Mitoxantrone (MITOX) as induction therapy for 6 months, reduced dramatically radiologi-cal and clinical parameters of disease activity in patients with severe relaps-ing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) (Edan et al., 1997). In the open fol-low-up retrospective study of 100 RRMS patients treated in Rennes on thebasis of this trial, the benefit initially observed was maintained during a periodof 4 yearsObjectives: To assess the potential action of MITOX in RRMS patients expe- riencing a beta or (IFN) comparedwith patients naive of disease modifying therapy (DMT) prior to MITOXMethods: From the open retrospective study of 100 RRMS patients followed in Rennes after an induction therapy with MITOX 20mg monthly for 6months, 11 patients treated by IFN for at least 12 months but who failed torespond were compared with 50 patients naive of DMT for at least 12 monthsprior to MITOX Results: The 11 IFN non responders and the 50 DMT naive patients started MITOX at a mean age of 33.3 vs 34.5 years, after a mean disease duration of6.6 vs 5.7 years, respectively (NS). Clinical and radiological parameters of dis-ease activity during the 12 months preceding MITOX were similar in IFN nonresponders and DMT naive patients with an annual relapse rate (ARR) of 3.1vs 2.8; a mean EDSS deteriorated of 1.4 vs 2 points and raising a score of 4.4vs 4.1 at MITOX onset, respectively. Gadolinium enhancing (GD+) in 7/11 IFN non responders and 40/50 DMT naive patients. Oneyear after MITOX onset, clinical and radiological benefits were similar in IFNnon responders and DMT naive patients with an ARR of 0.27 vs 0.20 (reduc-tion of 91% vs 93%); 19/50 (38%) of patients stabilised and MRI activity reduced by 86% vs 90%, respectively Conclusions: MITOX may provide a new treatment option in RRMS patients who experience sub-optimal response to INF beta Disclosure: E Le Page has nothing to disclose. P338 IN VIVO EFFECT OF INTERFERON- 1A ON INTERLEUKIN-12 AND TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR- 1 University Medical School, Poznan, Poland;bInstitute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, woj.wielkopolskie, Poland Background: Interferon beta 1a at present is one of the most important immunomodulatory agents in the therapy of multiple sclerosis.The mechanism of action of IFN- 1a in MS is not yet fully explained. It is possible that IFN- 1a may inluence flammatory TGF- 1 in vivo in MS patients. This hypothesis was not so far studied in relapsing-remitting MS patients. Objectives: The purpose of our study was to determine in vivo effect of inter- feron- 1a on interleukin-12 and transforming growth factor- 1serum levels during 6 months of therapy in group of 20 patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis.Methods: Twenty patients with multiple sclerosis have been studied. They were 32.6+/-7.6 years old, had at least two exacerbations during last 24 months,multiple lesions in MRI and EDSS 2.6+/-0.9 Interferon- 1a was given in a dose of 6 MIU once weekly i.m.The blood samples were taken before treat- ment,after 3 and after 6 months of therapy.Control group consisted of 15healthy blood donors,age and sex mathched to the MS group. IL-12 and TGF- 1 levels were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems,USA). Results: There was a significant increase of IL-12 levels in MS patients in comparison with control group, suggesting a role of this cytokine in immunity of MS. We have also found a significant increase of TGF- 1 levels after 6 months of therapy with IFN- 1a, however, there was no in vivo effect of the therapy on IL-12 levels. Conclusions: The results suggest that IFN- 1a may exert its action through up- regulation and increase secretion of TGF- 1. Disclosure: J Losy has nothing to disclose.

P339 INTERLEUKIN 18 IS MODIFIED DURING THERAPY WITH GLATIRAMERACETATE (COPAXONE) PATIENTS Medical School, Poznan, Poland;bNeuroimmunological Unit, Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, woj.wielkopolskie, Poland Background: Interleukin 18 known also as interferon gamma inducing factor is a proinflammatory cytokine which plays an important role in T helper (Th1) cells response by inducing IFN- production in T and NK cells. Elevated levels of IL-18 in CSF and serum have been shown in MS patients suggesting role of IL-18 in immunity of MS.Objectives: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of glati- ramer acetate (Copaxone) therapy on IL-18 serum levels in patients withrelapsing-remitting MS. It is possible that glatiramer acetate may influenceIL-18 production.Methods: Eleven patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis have been studied. The diagnosis was confirmed by MRI. The patients were treatedMultiple SclerosisPosters S127 subcutaneously with glatiramer acetate in a dose of 20 mg daily. Blood samples were taken before the onset and after 6 months of therapy. IL-18 serum levelsfrom MS patients and controls (15 patients with tension headache) were meas-ured by ELISA (R&D Systems, USA).Results: IL-18 levels in sera of MS patients were significantly higher in com- parison with control group. After 6 months of therapy with glatiramer acetatein MS patients a statistically significant decrease of IL-18 serum levels hasbeen found (p<0.05).Conclusions: The therapy of relapsing-remitting MS patients with glatiramer acetate is associated with a significant decrease of serum IL-18 levels. Weshow for the first time that glatiramer acetate may in vivo influence the pro-duction of IL-18 in relapsing-remitting MS patients. Disclosure: J Losy has nothing to disclose. P340 THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF STATINS IN RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Markovic-Plese S, Powell AW, Cortez A, Vollmer TL Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Background: Statins, the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase, are cholesterol-lowering agents extensively used in medical prac-tice. Recent studies have reported on their multiple previously unrecognizedimmunomodulatory effects. Objectives: To study in vitro immunomodulatory effects of Simvastatin on immunocompetent cells derived from patients with relapsing-remitting multi-ple sclerosis (RR MS). Methods: Mechanisms of action of Simvastatin were studied on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from RR MS patients. We enrolled12 patients that were untreated, age 18-60, EDSS 1-5.5, with at least oneGadolinium-enhancing lesion on the recent MRI scan The effect of Simvastatinwas measured on PBMCs stimulated with immobilized aCD3 and humanrecombinant IFN-g for 48 hours in a cholesterol-free media. A panel of surfacemarkers was evaluated in untreated and Simvastatin-treated cultures was measured in supernatants byELISA. In order to simultaneously capture treatment-induced changes in theexpression of multiple cytokine and apoptosis-related genes, untreated andtreated PBMC cultures are assessed using gene arrays and cDNA microarrays.Clusters of genes with a significant change in the expression are presently ana-lyzed by quantitative PCR, and cellular assays.Results: Simvastatin-treated monocytes exhibit a significant decrease in IFN-g inducible expression of MHC class II DR molecules (p<0.01). In contrast, the treatment did not affect constitutive DR expression on CD19+ B lymphocytes. In vitro treatment of aCD3-activated PBMCs with Simvastatin induced adecrease in the other Th1 typecytokines IL-2 and IFN-g was decreased, however the difference was not sta-tistically significant.Conclusions: Immunomodulatory effects of Simvastatin detected in this in vitro study will be utilized as immunological outcome measures in Phase IIclinical trial of Simvastatin in RR MS patients.

Eberhard (chemoattractant cytokines) is char- acterized by their capacity to induce migration and activation of leukocytes.Glatiramer acetate (GA, copolymer-1) is a standardized polypeptide mixture, whose beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis are considered to be based onactivation of GA-reactive T-helper (TH)-2-like anti-inflammatory T cells bymyelin antigens the nervous system.Objectives: To determine expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors T-cell protein 10) by GA-reactive TCL was investigated by ELISA.Surface expression of chemokine receptors was measured by FACS, transcrip-tion of chemokine receptor technique, cytokine TCL. was TCL. Thechemokine CXCR3 level, whereas CCR5 mRNA was transcribed by TH1TCL and not by TH2 TCL.Conclusions: These findings suggest and IP-10 are secreted by anti-inflammatory TH2 GA-reactive T cells and thus can be involved inchemoattraction of (i) other regulatory TH2 cells, (ii) pathogenic inflammatorycells in the CNS. Both pathways would increase the local bystander suppressive effect of TH2 cytokines secreted by the T cellsand their putative role in the mechanisms of action of GA are currently investi-gated.

Methods: The patient presented a progressive relapsing form of MS with onset at the age of 26 (right optic neuritis). Twelve years later (1992) he hadpresented three attacks with incomplete remission in one year. The EDSS was5. A treatment by Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 twelve months reducedEDSS to 4. Between 1992 and 1998 he had no new neurological signs. Thissilence period was followed by two attacks with severe brainstem signs(EDSS 6). The MRI performed at this time showed multiple supra- and infra-tentorial signals, with contrast enhancement. The patient refused Interferon.Six Mitoxantrone monthly cures were administred (120 mg). The treatmentwas well tolerated and showed no cardiotoxicity. The clinical and MRI evalu-ation revealed significative improvement (EDSS 4,5). The patient was lostuntil may 2001, when two another attacks occured (mixed sensitive-motorsigns in legs, left optic neuritis). The MRI showed the same lesions but con-trast enhancement. He received Mitoxantrone intravenously (20mg) in Apriland August 2001. The blood samples were normal. However, the bloodexams performed November 2001 showed 502OO leucocytes with 21). The immunotyping of blasts revealed myeloid origin (CD 13, CD 33, CD 34+). An AML type I diagnosis is advanced. A treatment by Aracytyne andIdarubicine dramaticaly reduced haematological signs, leading to completeremission.Results: Conclusions: This is the second case reported in France of acute leukaemia in MS patients treated by Mitoxantrone.

In vitro data describedantiproliferative effects as well as induction of TH2 T cell responses induced byimmunomodulatory therapies with IFNb and GA. As an universal antigen GAinduces in vitro antigen specific responses in T cells and can be used as a readout for changes of T cell reactivity induced by immunomodulatory therapies.Objectives: To further investigate the immunomodulatory effects of glatiramer acetate (GA)and interferon-beta (IFNb)on in vitro specific T cellresponses against GA and myelin antigens. Methods: Short term T cell lines against glatiramer human myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein (MOG) p 1-111were generated from 16 multiple sclerosis patients before and in three monthsintervals over 12 months during treatment with GA (8)or IFNb (8). Split wellassays were performed to measure antigen 3H-thymidine incorpora-tion and the cytokines IFN-g, IL-13 and IL-5 were measured from supernatantsby standard ELISA methods. Primary proliferative responses of peripheral blood leukocytes against GA and tetanus toxoid were followed. Results: GA specific T cell lines were established from peripheral blood leuko- cytes from all MS patients and control subjects. In accordance to earlier in vitrostudies during the treatment with GA T cell lines showed a treatment relateddecrease in their in vitro proliferative response and IFN-g secretion with anincrease in IL-13 production in most patients over time. We could detect a tran-sient decrease in the in vitro reactivity of GA specific T cell lines from IFNbtreated patients with no clear shift to a TH2 cytokine response. In those patientswho showed reacitivity to myelin antigens the frequency of antigen specific Tcell lines appeared to be influenced with a trend to a more sustained effect dur-ing treatment with GA. Conclusions: In vitro T cell reactivity against GA appears to reflect the effect of immunomodulatory therapies on T cell responses in patients with MS. Disclosure: M Schmied has nothing to disclose.

P344 REDUCED EXPRESSION OF THE INHIBITOR OF APOPTOSIS PROTEINS INT CELLS FROM PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS FOLLOWINGINTERFERON-BETA THERAPY Semra YK, Sharief MK Dept of Neuroimmunology, GKT School of Medicine, Guys Hospital, London, United Kingdom Background: Treatment with interferon-beta reduces clinical exacerbations in MS through several immunomodulatory mechanisms that involve theaugmentation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) of peripheral T lym-phocytes. The recently identified family of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) pro-teins is a potent regulator of death. expression of IAP-1, IAP-2,and X-linked IAP (XIAP) is upregulated in mitogen stimulated T lympho-cytes from MS patients, and this expression correlates with MS diseaseactivity.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of interferon-beta on cellular expression of IAP proteins and other apoptosis regulatory molecules. Methods: In a prospective study, we evaluated the expression of IAP proteins, the anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 protein, and the death receptor Fas in in vitro stimu-lated T lymphocytes from MS patients, before and serially after treatment withinterferon-beta. We also investigated the long-term effects of interferon-b oncellular expression of these proteins and T lymphocyte apoptosis in a cross- sectional study of MS patients receiving drug therapy for a mean of 4.8 years.Results: Treatment with interferon-beta reduced the expression of IAP-1, IAP-2 and XIAP in stimulated T lymphocytes. This reduced expression correlated withincreased T cell susceptibility to apoptosis and with clinical response to treat-ment. In contrast, interferon-b therapy did not alter cellular expression of Bcl-2protein or the death receptor Fas. This downregulatory effect of interferon-beta oncellular expression of IAP proteins was maintained following long-term therapy.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that interferon-beta therapy exerts a reg- ulatory effect on peripheral T lymphocytes through an anti-apoptosis mech-anism that involves the downregulation of IAP MK Sharief has received honoraria from Serono International P345 THE EFFECT OF LIVER TRANSPLANT COMBINATION IMMUNOSUPPRESSION ON MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AFTER 18 MONTHS Vorobeychik Ga, Yoshida Prout Aa aNeurology, UBC, Canada;bGasroenterology, UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Background: To date no patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) and liver trans- plantation has been reported in literature and there is little published experiencewith immunosuppressive medications used.Objectives: To describe the course of MS in a patient who was treated with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and tapering prednisone after liver trans-plantation for acute liver failure. Methods: Case report and literature review. Results: The patient is a 60 y.o. female with onset of relapsing-remitting MS at age of 57. She has 3 relapses in the first year after initial presentation, allincluding cerebellar and brainstem dysfunction, and reached Extended Disabil-ity Score (EDSS) 5.0. Her MRI and CSF analysis were compatible with MS.She developed fulminant hepatitis and required liver transplantation 2 months after she was staarted on 11 \u00b5cg of interferon -1a. Her post-transplant immunosuppression consisted of delayed, lower dose tacrolimus to hepato-renal syndrome, mycophenolate mofetil and tapering prednisone. Herpostoperative period was complicated by CMV infection (transmitted fromdonor) and acute rejection reaction. She has not had any relapses during the 18months since transplantation and her MS is symptomatically improved com-pared to pretransplant period. Her EDSS decreased from 5.0 to 2.5 and the bur- den of disease (BOD) on MRI remains unchanged (143 mm 2before treatment with interferon -1a to 113 mm218 months later). She is currently maintained on low dose tacrolimus monotherapy with normal graft and renal function. Conclusions: The post-transplant experience in MS is largely unknown. Our experience suggests that post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy with lowdose tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and tapering prednisone may be asso-ciated with excellent clinical outcome with little drug toxicity.

Baseline MRI was assessed for the presence of gadolinium-enhancement (or9 T2 lesions), juxtacortical, infratentorial, and 3 periventricular lesions. Conversion to CDMSwas used as the outcome parameter.Results: Conversion to CDMS occurred in 41% of patients with gadolinium-enhancement or 9 T2 lesions versus 11% of those without (p /H110050.017); similar comparisons were 44% vs. 31% for 41% 17% for more than 3 periventricular lesions (p /H110050.034). For the cumulative number of modied Bark- hof criteria, the rate of conversion to CDMS was 25% for 1 abnormal criterion, rising to 47%with 4 abnormal criteria. For a cut-off of 3 positive criteria, the hazard ratio for time to CDMSwas 2.3 (95% CI 1.17-4.56, p /H110050.016).While the effect of treatment seemed most evident in patients with 4 abnormal criteria, statistically significant treatment by variable interactioncould not be detected. However, the number of patients needed to treat decreases from 50with 2 or less criteria to 5.6 with 4 positive criteria.Conclusions: This study conrms the validity of the modied Barkhof criteria for conversion to CDMS, and suggests that treatment with IFN-beta-1a is more cost-effective in patientswith more abnormal criteria.

Berger Ta, Rubner Innsbruck,Austria Background: 90% of MS patients present at onset with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Although up to 80% of these patients will convert to clinically denite MS (CDMS), the fur-ther MS disease course is unpredictable at onset for individual patients.Objectives: New neuropathological ndings, e.g. antibody-mediated demyelination, and the concept of epitope spreading in the early disease phase, prompted us to investigate whetherthe presence of serum anti-MOG and anti-MBP antibodies (abs) in patients with CIS predictsthe further disease course.Methods: 103 consecutive patients with a CIS, conrmed by MRI and positive oligoclonal bands in CSF , were included and followed for at least 12 months.Anti-MOG and anti-MBPabs were measured as previously described (Reindl et al, 1999).Results: 73 females and 30 males (mean age at disease onset: 32.0 years; mean disease dura- tion: patients abs against MOG andMBP , 42 (41%) were seropositive for anti-MOG abs only, and 39 (38%) were seronegative.Relapses occurred in only 9 (23%) seronegative patients, but in 95% of patients with absagainst MOG and MBP . Seronegative patients had their rst relapse after a mean relapse freeinterval of 45.1 months (range 25-83 months). In contrast, patients with initial seropositiv-ity for anti-MOG and anti-MBP abs developed their rst relapse after only 7.5 months (range1-18 months, P<0.001). Quantitation of MRI showed higher mean numbers of T2 and Gd-enhancing T1 lesions in patients with anti-MOG and anti-MBP abs compared to seronegativepatients. However, the number of MRI lesions varied in individual patients, irrespective of theirantibody status, from 2 to >9 T2 lesions and 0 to 4 Gd-enhancing T1 lesions.Conclusions: Analysis of antibodies against MOG and MBP in patients with CIS represent a rapid, unexpensive and precise method to identify patients with either a high or low riskfor early conversion to CDMS.This may have implications for counseling and management inpatients with a rst demyelinating event suggestive of MS.

Raso va K, Krasensky J, Havrdova Obenberger J, Zalisova M, Seidl Z Department of Neurology, Charles University Background: Although MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease, which can lead to the axonal injury and loss, neurorehabilitation may contribute to functional recovery accompa-nied by the changes in brain activity.Objectives: T o show changes in brain activity on fMRI and their correlation with functional recovery.Methods: 18 outpatients with MS were evaluated before and after individualized neurore- habilitation treatment (two sessions per week, 30 weeks) for impairment (EDSS), disability(BI), handicap (ESS), quality of life (MSQoL) and amplitude of signal in the primary sensori-motor cortex (ASPSMC) using serial fMRI during the performance repetitive index-thumbopposition.Results: There were 6 men and 12 women, EDSS was 4.19, age 41.11 yrs and illness duration 11.5 yrs. 8 patients had relapsing-remitting, 4 primary progressive and 6 secondary progres-sive MS.The therapy led to functional recovery and positively influenced the impairment (EDSSfrom 4.19 to 3.63: p<0,1), the disability (BI from p<0.05), the handicap (ESSfrom 7.30 to 4.25: and of life (MSQoL from 152.6 to 161.13: trend shown).The functional recovery was accompanied by changes in ASPSMC.There was a trend towardsdecreased ASPSMC after therapy (ASPSMC for right hand from 7.82 to 7.20%, for left handfrom 8.61 to 7.71%).We found two different responses to therapy: in two thirds of patientsthe ASPSMC decreased, while in one third of patients it increased.We have found no rela-tionship between functional recovery and changes in the brain activity. It was shown thatwhen ASPSMC in left hand changed, it changed in right hand as well during the performanceof paradigm (correlation coefcient 0.56).The therapy was not aimed at improving functionof the hands, but control of the whole body. Nevertheless, the function of the hands andASPSMC during the performance of the paradigm changed. It seems that neurorehabilitationinfluences the function of the whole brain.Conclusions: There is very little scientic basis for the therapy that is designed to help dam- aged brain circuits recover.These preliminary results show that neuorehabilitation in MS con-tributes to functional recovery and can be accompanied by changes of brain activity.

Kirk a, Plumb Jb, Mirakhur Mb, Sb aPathology, Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom;bNeuropathology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom Background: Increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability observed in MS has been linked to pathological change in the tight junctions (TJ) and vesicular transport of vascularendothelium.Objectives: This study quantifies the pathological changes in TJs which we have recently reported in MS, including their uneven distribution and the relation between abnormal TJ andBBB leakage.Methods: Frozen sections from plaque and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in 14 post-mortem(PM) cases of MS were studied together with white matter from 6 neurologicaland 5 normal controls. Using single and double immunofluorescence microscopythe were examined acrosslesion types and tissue categories, and in relation to brinogen leakage. Confocal image datasetswere analysed for 2198 MS and 1062 control vessels.Results: Signicant differences in the extent of TJ abnormalities (i.e. beading, interruption, absence or redistribution of fluorescence signal, separation or opening of junctions) weredetected between the different lesional types in MS and between MS and control white mat-ter.They were frequent in oil-red O(ORO) +'active' plaques, affecting 42.5% of vessels, but less frequent in ORO-'inactive' plaques (22.8%) or NAWM (13.1%) and in both normal (3.9%) and neurological controls (9.5%).A similar pattern was found irrespective of the size of ves-sels examined. In both NAWM and inactive lesions, dual-labelling showed that those with themost TJ abnormality had the greatest fibrinogen leakage.This was most apparent in activelesions where 41% of vessels showed severe leakage.Conclusions: TJ abnormality affects vessels of all sizes, suggesting a diffusable chemical (?cytokine) cause. It occurs in lesional and non-lesional white matter, being most severe wherethere is evidence of active demyelination. Disruption of TJs, affecting both paracellular andtranscellular pathways probably contributes to the BBB leakage detected in this study.Thending of TJ abnormality and BBB leakage in 'inactive' lesions points to a failure of effectiveand complete TJ repair or to the continuation of a pathological process. In NAWM it sug-gests either pre-lesional change or white matter damage secondary to remote lesions. Disclosure: J Kirk has nothing to disclose.

Montalban X a, Brieva Barcelona, Spain Background: Beneficial effects of interferon /H9252have been shown only for patients in the relapsing phase of MS as its role in the treatment of SPMS patients still remains controver-sial.The single phase II randomized controlled trial on PPMS using IFN /H92521a(IM) shows no sig- nicant treatment EDSS though some effect on T2 lesion load.Objectives: T o investigate safety and efcacy hints of interferon /H92521b given to patients with primary and transitionalprogressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS and TPMS).Methods: 73 patients (49 PPMS, 24 TPMS) with EDSS scores of 3.0 to 7.0, were random- ized to receive 8 million IU of IFN /H92521b or placebo every other day, subcutaneously for 2 years. Safety parameters including the Ashworth spasticity, Krupp fatigue and DepressionInventory scales and blood tests were performed three monthly. Clinical outcomes (EDSSand MS Functional Composite\u2014MSFC) were also performed three monthly and the Sick-ness Impact Prole six monthly. MRI measures (T2 and T1-weighted brain lesion load, brainparenchymal fraction, active lesions, cord atrophy, MTR and spectroscopy) and neuro-psychological assessment (BRNB) IFN /H9252included injection-site reaction, flu-like symptoms and lymphopenia. One patient on placebo died of pulmonary infection. In all,96% of the patients reached study end and 93% completed the treatment period.Treatmentgroups were comparable on all baseline variables.The proportion of patients with conrmedprogression measured by EDSS at 3 months was 27.8% in the IFN arm and 37.8% in theplacebo arm (p /H110050.3135). differences were for (PASAT (p /H110050.001) lesion load and number of active lesions (p /H110050.005) in favor of the IFN-treated group. Conclusions: IFN/H92521b is safe in treating patients with PPMS and TPMS. Our study seems to be the rst indicating a benecial effect of IFN /H9252in these patients.

Funding:Trial supported by Schering Espa\u00f1a SA (of Schering AG, Germany) LB6 SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT WITH IFN- /H92521B IN RR MS PATIENTS IS ASSOCI- ATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF IFN- /H9252is now widely used for treatment of MS, its mode of action still remains unclear; recent studies do not support a shift in the Th1/Th2 balance. In vitro studies show that type I interferons induce the differentiation of Tregulatory-1 (Tr1) cells andthe survival of CD4 +CD25+T cells, which are both recently described suppressor T cells able to produce IL-10.Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether IFN- /H92521b therapy induces IL-10 in a general fashion or in a specific (regulatory) T -cell subset only. In addition, it was eval-uated whether differential effects on IL-10 production by peripheral blood monocytes, CD4 + or CD8+T cells could be correlated with efcacy of IFN- /H92521b treatment. Methods: Based on EDSS-progression and the number of relapses and steroid interventions in the 2 years before initiation of IFN- /H92521b treatment compared with those in the 2 years after initiation of treatment, 24 RR MS patients were classied as responders (15) and non-responders (9). Using intracellular cytokine staining techniques, the effect of IFN- /H92521b after 0, 3 and 6 months of treatment was studied on the number of IL-10 producing CD8 +T cells, CD4+(CD25+) monocytes. Results: Numbers of IL-10 producing CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased prior to treatment. Remarkably, after 3 and 6 months of treatment a signicant increase in the num-ber of such T cells could be found in the clinical responders only. In contrast, treatmentdecreased numbers of IL-10 producing monocytes in both responders and nonrespondersand did not affect numbers of CD8 +T cells that produced IL-10. In a subgroup of the respon- ders (7 out of 15), the effect of IFN- /H92521b treatment was also studied on CD4+CD25+T cells. Notably, a signicant increase in the number of IL-10 producing CD4+CD25+T cells could be observed after 6 months of treatment.Conclusions: Enhancement of the number of CD4 +CD25+T cells that produce IL-10 may be an important mechanism in the therapeutic effect of IFN- /H9252in RR MS.

Furthermore, the systematic collection of data on large cohorts ofconsecutive patients may help to correlate clinical information with basic research.Althoughthe development of database programs to monitor MS patients started almost thirty yearsago, no single application has gained widespread use so far.Objectives: T o develop a modular electronic patient record supporting both the daily care of patients and the collection of specic information on MS.Methods: MSDS is a SQL (structured query language) database.A multilingual (German, Eng- lish; Italian and Spanish in preparation), graphical user interface allows easy data input andoutput. Client-server architecture optimizes MSDS for using it in local area networks.Results: Since its introduction in 12/2001, MSDS has been distributed to 25 hospitals (16 universities).Through MSDS users recorded and managed visiting dates, patient history (com-plaints, relapses), physical examination ndings, and results of blood and CSF chemistry, evokedpotentials and MRI. MS diagnosis can be specied according to criteria by Poser (applied auto-matically), by McDonald and by Lublin/Reingold. Clinical scores calculated by MSDS comprisethe EDSS, the MSFC, and the Scripps NRS. In general, data input is standardized (pull-downmenus).Whenever required, specific details can be added as free text. Data consistency iscontrolled by internal check mechanisms. Multiple reports describe the individual diseasecourse, as well as the local patient population. In addition to these built-in features, individ-ual queries can be designed to retrieve specic information. Correspondence to practition-ers is supported by MSDS.Additional features include a pedigree generator, a bio-sample data-base and a study-protocol editor.T o support the building of a national MS registry, the presentversion of MSDS automatically keeps a consensus minimal data set of each patient up-to-date. Current users have found MSDS user-friendly and well suited to accurately describe theclinical aspects of MS.Conclusions: MSDS may provide an improved platform for clinical documentation of MS and facilitate international standardization.
