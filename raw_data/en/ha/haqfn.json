As a reminder, Biological Chemistry is one of six basic science departments in a medical school with now 26 different departments and two new ones (Cardiovascular Surgery and Bioinformat - ics) due to be instituted soon. We currently have 47 faculty with appointments in Biological Chemistry all of whom have shared responsibilities for teaching graduate, medical and undergraduate students. The Department averages about 35 graduate students in the Biological Chemistry Ph.D. program as well as having about 20 students from the Cellular and Mo - lecular Biology, Chemical Biology, Bioinformatics and Biophysics Ph.D. programs. There are also about 50 postdoctoral scientists, 10 laboratory staff and an ad - ministrative staff of eight. In addition to our doctoral program and the Med - ical School \"M1\" curriculum, Biological Chemistry teaches many classes in the allied health elds. In - cluded is BC212, which primarily serves Nursing stu - dents and has an enrollment of over 200. In addition, our faculty teach in the undergraduate Biochemis - try concentration (BC452 Lecture) in the Chemistry Department. The Department also teaches a popu - lar one semester general biochemistry course BC415. Demand for BC415 is so strong that last year we in - creased to three the number of BC415 sections. The total enrollment approaches 700. There have been several faculty comings and go - ings this year. Dr. Yang Zhang, who has his primary appointment in the Center for Computational Medi - cine and Biology, was appointed as an Associate Pro - fessor in the Department last spring. Yang and his laboratory are famously successful in developing algorithms for protein structure predictions. He and his group were ranked No. 1 in both pro - tein structure and function prediction among more than 200 groups in the most recent international competition (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/). Dr. Daniel Southworth has recently been appointed to a tenure track appointment as an Assistant Profes - sor in Biological Chemistry with a research track ap - pointment in the Life Sciences Institute. Most recent - ly, Dan received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins and did postdoctoral studies at UCSF. He plans to apply struc - tural biology techniques including cryo-EM to under - stand the structure and function of p53. Three faculty took other positions this year. Dan Bochar moved to the Cayman Chemical Company in Ann Arbor, Ran - dy Kaufman moved to the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in La Jolla, and Matt Young is now a Research Assistant Professor in Pharmacology. We are pleased that Dan and Randy retain adjunct ap - pointments in the department. Our faculty continue to be involved in extramural service activities. For example, Ruma Banerjee is on the ASBMB Council, Janet Smith continues as Direc - tor of the NIGMS X-ray Beamline at APS/Argonne Na - tional Laboratories, David Engelke is a Deputy Editor of RNA , and Jochen Schacht is a Section Editor for Au- diology & Neurotology . Several faculty have also received signicant awards this year. Alex Ninfa was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, Ming Lei received the Dean's Basic Science Research Award, Jerry Menon was named recipient of the EBS/Bio - logical Chemistry Teaching Award and Carol Fierke A Letter from the Chair : Dr. William L. Smith 3dy Center. More recently, he instigated a program in Chicago for alumni from various basic science de - partments. I attended this event and was particular - ly delighted to meet Dr. Evelyn T yner ('51 Ph.D.) who now lives in Glenview, Illinois. She had been a stu - dent with H.B. Lewis, who was head of the depart - ment between 1921 and 1954. One other thing I would like to mention is that Myrna Weissman, the widow of Marshall Nirenberg, recently donated copies of his notebooks and papers relating to his Nobel Prize work in determining the genetic code. These materials are now prominent - ly displayed in a beautiful case located in the atrium of the new A. Alfred Taubman Biomedical Science Re - search Building (BSRB). Best wishes for the upcoming year. Please stay in touch (smithww @umich.edu), and I will ensure that all the relevant information is included in next year's newsletter. Alternatively, you can send us an update at the Alumni and Friends page of our BioChem web - site (www.biochem.med.umich.edu/?q=alumni_reg). will receive the 2012 Repligen Award in Chemistry of Biological Processes from the American Chemical Society. In the coming year we plan to recruit a new Assis - tant Professor. To that end we have formulated a fac - ulty-led committee headed by Dave Engelke to look for candidates who would complement our current strengths particularly in the areas of protein pro - cessing and folding, regulation of gene expression and biochemical signaling. We have been negotiat - ing with a senior candidate for the endowed Anthony and Lillian Lu Professorship and are hopeful that this will be successful. Something I have been very pleased about has been the success of our endowed lectureships. We now have four of these lectureships named for cur - rent or former faculty, including the William E.M. Lands Lecture in the Biochemical Basis for the Phys - iology of Essential Nutrients, the Irwin J. Goldstein Lecture in Glycobiology, the Martha L. Ludwig Lecture in Structural Biology and the G. Robert Greenberg Lecture in Biological Chemistry. The lecturers are se - lected by our Seminar Committee from nominations made by faculty or, in the specic case of the Green - berg Lecture, from student nominations. For exam - ple, the Ludwig Lecturer this fall is Venki Ramakrish - nan, who shared the Nobel Prize in Biology and Medicine in 2009 for his work on the ribosome struc - ture. Having our students and faculty be able to inter - act with world class scientists is a very important as - pect of Departmental activities. The visibility of these lectures also serves to highlight the importance of the Department of Biological Chemistry to others in the University. These lectureships have come about as a result of selfless contributions from donors and have now become a key part of our Department. With respect to philanthropy Mr. Greg Witbeck con - tinues to be a very effective and dedicated develop - ment ofcer for Biological Chemistry and other ba - sic science departments. In this role, he has staffed alumni reunions, assisted with our newsletter and generally engaged in developing a culture of giving within the Department. For example, in April of this year, Greg hosted a Biological Chemistry/Pharmacol - ogy alumni dinner in Washington D.C. at the Kenne - In this IssuePhilanthropy at Work, Gifts 4 Minor J.

Every year for more than 20 years, he and his wife, Dr. Cheryl Janson, have giv - en generously to the department in support of a va - riety of initiatives, including the endowment for the Martha L. Ludwig Professorship in Protein Structure and Function and the endowment for the Biological Chemistry Graduate Student Program, as well as pro - viding unrestricted gifts to the department. Dr. Smith graduated with a Ph.D. from the Depart - ment of Biological Chemistry in 1977, working in the laboratory of Dr. Martha Ludwig. The title of his the - sis was The crystal structure and renement of clostridi - um MP flavodoxin in the semiquinone state and some com - parisons of the protein in the oxidized, semiquinone and fully reduced states. Following graduation, Dr. Smith conducted postdoctoral research at the Universi - ty of California, Los Angeles. He currently works at the National Institutes of Health, where he is chief of the Structural Genomics and Proteomics Technology Branch at NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences. His responsibilities include directing the Protein Structure Initiative, a $270 million program to elucidate the structure and function of protein mol - ecules. Dr. Smith previously worked as a structur - al scientist at Agouron Pharmaceuticals, served as an associate director in the Department of Structural Bi - ology at GlaxoSmithKline and worked as a protein crystallographer in the Biosciences Division at Ar - gonne National Laboratory. In this issue of the Biological Chemistry newsletter, we ask Dr. Smith to reflect on his time at the Univer - sity of Michigan and his and Cheryl's long history of giving to the department. When did you rst decide to make a donation to the De - partment of Biological Chem - istry? What prompted the decision? Cheryl and I both ben - eted from graduate ed - ucations at Big 10 institutions (Cheryl holds a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin). Once we were working, we felt it was the right thing to do to repay those institutions in a small way for the opportunities we received. Why have you consistently donated to the Department of Biological Chemistry over the years? Are there particular causes that appeal more to you than others? I wanted to give to the Department in preference to the University; I feel more of an attachment to the Department than to the University. Giving to the Department seemed the best way to benet the graduate students in the Department of Biological Chemistry. What effect do you hope your donations will have? I hope to help the students in ways that are other - wise difcult to fund, such as speaker programs, sci - ence retreats and enhancements to the department library. How did your studies at UM prepare you for a career in bi - ological chemistry? At UM, I learned what is now called structural biol - ogy in the early days of the science. As I've continued to work in this eld, I've also learned that being able to work at something you enjoy is an invaluable gift. I have always felt fortunate to have a career, rather than merely a job. \" 5What is your fondest memory of your time at UM? As a student, being able to pursue the science that I enjoyed with relatively few other distractions is one of the things I have come to appreciate. What words of advice do you have for the department's graduate students and newly-minted PhD's? Pursue your passion. Choose your path based on what truly excites you. Supporting BioChem The Department of Biological Chemistry relies upon the philanthropic generosity of donors to fund many aspects of its operations. Gift funds are essential to supporting ac - tivities beyond our basic operations. From endowed profes - sorships and lectureships, to graduate student fellowships, seminar speakers, and gifts in direct support of research, donations help make the department an intellectually ex - citing and vibrant community.

Coon : A Celebratory Symposium On Friday, July 15th, the Department hosted a Cel - ebratory Symposium in Palm - er Commons that honored the career and 90th birth - day of Professor Minor \"Jud\" Coon. The Symposium marked his 56-year career in our Department, his seminal contributions in characterizing the func - tions of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, and his mentoring of an impressive cadre of highly suc - cessful scientists. The Symposium's speakers included students, postdoctoral fellows, and scientists who trained with Professor Coon and have gone on to distin - guished careers in ac - ademia and industry. Chairman William Smith and Professor Paul Hollen - berg, Chair of the Depart - ment of Pharmacology, opened the Symposium with brief remarks about Professor Coon's research career, history with the Department, and service in various professional organizations, including his term as President of the American Society for Biochemistry and Mo - lecular Biology (ASBMB) from 1991-1992. Following the opening remarks, Dr. Henry Strobel (Professor of Biochemis - try at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center) presented the rst research talk that described the role of Cytochrome P450 4F in the response to trau - matic brain injury. Next, Dr. Aln Vaz (Associate Re - search Fellow at Pzer Inc.) described his work on utilizing isotope effects in enzyme kinetics and phar - macokinetics and the application of this approach to studying drug metabolism in animal model sys - tems. Dr. Xinxin Ding (Professor of Molecular Genet - ics, Neuroscience, and Toxicology in the Departments of Biomedical Sciences and Environmental Health Sciences at the State University of New York at Al - bany, and also Chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Toxicology and Assis - tant Director of the Di - vision of Environmen - tal Health Sciences at the New York State De - partment of Health's Wadsworth Center) then discussed his re - search on mouse ge - netic studies of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and the involvement of various cytochrome P450 iso - forms in lung cancer. After a short break, the talks re - sumed with Dr. Edward Morgan (Professor of Phar - macology at Emory University), who presented his research on the post-transcriptional regulation of various cytochrome P450 isoforms by nitric oxide and how this signaling pathway controls P450 protein I am very grateful to Bill Smith and his organizing committee , including Dave Ballou, Paul Hollenberg, and Yoichi Osawa, with Amanda How - ard, who carried out the plan, for the superb sympo - sium held last July. Many of my former students and postdoctoral associates, some from as far back as 1955, joined us, including six who were ne speakers. As I have often said, despite its size the University of Michigan is exceptional in the ease of collaboration throughout the campus. Whatever success we may have had in our research over many years was great - ly aided by such collaborations with our colleagues in other departments. This tradition will continue be a great asset to the U of M in the years ahead. Minor J. Coon. . . and a Note from Jud: 7Finally, Dr. Ronald Estabrook (Emeritus Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Texas Southwest - ern Medical Center) concluded the talks with a hu - morous and heartfelt recollection of his travels and adventures with Professor Coon and the many hats that he wore throughout his life. In the evening after the Symposium, a reception and dinner was held in Professor Coon's honor at the Michigan Union. Among the guests were members of Jud's family, the Symposium's participants, Depart - ment faculty, and University of Michigan President stability and turnover in cells. Professor Paul Hollen - berg then described structural and functional stud - ies of cytochrome P450 mechanism-based inhibitors and their application as active site probes for vari - ous P450 isoforms. Dr. Fred Guengerich (Professor of Biochemistry at Vanderbilt University) then provided a historical retrospective of Professor Coon's career and accomplishments in the cytochrome P450 eld, dating from his rst research article on microsom - al P450 that he co-authored with Dr. Anthony Lu in the Journal of Biologi - cal Chemistry in 1968. Dr. Guengerich then went on to discuss his own research into functions of the cy - tochrome P450 fami - ly in 8Mary who presented a brief address highlighting Professor Coon's scientic accomplish - ments and contributions to the University communi - ty (see page 9). The dinner concluded the Symposium celebrating Professor Coon's remarkable career as an outstanding scientist and mentor to a generation of biochemists who continue to make important strides in understanding the functions of cytochrome P450, which he likes to call Nature's Most Versatile Biologi - cal Catalyst. Remarks by President Mary Sue Coleman at the Symposium Dinner for Dr. Minor J. Coon I am so happy that my schedule would make it possible for me to attend this dinner this evening, in honor of a sci - entist that I have admired for decades. During my graduate work at UNC-Chapel Hill, I was of course fa - miliar with the ground-breaking work of Jud Coon in devising an elegant process to purify a soluble en - zymatically active form of p450. The work in this area really took off after his classic JBC paper with Anthony Lu was published. Perhaps I was par - ticularly interested in this work because one of my graduate school classmates, Henry Strobel, was going to Ann Arbor for a postdoctoral position with Jud. I heard a lot during that time about the Coon laborato - ry in Ann Arbor, especially since I was headed in the opposite direction to the University of Texas (as I re - call, we probably talked a lot about weather). Never then, could I have imagined that I would at this point in my career be entering my tenth year as president of the University of Michigan, where Jud Coon has made so many stand-alone dis - coveries and been so important for the University in the eld of P450 research \u2014 and maybe it's a bit ironic now that Henry is in Texas. As you all know, Jud was recruited to UM in 1955 where he quickly es - tablished a vibrant and exciting research laboratory. As his own work became more important and influ - ential, he took on the sometimes onerous task of be - ing the department Chair, and he stayed in the role for twenty years \u2014 that is a remarkable service to the University. He served the biochemistry community also in numerous ways, and has been honored many times over. Jud, you deserve every single one of those awards, and more. We are deeply honored that you made the Univer - sity of Michigan your home for so many years, and we are thrilled to honor you in the month of your 90th birthday. May you experience many, many more. Congratulations. A Brief Biography of Minor J. \"Jud\" Coon Jud Coon was born and grew up in the Denver, Colorado area. After nishing public schools there, he enrolled at the University of Colo - rado, Boulder, where he became interested in chem - istry and biochemistry, working with Professor Reu - ben Gustavson. In 1943 he entered graduate studies in Biochemistry at the University of Illinois, with 9Professor William C. Rose as his mentor. His thesis work dealt with the essential amino acids, a topic he would continue to pursue following his graduation (1946) in his rst faculty position at the Universi - ty of Pennsylvania in the Department of Physiologi - cal Chemistry (1947-1955). In 1955 Jud Coon moved to the Department of Biological Chemistry at the Uni - versity of Michigan, where he has spent the remain - der of his career and is still involved. He was Chair of the depart - ment from 1970 to 1990 and is now the Victor C. Vaughan Dis - tinguished Uni - versity Profes - sor, Emeritus. His sabbatical leaves were at New York University with Professor Severo Ochoa and at the ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in Z\u00fcrich with Professor Vladimir Prelog. In the course of his research on the catabolism of amino acids and then fatty acids, Professor Coon be - came interested in the mechanism of chemically dif - cult oxidations of these molecules. This work devel - oped into consideration of the omega oxygenation of fatty acids and alkanes, ultimately leading to his suc - cess with his dedicated associates in separating P450 from liver microsomal membranes and reconstitut - ing catalytic activity. Enzyme purication provided unambiguous proof that multiple forms of P450 ex - ist in animals. Other prominent contributions of his group in the eld of P450 includ - ed studies on the isolation of oth - er P450s, mech - anisms of P450 gene regulation, and heterolo - gous expression of mammali - an P450s. Some of the most important contributions by Jud Coon were in the area of the catalytic mecha - nisms of NADPH-P450 reductase and P450, establish - ing an iron-bound oxygen as the powerful oxidant and the radi - cal nature of the reactions. An - other major re - search accom - plishment was establishing the stoichiometry of oxygen re - duction. New transformations of chemicals by P450s in humans, animals, and plants, including drug metabolism, con - tinue to abound and will continue to occupy P450 re - searchers seeking to rationalize these enzymes in the context of the insights advanced by the work of Jud Coon and his students. In addition to his research contributions, Profes - sor Coon has enhanced science in many other ways. Many current inves - tigators in the eld trained with him. He served as President of the American So - ciety for Biochemis - try and Molecular Bi - ology (1991-1992). In addition, he chaired the advisory commit - tees for two of the leading international meetings in this eld, the Cytochrome P450 Meetings, and Mi - crosomes and Drug Oxidations, for over twenty years. In recognition of his research, Jud Coon received the American Chemical Soci - ety Award in En - zyme Chemistry in 1959, the Distinguished Faculty Continued on p. 27 10In Memoriam : Saul Roseman 1921-2011 Some of his most important discoveries were the result of insightful thinking about chance observations. Saul Roseman, a pioneer in the eld of glycobiolo - gy, died on July 2, 2011 , ending a distinguished career that spanned nearly seven de - cades. At the time of his death at age ninety, he had only recently transitioned to Professor Emeritus sta - tus but still maintained an active research group at The Johns Hopkins University. Among his many sci - entic contributions, Roseman published the rst correct structure of sialic acid, discovered its nucle - otide sugar donor CMP-sialic acid, elucidated the bio - synthetic pathways of glucosamine and the sial - ic acids, demonstrated glycosyltransferase activities in tissues and fluids and discovered and character - ized the important, widely distributed phosphotrans - ferase transport system (PTS) present in procaryotes. Roseman was considered a master of serendipity. Some of his most important discoveries were the re - sult of insightful thinking about chance observa - tions. He relished this characterization as evidence of a sharp intellect, an unyielding eye for data, and an open-minded, enthusiastic approach to science. He once said \"The unexpected is just Nature's way of telling researchers where to look for the really in - teresting and important stuff.\" Certainly, his scientif - ic career was marked by interesting and important discoveries. Roseman attended City College of New York where he majored in Chemistry and double minored in Physics and Biology, three disciplines that served him well throughout his long, productive scientif - ic career. He completed his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in 1947 under the mentorship of Karl Paul Link where he worked primarily on the chemistry and metabo - lism of coumarins. Although his graduate work in - cluded some carbohydrate chemistry, it was during his postdoctoral years at the University of Chicago in the laboratory of Albert Dorfman, where he studied glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and degradation, that his career in Glycobiology started in earnest. His studies on hyaluronic acid biosynthesis brought him to the attention of the Rackham Arthritis Unit at the University of Michigan Medical School where in 1953 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry. At Michigan, Roseman initially studied the inter - mediary metabolism of hexosamines. These efforts ultimately led to his now classical studies on the me - tabolism of the sialic acids. He and a postdoctoral fellow Don Comb (who later founded New England Biolabs) were studying \"NAN-aldolase,\" a bacteri - al enzyme that cleaves sialic acids into two compo - nents. Unexpectedly, they discovered that one of the products was not consistent with the then well-es - tablished structure of sialic acid published previously by other research groups. Comb and Roseman rigor - ously characterized the reaction products, crystal - lized the hexosamine fragment and unambiguous - ly established that the hexosamine fragment was N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and not N-acetyl-D-glu - cosamine as previously suggested. This nding led to their publication of the rst correct structure of the sialic acid(s). This nding rmly established Roseman as a major contributor to the eld of complex carbo - hydrates, the forerunner of modern glycobiology. The years following the discovery of the struc - tures of the sialic acids were remarkably productive for the Roseman laboratory. They established the en -Biological Chemistry Faculty, 1953-1965 11zymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of the sialic acids, discovered CMP-sialic acid, the nu - cleotide sugar donor for sialylation, and determined pathways for hexosamine biosynthesis. During a summer sabbatical in 1961 in Vancouver in the labo - ratory of Nobel laureate H. G. Khorana, Roseman de - vised an improved method to synthesize nucleotide sugars. The ready availability of these compounds enabled the Roseman laboratory and other laborato - ries worldwide to study the biochemistry of glycosyl - transferases and pathways of glycoprotein and glyco - lipid biosynthesis. In an unexpected foray into a completely new area of research, Roseman's group discovered a multi-pro - tein bacterial transport system. The laboratory was studying the biosynthesis of N-acetyl mannosamine 6-phosphate, an intermediate in sialic acid biosyn - thesis in E. coli. It was anticipated that that the phos - phorylation of acetylmannosamine would be ATP- mediated. However, as controls, other potential high energy donors including phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) were added. Surprisingly, the bacteria failed to trans - fer phosphate from ATP but efciently transferred phosphate from PEP. That single observation led to the discovery of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS), a pathway widely distributed in pro - caryotes including many pathogens. Subsequently at Hopkins, Roseman and his team vigorously explored the biochemistry, biophysics and biology of this fasci - nating, versatile multi-protein sugar-nutrient trans - port system. In 1965, Roseman accepted a Professorship in the Biology Department at Johns Hopkins University where he continued studies on glycosyl transferas - es, the PTS system, and initiated new avenues of re - search concerned with the roles of glycans in cell- cell adhesion and chitin metabolism in Vibrio and other bacteria. During this time he also served as Chairman of the Department of Biology (1969-1973, 1988-1990). At the time of his death, his laboratory was continuing to study a potent hepatocyte adhe - sion molecule and the role of chitin metabolism for biofuel production. Throughout his career Roseman's approach to sci - ence \u2014 his own and that of others \u2014 was remarkably focused and enthusiastic. Whether he was discuss - ing the latest data with his research team, hosting a visitor in his ofce, or attending a seminar or a sym - posium, he was always fully engaged and seeking the essence of the science being presented. He was fa - mous for his keen criticism, and often would raise key alternative interpretations or controls for consid - eration. Although the laser beam of his intellect was unblinking, his goal always was to advance knowl - edge and further discovery, pursuits that he truly loved. This philosophy was rmly instilled into his many students and associates. Roseman's contributions are well-appreciated by the scientic community. His many honors in - clude induction into the National Academy of Sci - ences (1972), an honorary Doctor of Medicine from the University of Lund (1984), and the Karl Meyer Award from the Society for Glycobiology (1993). A col - lection of reviews was published in his honor in the rst volume of Glycobiology in November, 1991. In ad - dition, the Journal of Biological Chemistry honored him with a Centennial biography, \"Hexosamine Metabo - lism, Sialic Acids, and The Phosphotransferase Sys - tem: Saul Roseman's Contributions to Glycobiology\" in 2006. In the introduction to the glycobiology issue in his honor, Roseman reminisced at length about \"the way it was,\" remarking on the sparse attendance at the complex carbohydrate sessions at national meet - ings early in his career. He noted that the sessions were typically scheduled on the last afternoon of the week-long meetings, and recalled one session in which \"... the chairman introduced me and excused himself because he had a 'train to make'. The audi - ence in that case consisted of the last speaker on the program and the slide projectionist.\" Saul Roseman's persistence and pioneering efforts have contributed meaningfully to the emergence of glycobiology as a vigorous discipline. 12Jerry Menon was the recipient of the University of Michigan Medical School's Endowment for Basic Sci - ence Teaching Award for Biologi - cal Chemistry. Dr. Menon was recog - nized for his many years of teaching excellence in Biol Chem 415 and the medical student M1 curriculum. Alex Ninfa was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in recognition of his stud - ies into the signal transduction mechanisms of bac - teria and into the functions of ge - netic networks using a synthetic biology approach. The American Academy of Microbiology is the honoric leadership group with - in the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). Only about seventy-ve fellows are elected to the Amer - ican Academy of Microbiology each year through a highly selective, peer-review process, based on their records of scientic achievement and original contri - butions that have advanced microbiology. Georgios Skiniotis was named a 2011 Pew Scholar. Pew Scholars are early to mid-career scientists. They receive a $240,000 award over four years to support and expand their research, as well as to foster col - laboration and connection through the exchange of ideas with other stellar scientists. Skiniotis uses electron cryomicros - copy (Cryo-EM) to obtain the 3D ar - chitecture of complex and dynamic protein assemblies. A main theme in his lab is the structural biology of signaling cell membrane receptors, which play essential roles in regulating every aspect of normal physiology.

She will serve in this capacity with Internet2 until July 2012. Carol Fierke will receive the 2012 Repligen Corporation Award for Chemistry of Biological Processes \"in rec - ognition of her contributions to our broad understanding of how protein and nucleic acid catalysts achieve high efciency with rigorous con - trol of reaction specicity,\" and \"sig - nicant contributions to our view of metal ion homeo - stasis in cells.\" The Repligen Award is administered by the Division of Biological Chemistry of the American Chemical Society. Ming Lei received the University of Michigan Medical School's Basic Sci - ence Research Award for his research in the areas of telomere protection and regulation, small molecular in - hibitors of the interaction between single-stranded te - lomeric DNA and its binding protein POT1, and molec - ular mechanisms of histone demethylase. 13 Daniel Southworth, Ph.D. The Department is pleased to announce that Dr. Daniel South - worth has joined the faculty as an As - sistant Professor of Biological Chemis - try and a Research Assistant Professor in the Life Sciences Institute. Dr. Southworth received his Ph.D. in 2004 from Johns Hopkins University under the guidance of Pro - fessor Rachel Green, where he studied essential mechanisms of the protein translation machinery. He developed key single-turnover kinetic and in vitro translation assays to determine how the tRNA:mRNA complex ratchets through the ribosome during the translocation step. He discovered that ribosomal pro - teins S12 and S13 act as critical control elements while the translocation mechanism is inherently driven by the ribosomal RNA. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Southworth joined Pro - fessor David Agard's lab at the University of Califor - nia, San Francisco to study the structure and function of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) molecular chap - erone. He achieved several 3-D structures of Hsp90 from different organisms and in different confor - mational states. This work revealed a 3-state nucle - otide cycle that is universal in E. coli , yeast and human Hsp90s and identied unique conformational equi - libria that are tailored to the different organisms. He has further determined a 15 \u00c5 cryo-EM structure of the human Hsp90:Hop complex that identies a novel substrate loading conformation of Hsp90. At the University of Michigan, Dr. Southworth plans to study the mechanisms of molecular chaperone- mediated turnover, activation and signal transduc - tion of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. He will ex - pand his in vitro assembly system and use cryo-EM methods principally in determining structures of macromolecular Hsp90:p53 complexes trapped in dis - tinct stages of degradation and activation pathways. These approaches will generate tremendous mecha - nistic insight about how protein interaction networks drive decisions that are critical to cellular growth and maintenance. Yang Zhang, Ph.D. The Department of Biological Chemistry is also pleased to an - nounce the joint appointment of Yang Zhang, Ph.D. as an Associate Professor without tenure. Dr. Zhang also holds an appointment as Asso - ciate Professor with tenure in the Center for Compu - tational Medicine and Bioinformatics. In 1996, Dr. Zhang earned his Ph.D. in Physics un - der the direction of Professor Lianshou Liu at Cen - tral China Normal University in Wuhan, China. As an Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow, he performed his postdoctoral training in the Phys - ics Department at Free University Berlin in Germa - ny from 1996 through 1998. Dr. Zhang has also held postdoctoral appointments at the Institute of Theo - retical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China and at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis. Under the mentorship of Professor Jerry Skolnick, Dr. Zhang was appoint - ed as Research Associate in the Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics at the University of Buffalo in Oc - tober of 2002. In August of 2005 Dr. Zhang was ap - pointed as Assistant Professor in the Center for Bio - informatics, Department of Molecular Biosciences at the University of Kansas, and was promoted to As - sociate Professor with tenure just three years later. In September of 2009, Dr. Zhang became an Associ - ate Professor with tenure here at the University of Michigan. Dr. Zhang's research interests include biophysics, structural and chemical informatics, and proteomics, as well as systemic modeling and systems biology. His laboratory focuses on developing bioinformatics approaches to predict the three-dimensional struc - tures of proteins from amino acid sequences and from there to deduce the biological functions based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm. His group is especially interested in the structures of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and their inter - actions with ligands. A long-range goal is to develop new drugs to regulate these interactions.

Goldstein Lectureship in Glycobiology Pamela Stanley, Ph.D. Regulation of Notch Signaling by Glycans during Embryogenesis and T Cell Development Pamela Stanley obtained her Ph.D. in the laborato - ry of Prof. David White, Department of Microbiolo - gy, University of Melbourne, Australia. She was subse - quently a postdoctoral fel - low of the MRC of Canada in the lab of Dr. Louis Simino - vitch where she began her work on somatic cell glyco - sylation mutants. She was appointed Assistant Professor in Cell Biology at Al - bert Einstein College of Medicine in New York in 1977 and became a full Professor in 1986. She currently holds the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation Chair in Cell Biology and is Associate Director for Laboratory Research of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center. Dr. Pamela Stanley's lab investigates biological functions of mammalian glycans on glycoproteins, such as growth factor and Notch receptors. Certain glycans are required for mam - mals to develop, and changes in the glycans of cancer cells facili - tate tumor progression. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mu - tants in glycan synthesis help to identify novel glycosylation ac - tivities, functions of mammali - an glycans in cell-cell and cell-pathogen recognition and transduction, and for glycosylation engi - neering. CHO mutants were used to show that Notch receptors require O-fu - cose glycans to func - tion. Embryos that can - not transfer fucose to Notch die before birth with a phenotype typ - ical of embryos defective in global Notch signaling. This includes defective formation of the heart and defective vascularization of the yolk sac and embryo. Most recently, a knock-in Notch1 mutation was made to eliminate the single O-fucose site in the Notch1 li - gand binding domain. Mouse mutants with this point mutation are viable and fertile but have a T cell de - velopment defect. In addition, a vascularization de - fect becomes apparent when the Notch1 point mu - tant gene is present in only a single copy. These and other Notch1 mouse mutants are being used to pin - point roles for glycans in Notch signaling during em - bryogenesis and immune cell development. 2010 William E.M. Lands Lectureship on the Biochemical Basis for the Physiology of Essential Nutrients Patrick J. Stover, Ph.D. Folate-Genome Interactions: Managing Gene Expression and Genome Stability Patrick J. Stover, Ph.D. is Pro - fessor and Director of the Division of Nutritional Sci - ences at Cornell Universi - ty and Director of the Unit - ed Nation's University Food and Nutrition Program for Social & Human Develop - ment. He graduated from Noted speakers add vitality and prestige to the Department of Biological ChemistryBill Lands and Irwin Goldstein17Saint Joseph's University with a B.S. degree in Chem - istry and was awarded the Molloy Chemistry Award at graduation. He received a Ph.D. degree in Bio - chemistry and Molecular Biophysics from the Medi - cal College of Virginia and performed his postdoctor - al studies in Nutritional Sciences at the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Patrick J. Stover's laboratory studies the bio - chemical, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the relationships between folic acid and hu - man pathologies including neural tube defects & other developmen - tal anomalies, car - diovascular disease and cancer. Specif - ic interests include the regulation of fo - late-mediated one- carbon metabolism and cellular methylation reactions, molecular ba - sis of the fetal origins hypothesis, development of mouse models to elucidate mechanisms of folate-re - lated pathologies, and translational control of gene expression by ferritin. In 1996 he received the Pres - idential Early Career Award for Scientists and En - gineers from President Clinton, the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on outstanding sci - entists and engineers beginning their independent careers. He received the ERL Stokstad Award in Nu - tritional Biochemistry from the American Society for Nutritional Sciences in 1999 and has been select - ed as an Outstanding Educator four times by Cornell Merrill Presidential Scholars. He is a current mem - ber of the National Academies of Sciences' Food and Nutrition Board. He serves on the editorial board for the Annual Reviews of Nutrition , the Journal of Biological Chemistry and the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2011 G. Robert Greenberg Lectureship in Biological Chemistry Dorothee Kern, Ph.D. Choreographing an Enzyme's Dorothee Kern, Ph.D. is Professor of Biochemistry at Brandeis University and an Investigator of the How -ard Hughes Medical Institute. She received her Ph.D. at the Martin Luther University in Halle, Germany and then carried out her postdoctoral studies at UC Berkeley. She joined the fac - ulty at Brandeis University in 1999. Dr. Kern's research group studies the dynamical na - ture of proteins with the goal to reveal the interplay between structure, dynam - ics and function. She has been a major contributor in the experimental characterization of protein dynam - ics during enzyme catalysis and signaling. With the unprecedented wealth of high-resolution protein structures churned out by x-ray crystallogra - phers in the last two decades, it might be easy for a structural biologist to develop a sense of complacen - cy. Not so with Dorothee Kern, who sees a real oppor - tunity to augment these otherwise static structural images with new studies designed to reveal what she calls the \"dynamic personality\" of enzymes, signal - ing proteins, and the substrates that they affect. Only through such dynamic studies, Kern argues, will re - searchers develop a realistic picture of how proteins function. Dr. Kern is com - bining nuclear mag - netic crystallog raphy, computation and single molecule experiments as tool. NMR, which relies on magnetic elds and radio waves, is capable of ob - serving the motion of the atoms inside functioning proteins. Dr. Kern is the recipient of the Pzer Award in En - zyme Chemistry from the American Chemical So - ciety, the Dayhoff Award from the Biophysical Soci - ety, the Young Investigator Award of the International Association for Protein Structure Analysis and Pro - teomics, the Strage Award for Aspiring Young Science 18 Her many honors include the U.S. Steel Founda - tion Award in Molecular Biology (1982), the Nation - al Medal of Science (1986), the Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award (2002), the FASEB Excel - lence in Science Award (2003), the RNA Society Lifetime Achievement Award (2004), E.B. Wilson Medal (2005), Gairdner Foundation Interna - tional Award (2006), and Al - bany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Re - search (2008) [shared with Elizabeth Blackburn].

Ludwig Lectureship in Structural Biology Joan Steitz, Ph.D. Noncoding RNAs: With a Viral Twist Joan A. Steitz, Ph.D. is the Sterling Professor of Molec - ular Biophysics and Biochemistry, and Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the National Acad - emy of Sciences, and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Steitz earned her Ph.D. from Harvard University. Dr. Joan A. Steitz earned her B.S. in chemistry from Antioch College in 1963. Signicant ndings from her work emerged as early as 1967, when her Har - vard University Ph.D. thesis with Jim Watson exam - ined the test-tube assembly of an RNA bacteriophage known as R17. Steitz spent the next three years in postdoctoral studies at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, where she used early methods for determining the biochemical sequence of RNA to study how ribosomes know where to initiate protein syn - thesis on bacterial mR - NAs. In 1970, she was appointed as an assis - tant professor of mo - lecular biophysics and biochem istry at Yale, becoming a full profes - sor in 1978. At Yale, she established a laboratory ded - icated to the study of RNA structure and function. In 1979, Steitz and her colleagues described a group of cellular particles called small nuclear ribonucleopro - teins (snRNPs), a breakthrough in understanding how RNA is spliced. Subsequently, her laboratory has de - ned the structures and functions of other noncoding RNPs, such as those that guide the modication of ri - bosomal RNAs and several produced by transforming herpesviruses. Today, her studies of noncoding RNAs include microRNAs. Distinguished Graduate Lecture: Beverly L. Davidson Beverly L. Davidson holds the Roy J.

Organisms were challenged signicant - ly by O2, which can disrupt the normal flow of elec - trons in metabolism and produces oxygen species that are highly destructive to biochemicals. Organ - isms had to adapt to these new selective pressures by controlling oxygen reactivity with cellular com - ponents. This was especially true for flavin prosthet - ic groups. Flavin-dependent enzymes participate in all aspects of cellular physiology. Some flavin-depen - dent enzymes have evolved to be less reactive with oxygen than free flavins, affording kinetic protection. In contrast, many flavin-dependent enzymes - the oxidases and monooxygenases - evolved to use O2 as a substrate and, therefore, react more quickly than free flavins. Despite a signicant amount of research, how proteins control the reaction of O2 with reduced flavoenzymes, is not fully understood. Recent work from alumna Marilyn Schuman- Jorns (Ph.D. Biological Chemistry, Massey, 1970) at Drexel University suggests that a positive charge near N5 of the isollaxazine of flavoenzymes makes them more reactive with O2. Professor Jorns showed that mutating a lysine to a neutral residue caused re -activity with O2 to plummet. The hy - pothetical site of reactivity of oxy - gen near the flavin is illustrated by the O2 in the picture, which shows the flavin from an oxidase, a nearby lysine, and O2 with the two degenerate singly-occu - pied orbitals which would receive electrons from the flavin. Claudia McDonald, a graduate student in Bruce Palfey's lab, tested the generality of the idea that lysine near N5 is the site of oxygen activation. The re - activities of several reduced flavoenzymes were de - termined by mixing with various concentrations of O2 in stopped-flow experiments. The bimolecu - lar rate constants for the reactions were determined from the time-dependence of flavin oxidation. The removal of a positive charge near N5 of the flavin caused a large change for one model enzyme, fruc - tosamine oxidase. However the a lysine near N5 (dihydrooro - tate dehydrogenases) were unchanged by mutagen - esis. McDonald found that the positive charge was only important in some enzymes, deepening the mystery of oxygen reactivity [McDonald et al. (2011) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133, 16809-16811]. On the Cover27The Evolution of the Department of Biological Chemistry at Michigan One of the rst members of the Medical School fac - ulty, Silas Douglas, was appoint - ed to teach chemistry. In fact, the rst chemistry courses taught at Michigan were taught as part of the Medical School curriculum. Dr. Douglas had a small laboratory in the medical building, and he gave chemical demonstrations before the Medical School classes. He persuaded the Regents in 1855 to build the rst building at any American university sole - ly devoted to chemistry. Douglas was in charge of the University's building program and he placed the Chemical Laboratory immediately behind the Med - ical Department. The two buildings were connected by a wooden walkway spanning the mud. Dr. Douglas and his staff taught chemistry to the rest of the University, and the Chemical Laboratory was repeatedly enlarged. At rst, Preston Rose taught toxicology and the elements of urine analysis to medical students, but the latter subject was soon in - cluded in a course in physiological chemistry taught by Victor Vaughan, who later became dean of the Medical School. In 1883, Victor Vaughan was appointed professor of physiological and pathological chemistry. He was the rst man to hold a professorship in physiological chemistry in a medical faculty in this country. Un - der the able leadership of Dr. Vaughan and his pupil, Frederick Novy, the subject was developed as part of the offerings of the combined Department of Bacteri - ology, Physiological Chemistry, and Hygiene. After the retirement of Dr. Vaughan in 1921, it was felt that physiological chemistry, in view of its rising importance, could hardly be kept in the posi - tion of an adjunct to other subjects. A separate De - partment of Physiological Chemistry was established in 1922. In 1935, with the approval of the executive committee of the Medical School, the department's name was changed to Biological Chemistry. It was felt that the broader term \"biological\" was more in keeping with the recent developments in this branch of chemistry. From Medicine at Michigan , Volume 1, Number 1, Spring 1999.
