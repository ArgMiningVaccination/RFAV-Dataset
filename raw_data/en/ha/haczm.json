Physical Physiological Psychique Emotional Learning Relational Allow your body to return to its state of homeostasis: its natural ability to balance itself. How many sessions in brief therapy? Depending on the issue, 2 to 12 sessions are required, until the individual's balance is completely resolved and stable. Then, we can continue together and work on other objectives, and various aspects of your overall health. Or help you with various relaxation tools to maintain serenity and harmony by releasing stress (meditation, brain gym, self-hypnosis, massage). But also, to support you in managing the challenges of daily life, and in improving your functioning patterns (psychology). Conduct of a session - 1. ANAMNESE After a period of discussion, during which the consultant shares his or her problems, the therapist helps him or her to become aware of, and then verbalize, the first objective to be achieved. The therapist will also ask you questions about your life and physical health conditions. - 2. MUSCLE TESTING [online: different tests] With this goal in mind, the therapist locates muscle tone conflicts that indicate a stress [or set of stresses] in the body. The practitioner will then plot these dissonances on the health triangle [physical/nutritional/emotional/energetic] to assess which elements need to be rebalanced according to their nature, and will try to contextualise each resonance in the person's experience, back to the root cause. 3.CHOICE OF TREATMENT Physical therapy / Psychology / Energetic After this first phase, the therapist proposes a choice of techniques adapted to the situation. Throughout the process, the person is accompanied in his or her awareness, which is necessary to put the self into perspective. This distancing leads to a modification of their physical posture, behaviour and actions. The person will thus be able to go beyond his or her limits, progressively accessing his or her full potential to gain new momentum. A protocol for each session's goal Depending on the reason for the consultation, the course of the session will vary. A consultation for the resolution of a trauma or for support during a serious illness will not have the same course as for well-being and personal development. Online: adjusted treatment - 4.FEEDBACK If you used specific technic like hypnosis, age recession, or deep massage, you need time to \"come back\". Then, we will have a sharing time with advice to improve your health durably: nutritional advice, herboristery & aromatherapy, self-massage, meditation or physical exercises... And we decide if we need another appointment, or even a regular therapy. - AFTER THE SESSION The body continues its balancing process, it is advisable to drink well and rest to integrate the changes on the structural level, but also on the behavioural level.
