Further, the emergence of variants of concern (VoCs) that evade immune recognition has reduced vaccine effectiveness, compounding the problem. Here, we show that a single dose of a murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-based vaccine, which expresses the spike (S) protein of the virus circulating early in the pandemic (MCMVS), protects highly susceptible K18-hACE2 mice from clinical symptoms and death upon challenge with a lethal dose of D614G SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, MCMVS vaccination controlled two immune-evading VoCs, the Beta (B.1.135) and the Omicron (BA.1) variants in BALB/c mice, and S-specific immunity was maintained for at least 5 months after immunization, where neutralizing titers against all tested VoCs were higher at 5-months than at 1-month post-vaccination. Thus, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based vector vaccines might allow for long-term protection against COVID-19. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors LCS and YK are applicants for a patent based on MCMV as a vaccine vector.
