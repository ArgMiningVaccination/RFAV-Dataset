Interms of surveillance and control of communicable disease in theEuropean Union, it marked the beginning of a new era. Global challenges from emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases, and especially in recent times, the spectre of threats from deliberate releases of pathogens, have exposed inadequacies and vulnerabilities in national and international systems and defences. Neverbefore has the need for closer cooperation between globally-acting organisations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), and enti-ties such as the European Union (EU) and individual countries, become so apparent and so acknowledged. Tackling health threats thatrequire a rapid response has resulted in much closer cooperation amongthe member states and the central institutions of the borderless EuropeanUnion, where, every day, millions of people move about freely and goodsof all sorts are speedily transported at great distances.This European structure means that the risks of spread-ing harmful agents are greater if measures are not takenimmediately to stop the problem at its source. Efforts to strengthen defences and prevention against such health threats have been steadily increasing overthe last two decades. From hesitant and humble be-ginnings in 1993, the European Community has grad-ually strengthened cooperation in public health,especially in communicable disease surveillance and control. Trustfulrelationships and familiarity with working together among public healthofficials and communicable disease professionals proved soon to beone of the key achievements. Very poorly resourced at first, coopera-tive networks and jointly-run projects and programmes started to mul-tiply and grow, aided by increasing European Community funding. Certainly, this process has not been without problems: there were differences of opinion as to priorities and direction, disputesover the division of responsibilities and hostility towards anythingthat might have centralising features. Since the end of 1998, thiscooperative framework has been enshrined in law by a decision ofthe European Parliament and of the Council establishing theCommunity Network for the Epidemiological Surveillance andControl of Communicable Diseases [1]. This has organised the co-ordination of national surveillance systems and institutes/agencieson the basis of a common list of diseases under surveillance [2],common case definitions and common laboratory methods [3].Moreover, it put in place the Early Warning and Response System(EWRS) [4] of the European Community which connects the com-petent authorities of all the EU member states responsible for formally notifying outbreaks of disease on the common list and forcommunicating information on counter-measures, or information onmeasures already taken if these had to be taken without delay. These developments gave a big boost to surveillance and infectious disease epidemiology and diagnosis in the European Union. Partnershipsand surveillance schemes and networks expanded, albeit not alwaysefficiently and with variable quality. Disagreement over resources, realneeds and added value were never far from the surface. Thinking inlocal and \"tribal\" terms is hard-wired in the scientific and adminis-trative world, as it is in other spheres of human activity. Nevertheless,thinking over how best to improve surveillance and outbreak investi-gation and capacity for advice and training moved away from the fash-ion of more and more project-driven networks with distributed hubs to the idea of a European centre. Support for such a centre had beenexpressed years previously by some health professionals. The SARS emergency in 2003 proved to be the catalyst for the creation of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Consensus among the health professionals led to the swift accept-ance of the Commission proposals for its establishment. It is hopedthat the Centre will be the missing link in European surveillance andcontrol and that there will finally be the capacity for advice, soundsurveillance everywhere and outbreak problem resolution that Europehas hitherto been lacking. There has been good progress with the setting up of the Centre [5]. The last week of September 2004 saw not only the start-up event forthe Centre with a solemn ceremony at the Swedish Prime Minister'spremises in Stockholm where the Centre will be located, but also the first meeting of the Centre's management board whichelected its officials, approved rules of procedure andconfidentiality and agreed on the acronym it will beECDC from now on. The search for the Director has already started and work on the programme of work for2005 is already underway. The management board isexpected to select the Director and adopt the mainlines of next year's work programme at its forthcomingmeeting in December 2004. The procedure for setting up the ECDC's Advisory Forum of representatives from member states'national public health entities has already begun. The ECDC should be fully operational in May 2005. It faces many organisational challenges and will no doubt have to confrontproblems soon. SARS and avian influenza may return and pan-demic influenza remains a constant threat. New pathogens withlonger incubation periods may still emerge due, inter alia , to the in- cessant encroachment of previously untouched habitats, intensivefarming without proper hygiene and safety conditions, spreading cultural habits, trade -sometimes illegal- and fast transport whichincapacitates traditional methods for containment. The ECDC will need all the support it can get from the surveillance and control constituency. Let us hope that this will come in abundance. Refer ences 1.

Negotiations, from the Commission's proposal in July 2003 to final agreement by both the European Parliament and the Counciltook just eight months. This might not be a record for agreeingnew EU legislation, but in terms of the type of legislation in-volved - setting up a new Community body with all that entailsfor permanent funding and obligatory participation by MemberStates - it probably is. Now comes the next phase - the practical implementation of the Regulation. First amongst the priorities will be the choice ofDirector [2] and the site in Stockholm. The Regulation sets outan ambitious series of requirements to make the Centre operationalby May 2005 - making arrangements for the Management Board,organising the work programme for 2005, and putting in placemany organisational requirements. If the Centre is to be operational in less than a year, it is vi- tal that decisions are taken on these essential nuts and bolts is-sues. But what is more fundamental is the question of mandateboth now and later; how can it deliver in the firstyears of operation with a small initial budget ofthe order of ten Mio \u20acincluding some financing from the Public Health Programme and how can itcomplement existing initiatives at Community andinternational level -or with third countries. The International Context For a long time, professional bodies, scientists, and health professionals have cautioned that changing lifestyle patterns,travel, and migration all lead to the easy spread of communica-ble diseases. Our political representatives have heard their call. In 2002 a new look at the need for a Community body or serv- ice to rise to this challenge was called for at an EU meeting inMadrid on the future of the epidemiological surveillance in Europe- actions and needs. Coincidentally a suspected outbreak of en-teroviral encephalitis took place within the European Union andwas threatening to close frontiers between EU Member States andthe cooperation between partners in this event and afterwardsshowed that there was much to be gained and little to be lost byextending the existing possibilities under the Community Networkon communicable disease surveillance and control. Indeed thistimely practical application of the concept helped us on the roadto the new Centre. This Community Network set up and made legally binding by Council and European Parliament Decision 2119/98/EC [3] re-quires Member States, coordinated by the Commission, to shareexperiences as outbreaks occur and to cooperate in surveillanceand early warning and response. The Decision also requires closecooperation with international organisations active in the field ofpublic health, particularly with the WHO. Its strength is its dou-ble objectives of surveillance and early warning organised mainlyby public health institutes in the Member States - but not ex-clusively.Since then SARS, avian 'flu', worries about a new pandemic influenza outbreak, and the inadequacy of preventive measureson HIV/AIDS have demonstrated that the EU Member States haveto improve the coherence of their actions, but also that effectiveCommunity inspired action continues to be bedevilled by insuf-ficient coordination from the Commission mostly related to avail-ability of sufficient resources. The EU has not been alone in identifying the need for a new process to protect the world's citizens. WHO has decided to reviseits International Health Regulations (IHR) [4] to cover all outbreaksof illness with a potential for the international spread of disease.Outbreaks are not simply a threat to health or life. They drainresources of health systems, they cause economic disruption andthey lead to unwanted as well as undesirable political ramifications.The IHR tries to reconcile the constraints of health protection withminimum disruption of trade. Whether the WHO Member States will agree to WHO proposals or whether even WHO has the resources to fulfil its suggestionsis still not clear. However, it is no coincidence that the Regulationestablishing the Centre specifically points to its cooperation inthe revision of the IHR. Indeed one of the challenges for the new Director will be how to integrate the Centre'sactivities with those of the WHO and how to takeforward these common objectives. Of particular note is the fact that by being Members of the EU about half the countries makingup the European Region of WHO will have accessto the resources of the Centre. Given the serioushealth concerns to be faced at the EU's Eastern frontiers, the WHO region needs to look at how the Centre can helpand at the same time how the WHO itself, through its contactsand specialised agencies, early warning arrangements, andcollaboration centres, can create a coherent, integrated, andsynergistic partnership throughout the region which can thenprovide substantial input to the worldwide effort through theIHR. To those who would say that we should address first how tomake the Centre work within the EU one should recall that theCommunity Network already is required to contribute to WHOactions and does so through a variety of means including thejoint surveillance activities through dedicated surveillancenetworks. It is a relatively simple strategic objective that there should be concerted action between EU and WHO - putting it into practice,however, may be more complicated. Nevertheless, surveillance ofthe most important pathogens and special health issues coveredwithin the framework of the existing Community network - andlater through the Centre should be organised through joint datacollection using common case definitions as far as possible withinthe entire WHO Euro area to ensure comparability and compatibilityof the data collected. Apart from surveillance one could easilyenvisage other joint activities within several areas such as training,teams for field outbreak investigations, and the development oflaboratory networks and organisation of their external qualitycontrol schemes - especially when some of these are alreadyorganised for and within the WHO Euro framework. The Centre will mobilise and reinforce the synergies between the national centres for disease controlIt would seem prudent therefore to decide and programme the work of the Centre with this ambitious idea in mind from thevery beginning to harness all resources and to avoid duplication. What can the Centre do? The mandate of the new Centre for the foreseeable future will be to provide scientific information and backup on communicablediseases from whatever cause, and outbreaks of illness of unknowncause. In practice to have all the activities in place and runningunder the initial scope will be a major effort for the Director forseveral years! Not only because it is a vast area to cover but alsobecause it needs resources and practical efforts to organise thecollaboration with the Member States and other working-partnersin an effective way which will only become possible as the Centreis established. This scope of action will only be extended after a thorough independent review of the Centre's ability to cope with its currentterms of reference and budget restrictions, and thereafter itscapacity to act effectively in other areas. However, when thisextension would be possible it would open new opportunities tostrengthen public health policies and activities within the EU andin its neighbourhood. The creation of the Centre will mobilise and significantly reinforce the synergies between the existing national centres fordisease control. In practice, the Centre will take over the existingoperational instruments provided by Decision 2119/98/EC (networkand early warning), whilst the Commission will continue to beresponsible for its residual legislative provisions, such as technicaland procedural requirements. Thus the Centre will have a key role in the future running of the Community Network on Communicable diseases - organisingthe surveillance networks, and supporting the Commission inrunning its Early Warning and Response System. A specificchallenge will be to integrate the operation of early warningsrelated to terrorism where political constraints on divulginginformation are dissimilar to those on more traditional kinds ofoutbreak and response. The balance will need to be found betweenthis political demand to keep a Rapid Alert System for Biologicaland Chemical Attacks and Threats (RAS BICHAT) -system alive,hoping at the same time that there will never be a need to useit, and at the same time to put enough effort to further developthe Early Warning and Response system so that it would besensitive enough to be useful on all occasions - recognising boththose 'every day' abnormalities and threats as well as thoserelated to possible terrorist attacks [5]. The Regulation places a heavy burden of scientific impartiality and coherence on the Centre and requires the Centre to contributeto the effectiveness of EU actions in a number of areas such asresearch, development and aid, and in providing reliable information. The Centre's technical assistance will cover more than the European Union itself. It can support, if necessary, thoseCommission services that give humanitarian aid or other types ofassistance in response to disease outbreaks in third countries. Inthese situations, the technical assistance will be co-ordinated withthe appropriate Commission services and relevant EU programmes.In the case of an outbreak investigation mission, depending onthe identification of the source of the outbreak (environmental,food, animal, chemical, deliberate release, etc), other appropriateEU agencies, and the WHO may have to be involved in order tostrengthen the coherence of the combined efforts. The Centre will bring together scientific expertise in specific fields through its various EU-wide networks and via ad hocscientific panels. The information made available through EU-funded research projects and other EU agencies, such as theEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will be used by theCentre. Research will not be the main task for the Centre. Itcan, however, initiate applied scientific studies to enhance policydevelopment and also studies to develop and enhance its own operational effectiveness. To avoid duplication, the Centre will co-ordinate its actions with those of the Member States and the EUFramework Programme on Research. Management of the Centre The new Regulation imposes a Management Board comprised of some 30 persons and an Advisory Forum comprised of mem-bers from technically competent bodies, as well as three mem-bers representing interested parties at European level, such asnon-governmental organisations representing patients, profes-sional bodies, or academia - or more succinctly some 28 per-sons with a broad base of scientific knowledge and experience. Representatives of the Commission's staff will also participate in the work of the Advisory Forum. These two groups - theManagement Board and the Advisory Forum - are already a sur-charge on budgetary resources at a time when the Centre is con-centrating on making its place in the process and internationalcommunity as a responsible source of inspiration. The aim of in-cluding representatives of non-governmental organisations is toensure a broad base of scientific knowledge and experience notnecessarily found in the national public health institutes. The budget of the Centre is designed to accommodate in 2005 some 35 staff rising to 70 in 2007. Thereafter the whole struc-ture and its financing have to be renegotiated in what are calledthe \"budgetary perspectives\". Casual comparison with any nationalor international equivalent body illustrates the current dramaticunder-funding. The financing gap for the European Centre is due at least par- tially to the speed and urgency with which the Centre was set up.We might anticipate that a successful Centre might expect a sub- stantial increase in funding beyond 2007 to cover the blatant needsfor more operational funds and to address the need for someform of \"catastrophe\" arrangements which could be drawn uponin the case of an event of major proportions - for example a flupandemic, or major scare from a third country. And the Future? Communicable diseases are a priority, and the Centre must first show its added value in this area. But a public health centre onhealth protection could be an asset in addressing other majordisease scourges at Community level. For example, obesity shouldbe a worry for us all. Including activities in health informationneeded to cover non-communicable diseases and monitoring ofhealth trends and developments within the Centre would thereforesupport Community actions and policies related to healthpromotion. The Centre could also in due course fulfil one objective mentioned only briefly - that of harnessing research on diseasesand public health in a more coherent way. The Centre should be seen as a major building block in the EU's capacity to tackle threats to health - both natural and man-made.It will serve as the technical arm for the Community for action andevidence-based advice for decision making. It strengthens also theinternational role of the EU in tackling diseases in particular inEU neighbouring countries, and in participating in global actionto control and respond to serious outbreaks or threats. The European 'CDC' has been a long time coming, but it is now here to stay. Whether on communicable diseases or other scourges;whether on research or surveillance; the Community of the EU isnow better served. Refer ences 1.

This was followed the next day bythe first meeting of the ECDC's management board (see Box). The event was attended by senior health officials and politi- cians from Europe, North America and Asia, and in his speech, theEuropean commissioner for health and consumer protection em-phasised the international nature of the centre. Unlike national cen-tres for disease control, such as the United States' Centers forDisease Control and Prevention and Hong Kong's new Centre forHealth Protection, the ECDC is being built to be the small hub ofthe many existing networks of experts and laboratories in Europeancountries both inside and outside of the European Union. It ishoped that the ECDC will provide stability for core funding of thesenetworks, and a focal point for expertise and training. The board elected Dr Marc J.W. Sprenger, director general of the Netherlands' National Institute for Health and the Environment(RIVM), as chair, and Dr Meni Malliori, assistant professor in psychi-atry at the University of Athens, as deputy chair. The board has responsibility for the ECDC's work programme, budget and man-agement, and will work closely with the director. The next boardmeeting will take place on 13-14 December, when the director willbe appointed. Refer ences: 1 European Commission.

Obviously, the method can only be used for fairly common diseases and destina-tions, otherwise the uncertainty of the estimates becomes too large. Methods For this study we used two data sources. The first was our depart- ment's the national database of all notified infections in Sweden since1997, SmiNet [3]. The doctor diagnosing a notifiable disease reportsa number of items for each case, including diagnosis, age, sex, andmost likely place/country of infection (based on travel history andknowledge of the disease incubation period). The completeness of thisreporting can be evaluated against the laboratory reports , which use the same personal identifier, and is 98% or more for most diseases[4]. During the 7 year period 1997-2003 there were 14 829Campylobacter cases and 1112 Giardia cases where infection was re-ported to have been acquired during travel in a European countryoutside Sweden. These figures only refer to Swedish residents whotravelled abroad (identified in the database through the unique per- sonal identification number issued to all Swedish residents). Newlyarrived immigrants, who do not have a personal identification num-ber, were excluded prior to the analysis. The second data source was a commercial database on Swedish travel, the Swedish Travel and T ourist Database (TDB) [5,6]. This data- base is mainly used by the travel industry, and is built on monthlytelephone interviews with 2 000 randomly selected Swedes, in which they are asked about any travel during the last 6 months. The questionsasked are quite detailed and cover destination, length of stay, type oftravel (business/leisure), type of accommodation, car rental, etc. We used the part of the database containing age, sex, destination, time of traveland length of stay for all respondents during 1997-2003. There were14 519 interviewees who had been on overnight trips to a Europeancountry other than Sweden during this period. From the age, sex and geographical distribution of these people, we were able standardiseagainst the total population of Sweden (9 million) to get an estimateof the actual number of travellers to each country during the seven years. For each country, the risk of infection per 100 000 travellers was calculated as the number of cases reported in travellers returningfrom that country, divided by estimated total number of travellersand multiplied with 100 000. The confidence intervals were calcu-lated using the formula: eln risk \u00b11.96* (1/cases+1/travellers), where 'cases' was the number of cases reported from a country, and 'travellers' was the actual number of travellers to that country in the TDB data base, not the estimated Swedish total. The formula thustakes into account both the uncertainty in the number of reported casesand the uncertainty in the actual number of responding travellersforming the basis for the estimated total number of travellers.Comparable figures on disease incidence between countries are difficult to attain. We therefor e compared risk of infection for Swedes going to other European countries. We took as the nu- merator the number of imported cases from European coun- tries of Campylobacter and Giardia infection in the nationalSwedish su rveillance database, and as the denominator, the number of visi tors to each country from a commercial database on for eign travel. Risk of infection in tourists was also compared to nat ional inci dence figures for a selection of countries. During the 7 year period 1997-2003, 14 829 Campylobacter and1112 Giardia infections were diagnosed in Swedes returning from a European country. The travel database contained infor- mation on 14 519 overnight trips to such a country during the same period. Risk of Campylobacter infection was over 100 per 100 000 travellers to Portugal and Turkey, but only 1/100 000 in Finland. Risk of giardiasis was highest in Russia (50/100 000).There appears to be substantial underreporting of Campylobacterinfection in many European countries. In conclusion, the risk of infection with Campylobacter andGiardia varies 100-fold across Europe. Returning tourists as asentinel population are a useful tool to estimate these differ- ences. There are large - and unexplained - differences between the risk for travellers and reported national incidence. Euro Surveill 2004;9:6-9 Key words : Surveillance; Giardia; Campylobacter; Travel; Risk Introduction Comparing incidence figures for infectious diseases between one country and another is notoriously difficult. Healthcare-seeking be- haviour, clinical practice and laboratory methods vary considerably,even between otherwise similar countries. Several attempts at col- lecting national data on an international level, such as the WorldHealth Organization centralized information system for infectious diseases (WHO CISID) [1] or the European Union Zoonosis Report[2] lose much of their usefulness due to this incomparability. Sweden has a relatively favourable infectious disease situation . Since many of our cases of various infections are imported, we have a longtradition of routinely registering the country of infection along with other epidemiological data. We decided to use these data to estimate risk ofinfection for a list of diseases in various countries. In this paper, wedescribe the method and and have taken Campylobacter and Giardiainfection in Europe as example results. We intend to continue with 6 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 * Department of Epidemiology, Swedish Institute for Infectious Diseaese Control and the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics,Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, SwedenFIGURE 1 Risk of being diagnosed in Sweden with Campylobacter infection on return home per 100 000 travellers to countries inEurope.Aggregated data for 7 year period 1997-2003The proportion of notifications with unknown country of infection was quite stable over the period; 8-11% for Campylobacter notifica-tions and 15-21% for Giardia notifications. This estimate of risk for travellers per country was the main aim of our study. However, we also wanted to compare these risks to re-ported national incidence. We therefore looked for official national sur-veillance statistics, but it is difficult to get reliable data of this kind for most infectious diseases in Europe, and there is no single publica-tion or website to consult. (Our department is leading an EUfundedproject to improve this situation, the Basic Surveillance Network [7].)We could not find any useful data on Giardia, but there are some fig- ures for human Campylobacter disease in the annual EU ZoonosisReport [2]. This list only includes about half of the European coun- tries, and is based on clinical notification in some, but on laboratory notification in others. Also, only 11 of the 18 L\u00e4nder in Germany re-port. For Germany we therefore assumed a population of 50 million instead of the actual 82 million when calculating national incidence. To compare the risk of Campylobacter infection in travellers to the national reported incidence for some European countries listed inthe EU Zoonosis Report, we constructed an 'under-detection index' ,using Finland (with the highest detection rate) as reference. The in-dex is based on the ratio of travel-related infections in Swedes and thenational incidence, and denotes estimated number of Campylobactercases not notified for every notified case. Results The risk of infection for travellers from Sweden is shown in Table 1 and in Figures 1 and 2. It is evident that there are huge differences be-tween various countries, ranging for Campylobacter from 1 per 100 000travellers in Finland to over 100/100 000 in Turkey and Portugal, and for Giardia, from 0/100 000 in Austria and Ireland to over 50/100 000in Russia. It is also evident that the distribution of these two pathogens is quite different across Europe. The mean annual incidence of do-mestically acquired campylobacteriosis and giardiasis in Sweden in thesame period was 27.2/100 000 and 2.7/100 000, respectively.

TDB denotes a database sample of Swedish foreign travel, see text for detailsTable 2 gives the official incidence of campylobacteriosis in some countries, and a rough estimate on how many Campylobactercases are missed for each reported case nationally. There is an obvi-ous north-south gradient here, but even France, Ireland and theNetherlands seem to have a greater problem with Campylobacter than indicated by national statistics.Discussion For a case of any notifiable disease to appear in national surveil- lance statistics, the patient must usually experience symptoms fromthe infection serious enough to bring the patient to a doctor. Thedoctor must then suspect the disease, and in most instances orderthe appropriate laboratory test. At the laboratory, the test must bepositive, and the result reported back to the clinician. The case mustthen be reported upward in the surveillance chain, and finally be en-tered correctly in the national database. At each of these steps, there will be differences between countries, which will render comparison of national incidence statistics difficult. In this study we have used tourists from Sweden as a sentinel pop- ulation to measure relative risk of acquiring two diseases in the coun-tries of the European Union. The differences observed are substantial. What are the possible biases? The first is obviously that the estimates for number of travellers to each country are based on a random sam-ple of Swedes, interviewed over the telephone. Estimates for unusualdestinations in particular will have wide confidence intervals. Thequestions asked about travel were fairly detailed, making it unlikelythat the respondents would not tell the truth about their destination.Conversely, names were not registered by the interviewers, and there should thus be little incentive not to report trips taken abroad. The rep-resentativeness of the TDB database has been studied in an internal report from Gothenburg University [6], and found to be good. In or- der to validate the figures even further, we also compared them withfigures for collected landing cards reported from several few countries.For these destinations, agreement was good (less than 5 % difference for travel to Thailand), but obviously we could not check against suchfigures for any EU country. Second, length of stay will differ between destinations. Most Swedes travelling to other Nordic countries will only stay a few days, whereas holidays of a week or longer will be the norm for Mediterranean des-tinations (indeed, data on the mean length of stay from the TDBranged from 3.6 days in travellers to Denmark to 10.1 days in travellers to Spain, while most of the countries were visited for an average of 5 to 9 days). However, our system mostly picks up infections acquired towards the end of a stay, since a tourist with an illness acquired shortly after arrival at the foreign destination will often have recov-ered before the journey home, or have been cared for at the traveldestination. This bias would therefore lead to an underestimation ofthe risk in countries where tourists stay longer. Third, the propensity to seek healthcare for a given symptom may also differ for infections acquir ed closer to home than in more distant places. It is unlikely, however, that this behaviour would differ be-tween tourists returning from, for examply, Greece or Spain. Riskcomparisons may well be best made along the same latitude, but even so, there are notable differences. On the other hand, if returning trav-ellers are more likely to see a doctor than patients who have not trav-elled, some of the underdetection of domestic cases in the countriesunder study could be explained by health-seeking behaviours. Fourth, doctors may be more inclined to test for specific pathogens if the patient is returning from a known high-risk country. For the twopathogens used as example in this paper, this selection bias couldpossibly have led to more zealous diagnostic work on giardiasis intravellers returning from Russia. Fifth, travellers to different countries may not be alike. Some ar- eas may attract mainly holidaymakers, who display a different expo-sure pattern from business travellers who travel to other destinations.Finally, for several diseases, risk varies throughout the year, often inparallel with incidence of travel. We applied a logistic regression modelto the data, adjusting for age, sex and month of travel, but it changed the results only minimally. The use of incidence in tourists to compare with reported national incidence obviously entails even more biases: tourists probably differfrom natives in exposure, particularly to enteric pathogens, since theywill be eating out much more often. There may also be some immu- 8 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 Surveillance report FIGURE 2 Risk of being diagnosed in Sweden with Giardia infection on return home per 100 000 travellers to countries in Europe.

Euro Surveill 2004;9:9-11 Key words : vertical transmiss ion, HIV, surveillance Introduction The global epidemic of HIV infection remains horrifying. An estimated 630 000 children acquired HIV infection in 2003 [1], most of them as aresult of mother-to-child transmission, which continues to be an important public health issue. This article presents the surveillance data on paediatric HIV infections and AIDS cases in Greece reported by 30 June 2003. Epidemiological dataare essential for a better understanding of the dynamics of the epidemicand the impact of prevention programmes. Methods Surveillance of HIV infection in Greece is conducted by the Hellenic Centre for Infectious Diseases Control (HCIDC). Notification of HIVinfections was implemented in Greece in 1998; AIDS case reportingwas implemented in 1984. It is anonymous, confidential, andmandatory by law [2]. Cases of HIV infection identified prior to 1998have also been retrospectively collected, for surveillance and trendanalysis purposes. AIDS cases and new diagnoses of HIV infection inchildren (under 13 years old) are reported by reference centres,In Greece, HIV/AIDS surveillance is conducted by the Hellenic Centre for Infectious Diseases Control. The AIDS case reportingsystem was implemented in 1984, followed by notification of HIVinfections in 1998. This article presents surveillance and trendanalysis of paediatric HIV infection and AIDS, including casesidentified prior to 1998. The number of HIV infected children in Greece is relatively low,raising to a cumulative total of 69 cases by June 2003, 44 (64%)of whom are thought to have been infected through mother-to-childtransmission. Thirty three paediatric AIDS cases have been reportedsince the onset of epidemic, with Pneumonocystis carinii pneumonia being the most frequent opportunistic infection. A significant number of children in Greece were diagnosed after theage of 1 year. This could be attributed to the fact that many HIV-infected women are not identified during pregnancy, despite thatfact that voluntary testing is available. It could also be attributedto the fact that data includes HIV infections collected retrospectivelyafter 1998, and that foreign HIV-infected children may arrive inGreece at a later age. Furthermore, new paediatric HIV positivecases that were reported during the first half-year period of 2003were foreign children born in eastern Europe and sub-SaharanAfrica. Efforts should be made to identify women in these populationsin time for proper intervention. HIV infection in children remainsnity in the local population that visitors lack - something that many travellers to new places have experienced. The figures do, however, raise some questions: 378 Campylobacter cases per year in France, comparedto some 140 annually in returning Swedish tourists - or an annual in- cidence of 43 per 100 000 in Ireland compared to about 25 per 100 000Swedish visitors - seem unlikely. Another problem with the figures in Table 2 is that reported inci- dence is a mixture of imported and domestic cases not only in Sweden.For example, almost 80% of British cases are imported to that coun- try [8], and should thus not represent any risk to visiting Swedes. The ratio of imported to domestic cases is, however, unknown for most countries, and difficult to control for. The situation is likely similar in Finland and the UK, and if domestic Finnish incidence only was usedfor comparison, the ratio of undetected to reported cases would in-crease even more for countries where a larger portion of cases aredomestic. We believe that the use of returning tourists as a sentinel popula- tion is a valid tool for estimating risk of infection in various countries.It would be very interesting to see similar studies from other countries.References 1.

The surveillance system is estimated to resultin accurate case counts with duplicate and incorrectly matched caserepor ts to be below 5%. Diagnosis of HIV infection in children is based on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines for NationalHuman Immunodeficiency Virus case surveillance [3]. For all children 18 months or older, diagnosis of HIV infection, either by laboratories orclinical departments, should be based on a positive result on a screeningtest for HIV antibody (repeatedly reactive enzyme immunoassay), followed by a positive result on a confirmatory test for HIV antibody(western blot) or a positive result or report of a detectable quantity onan HIV virological test (HIV nucleid acid detection, HIV p24 antigen testincluding neutralisation assay, HIV isolation). For children up to 18months or younger, reportable HIV cases should meet the laboratorycriteria (positive results on two separate specimens, excluding cordblood, using one or more of the following HIV virological tests: HIVnucleid acid detection, HIV p24 antigen test, including neutralisation assay, in a child aged 1 month or older, HIV isolation). For children, the AIDScase definition is the European case definition [4]. Data are analysed by the HCIDC's HIV Infection Office. Results Since the beginning of the epidemic, 69 HIV infected children have been registered in our database. Of these, 44 (63.77%) were boysand 24 (34.78%) were girls, while for one case the sex was not reported.In total, 20 (28.99%) children were identified during the first year of life, 24 (34.78%) between 1-4 years old, 13 (18.84%) at the age of 5-9 years and 12 (17.39%) were aged 10 years or older [TABLE 1]. Fiftythree children (76.81%) were of Greek nationality, 7 (10.14%) wereborn in sub-Saharan Africa. Two new paediatric HIV cases werereported during first half-year period of 2003. One of the children was born in eastern Europe and the other in sub-Saharan Africa.recipients (6.1%). AIDS trend analysis shows that the number of cases progressing to AIDS has been lower in recent years and no newpaediatric AIDS case has been reported since 2001. The number ofdeaths in paediatric AIDS cases has been dropped to one annually since2000 [FIGURE]. In terms of AIDS defining conditions in children, themost frequent are pneumonocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (12%), HIV and Cytomegalovirus disease (12%).

HIV trends by transmission group shows that HIV infection in children is primarily vertically acquired. Most of cases in haemophiliac children and transfusion recipients were infected during the early years of the epidemic. Of the cases classified as undetermined, a high proportionof these in recent years are so because reports are based on a laboratorysurveillance system, with, therefore, little information available. Among the 44 cases of vertically acquir ed HIV infection, the majority of mothers (38.63%) were exposed to the HIV virus throughheterosexual contact, but the transmission mode of the motherremains unknown for 41% of cases. The total number of paediatric AIDS cases is 33 (20 boys and 13 girls). Most of the patients (60.6%) were infected through mother- to-child transmission, 33.3% had haemophilia or were transfusionTABLE 2 Cumulative paediatric HIV positive cases by transmission group and sex, reported in Greece by 30 June 2003 Transm ission groupMales N (%)Females Coagulation Mothe r-to-child 23 Undetermined 5 (11.40) 1 (4.17) 6 (8.70) Total* 44 (1 00) 24 (100) 69 (100) * including cases of unknown sex Discussion New HIV diagnoses in Greece are considered low compared with other countries in western Europe. In 2002, the HIV reporting ratein western Europe was 76.1 new HIV diagnoses per million populationoverall , while in Greece the rate was 37.9 [5]. In the entire WHO European Region, 13 603 persons were reported to be infected through mother-to-child transmission by 30 June 2003: only 44 cases were fromGreece [5]. As mother-to-child transmission is the main route of transmission for children under 13 years old, the low number of HIV infected children in Greece is probably due to the low number ofHIV infected women (1242 females versus 5241 males) [2]. In astudy sponsored by HCIDC and conducted by the National Schoolof Public Health in 1999-2000, it was found that the prevalence of HIVinfection among pregnant women in Athens was 13 per 10 000. Thenumber is considered low compared to other European urban areas such as London (24.83 per 10 000) for which data were available forthe same time period [6]. Haemophiliac patients and transfusionrecipients were infected in the early years of the epidemic since blood supplies were not tested for HIV antibodies until 1985. It has been recommended that screening tests for HIV infection are offered to pregnant women in Greece during the first trimester ofpregnancy on an 'opt-out' basis, but this is not always done at present.Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which is free of charge; modification of obstetric practices such as elective caesarean section;and avoidance of breastfeeding: all these are affordable for all knownHIV positive pregnant women in Greece.

A catch-up campaign was carried out in children under sixyears of age. As a consequence, the incidence of meningococcaldisease caused by serogroup C has fallen sharply during the lastthree epidemiological years in Spain. The risk of contractingserogroup C disease in 2002/2003 fell by 58% when comparedwith the season before the conjugate vaccine was introduced.There was also an important decrease in mortality. Three deathsdue to serogroup C occurred in the age groups targeted forvaccination in 2002/2003, compared with 30 deaths in the sameage groups in the season before the launch of the vaccinecampaign. In the catch-up campaign the vaccine coverage reachedvalues above 92%. For the 2001, 2002 and 2003 routinechildhood immunisation programme coverage values ranged from 90% to 95%. During the past three years a total of 111 cases ofserogroup C disease have been reported in patients in the vaccinetarget group. Most of the vaccination failures occurred duringthe epidemiological year 2002/2003. Eight (53%) vaccine failuresoccurred in children who had been routinely immunised in infancy,and could be related to a lost of protection with time sincevaccination. The isolation of several B:2a:P1.5 strains (ST-11lineage) is noteworthy. These may have their origin in C:2a:P1.5strains which, after undergoing genetic recombination at thecapsular operon level, express serogroup B. These strains couldhave relevant epidemic potential.

However as in all resource-rich countries, a number of infected women are notpromptly identified despite the counselling and voluntary testingavailable in antenatal clinics [7]. This could partly explain the significant number of children in Greece who were diagnosed afterthe age of 1 year. The migration to Greece of foreign patients at anolder age, as well as the retrospective collection of data after theimplementation of HIV case reporting, are, however, factors thatexerted influence on the distribution of cases by age. Our database does not record which of these paediatric HIV cases in Greece reflectscreening or prophylaxis failure, and so our data could not supplyanswers to this question that would allow a better allocation of resources. As regards paediatric AIDS cases and deaths, the numbers are very low. In terms of AIDS-defining conditions, it seems that PCP is he mostfrequent opportunistic infection in children. It is noteworthy that the new paediatric HIV positive cases reported during the first half-year period of 2003 in Greece were in foreignchildren born in eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, 10% of paediatric HIV cases in Greece in children were from sub-Saharan Africa. It seems, then, that the national redistribution ofimmigrant and refugee families have a great impact on the HIV trendworldwide [8]. Greece is the final destination for many immigrants, and the number of people moving to Greece has increased dramaticallyduring the past decade. More efforts should therefore be made toidentify the women in these populations in time for properintervention to be made.HIV infection in children remains a huge problem. As paediatric HIV infection reporting in Greece is part of the National SurveillanceSystem, further studies including obstetric data on demographic information, timing of maternal diagnosis and HIV infection status,uptake of interventions, outcome of pregnancy, avoidance ofbreastfeeding and paediatric data on neonatal details are necessary.

The median incidence of meningococcal disease was 2.9/100 000 for the five year period 1991-1996 and serogroup B wasthe most frequent among all the confirmed infections. In theepidemiological year 1996/1997, however, serogroup C became thepredominant group (63%) in almost all Spanish regions, with aconsequent increase in incidence and mortality. The incidence reached 5.8/100 000 with incidence due to serogroup C at 2.3/100 000. T oreduce this incidence, a nationwide vaccination campaign (which included 16 out of the 19 autonomous Spanish regions) using anti-meningococcal A+C polysaccharide vaccine was launched in autumn1997. The overall estimated coverage was 76.3%. This strategy reducedthe national incidence of meningococcal disease by 45%. A reductionwas seen in all age groups, and the most important reduction wasfound in 2 to 19 year olds, the target group of the intervention. In thisgroup, the number of serogroup C cases fell by 76% in comparison with the year before vaccination was introduced. However, the incidence of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C continuedto increase in the years following vaccination [3], a foreseeable circumstance given the limitations in the immunogenicity ofpolysaccharide vaccine [4,5]. The new conjugate vaccine becameavailable in Spain in 2000, and was included in the infant vaccination schedule. A catch-up campaign was carried out aimed at the mostvulnerable group: children under the age of six years. In three of the19 national regions, this group was extended to include all those under19 years of age over the next three years. This study analysesmeningococcal disease surveillance data from the three epidemiologicalyears from 2000/2001 and 2002/2003 following the introduction of the meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) conjugate vaccine in Spain,and includes data on incidence in the different age groups and onthe characterisation of strains isolated in clinical cases. In this sense,the main interest in characterising these strains lies in verifying whetherthe vaccination with the MenC conjugate vaccine carried out duringthe last months of 2000 led to the selection of new antigenic variantsas a result of recombination or shift of group B or C percentages, aswell as an increase in the number of cases caused by serogroups other than B and C. Methods Epidemiological surveillance of meningococcal disease in Spain is based on a passive notification system. The weekly reporting ofcases diagnosed is compulsory and physicians must complete aquestionnaire for every case notified with the patient's demographic,clinical and epidemiological data. The epidemiologist updates theinformation on outcome and vaccination status a few days after thecase is notified. Data for the calculation of global and specific incidences by age during the years 1999/2000 to 2002/2003 were obtained from thecases notified to the Sistema de Enfermedades de Declaraci_nObligatoria (EDO, Compulsory Disease Reporting System). For notification purposes, a probable case is defined as a patient whopresents with clinical symptoms compatible with the disease and apresumptive analytical test (such as the presence of intracellular Gramnegative diplococci in cerebrospinal fluid or other biochemistryanalyses). In 2000, the definition of a confirmed case was modified toinclude both isolation of Neisseria meningitidis at a normally sterile site and the presence of meningococcal DNA or the detection ofmeningococcal antigen in the appropriate samples. In this study, the epidemiological year (also known as 'season') runs from week 27 of a particular year until week 26 of the next. Calculation of national and age-specific meningococcal diseaseincidences was made using population estimates made mid-year bythe National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica).The risk of suffering from the disease during the previousepidemiological year in the study was calculated, (using relative riskand a 95% confidence interval,) by comparing the current seasonwith each of the previous epidemiological seasons.Vaccine failure cases were studied from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003. A confirmed vaccine failure was defined as a confirmedcase of serogroup C disease with onset more than 14 days after thelast dose of vaccine scheduled for that age group. To analyse the specific characteristics of the meningococcal strains in all isolates, serogroup, serotype and serosubtype were determinedusing specific monoclonal antibodies according to techniques describedelsewhere [6]. Furthermore, in order to study the possible appearanceof capsular genetic interchange phenomena, multilocus sequencetyping (MLST) [7] was used to define precisely the clone lines to which the suspected strains belonged. Results In the epidemiological year 2002/2003, 948 cases of meningococcal disease were reported (2.3/100 000), of which 76% were confirmedcases. The percentage of confirmed cases during the study's finalseason was higher than that of the previous three seasons (71% onaverage), and 468 serogroup B (1.2/100 000) and cases were notified [TABLE 1]. The number of serogroup Ccases notified fell during the three seasons after the introduction of thevaccine, except for a slight increase in the rates both for this serogroupand for the others in the season 2001/2002 [FIGURE 1, TABLE 1].

These children were either born after the conjugatevaccine was included in the routine vaccination schedule or were partof the target group for the catch-up campaign. In the epidemiologicalyear 2002/2003, 38 cases due to serogroup C (1.0/100 000) were reported in children under -ten years, compared with 254 cases (6.6/100 000) during the season before Menc C conjugate vaccinewas introduced, which represents an 85% reduction in the incidenceat this age. On the other hand, although not statistically significant,there was an increase in the incidence in 10 to 14 -year olds.Outcome is known for more than 95% of cases. In the epidemiological year 2002/2003, 88 deaths due to meningococcaldisease were reported. During the same period, the number of deathsand the case fatality rate (CFR) for the most important serogroups were33 and 7.5% for serogroup B, and 29 and 16.6% for serogroup C.Table 3 shows the number of deaths due to serogroup C disease by age before and after the introduction of the MenC conjugate vaccine.There was a continuous decrease in the mortality caused by serogroupC disease after vaccination, except in 2001/2002. Three deaths due toserogroup C occurred in the age groups targeted for vaccination in2002/2003, compared with 30 deaths that occurred in the same agegroups in the season prior to the 2000 vaccine campaign was launched. One of the three deaths was in a child who had received the completecourse of three doses of conjugate vaccine in the routine vaccination programme. In the epidemiological year 2002/2003, there was a 36%reduction in CFR compared with that registered before vaccination.

On the other hand, the incidence of non-groupable cases increased gradually throughout the study period and the risk was59% higher in the season 2002/2003 if we compare it with the season1999/2000. This increase is statistically significant [TABLES 1 and 2].present in 10% of the cases. The percentage of cases with sepsis was greater in serogroup C cases (52%) than in serogroup B cases (49%), but the difference is not statistically significant.

The distribution by ageof serogroup B disease reflects the usual age distribution pattern witha large incidence for children under five years. Information on the clinical presentation of the disease (sepsis, meningitis, or both) was registered for 95% of cases during the season2002/2003. Clinical sepsis was present in 46.9% of cases, and clinicalmeningitis in 38.4% (p = 0.01). Sepsis and meningitis together wereFIGURE 3 Meningococcal disease. Incidence of serogroup B during the study epidemiological years by (in years) Coverage in the catch-up and routine immunisation programmes in 2001, 2002 and 2003 was estimated on the basis of coverage datafrom nine Spanish autonomous regions, which together account for60% of the total Spanish population. The proportion of the vaccinatedpopulation in the catch-up displayed considerable homogeneity forchildren born between 1995 and 2000, with values above 92% for these birth cohorts. For the 2001, 2002 and 2003 routine childhoodimmunisation programmes, coverage values ranged from 90% to95%.

Twenty three of them had received thevaccine, 78 had not, and the vaccination status was unknown in 10cases. The number of cases for which the vaccination status wasunknown fell during the last three seasons and status information isavailable for all cases during the 2002/2003 season. Of the 23 vaccinated cases, 15 were classified as confirmed vaccine failures(accomplished complete vaccination) and eight as probable failures(incomplete vaccination or fewer than 14 days between vaccinationand first symptoms) [TABLE 4]. Eleven of the 15 confirmedvaccination failures occurred during the season 2002/2003. T en ofthese children were between one and four years of age, and only oneof these cases had previously received the A+C polysaccharide vaccineduring the 1997 vaccination campaign. Of the 15 vaccination failures,seven had received the vaccination during the catch-up campaignin 2000. The eight remaining cases had been vaccinated according tothe routine vaccination schedule established, and all but one hadreceived the vaccination in 2001. Failures were distributed throughout the country. According to figures provided by pharmaceuticalcompanies on the number of doses of conjugate vaccine sold in Spain, we estimate that during the period 2000-2003, 2.6 vaccineconfirmed failures per one million doses occurred.Discussion The incidence of meningococcal disease, especially serogroup C, has fallen sharply during the last three epidemiological seasons in Spaincovered by this study. It has been estimated that the risk of contracting the disease of this serogroup fell by 58% if we compare the incidenceof the last epidemiological year in the study with that of the seasonbefore the conjugate vaccine was introduced. Nevertheless, we mustbear in mind that the rates for the season 1999/2000, especially thoseof serogroup C, had already fallen considerably due to the vaccinationcampaign with polysaccharide vaccine in 1997. The increased incidencein the 10-14 year age group, although not statistically significant,deserves special mention, given that only about 35% of the population in this group has been vaccinated. No increase was observed amongothers adolescents or in young adults. Nevertheless, a continuousmonitoring of the incidence in these age groups is needed in order toevaluate the current vaccination policy. The proportion of vaccine failures detected is similar to that observed in other countries [8]. However, a large number of theconfirmed vaccination failures occurred during the epidemiological year 2002/2003. Also, 8 out of 15 (53%) confirmed vaccine failures occurred in children who had been routinely immunised in infancy.These aspects could be related to a loss of protection with time sincevaccination. The study currently being carried out on vaccineeffectiveness may help clarify the issue. No relationship has beenfound between vaccination failures and a previous history of havingreceived the polysaccharide vaccine. The incidence of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B and other serogroups has remained stable during the last three seasons.This circumstance is compatible with the cyclical evolution of thedisease and suggests that we are in an interepidemic period. It can alsobe concluded that the analysis of the situation immediately after theintroduction of this new conjugate vaccine, which could have led tothe appearance of a new bacterial equilibrium, shows that there is noevidence of alterations in the populations of circulating meningococci. However,special mention must be made of the isolation of B:2a:P1.5 strains, previously mentioned in the results section. These strainscould have relevant epidemic potential and, after two years of evolution, they are now being isolated in more areas of Spain, although only insmall numbers. Future evolution of this strain will enable us to analysethe real importance of these processes of active immunisation in theselection of this type of antigenic recombinants. We do not have any explanation for the increase in the number of non-groupable cases. The current use of microbiological techniquescannot be evaluated here, as we do not have information on thetechniques used in the diagnosis of each case. Finally, we must stress the importance of maintaining epidemiological surveillance of this disease, as well as on improvingthe quality of the information collected from each case. This willenable us to observe changes in the presentation pattern of the disease,and in the identification of vaccination failures with a view to reviewingthe functioning of current prevention programmes.

The proportion of serogroup B cases increased graduallyfrom 58.3% in 2000 to 68% in 2001 and 2002, reaching 72.9% duringthe first nine months of 2003. The frequency of serogroup C strainsfell from 38.5% in 2000, to 27% in 2001, 22.6% in 2002, and finallyto 20% in 2003. The percentage for 2003 corresponds to that observed in Spain during the 1980s, before the increase in serogroup C disease.Only slight increases were observed in the frequency of serogroupsY and W135, with the former rising from 1.2% in the year 2000 to2.8% in 2003, and the latter from 1% to 1.9%. These increases arenot statistically significant.The serosubtypes which appear in thestrains of serogroup C have undergone a considerable change.

The isolation in the north of Spain of several B:2a:P1.5 strains (ST- 11 lineage) is worthy to note. These may have their origin in C:2a:P1.5strains which, after undergoing genetic recombination at the capsularoperon level, express serogroup B capsule.ORIGINAL ARTICLES Outbreak report OUTBREAK OF CLOSTRIDIUM HISTOLYTICUM INFE CTIONS IN INJECTING DRUG USERS IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND J S Brazier, M Gal, V Hall, TE Morris*3.

In the period December 2003 to April 2004, the AnaerobeReference Laboratory received twelve referrals of an extremelyrare isolate, Clostridium histolyticum , from cases of infection in injecting drug users submitted from nine different hospitals in England and Scotland. Molecular typing of these isolates by twodifferent methods of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and PCR ribotyping revealed they are all indistinguishable, indicating acommon source of the infections, most probably a batch of herointhat was recently distributed across the UK. Euro Surveill 2004;9:15-16 Key words : IDUs, Clostridial infection, Clostridium novyi Introduction Since the outbreak of serious illness and deaths due to Clostridium novyi that occurred amongst injecting drug users (IDUs) in 2000 [1], the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory (ARL) at the UniversityHospital of Wales in Cardiff has been alerted to the role of clostridial infections in this group of patients. It is believed that, somewhere alongthe supply chain, heroin is being contaminated with clostridial spores.These spores have been shown to survive the heroin 'cooking up'process that commonly involves heating in citric acid (pH 2.1) priorto injection [2]. Only skin or muscle 'poppers' , those IDUs who in- ject subcutaneously or into muscle tissue rather than a vein seem tobe affected, as the injectate creat es a localised necrotic focus that is suitable for the germination of the clostridial spores. Mixed clostridialspores may be present including C. tetani and some cases of clinical tetanus in IDUs have been reported, but an unusual number of in- fections primarily due to a rarely isolated clostridial species has re-cently come to our attention.Methods and Results The first such case was in December 2003 when a 35 year old fe- male IDU from Glasgow presented at hospital with a necrotic lesionat an injection site in her buttock. The organism isolated from this le-sion was referred to the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory for identifi-cation and was identified according to the phenotypic criteria ofHoldeman et al [3] as Clostridium histolyticum (FIGURE 1). In the next few weeks, further indistinguishable isolates from IDUs from othercities across England led to an alert being issued by the HealthProtection Agency Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in the Communicable Disease Report Weekly [4]. Later, over a four month period to April 2004, another eleven isolates referred to the ARL frominjection site infections or blood cultures taken from heroin injectingdrug users across England and Scotland have been identified as C. his- tolyticum .Molecular typing methods were applied to these isolates to determine their relatedness using unrelated strains from the NationalCollection of Type Cultures (NCTC) culture collection and one wild clinical isolate from a crushed-hand injury for comparison. T o the best *A n a e r o be Reference Laboratory, National Public Health Service of Wales, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom FIGURE 1 Gram stain of Clostridium histolyticum16 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 of our knowledge, no molecular typing methods have ever been ap- plied to this organism as it is so rarely isolated from clinical material. Figures 2 and 3 show the results of pulsed-field gel electrophore- sis (PFGE) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping analy-sis respectively, of DNA extracted from the twelve IDU isolates andcomparator strains. All the IDU isolates of C. histolyticum were in- distinguishable by both methods and showed different DNA profilesto the NCTC strains. The one wild isolate detailed above also had a distinct profile. Discussion Referrals of C. histolyticum from human material are so rare that previously the ARL had received just one clinical isolate of C. his- tolyticum in the preceding 20 years from an infected crushed-hand in- jury in an agricultural worker.C. histolyticum is a member of the gas-gangrene group of clostridia that may be isolated from soil, bone-meal and gelatin. It producespotent exotoxins that have proteolytic and necrotising propertiescausing severe localised necrosis. However, these toxins do not elicitthe systemic effects that caused such dramatic loss of life as seen in theC. novyi - associated outbreak in 2000. The referrals had originated from hospitals in nine different towns or cities around England and Scotland including Glasgow, London,Brighton, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Banbury, Liverpool, Derby and Nottingham. The patient demography was 2:1, females to males,and the average age was 35 years. This ratio is at odds with the usualdemography of IDUs in which males usually predominate and infec-tion may be related to a higher ratio of skin and muscle 'poppers'among women who have difficulty injecting into a vein. The patientshad mostly presented at Accident and Emergency Units where de-brided material was sent for microbiological investigation to the on-site diagnostic bacteriology departments. T en referrals were isolatesfrom such material and two were from blood cultures. In some cases,mixed clostridia were isolated and the local laboratories then referredthese unusual isolates to the ARL for identification as is commonpractice. Although the isolates are from as far apart as London and Glasgow, the results of this typing investigation suggests a common source tothese infections. The most probable scenario is a batch of heroin thatwas contaminated quite early in the production or supply chain priorto distribution within the United Kingdom (UK). Interestingly, this outbreak appears only to be affecting the UK as, to date, there have beenno reports of C. histolyticum infections in IDUs in other countries. The outbreak appears to be ongoing as we have received several more re-ferrals since April 2004 and this intelligence needs to be cascaded todrug support workers in the field and also to medical staff, particu-larly in accident and emergency units. Diagnostic microbiology de-partments should also be alerted to infections in IDU's presentingwith severe local necrosis at injection sites and pay attention to any un- usual clostridia isolated. UK drug support organisations highlightedthis problem in 2000 during the C. novyi outbreak advising users not to inject heroin into tissues if at all possible and this warning should be repeated. Other European countries should also be alert in case sup-ply routes of contaminated heroin alter.

W van Pelt1, D Mevius2, HG Stoelhorst3, S Kovats4, AW van de Giessen1, W Wannet1, YTHP Duynhoven1 In June 2003, the NSC (Dutch National Salmonella Centre) reported a significant excess isolation rate of Salmonella Enteritidis when com- pared with earlier years in most regional public health laboratories.By the end of 2003, this amounted to an extra 540 laboratory con-firmed cases for the whole of the Netherlands, which implies an es-timated 7500 extra cases of gastroenteritis caused by S. Enteritidisin the general population, an increase of 50% on previous years.The hot summer could not explain the findings. Strong evidence hasbeen found to suggest that the increase in importation of salmonellacontaminated eggs, as a side effect of a concurrent avian influenzaoutbreak, was the most probable reason for this excess. Euro Surveill 2004;9:17-19 Key words : Salmonella, outbreak, avian influenza, Netherlands Introduction In June 2003, the Dutch National Salmonella Centre reported a significant excess Salmonella isolation rate compared to previousyears in most regional public health laboratories (FIGURE 1). Beginning in May 2003, the number of laboratory confirmed casesclearly increased to above the level expected [1], and from June toNovember, and again since the beginning of 2004, to above the level of tolerance (a measure for the significance of an excess). This in-crease involved only Salmonella Enteritidis ,and not S. Typhimurium (ST), or other Salmonella serotypes or Campylobacter spp. In this pa- per, we try to indicate the possible role in the 2003 excess of the hotsummer compared with that of the increase of imports of (contam-inated) eggs due to the concurrent avian influenza outbreak. Salmonella surveillance The data are from the National Salmonella Centre (NSC) and the National and European Reference Laboratory (CRL) for Salmonella at RIVM that performs the sero- and phage-typing of isolates takenfrom humans (mostly sent by regional public health laboratories,cov-ering 64% of the Dutch population) and animals, from food, animalfeed and from the environment [2]. The sensitivity to various an-tibiotics has been quantitatively determined by the minimal inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) at the Centraal Instituut voor DierziekteControle - Lelystad (CIDC- Central Institute of Animal Disease Control) [3]. 1. National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthove n, the Netherlands 2. Central Institute for Animal Disease Control (CIDC), Lelystad, the Netherlands 3. Product Boards for Livestock, Meat and Eggs, Zoetermeer, the Netherlands 4. London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United KingdomThe excess isolation rate of S. Enteritidis since May 2003 amounted to an extra 540 laboratory confirmed cases for the whole of the Netherlands at the end of 2003 (FIGURE 2, adjusted for the 64% cov- erage of the laboratory surveillance). This is 50% higher than excessesfound in previous years. Figure 2 shows that the large increase of casesinvolved S. Enteritidis only. Extrapolation using data from a 1999 study[4], then 540 extra laboratory confirmed cases would mean an estimated7500 extra cases of gastroenteritis caused by S. Enteritidis in the totalpopulation. Denmark has a laboratory surveillance system compara-ble to that of the Netherlands, and a Danish study has shown that,when compared with controls, 1.5-2.1% of the laboratory confirmedpatients with salmonellosis die within one year, probably due to the in-fection [5]. This would mean that the 2003 excess S. Enteritidis infec-tions in the Netherlands caused 8-11 deaths. Hot summer The excess of SE cases in June and July was at first attributed to the exceptionally hot weather that lasted until August, when tempera- tures were far higher than normal for that time of year [FIGURE 2].This was suggested by the findings in the WHO cCASHh (project(climate Change and Adaptation Strategies for Human health inEurope: http://www.who.dk/ccashh ) of time series analysis of sal- monellosis in 10 European countries. An additional effect of tem-perature was demonstrated clearly on the risk for food poisoning, apart from a general effect of season itself [6]. In the Dutch data (cov-ering the period 1984-2001) this effect was exceptionally strong for S.Enteritidis (a linear 12.6% increase per oC). The largest effect of tem-perature is one week before onset of illness, with diminishing butpositive effects up to 5 weeks [6]. Earlier calculations of our own,that more strongly adjust for season (covering 1990-1998), illustratethese findings [FIGURE 3].

Enteritidi s isolates per week DecJan 2003Feb Mar AprMay Jun Aug Sep Oct Nov DecJan Mar Jul JulTolera nce Expected Observed Sourc e: Widdowson MA et al(2003)Above a threshold of about 6\u00b0C the risk linearly increases; most strongly for S. Enteritidis but, in the Netherlands, hardly so for ST. Thedifference between S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium probably derivesfrom the traditional food preparation of the main food vehicle for S.Enteritidis, eggs, sometimes processed and consumed raw, whereas S.Typhimurium is mainly associated with meat from pigs and cattle that normally get a proper heat treatment. However,an inquiry among the members of the Enter-net sur- veillance network revealed that most European countries had not ex- perienced an excess of Salmonella infections during the same timeperiod, with the exception of Belgium, and England and Wales.Therefore the hot summer was unlikely to have had a major role in theexcess.. Furthermore, figure 2 shows that the 'hot summer' occurred during the months of June, July and -August, when temperatureswere on average between 1 and 2.5\u00b0C above normal. This period was followed by two months when temperatures that were below normal.Clearly, a 7-13% increase per \u00b0C cannot explain the 50% excess ofcases at the end of the year. Note that due to the lag of about oneweek between temperature changes and the onset of disease and an- other three weeks until the laboratory results appear, the temperaturefindings in figure 2 should be compared with the surveillance findingsof one month later. Raw shell eggs Surveillance programmes in the Netherlands show that the Salmonella control programme for poultry has been successful in re-ducing S. Enteritidis in broilers almost to exclusion [7]. However, incommercial layers in 2003, more than 6% (9% in 2001 and 14% in 1997) of the flocks remained S. Enteritidis positive (7). This makes rawshell eggs the main suspect food vehicle for causing the 2003 excessof S. Enteritidis infections in humans. However, phage typing of S.Enteritidis, combined with antimicrobial resistance testing, showed re-markable differences between human and poultry isolates, pointingto a source from outside the Netherlands [3]. In 2003, twice as much phage type 1 (PT 1) was found among S. Enteritidis isolates fromDutch patients (14.5%) as between 1998-2002, 54% of them being re-sistant to nalidixic acid (Na) and with decreased susceptibility tociprofloxacin. Between 1998-2003, PT 1 accounted for about 5% of allS. Enteritidis poultry isolates (SE isolates derive almost exclusivelyfrom layer flocks , but none of these were resistant to nalidixic acid.Human infections with PT 1(Na) in the Netherlands appeared to be travel-related three times more often than other S. Enteritidis phage types, and more than 50% of PT1(Na) infections were related to travel to Spain and Portugal . A series of outbreaks with S. Enteritidis in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2002 and again in 2003 [8] led to several investigations of raw shelleggs [9,10]. Among a range of other phage types, PT 1(Na) was foundto be associated with Spanish eggs. Salmonella was found in 0.3% of the eggs produced in the UK and in 5.1% and 6.7% in two surveys ofeggs imported from Spain and was high as well (7.7%) in other im-ports where the country of origin was unknown. Salmonella wasfound in only 0-0.03% of eggs produced in Holland [11], i.e. 10 and160 times lower than eggs produced in the UK and Spain respectively.It is nevertheless estimated that about 35% human salmonellosis cases in the Netherlands are due to consumption of eggs [11]. Avian Influenza outbreak in poultry The Netherlands experienced a major outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in the spring of 2003 that led to a shortage of eggs on theDutch market. Data from EUROSTAT [FIGURE 4] shows that thisshortage was compensated for with egg imports, mainly from Germany,Italy and Spain (>8-fold increase in the 2 ndquarter of 2003 as com- pared to former quarters) . In the fourth quarter of 2003, the num-ber of imported eggs was still considerably higher than in formeryears. In fact the contribution of eggs imported from the new EU member states , negligible in previous years, continued to increase anddoubled in the second half of 2003. Figure 1 shows that in the firstmonths of 2004 there was still an excess of S. Enteritidis cases, now pre-dominantly PT 8. PT 8 has been reported as a problem in the poul-try industry in several new member states in central Europe (personal communication with NRL and ENTERNET colleagues) . For several years, central European countries have been the number one desti- nation of travellers that returned with a PT 8 infection. 18 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 Outbreaks report FIGURE 2 Cumulative number of laboratory confirmed cases of salmo- nellosis in excess of expected* and monthly average day tem-peratures for 2003 in the Netherlands * See fi gure 1-50050100150200250300350400450500550 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct NovDec-6-5-4-3-2-10123 S.

Enteritidis when compared withprevious years . The hot summer of 2003 could not explain the find-ings. Strong evidence was found to suggest that the increase in im-portation of contaminated eggs, as a result of the avian influenzaoutbreak, was the most probable reason for this excess. The lesson is that with the low level of contamination in Dutch eggs, even small increases in imports of eggs that are relatively highly con- taminated with S. Enteritidis, may have a large impact on the incidenceof human salmonellosis, and may strongly affect both morbidity andmortality. Hence, major changes in market supply should initially beconsidered as a potential serious public health threat. Continuous surveillance, especially of imported eggs, is therefore strongly rec-ommended. The approaching impleme ntation of a harmonized sys- tem for monitoring and control of Salmonella spp. in flocks of laying hens in all EU Member States (EC Zoonosis Regulation 2160/2003 isan important, and constructive development in this respect. Trace back of the source of salmonellosis cases, serotyping and phage typing of positive findings, together with testing for antimicrobialresistance, are essential for decision making and providing a basis for intervention.References 1.

EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 19The Basic Surveillance Network was started in 2000 and is one of the networks on infectious diseases funded by the EuropeanCommission. The network collects and makes readily available ba-sic surveillance data on infectious diseases from all the 'old' (pre-2004) European Union member states. The aim is to provide easyaccess to descriptive data that already exist in national databases,so that it is possible to monitor and compare incidence trends forinfectious diseases in the EU member states. The list of diseases covered by the network has recently been ex-panded from 10 initial 'pilot' diseases to over 40 diseases listed bythe EU to be under surveillance. In the near future, the new mem-ber states will be invited to participate in the network.Data are case-based and comprise date of onset of disease, age andsex. Only a very short list of disease specific additional variables,such as country of infection or immunisation status, is collected.Classification of cases ( possible, probable, confirmed) is specifiedaccording to EU case definitions. The participants of the network have access to an internal web site were all the data is presented in tables and graphs. An open web-site is available for the public at https://www.eubsn.org./BSN/ Euro Surveill 2004;9:19-22 Key words : Surveillance, in fectious dise ases, database Introduction In September 1998, a proposal from the European Commission was adopted as a Decision of the European Parliament and Council(2119/98/EC) to set up a network for the epidemiological surveil-lance and control of communicable diseases in the EuropeanCommunity. With this legal document as a background, several projects to de- velop designated surveillance networks (DSN) have been funded by the Commission and they are now operating at the European level (fordiseases such as salmonellosis, legionellosis, tuberculosis andHIV/AIDS). Each one of them is collecting data at a detailed leveland most of them have objectives beyond routine surveillance 1. Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, Stockholm, Sweden20 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3Euroroundup (surveillance that only includes information collected on a regular ba- sis in a majority of European Union (EU) countries and by methods usedby regular national surveillance systems). Some examples of these ex- tended objectives used in different networks include: the collection of strains for the further study of resistance mechanisms; surveillance ofantibiotic resistance; and to function as an early warning system for out-breaks in travellers [1-3]. T o fulfil this type of detailed surveillance, a con-siderable input is often needed from the member states. Epidemiologistsat the reporting institutes have to fill in manually questionnaires sentout by DSN at a regular basis. The different networks' case definitionsmay differ both from the one proposed by the EU and from the one usednationally. Age grouping can also vary between, for example, the WorldHealth Organization and a DSN for the same disease. A later EU decision listed some 40 diseases that should be under surveillance [4]. T oday there is no single source of routine surveillancedata for these diseases; many of them are not covered by a specific net-work and even when covered the data does not necessarily mirror the national surveillance data. An easy one-step access to simple de-scriptive data on numbers and incidences would be useful. To conclude, there is a need for a surveillance network at the European level that handles rare diseases and also collects basic or 'generic' information on the other listed infectious diseases using the three-level system for case definitions (possible, probable, confirmed). The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI) ap- plied for funding of a project to establish this network, and an agree-ment between the Commission and SMI was reached whereby SMIwas to coordinate the formation of a Basic Surveillance Network(BSN). BSN was started in 2000. Objectives The key objective of the BSN project is to create a standard, passive system for sharing basic surveillance data, in order to detect and mon-itor incidence trends for infectious diseases in Europe. A long term ob-jective is to promote activities that make national data more comparablethan they are today. An example is the use of EU case definitions. Method One epidemiologist and one database manager have been identi- fied at each national institute for infectious disease control in the(then) 15 EU member states plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.Together with these designated participants, a programme to fulfil the objectives has been developed. The following are the main prin-ciples of this programme that the participants have agreed on. Theguiding principle has been to find a level of detail and frequency thatis as low as possible, yet still useful: BSN collects data that already exist in national databases. Data are case-based, and include age, sex, report date. Classification of cases are specified (possible, probable, confirmed), based on the EUcase definitions. If case-based data are unavailable, aggregated data willbe collected. Only a short list of additional variables for each disease is collected [ TABLE 1]. The BSN database is updated on a monthly basis. Data collection: data are transferred from the national databases in a predefined format in xml or comma separated files. Before dataare added to the common database, they are checked for consistencyand adherence to the predefined format, and all exceptions found areclarified. The data are first published on the participating country'sprivate web page,on the BSN internal website, where only the send-ing country can review them. During the first week of the followingmonth, the new data are added to the common database. Aggregated data from the common database are accessible for all network members via the internal website. A module for stan-dardised output to a public website has been created. T o increase theinterpretation of data, countries can add comments to the graphicalpresentation of the aggregated data, shown on the public website.Activities Annual meetings of all participating partners are held to discuss principles of operation and collaboration. Several temporary and onepermanent working group have worked on various epidemiologicaland data management issues. T en pilot diseases have been chosen forreports [table 1]. They were selected to represent a wide range of dif- ferent epidemiological characteristics, not in terms of public health pri-ority, but primarily to test the feasibility of the collection and transferprotocols set up. Data has been collected since 2000 and some countries have also reported historical data in monthly aggregated format since 1995. Historical data make the time series longer and facilitate detection of trends. There is a variation between the members of the network on how many diseases can ben reported to the network, and how often.Some can deliver data on all ten diseases, others on six or three, andothers on none [ TABLE 2]. There are several reasons behind these dif- ferences. It may be that a specific disease is not under surveillance inthe country, that the information is not stored in a computeriseddatabase, that the data are not stored at national but at county levelor other reasons that make reporting impossible. The designated participants of the network have access to an inter- nal website where surveillance data are presented in various ways. TheBSN focuses on numbers and incidence rates and their trends over time.

This is not currently possible to find, as most of the dedicated (disease specific) surveillance networksdo not collect data on all national cases, but rather on a subset. Thismeans that BSN will provide health professionals and the public withdescriptive data on reported diseases. The network will not be a toolin itself to answer more complicated questions such as 'why has theincidence for hepatitis A in country X increased between 00-02?. It can,however, be a positive stimulus for professionals to initiate further EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 21investigative and analytical work, and furthermore provide them with information on incidence trends in other EU countries when theyexperience changes in their own countries. There are numerous additional benefits that have been identified during the development of the network. Bringing database managers from the national institutes together for the first time made it possible to examine a number of questions from a new angle. Several of the coun-tries were at different stages of developing new or updated versions of computerised reporting systems when the project started. The meeting of the database managers made it possible to exchange ideas and facil-itated and improved the development of some of these systems. Among epidemiologists, discussion on interpretation of data has been possible in a new forum, and detection of major shifts in trendsand difference between different countries can be identified andanalysed at a multinational level.As with all surveillance networks, there are a number of inherent problems. When pooling incidence of diseases from individual coun-tries based on data from their national surveillance systems, there are a number of obstacles to be faced regarding case definitions and otherfactors that will influence the number of cases reported. Althoughthere are common case definitions for the infectious diseases undersurveillance specified in Decision 2002/253/EC (19.3.2002), this onlysolves a small part of the problem. Other, more country specific fac-tors, such as the tendency of people to seek medical care, different di- agnostic methods in use, and the percentage of physicians sending innotifications probably have an impact on the numbers reported. Another problem is that it takes time before data series become long enough to make trends in disease incidence obvious. Before this out-put can be produced, there is a risk that countries providing data andusing the services will not perceive the output as valuable, and mightDiseaseMode of tr ansmis sion (Heterosexual,other, unknown)Country of x xShigellosis x x Syphilis x x Trichinosis x Yersinosis x Expanded list of diseases AIDS xAnthrax x xBrucel losis x Campylobacterosis x Chlamydia x Cholera x Congo-Crimean fever xCryptosporidiosis x Diphtheria x x xEbola x x Echinoco ccosis x EHEC x xGiardiasis x H. influenzae type b, invasive x Hepatitis B x x Hepatitis C x HIV xInfluenza x Lassa fever xLegionellosis xListeriosis x diseas e, invasive x x Mumps x Pertussis x Plague x Pneumoccocus, invasive xx Polio x x Q-fever x Rabies x xRubella x Smallpox x x Tetanus x xTuberculosis x Tularaemia xTyphoid/Paratyphoid fever x x vCJD x Yellow fever x xTABLE 1 List of additional variables collected for each diseaseSEVERE DISEASE DUE TO GROUP A STREPTOC OCCUS IN BELGIUM G Hanquet1, H Goossens2, G V Gilbert5, Vergison7, G Ducoffre1, E Van Cleemput1, C Epidemiology section, Institut Scientifique de Sant\u00e9 Publique , Brussels, Belgium 2 Department of Microbiology and National Reference Centre S. pyogenes, Universi ty of Antwerp, Belgium 3 Gezondheidsinspectie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap, Brussels, Belgium4 Health inspectorate, French Enfants Belgium Published online 24 June 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040624.asp) In April 2004, a dozen invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infec- tions were reported by several hospitals in Brussels and Flanders. Mostof the cases presented with a severe clinical picture requiring intensivecare. Four deaths were reported in a one week period (14-18 April). Inthe same period, the Streptococcus pyogenes reference laboratory at the University of Antwerp also reported a sudden increase in the number of invasive GAS isolates submitted in April. A working group on invasive GAS disease was immediately created, including epidemiologists from the Institut Scientifique de Sant\u00e9Publique (Scientific Institute of Public Health,IPH), health officials from the three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels), clinicians,and staff from the reference laboratory. It was decided to enhancethe surveillance of GAS in Belgium. On 22 April, letters were sent tothe Belgian microbiology laboratories, asking them to report epidemi-ological data on every invasive GAS infection to the regional authori-ties and to send isolates to the reference laboratory for typing andfurther analyses. GAS is one of the pathogens monitored by the Belgian network of sentinel laboratories. This network involves the voluntary participa-tion of 59% of all Belgian microbiology laboratories (2004) and 38 ref-erence laboratories specialised in specific pathogens. The surveillance of GAS by this network has been ongoing since 1994 (but does not col-lect clinical or risk factor data). In addition, any severe communica-ble disease with potentially epidemic characteristics must be notifiedOUTBR EAK DISPATCHES by law to the regional health authorities. Data from these different sources are currently compiled at the IPH. In the 2 month period 1 April - 31 May 2004, 55 cases of invasive GAS infections were reported from the three regions, including 6deaths (outcome reported in 15 cases). Twenty nine per cent of the cases(n=15) were in patients under 5 years old, and 69% were in adults (20years and older, n=36). In the 25 cases for which the clinical picture has been reported, 56% (n=14) presented as septicaemia with or with-out toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Other frequent clinical presenta-tions were pneumonia, empyema and necrotising fasciitis. On the 6reported deaths, in 2 children and 4 adults, 5 presented with septicaemia and/or TSS. No geographic clustering was observed. Isolates have been sent and typed at the reference laboratory for 75% (n=41) of the reported cases. GAS was isolated mainly from blood(71%), pleural fluid, synovial fluid and wounds. Thirty nine percentof were emm type 1 and 24% (n=10) emm 100-104. Isolates were susceptible to common antibiotics, such as the beta-lac- tams and macrolides. In comparison, over the whole of 2003, only 93 isolates from in- vasive sites were received by the GAS reference laboratory. Althoughthe increase in 2004 is at least partly due to strengthened surveillance,the predominant emm types of the current episode and the severe clinical outcomes and presentations observed in 2004 suggest theemergence of more virulent strains. Since June 2004, the surveillance has been expanded to include other health professionals involved in GAS management, and a standard ques-tionnaire has been sent to all intensive care physicians, emergency physi-cians, infection control practitioners and microbiology laboratories. Severe invasive S. pyogenes infections and deaths have been re- ported with increased frequency in the last 2 decades in the UnitedStates and Canada [1,2]. Some European countries, such as Norway,Sweden and the United Kingdom, have also reported increases in se- vere invasive GAS infections [3,4]. Several studies have also described that M1 isolates were associated with severe disease such as toxicshock-like syndrome [5,6].

The jamboree ended on 5 August and several more cases have been reportedin the past seven days. Since the shedding of norovirus continues af-ter recovery from illness, and can also occur in the absence of illness, thorough hygienic measures, emphasising handwashing, of all par-ticipants leaving the camp will be essential to reduce further spreadof the virus.

Thirty five participants were ill onthe last night, and two children were ill before the start of the campon 26 July. Symptoms have generally been mild with most patients experi- encing vomiting and diarrhoea, although 47 patients were admittedto a local hospital for rehydration. Infection control measures have been put in place in order to contain the outbreak. The regional munici-pal health service (GGD Hart voor Brabant) has been involved inmanaging the has been epidemiologically im-plicated as the causative agent. The presence of norovirus confirmed in vomit at the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM, NationalInstitute of Public Health) using a standard RT-PCR protocol. Faecal samples are currently under investigation. The two children, one fromScotland and one from the Netherlands, who are reported to havebeen ill before joining the summer camp may be the index cases, butwe have not yet been able to obtain and analyse samples from these two children. From the first series of positive samples, 4 noroviruseshave been sequenced for typing, and this yielded three norovirus vari-ants: NoV (\"Malta\"), NoV GGI.5 (\"Butlins\") and GGII.4(\"Grimsby\"). Sequencing of other positive samples (mostly vomit)from the outbreak is in progress. In this outbreak, there are clear indications of multiple introduc- tions of viruses by sick people., Ge nerally, the presence of more than one virus strain in an outbreak is indicative of food- or waterborneintroduction. Preliminary epidemiological data do not implicate foodas a vector in this outbreak. The scouts had swum in a recreational lakethat complied with European standards for faecal contamination.Currently, water samples are being analysed for the presence of norovirus. Questionnaires have been distributed among the scouts, anddata collection and analysis is ongoing.

The major route of transmission from animals to humans is by infected aerosols. Over the past decade, the number of both sporadiccases and outbreaks in Bulgaria has increased. This may be associatedwith changes in livestock breeding on goat, sheep and cattle farms, as livestock are the usual sources of C. burnetii outbreaks in humans. During the 1990s, economic and social changes led to a decrease oflarger cattle herds and sheep flocks in rural areas and an increase ofthe number of cattle kept on small farms, and this has intensifiedcontact between farm animals and people. Investigation In early May 2004, an increase was noted in the number of pneu- monia cases in patients attending a clinic in Botevgrad (population28 000, situated 60 km northeast of the capital Sofia). At first, thesecases, diagnosed as atypical pneumonia, did not have Q fever in thedifferential diagnosis and were not thought to be associated with anyoutbreak. On 11 May, the Hygiene and Epidemiological Inspectorate(HEI) was informed of a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia. On12 May, an epidemiological and clinical investigation was started, andcommon characteristics suggested Q fever. Two days later, the first positive serological results were obtained with antibodies to phase IIC. burnetii antigen in hospitalised patients. Immediately the HEI, together with the veterinary and municipality authorities, implemented preventive measures to stop the outbreak inBotevgrad. The public was informed through mass media of the riskof the disease, the route and prevention of transmission, as well as theneed to properly dispose of al l animal birth products (including aborted foetuses), to restrict access to barns and animals and to useprotective clothing during contact with animals. Proper decontami-nation of surfaces with disinfectants and not drinking unpasteurisedmilk was recommended. Despite this, the number of patients continuedto grow,because of the large number of people already infected who were incubating the disease. Between 1 May and 9 June the number of patients admitted to hospital that were diagnosed with atypicalpneumonia in Botevgrad reached 220 (FIGURE).24 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 Laboratory analyses detected leucopenia (white blood cell<3.5x109/l) in 33% (16), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 65% (31) andmild elevation of aminotransferase activity in 29% (14). During the investigation, patients often reported being in a dust storm, which occurred at the beginning of May and probably coveredthe whole town. Only a few patients reported direct contact with animals. DiscussionThe apparent reason for the outb reak of atypical pneumonia due to C. burnetii was the inhalation of infected aerosols. The occur- rence of the dust storm supports the infected aerosol hypothesis. The large number of infected domestic animals (nearly 40% of goats investigated were found to carry C burnetii ) in the town may have been the cause. The character of pneumonic illnesses duringMay implies a point source. A comparatively large number of general practitioners in Bulgaria are not acquainted with the clinical features and epidemiology of Qfever, which may have led to delays in diagnosis and treatment. This may also have delayed notification of Q fever to the HEI, hence thelate implementation of preventive measures This slow reaction by thehealth authorities emphasises the necessity of enhancement of the epi-demiological surveillance in Bulgaria. The early diagnosis of Q fever in risk regions can be helped by epi- demiological data on morbidity due to influenza-like illnesses andatypical pneumonia. In such conditions, physicians must treat withappropriate antibiotics before serological confirmation of the diag-nosis of Q fever. To e n sure improved prevention of Q fever in Bulgaria, there is a need to amend legislation concerning livestock breeding in popu-lated areas, and introduce preventive measures. The public health, vet-erinary and municipal authorities must work together to educate thepopulation about the basic principles of Q fever prevention which in-cludes restricting contact between people and cattle and improvinginfection control in the places where animals are bred.

Brussels, Belgium Published online 12 August 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040812.asp) In July 2004, the health inspectorate of the Flemish commu- nity observed a sharp increase in reports of cases of hepatitis A.Between 7 July and 10 August 80 cases were reported in theGrimbergen area (Vlaams-Brabant province) and 172 cases in Antwerp province. In comparison, 12 cases were reported in Vlaams- Brabant and 32 in Antwerp in the period January-June 2004. Cases were clustered in space and time, notably in specific towns. Most patients were young adults. The situation is being closely monitored by the Flemish health inspectorate, who are investigating the source of the outbreak and trac-ing contacts of patients. A virological study with molecular sequenceanalysis is still on going as well as a case control study. It is currently suspected that the sources are food handlers with hep- atitis A, possibly working in a meat processing plant, which suppliesmeat to butcher's shops in the Antwerp and Grimbergen area. In collaboration with the Federal Food Agency, control measures are being put in place. The general practitioners of all known pa-tients have been requested to test all direct contacts of patients and offer vaccination if required.

Of patients admitted to hospital, 72% were between 22 and 60 years old. Diagnostic titres of antibodies for phase II C. burnetii antigen were found in 91 peo- ple. Forty-eight of the 220 patients admitted to hospital were investi- gated. Seventy-five percent (36) were male and 25% (12) were fe-male.

The MV MonaLisa left Bremerhaven, northern Germany, on 28 August carrying 940 peo-ple (330 crew and 610 passengers). Most of the passengers are German. Following a welcome dinner that day, 86 people developed gas- trointestinal illness over the following four days (29 August: one case; 30 August: 25 cases; 31 August: 45 cases; 1 September: 15 cases). Theattack rates among passengers and crew are reported to be similar al-though dates of onset among crew members were mostly one daylater than among passengers. Diarrhoea was reported much more often than vomiting and two pa- tients were admitted to hospital when the ship arrived in the OrkneyIslands, off the coast of north Scotland. So far, 16 cases have been microbiologically confirmed as salmonellosis. A Scottish outbreak con-trol team is trying to determine whether a food served at the welcome dinner was the source. The ship docked in Dover, England, on 7September and questionnaires were collected from passengers and crew. The Scottish Salmonella Reference Laboratory has confirmed that a number of the isolates are Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 4. Since 2 September, 26 more people have become ill with gastrointestinal disease.No pathogen has yet been isolated from these patients. Seventeen patients still have symptoms. This second wave of cases raises the possibility ofa continuing common source of infection, or secondary spread ofSalmonella ,or a concurrent outbreak involving another pathogen (such as norovirus). The investigation co ntinues with the full cooperation of the ship's staff. The ship is due back in Bremerhaven on 9 September.Acknowledgement s Dr Sarah Taylor, and SCIEH colleagues in public health, micro- biology and environmental health staff.

On 17 September, the infected bat was found lying on a roadby a person in a town in southern England. The person moved it off the road onto a path where it might be safer from traffic. The bat re-mained on the ground near the path until 21 September, when the sameperson contacted a bat conservation organisation. The organisationtook care of the bat until it died on 23 September. The dead bat was sent to the national Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) as part of the routine passive surveillance system of UK bats. On 25 September, the VLA reported that it had tested positivefor EBLV-2, on the basis of fluorescent antibody tests and PCR. A media press statement was released to encourage people who had contact with the bat to seek medical advice, including the offer of precautionary post-exposure rabies vaccination ( http://www.hp a.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2004/040928_bat_rabies.htm ). This is the third bat in the UK from which EBLV-2 has been iso- lated. Previous UK cases of rabies in bats were in 1996 [1,2] and 2002[3,4]. All three of the infected bats were Daubenton's bats. Surveys carried out of captured free-living bats in Scotland and the north and south of England have found EBLV-2 antibodies inDaubenton's bats but no virus has been isolated [5,6]. This suggeststhat some species of bat may be adapted to the virus and able to re-cover from infection and become non-infectious. In 2002 in Scotland, a naturalist and licensed bat handler died from EBLV-2 infection thought to have been acquired from one of themany bats he had handled [7,8]. This case was the second human in-fection with EBLV-2 to be identified worldwide. Two deaths from a re-lated strain, EBLV-1, have also been recorded. Daubenton's bats do not tend to live near or in human habita- tions. Pipistrelle bats, one of the more common species, often roostin houses, but the virus has never been isolated from this species inthe UK. The challenge for professionals involved in prevention is to raise awareness in the general public of the small risk to human health from UK bats without creating a fear of bats, which are an importantpart of UK natural heritage and protected by law. Awareness alsoneeds to be raised in health professionals. Further information about bat species in the UK is available from the Bat Conservation Trust ( http://www.bats.org.uk/ ).TABLE Hepatitis A cases reported to the Flemish Health Inspectorate in July-August 2004 Antwerp Vlaams-Brabant Number of reported cases 7-14 July (8 days) 35 17 15-23 July (9 days) 29 110 24-29 July (6 days) 2 19 1-8 August (8 days) 18 34References 1H P A .

HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, LONDON , AUGUST -SEPTEMBER 2004 D O'Sullivan South East London Health Protection Unit, London, United Kingdom Published online 30 September 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040930.asp) An outbreak of hepatitis A in gay men in southeast London has been identified. Nine cases have so far been reported, all with symptomonset dates between mid-August and mid-September 2004 [1]. Fiveof the affected men reported visiting a gay pub in Southwark, south-east London, in the two months before they became unwell. One ofthe nine patients is a secondary case, who has a history of householdcontact with one of the five patients who had visited the pub. The pub is, in effect, a public sex environment that includes a 'dark room' where sexual activities that carry a high risk of hepatitis A transmission occur. Of the eight patients whose vaccination status is known, none had previously been vaccinated against hepatitis A. The local health protection unit is working with a number of agen- cies (including local health authorities and social and health groupsthat work with gay men) to advise gay men locally of the risk, and howthis might be minimised, including advice on immunisation. Increasingcommunity outreach work at this and similar venues, and actions to improve hygiene at the pub are being considered. Outbreaks of hepatitis A in men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported from Denmark and the Netherlands in May 2004,and in France in 2000 [2-5]. Studies have established risk factors foracquiring infection. Following a series of outbreaks of hepatitis A amongst MSM in the United Kingdom including a large outbreak in London in 1997 [5], national recommendations for hepatitis A vaccination were extendedto include MSM whose sexual behaviour is likely to put them at risk [6,7]. The provision of hepatitis A vaccination for MSM at geni-tourinary medicine clinics and outreach services appears to have been successful in controlling the 1997 outbreak. The outbreak reported heremay indicate the need to increase hepatitis A vaccination offered toMSM through these services in order to prevent a more wide-scaleproblem. The outbreak investigation team is interested in hearing aboutcases which may be related to this outbreak. Please contact Donal O'Sullivan at donal.osullivan@lambethpct.nhs.uk.

It is caused by several closely related butdistinct flaviviruses. Three subtypes are recognised at present: and TheSiberian subtype is associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted predominantly by the tick Ixodes persulcatus, whereas the European subtype causes central European encephalitisand is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. Clinical features The clinical spectrum of acute TBE ranges from symptoms of mild meningitis to severe meningoencephalitis with or without myelitis[1]. The incubation period of central European tickborne encephali-tis is seven to 14 days [2]. Onset is generally biphasic. The first phaseinvolves a non-specific influenza-like illness with fever, headache,nausea, and vomiting, lasting about a week. After a period of remis-sion lasting a few days, the fever returns with aseptic meningitis or EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 27encephalomyelitis. The case fatality rate is 1-5% and about 20% of sur- vivors have neurological sequelae. Residual motor defects are rare. Russian spring-summer encephalitis is more serious, with a more acute illness and a case fatality rate of about 20%. Up to 60% of sur-vivors are left with neurological sequelae, including flaccid paralysis. Prevention Vaccination using licensed vaccines is the only real way to prevent TBE. Two commercially available vaccines are used in Europe: new versions of Encepur produced by Chiron Behring, Germany and FSME-IMMUN by Baxter, Austria. The conventional vaccinationschedule consists of 3 doses at Day 0, 1-3 months and 9-12 monthsafter the second dose. After 30 years of development, both vaccines are now available in adult and paediatric formulations that cause few adverse side effects. Encepur is licensed for rapid immunisation at days 0, 7 and 21, and this provides protection two weeks after the second dose of vaccine.The FSME-IMMUN rapid schedule involves two vaccine doses giventwo or three weeks apart. This two dose rapid schedule is only rec-ommended for immunisation protec tion over the summer months be- cause, unlike the Encepur schedule, its protection is only optimum forsix months. TBE trends in the Czech Republic The population of the Czech Republic is near 10 million. In 2003, the approximate incidence of tickborne encephalitis was 5.9 per 100000 population. Incidence is higher in regions south of Prague nearthe city of Ceske Budejovice. There has been constantly high inci-dence near the town of Pilsen in the western part of the Czech Republic.Recently, TBE foci have been identified in the northern part of the province of Bohemia. In the east of the country there hass been ahigh incidence near Olomouc. Clinical cases of TBE are notified fromApril until November every year (FIGURE 1). FIGURE 1 Seasonality of TBE in the Czech Republic by particular months 020406080100120140160180 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Mean no. of TBE cases (1993-2003) MonthFIGURE 2 TBE incidence in the 1965-2003 012345678 1965 666768 69 7071 72 737475 76 77 78 79 8081 82 83 84 85 86 87 8889 90 91 92 93 9495 96 97 98 99 2000 2001 2002 2003 YearTBE incidence per 100 000 population also changed, possibly affecting tick survival and development rates. Changes in the geographical distribution of Ixodes ricinus have beenobserved, with ticks appearing at higher altitudes in mountains thanin earlier years [Dr. Daniel, National Institute of Public Health, Prague,personal communication, 2004] [5]. There is no direct support from state institutions to target residents in areas of high endemicity for vaccination. There is partial financialsupport for vaccination of children and adolescents under the age of18 across the whole country (with reimbursement of a single dose ofvaccine), but childhood cases tend to recover spontaneously. Privatecompanies immunise employees who work in forests. The risk of acquiring TBE has been evaluated in two published studies from the United States (US) [6] and Austria [7]. In Kosovo,the risk for members of a US military unit that trained in a highly en-demic area was evaluated. The TBE virus infection rate was 0.9/1000man-months of exposure. For an unvaccinated tourist staying for 4weeks in a highly endemic province of southern Austria (Steiermark/Styria), the risk of acquiring TBE was 1/10 000 man-months of exposure [7]. Based on total numbers of tourist overnightstays in Austria during the summer season, about 60 travel-associatedcases of clinical TBE could be expected to occur among holiday-makers after their stay in Austria. Effective and protective inactivated vaccines are available, inex- pensive and have been licensed in the Czech Republic for more than10 years. Visitors to the Czech Republic and other endemic areasshould consider three factors before deciding on whether to be vac-cinated: length of stay, place of residence (urban or rural), and whetheror not they intend to visit high risk areas (in the Czech Republic,this would be the south, and parts of western Bohemia). Vaccinationis recommended for those travellers who intend to stay longer thanthree weeks, who intend to visit rural areas in endemic regions, or whoplan to camp. References 1Haglund M, G\u00fcnter G.

No single factor can adequately explain the rising incidence of the disease in the Czech Republic. The changing weather pattern inthe past few years is a possible factor.

Vaccination Despite TBE being a very big problem in Lithuania, vaccine cov- erage is too low to control the disease: about 20 000 doses of TBEvaccine are given each year, according to official statistics. Vaccinationis recommended but the government does not provide financial as-sistance for this, and people have to pay the full costs themselves.Some employers provide vaccination for employees such as forestworkers, who, through their occupation, have a higher risk of TBE.

The incidence rate (763 cases, 22 per 100000 population) was double the average incidence over the last 10years, and was the highest annual rate recorded since notification be- gan at the end of the 1960s. This rate was also the highest of all the Balticcountries in 2003. Four lethal cases of TBE were notified in 2003. TBE is normally transmitted by a tick bite, but in 2003, 22 cases of TBE(4 clusters), were acquired by consuming unpasteurised goat's milk,a well recognised transmission route. From 1993, the TBE incidence rate in Lithuania suddenly increased to >5 per 100 000 population, a 10-fold increase compared with the pre- vious two decades. There was a further 3-fold increase in 1997/98, fol- lowed by a decrease to nearer the 1993 level, before the dramatic increaselast year (FIGURE). One explanation for the high incidence in 2003 maybe that there were higher numbers of ticks this particular year.TICKBORNE ENCEPHALITIS IN LATVIA (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040624.asp) Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) epidemiology and tick activity TBE has been notifiable in Latvia since 1955. In 1993, annual in- cidence quadrupled from the mean level of the previous two decades(nearly 8 cases per 100 000 population), reaching the highest levels in1994 and 1995 at 53 cases per 100 000. Since 1999 the incidence hasbeen significantly lower, down to 6.5 cases in 2002, but back up to 15.7per 100 000 in 2003 (FIGURE). About 60% of TBE cases over the last10 years affected the meninges, about 30% were febrile and 10% hadthe most severe clinical course, meningoencephalitis. 0510152025 1970 75 80 85 90 95 2000YearTBE incidence per 100 000 population TBE has a strict seasonal pattern, probably due largely to seasonal patterns of tick activity and human visits to the forests. In 2003 mostTBE cases were registered in September and October, as usual. Thehighest incidences of TBE, about 80% of all notified cases, are recordedevery year in the northern and central part of the country, mainly in three counties: Kaunas, Panevezys and Siauliai. In 2003, the inci-dence rate in these areas was the same, but incidence rates were muchhigher in many other counties. Eight districts out of 44 reported a 2-5 times higher incidence rate than the average incidence in Lithuania.The highest incidence rate was in Panevezys, at about 100 per 100 000population. In Lithuania, TBE affects 1.4 times as many males as females. People from rural areas are 1.7 times more affected than people liv- ing in urban areas. This has stayed constant over the last 10 years.About40% of all cases of TBE were in retired and unemployed people, whoconstitute a particular risk group. This number has stayed relatively constant over the past few years. One reason could be that these peo- ple are more likely to collect mushrooms and berries, which can serveas an additional source of income. TBE incidence is about 2-3 times higher in adults than in children. Typically, 20% of all cases of TBE in Lithuania are in people over 60.60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1970 75 80 85 90 95 2000 Years There are two tick species in Latvia, Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes per- sulcatus. I. ricinus has two seasonal activity peaks in the western and central part of Latvia. I. persulcatus has only one spring activity peak and predominates in the eastern part of the country. According tomonitoring data, the abundance of ticks has increased since 1994,with the highest peaks of I. ricinus tick activity recorded in 1998 and 2000, which does not match the epidemiological pattern exactly. The highest TBE virus (TBEV) prevalence in field-collected ticks was observed in 1995 (28.4%), 1996 (10.8%) and 2002 (9.2%). Apart fromthese three years, over the whole observation period since 1973, the meanSource: SE Randolph (personal communication, 2004) and International Working Grou p on TBE ( http://www.tbe-info.com/epidemiology/index.html ) Source: SE Randolph (personal communication, p on TBE ( http://www.tbe-info.com/epidemiology/index.html ) ^EUROSURVEILLANCE .eurosurveillance.org 29annual TBEV prevalence rate in field-collected ticks was about 3%. Tests on ticks engorged with human blood, brought to the vac- cination service by members of the public, started in 1998. TheTBEV prevalence rate in these ticks was found to be much higher,about 30%. Typing of TBEV isolated from ticks and patient serum samples in collaboration with German and Swedish virologists revealed that the viruses belong to Far Eastern and Western subtypes and are highly homologous with the Vasilchenko ,Neudoerfl and Sofyn strains previ- ously described [2,3,4]. Vaccination Annual changes in TBE morbidity depend on factors other than tick activity, such as vaccination, awareness campaigns, changes in usualrecreation due to weather, etc. There is a significant correlation between marked decreases in TBE morbidity and increases in vaccination coverage. According to theincomplete data from vaccination services, which are mostly privatelyrun and not obliged to submit statistical data, the number of completely vaccinated people since 1993 rose 3-5-fold. Vaccine uptake accordingto the recommended vaccination schedule improved during the last decade, when the number of second and third doses came nearer tothe number of first doses. The number of booster doses also increasedsignificantly. Each year, the demand for immunisation is usually high-est during April, May and June, when tick activity first peaks andawareness of the problem is higher. In 1994, a campaign to vaccinate children against TBE began in areas of high TBE risk in Latvia. There are 5 rural areas where childTBE incidence level exceeded the mean level in country (20 cases per100 000 children); in areas with the highest TBE incidence, the lev-els exceeded the mean by more than six times. These became a vac-cination priority and 75% of children in these rural districts arenow covered. Vaccination in the two highest risk groups of infected territories was completed in 1998. Altogether, children have been vaccinatedin more than 100 rural districts. The childhood vaccination cam-paign was funded by humanitarian aid (51%) and national budget(49%), and this has brought the child TBE incidence in high risk ar-eas down to a rate similar to the mean in the whole country since1999. However,according to predictions (which were calculated using the child TBE incidence rate over previous five years), the theoretical morbidity in high-risk rural districts could exceed the rate from no-tified data more than 5 times. According to official statistics, the immunisation coverage for the whole population of Latvia is about 5%, but results of a population survey of TBE prophylaxis awareness (1000 respondents) suggestedthe percentage of vaccinated adults was higher: 15% people on lowincomes and 26% of all respondents reported that they had beenvaccinated.

There were 87 cases of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in Austria in 2003: an incidencerate of 1.09 per 100 000. In 2002, there were 51 cases and 2002, 60 cases. Regions most affected by TBE are in the south: Steiermark (Styria) and K\u00e4rnten (Carinthia).30 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 All of these cases were in unvaccinated people or people who had not had the vaccine according to the recommended schedule. In thepast five years, vaccine coverage of the entire population has risenfrom 79% to 87%. The coverage rate for very young children andpeople over 65 is under 70%. This lower coverage in older peoplerepresents the biggest challenge for prevention of TBE in Austria. Vaccination is not free, but health insurance companies pay part of the cost (this varies according to region). Denmark TBE is not a notifiable disease in Denmark. The only area where there is a risk of acquiring TBE is the island of Bornholm. People who live on Bornholm permanently or have a summer hol- iday home there are advised to get vaccinated if they do activitieswhich involve leaving the designated paths in woods or scrubland.Tourists and school parties are not considered to require vaccination unless participating in activities that take place in a fixed location inthe woods. Finland TBE is a notifiable disease in Finland. The absolute number of TBE cases has risen from an annual 10-20 in the 1990s to over 40 casesin 2001 (population 5.2 million). The incidence of identified casesis highest (i.e. over 100/100 000/year) on the island of \u00c5land, whichis situated between Finland and Sweden. According to antibodyanalyses, approximately every one in five \u00c5landers is infected dur-ing his or her lifetime. TBE infections are rare in children and ado-lescents. In addition to the \u00c5landers, approximately 10 Swedesannually fall ill with TBE after visiting \u00c5land. Foci of TBE also ex-ist elsewhere in Finland, for example in the Turku archipelago, andin some areas of southeast Finland, around Kokkola and on Isosaari,which is close to Helsinki. The National Public Health Institute (KTL) recommends vacci- nation against TBE for all those over 7 years of age who reside orspend long periods in the known endemic areas. The vaccine is not,however, currently part of the Finnish national immunisation pro-gramme. A TBE vaccination subcommittee of KTL has recently com- pleted an analysis of the TBE disease burden on \u00c5land and the impactof the different vaccination strategies, including cost-effectiveness,and whether the vaccine should be given free of charge. Germany TBE is notifiable in Germany. In 2003, 276 cases of TBE were noti- fied (2002: 239; 2001: 256). These occurred in southern Germanyin the federal states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (42%) and Bavaria (38%). Counties in Germany are classified according to three levels of TBE risk. A county is classified as a 'high risk area' if at least 25 TBEcases occurred within a 5 year period between 1984-2003 and as a 'riskarea' if at least 2 cases occurred within a single year or at least 5 casesoccurred within a 5 year period between 1984-2003. Areas are de-clared to be TBE endemic areas based on elevated TBE seropreva-lence in studies in non-immunised forestry workers. In 2003, three newdistricts were identified as risk areas. Seventy four of Germany's 440counties are currently classified as TBE risk areas and 9 as high risk areas. They are located in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (30), Bavaria (45),Hesse (4), Thuringia (3) and Rhineland-Palatinate. A further 5 coun- ties in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg are classified as endemic seroprevalence studies. (see map: http://www.rki.de/INFEKT/EPIBULL/2004/FSME Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) recommends TBE vaccination for persons at risk of tick exposure in high risk andrisk areas. Hungary TBE has been mandatory notifiable in Hungary since 1977, and data are collected by the \"B\u00e9la Johan\" National Center for Epidemiology(formerly the National Institute of Public Health). Samples from patients with aseptic meningitis and encephalitis have been regu-larly tested for TBE at the centre's division of virology since 1958,which is the only diagnostic laboratory for TBE in Hungary. The av-erage yearly incidence between 1977 and 1996 was 2.5 per 100 000population (range 1.3 to 3.8), with the highest incidences between1981 and 1990. From 1997 to 2000, a significant decrease in the num-ber of the registered/diagnosed TBE cases were observed, with inci-dence of 0.5 per 100 000 in 2000. Since 2001, the incidence has beenslowly increasing again. In the last 3 years the yearly average of thereported cases was 63. The high risk areas are the counties of Zala, Somogy, Vas (western Hungary) and N\u00f3gr\u00e1d (northern Hungary), which are in the areas of the known natural foci (Central and Western Transdanubia, and thenorthern central mountain chain). Vaccination for the highest risk groups (forestry and agriculture workers, etc.) was introduced in 1977. Vaccination is carried out by campaigns that are organised and controlled by the state. Since 1991,TBE vaccine has been available for all, through purchase at pharma-cies, and employers must ensure the vaccination of employees. No de-tailed data on TBE vaccination coverage is currently available, althougha rough estimate is that 5% of the population has been vaccinated,mostly people living in high risk areas. Norway All cases of encephalitis are notifiable in Norway, including TBE. In 2003, one case of TBE was reported. Only eight cases of TBE acquired in Norway have so far ever been reported. The first casewas identified in 1998. All cases were acquired within a limited areaon the southern coast, and four were diagnosed in the municipal-ity of Trom\u00f8y. A study done among regular patients attending ahealth center in Trom\u00f8y showed a seroprevalence of 2.4% withTBEV antibodies [4]. This area probably represents a small focus ofthe disease in Norway. In addition, two cases of imported TBE havebeen reported since 1994. These were acquired in endemic areas inSweden and Austria. Due to low incidence in Norway, vaccination is currently not rec- ommended as protection against transmission within the country. Itis only recommended for travellers planning outdoor activities inforested endemic areas abroad. Poland TBE is a notifiable disease in Poland, where it has been endemic for more than 30 years. Since 1993, the number of reported cases at coun-try level ranged from 100 to 350 cases per year. In 2002 the number of reported cases was 126 (incidence 0.33 per 100 000), and in 2003the number of reported cases was 339 (incidence 0.89 per 100 000).Eighty percent of cases occurred in two northeastern provinces of Poland adjacent to Lithuania and Belarus. A second focus of the dis- ease was in the southwestern part of Poland, in districts adjacent tothe Czech Republic. Vaccination using a three-dose schedule is recommended for high- risk groups living in endemic areas and tourists visiting endemic places. Certain risk groups (foresters, soldiers, timber industry employees) are immunised in regular campaigns paid for by their employers. Slovakia TBE is a compulsory notifiable disease in Slovakia. The number of reported cases at country level has ranged from 54 to 101 cases per year in the last ten years. In 2002 the number of reported cases was 62(incidence 1.15 per 100 000), and in 2003 the number of reported caseswas 74 (incidence 1.38 per 100 000). Some of reported the cases werecaused by drinking raw goat and sheep milk (home production). Longitudinal monitoring of TBE virus in ticks and vertebrate hosts (including humans) between 1964-1997 resulted in identification of37 natural endemic foci (see Figure).EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 312 Asokliene Accessed 15 July 2004] DEVELOPMENT OF A V ACC INE FOR HUMANS AGAINST HIGHLYPATHOGENICAVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS J M Wood, J S Robertson Division of Virology, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, United Kingdom Published online 17 June 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040617 .asp In the past eight years there have been three pandemic 'false alarms' caused by avian H5N1 viruses. The first of these in 1997 was a turn-ing point in our understanding of the difficulties of vaccine devel-opment from a lethal avian virus. It took 7 months to produce the firstvaccine and even this was not an ideal candidate, due to antigenicdifferences from the 1997 H5N1 virus and poor growth properties.Since 1997, we have become much better equipped to respond, mainly due to increased sophistication and more widespread use of reversegenetics technologies. The important features of reverse genetics for pandemic influenza vaccine development are as follows: Ability to genetically modify a highly pathogenic avian virus so that the molecular basis for pathogenicity is removed. This dramati-cally reduces the danger associated with the virus. Ability to produce reassortants between a modified safe avian virus and a human vaccine virus such as A/PR/8/34. A PR8 reassortant will growwell in mammalian cells and in eggs and it is likely to be attenuated for man, thus improving the safety profile of a pandemic vaccine virus. Since 1997, more experience has been gained with rescue of reas- sortant viruses in Vero cells, which was an important advance be-cause Vero cells are widely used for production of human viral vaccines.This provided an opportunity to rescue an avian virus: PR8 reassor-tant in a cell line approved by regulatory authorities. These advances prompted a European initiative to develop pan- demic influenza vaccines, which was sponsored by the EuropeanCommission. The project, FLUPAN, started in 2001 with the aim to construct a safe vaccine virus from a highly pathogenic avian H7N1 virus using reverse genetics. The reassortant H7N1 virus would then be used to produce and clinically evaluate an experimental mam-malian cell-grown vaccine. This project aimed to provide a 'proof ofconcept' that safe and immunogenic vaccines could be produced from highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. However,in 2003 the work of FLUPAN was overtaken by events in Hong Kong. Two human cases of H5N1 [1] prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to request WHO Collaborating Centres to pre-pare a safe vaccine strain. As there were no non-pathogenic H5N1strains available, the only option for vaccine virus development was tomodify one of the highly pathogenic avian viruses by reverse genetics.Incredibly, within the space of less than four weeks an H5N1:PR8 re- assortant was rescued in Vero cells by researchers in the United States(US) [2]. A few days later, a further reverse genetics H5N1:PR8 reas-sortant was produced in the European Union at the United Kingdom'sNational Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC,Vaccination using a three dose schedule is recommended for high risk groups living or working in endemic areas, and for tourists vis- iting endemic areas. The cost of vaccination for those who work inTBE endemic foci is reimbursed by health insurance. Slovenia TBE and Lyme borreliosis are endemic in the northern part of Slovenia, and are notifiable diseases. In 2003, 272 cases of TBE werereported, an incidence of 13.6 / 100 000. Similar numbers of cases were reported in 2002 (262 cases) and 2001 (260 cases). Efforts are being directed towards early diagnostics, antibiotic treatment and awareness campaigns. A vaccination campaign coor- dinated by National Institute of Public Health is in place throughoutthe country, from late autumn to spring annually. TBE immunizationis recommended by ministry of health and offered by general prac-titioners and epidemiologists to anybody who spends time outdoorin the endemic areas, including short term visitors. Vaccination is obligatory for those carrying out military service, and other professionally exposed persons, including forestry andagriculture students. The cost of vaccination is covered by health in-surance for students only. Coverage in those professionally exposedand students is very high (98%). Coverage in the general populationis unfortunately below 10%. Sweden TBE infection is included in voluntary laboratory reporting for infectious disease surveillance in Sweden. T o gather more informationabout the spread of TBE in the country a questionnaire is sent fromthe laboratories to the physicians who are requested to identify prob-able place of infection and known tick bite. By the late 1980s and early1990s, around 50 to 70 TBE cases were being reported annually. Themajority of the patients were diagnosed through hospital care. Sincethe end of the 1990s, around 100 cases have been reported annually,of which approximately 20% were treated through primary healthcare. During the same period the disease attracted increased public at-tention. It is therefore difficult to say whether there has been a real in- crease in the number of cases or increased diagnosis due to a higherclinical awareness or that samples have been taken to a greater extent.Apart from the fact that more cases have been observed by primary health care, several cases were reported in recent years from areaswhere previously only occasional cases had been detected. In 2003, 107 cases of TBE were notified (in 75 men and 32 women). Most of the infectious were acquired in the counties of Stockholm (56%), S\u00f6dermanland (15%) and Uppsala (6%). In (to the south of Lake V\u00e4nern) 5 to 10 cases are notified annually. Sporadic cases occur in the rest of Swedenevery year. Vaccination is recommended for high risk groups residing in endemic areas and for people who live in endemic areas during the summer. References 1 Beran J. Tickborne encephalitis in Slovakia 32 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 http://www.nibsc.ac.uk ) and for the next two months, it was important to establish whether these newly constructed viruses were safe for vac- cine development. The objectives of the safety testing programme wereto establish non-pathogenicity of the reassortant viruses in chickens and in man. There were already internationally agreed procedures for chickenpathogenicity tests [3], but such procedures were obviously not possi-ble in man. Consequently, the WHO Collaborating Centres produceda protocol to assess virus pathogenicity in ferrets [4], which is proba-bly the best available animal model for influenza infection in man. In 2004 we faced a third and possibly more serious pandemic threat, when highly pathogenic H5N1 infections of man were con-firmed. These cases were associated with widespread H5N1 disease indomestic birds in South East Asia [5]. Once more, the WHO requestedthe development of candidate vaccine viruses and it was disappoint-ing that the H5N1:PR8 reassortants produced in 2003 were not suit-able, due to antigenic differences between the haemagglutinin proteinof the 2003 and 2004 viruses [2]. It was therefore necessary to start oncemore with vaccine virus development. A reassortant was produced inVero cells within four weeks at NIBSC and just over two months later, the virus was available to vaccine manufacturers after passing path-ogenicity tests. At the time of writing, H5N1:PR8 reassortants producedin the US will also become available shortly. Meanwhile, despite delays in FLUPAN while responding to H5N1 threats, an H7N1:PR8 reassortant has recently been rescued in Verocells and is now awaiting safety tests and vaccine development. A further significant event in pandemic vaccine development was the publication of an EU regulatory framework for pandemic vac-cines in the past year [6]. Recent research has shown that in na\u00efve pop-ulations, conventional influenza va ccine formulations are unlikely to provide adequate protection and alternative vaccination strategies areneeded. It is therefore likely that pandemic vaccines will be signifi-cantly different from those currently licensed and unless the licensingprotocol is addressed in advance, they will cause administrative delaysin availability of pandemic vaccines. The EU Committee for ProprietaryMedicinal Products thus encouraged and provided guidance to vaccine manufacturers to prepare a core dossier for a pandemic vaccine, whichcould be licensed in advance of a pandemic. Such core dossiers would contain clinical data on the use of a 'mock' pandemic vaccine strain such as an H5N1 or an H7N1 virus. In the event of a pandemic, the vaccinecould then be rapidly licensed by an update procedure. The key steps in pandemic influenza vaccine development are il- lustrated in the table. It is envisaged that candidate vaccine viruses willbe generated by reverse genetics when WHO declares Phase 0 level 2 oftheir Pandemic Preparedness Plan (two or more human cases, but noefficient person to person transmission) [7]. If pandemic activity doesnot follow such alerts, the vaccine viruses are unlikely to be used for largescale vaccine production, but they provide ideal candidates for pandemicvaccine clinical research. Such research is crucial in order to explore dif-ferent vaccination strategies, so that manufacturers know in advance howto formulate an immunogenic, antigen-sparing and safe pandemic vac- cine. Once such information has been generated, manufacturers can seekto obtain an EU licence for this concept, as described above. In the event of pandemic activity, manufacturers can then go into full scale vac- cine production as soon as the vaccine virus is available, confident inthe knowledge that their pandemic vaccine can be licensed in the EUvery quickly, without fur ther clinical evaluation. Thus, in the space of one year, candidate vaccine viruses have been produced from two H5N1 viruses and one H7N1 virus. This is ample proof that reverse genetics technologies have potential for rap-idly generating pandemic vaccine viruses. It is now important forvaccine manufacturers to gain experience in vaccine production fromsuch viruses, for clinical trials to be undertaken and for progress in EUlicensing of pandemic vaccines to be initiated.

In thefollowing years the incidence of pertussis remained higher than in theperiod before 1996 and in 1999 another peak was observed [1]. Thehigh incidence of pertussis resulted in the introduction of a boostervaccination after recommendations from the Gezondheidsraad (DutchHealth Council) [2] with an acellular vaccine containing pertussis toxin, pertactin and filamentous haemagglutinin for 4 year olds in the national vaccination programme from October 2001 onwards (detailsof the Dutch vaccination programme are available, in Dutch, athttp://www.rivm.nl/rvp/). Although the total incidence in 2000 (26.6/100 000), before in- troduction of the booster vaccination, was slightly higher than in 2002, after its introduction (28.0/100 000) the incidence in the agegroup (3-4 years) targeted with the acellular booster-vaccination had decreased by 45% compared to 2000 (FIGURE 1). For the older agegroups, a slight increase in incidence was observed in 2002 compared with previous years. Apparently, the total transmission of pertussis has not decreased and hence the probability for young infants to acquirepertussis has not yet diminished. Pertussis can become severe, par-ticularly in young unvaccinated infants, and may lead to hospitalisa-tion (FIGURE 2). In 2001 and 2002 about 500 infants were admittedto hospital because of pertussis, often with severe symptoms such as collapse, apnoea and cyanosis. Most of these children were infants under 6 months of age, who were too young to be vaccinated or vac-cinated completely [3]. Increases in incidence have also been observed in other countries [4-7]. In the Netherlands, however, the increase has affected all agegroups (including young vaccinated children), while in most otherEUROP EAN NETW ORK FOR SURVEILLANCE OF STIS(ESSTI) ESTABLISHES WORKING GROUPS ON L YMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM AND HIV/STI PREVENTION AMONG MSM I von Holstein1, K A Fenton1, C Ison2, on behalf of the ES- STI network 1C o m m u n i c a b le Disease Surveillance Centre, Health Protection Agency, London, Uni ted Ki ngdom 2S e x u a l ly Transmitted Bacterial Reference Laboratory, Specialist and Reference Microbiology Division, Health Protection Agency, London,United Kingdom Published online 17 June 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040617 .asp) The European Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (ES- STI) [1] network, at its third collaborative group meeting on 27-28 May2004, established two working groups to facilitate information ex-change on lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), following the emer- gence of outbreaks in men who have sex with men (MSM) in citiesin western Europe; and to appraise options for strengthening HIV/STIprevention activities in MSM in the European Union (EU). Three outbreaks of LGV in MSM in Rotterdam, Antwerp and Paris have been detected recently [2]. ESSTI's early warning and alert sys-tem, ESSTI ALERT, which has been operational since April 2003, was instrumental in increasing awareness of these and prompted the in-vestigation of the outbreak in France. The outbreaks may be linked and investigations are ongoing. Discussions included an information ex-change on microbiological confirmation of LGV cases (by genotyp- ing) and the need for coordinating the investigation and reporting ofthese outbreaks across EU states. More generally however, recent in-creases in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) inMSM in many western and central European states raise wider causefor concern. Apart from LGV , outbreaks of syphilis, antimicrobial re-sistant gonorrhoea and among MSM have also been recentlyreported through ESSTI ALERT and in the published literature. Although changes in high risk sexual behaviour among this groupmay be a driving factor, other social, demographic and behavioural fac-tors may be contributing to the rising disease incidence. A second working group was therefore established, under the leadership of Hans Blystad (Norway), to consider current EU HIV/STI prevention activities among MSM, and to identify ways of strengthening the EU'sresponse to these emerging threats. Since its inception in December 2001, ESSTI has carried out a comprehensive review of EU STI surveillance systems (submitted to the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections) and a retrospective analy-sis of EU STI surveillance trends from 1990-2000 has also been com-pleted [3]. The network has also completed a survey of laboratorymethods for diagnosis of gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis infec-tions in different countries of the EU. A panel exchange for Neisseriagonorrhoeae isolates among 14 laboratories across Europe for qual-ity assurance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing has also been com-pleted. A website for the ESSTI network is in preparation, with thelaunch anticipated for July 2004. Plans for the future (if further fund-ing is secured) include extending the quality assurance programme forN. gonorrhoeae isolates to the new states in the EU, instituting anannual quality assurance programme, and completing a survey ofsurveillance programmes in the new EU states.34 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 countries the rise in incidence has affected mainly adults, adolescents and infants who are incompletely vaccinated or unvaccinated [4,7].Waning immunity and impaired vaccine effectiveness (as a result of the emergence of non-vaccine-type strains) appear to play an importantrole in current high incidence in the Netherlands [1,8]. In a mouse model, the Dutch whole cell vaccine was found to be less effectiveagainst the non-vaccine-type strains compared to vaccine-type strains[9]. The Gezondheidsraad has therefore advised on measures to betaken to improve pertussis vaccination in the Netherlands [10]. Thecouncil recommended the transition, as soon as possible, to the use of an acellular vaccine for immunisation in the first year of life. In agree-ment with the advice, the minister of health has decided to replacethe whole cell vaccine by the acellular vaccine in the national immu-nisation programme from January 2005 onwards. Furthermore, additional measures are necessary to protect infants too young to be vaccinated. Studies in other highly vaccinated populations demonstrated that it is mainly adults, often parents, who transmit theinfection to these young infants [11]. Separate assessment of infectionsources for infants in the Netherlands is useful because pertussis epi-demiology may differ by country, dependent not only on the vaccina-tion uptake but also the vaccination scheme, and the nature and qualityof the vaccine. T o optimise prevention of pertussis, modelling studiesare needed to explore future additional vaccination strategies such asstarting vaccination at birth, or boosting doses of adolescents or adults.

INVESTIGAT ION OF THE DECONTAMINATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR ENDOSCOPES IN NORTHERN IRELAND LDoherty1, E Mitchell1, B Smyth2 1 Department of Health, Social Services, and Public Safety, Belfast, Northern Ireland 2 Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre Northern Ireland, Belfast, Northern Ireland Published online 1 July 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040701.asp) At the beginning of June 2004, a hospital in Northern Ireland an- nounced that the arrangements for cleaning and disinfecting one of theirendoscopes were not fully in accordance with necessary standards [1].Following a detailed risk assessment the hospital undertook a patient notification exercise in relation to over 400 patients which involved 1. identifying patients who had undergone an endoscopy using this scope and 2. contacting these patients to invite them for testing for blood borne virus infection. To date, the results from this exercise have shown no cause for conc ern. In response to this incident the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) in Northern Ireland initiated aformal audit involving a detailed observational assessment of all en-doscopes in use at hospitals in Northern Ireland. This audit has iden-tified a number of issues in re lation to the decontamination of a small number of endoscopes in t otal, including gastroscopes, duo- denoscopes and colonoscopes) at four hospitals. The specific issues inrelation to the cleaning and disinfection of these endoscopes fall into two groups: 1. In a small number of endoscopes, one narrow channel on the en- doscope was not fully cleaned or disinfected despite going through thenormal cleaning and disinfection process. 2. In a second group, all the channels in the endoscope had been fully cleaned but one channel may not have been disinfected despiteFIGURE 1 Incidence of notified pertussis cases according to age (years), 2000 versus 2002 050100150200250300 02468101214161820222430-3440-4450-5460-6470-7480-8490-94 age (years)number/1000002000 2002 FIGURE 2 Age specific incidence according to hospital admissions, 2001(dark bars) and 2002 (white bars), age in years andmonths (children under 1 year, see right corner) 020406080100120140160180 02468101214161820222430-3540-4550-5560-6570-75 age (y ears)incidence/1000000100200300400500600700 0123456789 1 0 1 1 age (months)incidence/100000EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 35going through the normal cleaning and disinfection process. In response to this incident, DHSSPS convened a regional team to manage this issue. The team involved specialists in public health, de-contamination, endoscopy, infection control and virology. It was sup- ported and advised by England and Wales' Health Protection Agency(HPA) which convened an expert advisory group to advise on the riskassessment for the transmission of bloodborne viruses associated withthe endoscopy cleaning and the disinfection issues identified. It is es-timated that the prevalence of bloodborne viruses in Northern Ireland(population is 1.7 million) is less than 3 per 1000. In this risk assessment, the expert advisory group determined that: 1. For the first group of endoscopes, the risk of transmission of bloodborne viruses was very low; nevertheless, a patient notificationexercise would be required for all patients who had endoscopy with these instruments. 2. For the second group of endoscopes, the risk of transmission of bloodborne viruses was extremely low and it was therefore recom-mended that, where the endoscope was possibly in recent contactwith a bloodborne virus, only a limited number of patients should be notified and offered testing. In the interests of reassuring the public, the local regional team con- cluded that all patients who were examined with endoscopes from the second group should be contacted, made aware of the situation, andoffered reassurance and advice. In addition, a regional 24 hour helplinewas established and was supported by local helplines set up in eachof the four hospitals. T o date over 1700 patients have been includedin a patient notification exercise; this includes patients involved inthe notification exercise at the first hospital. Approximately 1300 pa-tients have received letters offering reassurance and advice. These in-cidents have attracted substantial media coverage in Northern Ireland.An independent review of the situation in Northern Ireland has been commissioned by DHSSPS: this review will commence shortly and will report by end of October 2004. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued an alert to National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England,asking all staff involved in purchase, purchase, reprocessing and useof endoscopes to carry out an assessment of all endoscope deconta- mination processes [2]. The alert also includes advice on proceduresthat need to be followed to ensure that endoscopes are properly de-contaminated. Assessments of reprocessing facilities and equipment should involve the infection control team, risk manager, health andsafety advisor, and the hospital decontamination lead person. TheNational Assembly for Wales has asked all hospitals in Wales to review practice, and similarly, the Scottish Executive Health Departmenthave asked for an urgent review of practice in Scotland. The HPA hasformed a UK task force to coordinate activity across the UnitedKingdom, and an expert advisory group to give independent advice on management, should any further incidents come to light. There is little documented evidence in the international literature of transmission of bloodborne virus infection at endoscopy. Limited evi- dence is available from case reports [4-7] and would indicate that todate there have only been five documented cases worldwide of an asso-ciation between endoscopy and transmission of bloodborne viruses.Four of these relate to transmission of hepatitis C virus infection at en- doscopy, each of which was associated with a decontamination failureor a breakdown in general infection control precautions [4-6]. One re-port documents the endoscopic transmission of hepatitis B virus [7]. Endoscopes are complex, multichannelled instruments, and some of the channels require manual cleaning and disinfection procedures,but it is important to stress that the risk of acquiring any form of in-fection from an endoscope is very low. Evidence from the literaturewould suggest that the risk of transmission of any infection is 1 in 1.8 million procedures [3]. The most common infections transmitted byendoscopy are salmonella, pseudomonas, and mycobacteria species.The main reasons for transmission app ear to be improper cleaning and disinfection procedures; the contamination of endoscopes by automaticwashers/ reprocessors; and an inability to decontaminate endoscopes, despite the use of standard disinfection techniques, because of theircomplex channel and valve systems. There are no reports in the pub- lished literature of HIV transmission at endoscopy. Concern about thedecontamination of endoscopes in the United States prompted the is-suing of a US Food and Drug Administration alert and the develop-ment of multisociety guidelines [8,9]. T echnical advice is alreadyavailable from the British Society for Gastroenterology [10]. As there is a paucity of information in the international peer re- viewed literature on this issue, we would be interested to hear from colleagues in other countries who have had similar experiences.

LGV was also suspected in two other patients. LGV is caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis ,s e r o t y p e s L1, L2 and L3. Cases in western Europe are rare. LGV is confirmed ifthe causative agent can be test-36 Issue 3 ing are positive for Chlamydia trachomatis .A case is classified as sus- pected if there are typical clinical symptoms and serology and PCR arepositive. Clinical presentation and course In January 2003, a 49 year old man presented at the Institut clinic with therapy-resistant ulceration of the anal region and lymphadenitis in the groin. Laboratory testing on a rectal swab revealed Chlamydia trachomatis as the causative agent. The anal lesions healed after doxy- cycline therapy. During June and December 2003, three other patients presented at the clinic with lesions of the penis and lymph node swellings in thegroin. They had neither urethritis nor proctitis. All three cases were laboratory confirmed as LGV . After several weeks of doxycycline ther-apy, all three recovered fully. Diagnosis The infection with Chlamydia trachomatis was confirmed in all cases by strand displacement amplification technique on genital swabsamples and material from lymph node punctures. Typing by se-quence analysis of ompA PCR products of all of the four isolates con-firmed different strains. The existence of other sexually transmittedinfections was ruled out using additional laboratory analysis (in-cluding Lues Haemophilus ducreyi). Source of infection The patients were between 32 and 49 years old. None of them had travelled in an area endemic for LGV in the previous year. Three of the four patients had a simultaneous HIV infection. In two cases, regu-lar contact in 'dark-rooms' in Hamburg appeared to be the likelysource of infection; two men frequently changed sexual partners. It isinteresting to note that all the strains and thus the infection sourceswere different. There could therefore be other undiagnosed patients. Conclusions Ifgenito-anal or oral ulcerations are present, particularly in MSM and HIV infected patients, LGV should always be considered as a dif-ferential diagnosis. Commentary Between 1991-95, an annual average of 35 LGV infections were notified in Germany, whereas between 1996-2000 the annual averagewas seven cases. Only one case was reported from Hamburg duringthis time. Since the introduction of the 2001 Protection from InfectionAct (Infektionsschutzgesetz), cases of LGV are no longer notifiable. Since October 2002, the Robert Koch Institut has conducted sentinel surveillance of sexually transmitted infections in Germany, but so farthere have been no cases of LGV notified. The sporadic appearanceof LGV cases were, until now, traced back to imported illnesses aftertravel to endemic areas. At the beginning of this year, several MSM in the Netherlands were diagnosed with LGV [1]. Since then, over 30 cases of LGV have beendiagnosed there. Many of these men reported a multitude of foreignsexual contacts, some of these in Germany. Sexual contact such asunprotected anal intercourse or 'fisting' , took place mainly at sex par-ties, in 'leather scene' bars or saunas. In addition, at a network meet-ing of the European Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections(ESSTI, funded by the European Commission DG SANCO [2]) inMay 2004, outbreaks of LGV in MSM in Belgium and France (with 27 and 38 cases respectively) were reported. In Belgium, over 90% ofthe patients were also HIV positive. Since LGV very rarely occurs in Germany and western Europe and if patients present with just ano-rectal symptoms or with an atypicalclinical picture, it is likely that LGV is not considered as a diagnosis.It is therefore possible that cases in Europe are missed. Doctors treat- ing and diagnosing HIV and other sexually transmitted infectionsshould, if relevant symptoms are present, consider LGV as a differential diagnosis. Gastroenterologists should also consider LGV if there arenotable signs in the rectum in patients who are MSM. The above described sexual practices increase the possibility of co-transmission of other infections, such as syphilis and HIV , and so multiple infection should be always be ruled out.

The patient received a blood transfusion in 1999 with blood from a donor who subsequently developed vCJD. The patient died of causesunrelated to vCJD but a post mortem revealed the presence of the ab-normal prion protein in the patient's spleen. The patient was not homozygous for methionine at codon 129 of the prion protein gene, and had not exhibited any signs or symptomsof vCJD before death. In contrast, all of the patients that have been in-vestigated to date have been methionine homozygous at codon 129 . This case provides evidence that people who are not homozygouscan still accumulate abnormal prions in lymphatic tissue. Whether non-homozygotes can also develop vCJD, albeit with a longer incubationperiod, is as yet unknown. The Department of Health has announced further restrictions on blood donors: the deferral of all potential donors who are unsure ifthey have had a blood donation, and apheresis donors who have pre-viously had a blood transfusion. Apheresis donors are a small pool of committed donors who make frequent attendances to centres to do- nate blood, where machine processing removes only certain bloodcomponents, and the rest is returned to the donor.

E Rudd1, K Fenton1, C Ison2 1H e a l t h Protection Agency Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London, England, 2Health Protection Agency Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory, Lo ndon, England Published online 12 August 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040812.asp) The prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Neisseria gonor- rhoeae in England and Wales has stabilised after a rapid increase ob- served in 2002 [1], according to results from the 2003 collection of theGonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme(GRASP) [2] . Between June and August 2003, gonococcal isolates from patients at 26 genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in England and Wales weretested for antimicrobial susceptibility at one of two central reference laboratories. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fiveantimicrobials were determined, including ciprofloxacin (range tested0.002-0.125 mg/l, extended to 32 mg/l as necessary). Clinical, demo-graphic, and behavioural data were obtained for each patient included in the collection. Over 1900 isolates from GUM clinics were tested during this time period in 2003. The overall prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance(MIC 1 mg/l) was 9.0% in 2003 compared to 9.8% in 2002, but this decrease was not statistically different (p=0.57). A decrease in preva-lence was observed in sentinel clinics outside London during this pe- riod, from 12.4% to 9.9%. However, London saw a slight increase in ciprofloxacin resistance from the 7.2% to 7.9% in 2003. In 2003 theprevalences of ciprofloxacin resistance remained at 5% in all re- gions of England and Wales. A more homogenous distribution in the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance across the regions was seen in2003 compared with previous years, with the exception of the WestMidlands region where a high prevalence of 21%, more than double the prevalence seen in any other region, was observed. The distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance within the population appears to be changing. In 2003 ciprofloxacin resistance was againabout twice as high in all males than in females (10.4% versus 5.3%,p<0.0005). For the first time, however, similar percentages ofciprofloxacin resistance were observed in both heterosexual malesand men who have sex with men (MSM) (10.8% and 10.7% respec-tively). These findings suggest ciprofloxacin resistance has becomewidely distributed and endemic within the population. In 2000, ciprofloxacin resistance in England and Wales was almost exclusivelyfound in white and Asian (here defined as South Asian and Chinese)ethnic groups and heterosexual individuals. Multivariate analysis in 2003 indicates ciprofloxacin resistance continues to be higher in individuals of white ethnicity (compared with black ethnic groups, here defined as African and African-Caribbean).It also continues to be higher in the relatively small groups of pa- tients aged >45yrs (24% resistant), in those from the Asian ethnicgroup (23% resistant), and in those who had had sexual contact in the Far East in the previous 3 months (67% resistant). When the significant increase in the prevalence of ciprofloxacin re- sistance to 9.8% was observed in England and Wales in 2002, alternativefirst-line therapies to ciprofloxacin or penicillin were recommendedby the GRASP steering group [2]. Subsequently, the Clinical Effectiveness Group (British Association of Sexual Health and HIV)gonococcal treatment guidelines were reviewed in response to theserecommendations. These guidelines recommend the use of the thirdgeneration cephalosporins ceftriaxone and cefixime in place of fluo- roquinolones or penicillin as first line therapies [3]. They also high- light the need for region-specific prescribing strategies depending onthe local antimicrobial resistance prevalence and distribution. Reports of increases in the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae have been observed over recent years in severalother European countries. Scotland has seen ciprofloxacin resistancerise to 11% in 2002 [4], and Spain has seen a rapid increase from 2.3% to 9.9% between 2000 and 2001 [5]. Furthermore, a recent re-port from Sweden highlighted a dramatic increase in the prevalenceof ciprofloxacin resistant gonorrhoea reported in Stockholm andother parts of Sweden during 2003. Ciprofloxacin resistant cases in menattending a clinic for homosexual men in Stockholm increased froma low level to over 50% during 2003. An outbreak of ciprofloxacin re-sistant gonorrhoea was also identified amongst heterosexual men andwomen in the county of Galveborg [6]. The findings discussed here demonstrate the importance of main- taining ongoing surveillance of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance ata national level to ensure treatment strategies remain responsive to thechanging epidemiology.

MEASLES IN CREASE IN IRELAND , 2004 S Gee, M Carton, S Cotter National Disease Surveillance Centre, Dublin, Ireland Published online 23 September 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040923.asp) Since the beginning of 2004 (weeks 1-36 inclusive), 293 cases of measles have been reported in Ireland (incidence: 7.5/100 000 popu-lation) [1]. The increase in measles activity, particularly since May, hasbeen widespread in the country. The incidence of measles has been highin recent years, notably in 2003 (Figure 1) and 2000, when there wasa large outbreak (over 1600 cases reported, including three measles-associated deaths in children) [2,3].TABLE All notified MRSA cases and the proportion of MRSA among S. aureus blood isolates, Finland, 1995-10.9.2004 FIGURE 1 Measles cases by week of notification 2003 and weeks 1- 36, 2004 (provisional data) FIGURE Proportion of MRSA among invasive S. aureus isolates, Europe,2003Methicillin resistance lates (x)Year 1995 89 26 2 7 0.3 1996 108 0 667 01997 120 4 74 6 0.5 1998 189 5 717 0.71999 211 8 812 1 2000 261 4 849 0.5 2001 344 4 887 0.52002 59 78 984 0.8 2003 813 5 975 0.5 1.1.-10.9.2004 849 18 709 2.5 This development has already been reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS), and Finland has recently been reclassified from a country with <1% methicillin re-sistance in invasive S. aureus infections to 1-5% on the European re- sistance map (FIGURE). It should be noted that only 15 of the 28Finnish clinical laboratories participate in EARSS, whereas all reportto the NIDR.

Mostcases notified were clinical, 60 (20%) were 'confirmed' (38 were lab-oratory confirmed and it is not known whether the remaining 22 con-firmed cases were laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linkedto a laboratory confirmed case). Y oung children were most affected, with the highest age-specific incidence rates occurring among those <1 year of age (157.8/100 000) (Figure 2). Enhanced surveillance data (where available) indicated that 77% of measles cases were in unvaccinated patients. In Ireland, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is rou- tinely recommended for children at 12-15 months of age, with an-other dose recommended at 4-5 years of age. The vaccine can begiven to children as young as 6 months old, particularly in outbreak situations, although seroconversion rates are lower in children im-munised before their first birthday [4].Source: European antibiotic resistance surveillance system (EARSS, http://www.earss.rivm.nl/PAGINA/interwebsite/home_earss.html )Source: National Infectious Diseases Register (NIDR)EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 39at 12-15 months as per the national immunisation schedule. Parents of older, unvaccinated children have also been encouraged to bringthem to their GPs for immunisation. A national Measles Eradication Committee has been established and will meet shortly. It will consider ways to improve surveillance (in-cluding laboratory testing) and vaccination uptake.

Health Protection Agency Specialist and Reference Microbiology Division, London, United Kingdom Published online 23 september 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040923.asp) Twenty seven suspected cases of wound botulism in injecting drug users (IDUs) were reported to the Health Protection Agency (Englandand Wales) between 1 January and 25 August 2004 [1]. Twenty five ofthese were in England, and six were laboratory confirmed. Of theconfirmed cases, three occurred in London during January and February, and the remaining three in northeast England during June and July. Reports of suspected cases co ntinue to be received, espe- cially from northeast and northwest regions. In comparison, there were 14 reports of suspected cases of wound botulism among IDUs reported for the whole of 2003, seven of whichwere confirmed by laboratory tests. Between March 2000 and December 2002 there were 33 clinically diagnosed cases in IDUs in the United Kingdom and Republic ofIreland: none were reported before 2000 [2]. Twenty of these 33 cases were confirmed in the laboratory by either detection of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin in serum, or culture of C. botulinum from wound tissue or pus. During September and October 2002 there was an outbreak of eight cases possibly related to a contaminated batch ofheroin [3].FIGURE 2 Age Specific incidence or measles cases notified in Ireland from weeks 1- 36, 2004 by age group (n=290*) 050100150200 <1 1-2 3-4 5- 91 Total Age Grou p 34.1 15.52.8 0.6 1.8 0.27.48 *P a t i e n t age was unknown for 3 measles cases FIGURE 3 National quarterly immunisation uptake rates for the first dose of MMR at 24 months, Quarter 1, 1999 to Quarter 1, 2004 010203040506070809010 0 Quarter / Year% Uptake 03 1999 04 1999A recent report on immunisation uptake in Ireland during the first quarter of 2004 estimated national MMR uptake at 24 monthsto be 80%, ranging from 74%-90% between regions. Collection of national immunisation uptake data started in Ireland at the beginning of 1999. Following the measles outbreak in 2000, theuptake rate of MMR increased to 83%, but then fell to 69% at the endof 2001. MMR uptake rates have been increasing gradually since then(Figure 3). The low MMR vaccine uptake rates in Ireland are thought to be because of the negative publicity surrounding MMR vaccine.Consistent MMR uptake levels of at least 95% are required among all birth cohorts to eliminate measles transmission. Preventing ongoing transmission in specific settings In response to the increased number of measles cases reported in 2004, the following control measures are taking place: Since good surveillance data are fundamental to control and prevention activities, measles surveillance and control activities haveincreased across Ireland (case investigation, laboratory testing whereappropriate, and encouraging immunisation). General practitioners and clinicians have been advised to notify any suspect cases promptly to ensure rapid implementation of con-trol measures. Immunisation is offered to all children in affected schools, cr\u00e8ches or institutions. In areas where substantial numbers of measles cases were reported among infants, measles vaccination of infants as young as 6 monthswas encouraged as an outbreak control measure. There has been national and regional press coverage (newspa- per articles, radio coverage) of measles and low levels of vaccination.Parents have been advised by GPs, Health Boards, and the National Disease Surveillance Centre to have children vaccinated with MMR40 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 Wound botulism occurs when spores of C. botulinum contaminate a wound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. All of the wound botulism cases detected so far in the UK have been amongIDUs. Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcuta-neously or intramuscularly may be par ticularly vulnerable to infection. Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with an afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in re-ducing the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if admin-istered early in the course of the disease and should not be delayed forthe results of microbiological testing. In cases of wound botulism,antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement are necessary to re-move the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin treatment. C. bot- ulinum is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole. As well as these cases in the United Kingdom and Ireland, wound botulism in IDUs in Europe has previously been reported inSwitzerland and Norway [4,5]. It is suspected that this type of botu- lism is underreported. The authors would be interested to get infor-mation on any suspected cases of wound botulism in IDUs fromother countries in Europe.

Eurosurveillance Weekly 2002; 6(46): 14/11/2002.( http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2002/021114.asp#2 A SURVEY OF MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS IN GERMAN- SPEAKING SWITZERLAND IN 2000 C Colombo, C Ruef Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland Published online 26 August 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040826.asp) A survey of hospital management plans concerning the occurrence of occupational exposure to bloodborne infections (above all, HIV)in German-speaking Switzerland was carried out by the Swiss nationalreference centre for bloodborne infections in Zurich, in 2000 [1]. A lack of access to specialist exposure risk assessment as well as a lack of 24-hour HIV testing facilities was highlighted. Antiretroviralmedication (Combivir and Viracept) was readily available in just 60%of all hospitals surveyed and only three quarters of hospitals had anHIV post-exposure management protocol. The deficiencies were sig-nificantly greater in small hospitals with less than 250 beds, than inlarger institutions. Introduction Occupational exposure to HIV in healthcare professionals carries a low risk of infection in comparison with exposure via sexual inter-course or needle sharing in injecting drug use. But prevention ofhealthcare-associated HIV infection and avoidance of occupational ex- posure are still important aims, par ticularly as the number of HIV- infected people in Switzerland continues to increase. The first reported case of occupationally acquired HIV infection in Switzerland occurred in 1994 [2]. The exposure was via a needle-stick injury from a hollow-bore needle that had been used on a pa-tient with AIDS. A second case occurred in 1995 from a percutaneousexposure, and a third possible case occurred in 1996. As well as HIV exposure, between 1997-2001, there were six cases of hepatitis C trans- mission to medical personnel. In all the cases of HCV infection, aneedle stick injury was the cause. The legal responsibility for protection of healthcare personnel lies with the employer. T o fulfil legal requirements, an HIV/bloodborne virus post-exposure management protocol is necessary, naming key responsible staff members. The protocol should specify the immedi- ate management of potential exposure which details provision ofcompetent medical advice, starting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) medication, tracing and investigation of the index person (withrespect to clinical or epidemiolo gical indications of HIV infection), HIV testing of index patient and serological follow-up of the exposedworker. There should be periodic education and information events for new employees. Reports of exposure should be sent to the na-tional reference centres for bloodborne infections. PEP medication hasbeen recommended in Switzerland since 1990. Up to the end of 2002,in 660 of the 9204 reported incidents of exposure, healthcare work-ers were started on PEP medication. In 2000, we surveyed hospitals in German-speaking Switzerland, to gain an overview of HIV PEP management. We focussed on or- ganisational preparedness to administer PEP after exposure. Methods A questionnaire was sent to all medical institutions, except eld- erly care homes and similar long-term facilities. It had been pre-testedby four occupational health doctors, and asked about: existence of an official PEP protocol and/or written guidelines contact person to whom a potential exposure is notified within the institution availability of specialist exposure risk assessment availability of HIV testing facilities time interval between exposure and informing an occupational health doctor place where HIV testing undertaken (internal or external labo- ratory), time interval between blood sampling of index patient and results being available availability and composition of antiretroviral medication how exposures are notified to the reference centre whether an HIV PEP starter kit is required. A total of 190 medical institutions were contacted and asked to par- ticipate in the study. They were asked to fill in the form within a month. Free PEP starter kits were offered to all participating institutions. These consisted of: Combivir (AZT and 3TC) and Viracept (Nelfinavir)for 5 days, the original patient information leaflet and an specified in-formation leaflet on the most important procedures concerning HIVPEP.There were also pocket-size cards produced with the basic in- formation about prevention of exposures and HIV PEP . Results The survey was well received: 158 (83%) filled in the questionnaire and sent it back. The response was better from bigger hospitals (250+beds) than smaller (<250 beds). Size of responding hospitals was asfollows: <250 250-499 beds n=20, 9.This distribution is typical for German-speaking Switzerland. HIV PEP Protocol An HIV PEP protocol defines procedures in the event of a possible exposure. It offers more safeguards that a correct decision willbe taken. About 75% of institutions had such a protocol, or internal guidelines. There were large differences between larger and smaller hos-pitals, with smaller hospitals less likely to have a protocol, althoughmany had guidelines. Availability of a specialist The 24-hour availability of a specialist to assess exposure risk and initiate PEP if necessary is important, especially within the first twohours of exposure. In only 83% of larger hospitals and 64% of smallerwas this cover available all the time. There is certainly a need for im-provement in this area. HIV testing facilities Quick treatment after exposure is important, as the effectiveness of PEP is better the sooner it is given after an exposure. An importantelement for fast judgement is the testing of the source patient forHIV as well as hepatitis B and C. Therefore, access to 24 hour testingis important, but 63% of hospitals stated that they did not have this.A further 4.5% of institutions had this partially in place or it was be-ing planned. Larger hospitals often had better access to HIV testingthan smaller hospitals. Time delay between testing and availability of results The time when results are obtained influences the decision as to whether PEP should be started. Only 31% of hospitals (65% of largerhospitals) could have results available within 2 hours of blood sam-pling from the source patient. In 20%, results could be obtained within6 hours. In 12% of hospitals, it would last longer than 2 days. A 2hour target should be aimed for as a maximum before the patient isstarted on HIV PEP medication. A time interval of 12 hours is un-satisfactory. Availability and type of anti-retroviral medication T YPE OF CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS . Ifthe hospital had ready access to PEP medication, 83% stated that that they dispensed a combination of 3 medications. A further 14%used 2 and almost 2% used just one. PEP should be immediately started if there are appropriate indi- cations. The necessary medication must therefore be on hand. Only60% of hospitals had ready access to HIV PEP medication (90% oflarger hospitals). Notification to the reference centres Relevant exposures should be notified to reference centres and there are special forms to do this. This reference centres should beknown to the responsible bodies in the hospitals and the forms shouldbe readily available. Fifty-six percent of institutions were aware of theNeedle stick Surveillance System carried out by the centres. Conclusions and recommendations The high level of participation in this survey demonstrated that there is considerable interest in the subject. The occupational health doc-tor is the important contact person in dealing with exposure inci- dents. At night, or over weekends, there is a lack of cover, especiallyin smaller hospitals. A quick determination of the HIV status of the index person is vi- tal to the decision whether to proceed with PEP . Only one third of hos-pitals had 24-hour access to HIV testing and so only a few hospitalswere able to receive results within the shortest deadline. Use of rapid HIV-antibody tests could be useful in these institutions and help re-duce this timespan. If there is an indication for HIV-PEP and no fastHIV testing facilities are available, a course of PEP should be startedand stopped if there is a negative test result from the index patient com-ing in later. Use of anti-retroviral medication is crucial for an optimallyfunctioning PEP management. In 40% of hospitals, this was not read-ily available. EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 41Key elements of an occupational HIV/bloodborne virus exposure plan are: Assigned department contact person after exposure Access to an occupational health doctor or infectious disease spe- cialist at all times Short time interval between HIV test and receiving the results Antiretroviral medication to be readily available if needed Standardised documentation of all (relevant) exposures Information and teaching of staff to achieve compliance with standard precautions In a few hospitals, important elements of an effective PEP man- agement protocol were missing. These deficiencies were notably morein smaller hospitals than in larger. Therefore only a proportion ofhospitals had a fully working HIV PEP management system. In viewof the potential seriousness of an occupationally acquired HIV in-fection, the deficiencies need to be urgently addressed. One possibleway to manage these in some hospitals could be cooperation betweenhospitals to form a joint HIV-PEP management system.

INFECTIONS ACQUIRED ABROAD , SCOTLAND 2003-2004 A Smith-Palmer Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom Published online 12 August 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040812.asp) During 2003, information on 45 outbreaks of gastrointestinal in- fections in people returning to Scotland from abroad was circulatedby the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH, http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/scieh/ ) [1]. Salmonella was the most frequently reported organism, identified in 24 outbreaks. Fourteenof these were caused by Salmonella Enteritidis. Cryptosporidium was identified in 11 outbreaks and Shigella in six. In four outbreaks, more than one organism was identified: three of Salmonella and Campylobacter and one of Cryptosporidium and Salmonella . Spain, including the Balearic Islands, was most frequently the country where travel-associated gastrointestinal disease was acquired (22 outbreaks), followed by Greece (5 outbreaks). Belgium and theDominican Republic were each associated with 2 outbreaks, and Maltaand Cyprus with one. This should be seen in the context of number of visits made: in 2002, 1 259 000 visits to Spain from Scotland were recorded [2]: these rep-resented 33% of all visits from Scotland, making it the most frequently visited country. France was the second most frequently visited coun- try,accounting for 10% of visits, but no potential outbreaks were re- ported from there in 2003. Six per cent of foreign trips (228 000 visits)were made to Greece.Up to the start of August 2004, 22 potential outbreaks have been identified: seven from Spain/Balearic Islands, three from Greece, twofrom Italy, and one each from Cuba, Dominican Republic, Egypt, France,Jordan, Morocco, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey and a Mediterranean cruise. A potential outbreak is defined as two or more confirmed cases of in- fection in patients who have recently travelled abroad to the same placeor at least one confirmed case where others (who have also travelled tothe same area) are alleged to be ill. Potential outbreaks are reported toSCIEH by local health authorities, or, in some cases, reference laboratories. SCIEH then disseminates information to local authorities about the organism responsible, number of positive cases, number of otherssuspected to be affected, country where infection was acquired andname of town or resort and hotel/accommodation, start and enddates of stay, date of illness onset, tour operator, flight details (if ap-plicable) and other relevant information. Where possible, information is also sent to the national surveillance centre in the country visited. Information is also sent to Enter-net (http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm ), an inter- national public health gastrointest inal disease collaboration, and this is disseminated across Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan and SouthAfrica so that outbreak cases can be linked to any other cases in peo- ple of different nationalities who stayed in the same resort. Due to potential seriousness, information about single cases of E.coli O157 infection in patients who report travel outside Scotland 14 days be-fore symptom onset is disseminated in a similar way as potential out-breaks. So far in 2004, information has been disseminated on 11 cases,three from England, two from Spain, one who travelled to England andSpain, and one each from Cameroon, Dubai, Egypt, France and Tunisia. The largest outbreak identified in Scotland in 2003 was of Cryptosporidium in Majorca [3]. A total of 175 affected people in Scotland were reported to SCIEH. References 1Smith-Palmer A.

Cryptosporidiosis outbreak in British tourists who stayed at a hotel in Majorca, Issue 3 1998 and 2002, the annual average was just over 2000 diagnoses. The cumulative number of HCV diagnoses is now 18 109, of whom 8%are known to have died. Just over 60% of the 18 109 diagnoses are known to have ever in- jected drugs, but modelling work undertaken by the Scottish Centrefor Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) suggests that the pro-portion of HCV positive people who have ever been injecting drugusers (IDUs) is more likely to be around 90%. SCIEH also estimatesthat between 40 000 and 50 000 people in Scotland (population 5million), are HCV antibody positive. The great majority of the 18 109 diagnoses were made in central Scotland, in particular in the Greater Glasgow area, which has oneof the highest prevalences of injecting drug use in western Europe.It is estimated that around 60% of Greater Glasgow's 7000-8000 current IDUs are infected with HCV , and the current incidence ofHCV among the city's population is extremely high at 20-30 per100 years of injecting. In 2002/2003, 32% of IDUs were re-ported to Division's ScottishDrug Misuse Database ( www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org ) indicated that they had shared a needle and syringe in the previous month. Thecorresponding sharing rates for the previous four years since 1998/1999 34%, 34%, 34% and 36%. In 2002/2003, reported having shared spoons, water, filters or solutionsin the previous month. As at the end of 2003, SCIEH estimates that between 500 and 1000 HCV infected persons in Scotland had developed liver failure and/or liver cancer. T o reduce the incidence of HCV-related end stage liverdisease in Scotland in the future, two principal public health chal-lenges have been identified:1. the prevention of HCV among injecting drug users2. the diagnosis and, where appropriate, treatment with antiviral ther-apy of former injectors. Prevention recommendations, April 2004 In April 2004, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh held a Consensus Conference on Hepatitis C. The following key messageswere highlighted in the Consensus Statement, which is available in full at http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/esd/consensus/hep_c_04.html : The hepatitis C epidemic is a public health crisis. Services are already struggling to cope with the burden of infec- tion and liver disease. Significant resources must urgently be directed at improving pre- vention and delivery of care. High priority for case finding should be given to former IDUs, es- pecially those over the age of 40 who are likely to have a stage of dis-ease which would benefit from treatment. Cost effective methods ofidentifying this group, through public awareness initiatives, primarycare, drug treatment services and prisons, should be established. Community based and specialist nurse led services should be provided. The requirement for liver biopsy to determine selection of patients for therapy is no longer essential for all patients. Access to treatment should be broadened to all those who might benefit. References 1SCIEH Weekly Report. Diagnosis of Hepatitis C Virus in Scotland: data to December 2003.

The St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission (standing committee on vaccination,STIKO) at the Robert Koch-Institut in Germany announced thechange in their recently published update to the national vaccine schedule [2]. Previously, varicella vaccination was only recommended in Germany for particular risk groups (and their contacts), and for young peoplewho had not had varicella. These recommendations were often not fol-lowed in the past. In the United States, varicella vaccination has been standard for all children and young people since 1995, with good results [3,4]. The STIKO recommendations should reduce the high numbers of varicellainfections in Germany - estimated at 750 000 cases per year. A re-duction is also expected in the annual number of varicella-associatedcomplications such as bacterial infections and their consequences (abscesses, skin infection) as well as rarer complications affecting thecentral nervous system such as brain inflammation, cerebellitis and en- cephalitis. This will reduce the need for hospital admission of infants and young children, the demands of sick children on parents andtherefore the economic costs. For most vaccinations recommended bythe STIKO, statutory health insurances cover the cost; however, no de-cisions have been made to date whether this will also hold for varicellavaccinations. Herd immunity induced by mass vaccination will also protect non- immune infants, young children, pregnant women and people in riskgroups. According to the official recommendations published in the Epidemiologisches Bulletin [2], varicella vaccination is scheduled for infants aged between 11 and 14 months (given preferably at the sametime as MMR vaccine). Catch-up vaccination for children and adultsis recommended, in particular for persons aged 9-17 years who havenot had varicella infection. National committees in Lithuania and Cyprus have also recom- mended varicella vaccination for all children, but as yet, this does notform part of their national routine vaccination schedule (A Nardone,ESEN-2, personal communication, July 2004).

Eurosurveillance OPV TOIPV USE R Pebody Health Protection Agency Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London, England Published online 19 August 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040819.asp) The United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service recently an- nounced changes to the national childhood immunisation programmewith a shift from the use of live oral polio vaccine (OPV) to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for routine infant and childhood vaccination [1].IPV has been shown to be a safe and effective vaccine, although morecostly than OPV . The UK thus joins a growing list of European countries that use IPV exclusively in their routine immunisation programme (currently 16 of the 30 European countries in the TABLE)(EUV AC.NET.http://www.ssi.dk/euvac/)*. Some of these counties such as Franceand Sweden have had successful routine IPV programmes for manyyears, while others such as Ireland have moved only very recently from routine OPV to IPV use. Seven other countries, mainly in east-ern and southern Europe, continue to only use OPV , while seven havemixed programmes: recommending IPV for the primary schedule(or part of it) and OPV for subsequent booster doses. TABLE Polio vaccine recommendations in Europe Childh ood schedule (>12 published 19/08/2004 originally stated that Spain and Slovenia used OPV for both infant and childhood vaccination. In fact, Spain switched to IPV use only for both schedules in March 2004.Slovenia also switched to IPV for infant vaccination in 2004 and uses both IPV and OPV for childhood boosters, with a plan to use IPV only from 2005or2006.Historically, OPV has been used widely in both routine programmes and mass campaigns as it is a cheap, easily administered vaccine thatinduces both systemic and mucosal immunity. In addition, the use ofOPV has the benefit of providing protection to close contacts of vac-cinees through person-to-person transmission. These factors havelead directly to the success of the World Health Organization (WHO)global initiative to eradicate polio [2]. In 2002, 51 member states of the WHO European Region were declared polio-free and in 2003,less than 700 cases were reported globally, most of these in six coun-tries in west Africa and south Asia [3]. However, unlike IPV , OPV is associated with a small but real risk of vaccine-associated paralytic po-lio (V APP)(estimated to be one per 790 000 first doses) in vaccineesand their contacts. As the risk of importation of polio into Europe isnow diminishingly small, IPV use, which carries no risk of V APP , isthus being increasingly preferred by European countries. Furthermore, mutations of live vaccine-derived polioviruses have lead to the emergence of circulating neurovirulent strains with wild-type characteristics that have been responsible for documented polio outbreaks in areas of low vaccine coverage e.g. in Madagascar andthe Philippines. This has raised concerns about the persistence of vac-cine-derived strains in the post-eradication era, particularly if vaccinecoverage levels decline and OPV use continues. There has been con- siderable debate as to the most appropriate strategy that should be used(the \"end-game\") before and after global polio eradication, including eventual cessation of OPV use [4]. Switching to IPV use, although cur- rently too expensive for many low-income countries, provides an al- ternative to OPV and, on the condition that high coverage levels are achieved, maintains population immunity at levels that prevent boththe emergence of neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses and re-introduction of wild-type polio.
