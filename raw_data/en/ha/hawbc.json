Jami Kinnucan, MD Assistant Professor of Medicine University of Michigan Director of IBD Metro Health, University of Michigan Disclosures Advisory board member Abbvie Janssen Pfizer Crohn's and Colitis Foundation National Scientific Advisory Committee Chair, Patient Education Committee Outline Overview of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in IBD Provide overview of evidence (if any ) for various CAM - based approaches 1.Dietary modifications 4.Cannabis 5.Hypnotherapy 6.Low 7.Exercise and yoga (not covered) Outline: Disclaimer While this is meant to be an overview of more common patient driven discussions about CAM in IBD, it is not meant to be a complete comprehensive overview. What do we mean by \"complementary and alternative medicine\" (CAM)? A group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products not presently part of conventional medicine 30-50% of IBD patients report CAM use Worms Probiotics Fecal transplants Cannabis 41% Herbal Supplements 15% Alt. Medical Practices28% Special Diet -1568 . Top reasons why IBD patients use CAM Direct disease benefits Indirect disease benefits Search for optimum therapy Want better control of symptoms and disease Avoidance of steroid -based therapies Unable to deal with the side effects of conventional therapies Ineffective conventional medical therapiesTake control over treatment Better quality of life due to control of treatment options Considered \"safer\" than conventional therapy Dietary Modifications Dietary Modifications? Is there a role? Dietary modifications Alteration of the gut bacteria Immune system alteration Effects in Crohn's disease & ulcerative colitis ? If only it were that simple... Dietary modifications are difficult to study in a human populationHope or Hype: Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) Proposed by Dr. Sydney Haas in 1924 for management of celiac disease Avoidance of di -and poly -saccharide carbs Small case series of self -reported SCD among IBD patients (n=50) Patients noted improvement in clinical symptoms with SCD diet, most still taking their IBD therapies Caution: case series so there was no report on patients NOT on SCD diet for comparison Lack of data= Hype Kakodkar S et al. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Genetics. Hope or Hype: Low FODMAP Diet FODMAPs are highly fermentable but poorly absorbed carbohydrates Elimination of high FODMAP foods for 6 -8 weeks Significant improvement in patients with visceral hypersensitivity (IBS) Studies in IBD patients have shown symptomatic improvement No assessment of disease activity Hope as adjuvant therapy Hope or Hype: Omega -3 Fatty Acids Fish oils containing Omega -3 Fatty Acids: Naturally found in fish, fish oil, canola oil, soybean oil and dietary supplements Results from small trials are inconsistent Large trial in over 700 Crohn's disease patients No benefit over placebo Feagan BG, et al. JAMA . 2008;299:1690 -1697. Hope as adjuvant therapy Summary: Diet in IBD Most of the evidence shows that patients can FEEL better when they perform dietary modifications No significant data to show that dietary modifications CHANGE disease activity More studies need to be completed to show overall effects in Crohn's and colitis Crohn's and Colitis Foundation's DINE (turmeric) Curcumin (1100 -2000 mg/day) Large pilot study as adjuvant therapy UC (89 patients) showed decrease in clinical relapse @ 6 months1 Pilot study of adjuvant therapy in UC and CD (n=10): Decrease 5ASA dosage in UC, improved symptoms in CD2 What is needed? Large prospective, randomized controlled trials to show benefit Current studies with no objective evaluation/follow -up Initial small studies show some promise Standardization of dosing 1.Hanai H, et al. ClinGastroenterol Hepatol .2006;4:1502 Sci . 2005;50:2191 -2193 .Hope as adjuvant therapy Hope or Hype: Vitamin D Vitamin D is a hormone with immune system effects Normal levels >30 ng/ml 60-70% of IBD patients are deficient in Vitamin D Low Vitamin D levels have been linked to more severe disease Increased risk for surgery, hospitalization Colon cancer, C. diff infection Small studies (n=18 -20) show that supplementation leads to improved disease activity and quality of life It is easy and safe to supplement Hope as adjuvant therapyBased on the idea that inflammation is driven by a gut bacteria dysbiosis and that restoration of a healthy microbiome can improve inflammation Probiotics Traditional, commensal species, genetically engineered Symptom benefit reported with use Many do not colonize the gut, not able to recover in stool samples after 1 -4 weeks Remember: Not all probiotics are created Sing study showing E. coli Nissile 1917 improved clinical symptoms in Crohn's disease (not available) No improvement with VSL#3\u00ae or others in post -surgery prevention of recurrence Ulcerative colitis Multiple studies showing E. coli Nissile 1917 showed equal benefit to mesaslamine (5-ASA) in mild disease (not available) VSL#3\u00ae -with benefit as adjuvant therapy in ulcerative colitis and for patients with recurrent pouchitis Hope as adjuvant therapy in UC Cannabis Hope or Hype: Cannabis to treat IBD Cannabis sativa Cannabis also known as marijuana Composed of compounds or phytocannabinoids Delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Cannabidiol (CBD) Cannabinoids endocannabinoid system Synthetic THC cannabinoids exist but have not been tested in IBD Image adapted from Peak Pharma What are the clinical effects of cannabinoids (cannabis)? ? Decreased diarrhea? Antiemetic Improved sleep Appetite stimulation Pain relief Cannabis: medicinal effectsCannabis timeline Where is cannabis legal NOW? As of March 2018 DISCLAIMER : It is still considered Schedule I drug under the Federal Controlled Substance Act Image adapted from Wikipedia, Sept 1, 2018IBD patients are using cannabis 15-20% IBD patients report active cannabis use Up to 40% report prior use of cannabis They indicate use to relieve IBD -related symptoms To improve pain, appetite and diarrhea, nausea More than 50% express interest if it were to become legalized Majority mention that they do not discuss use with their health care providerWhat are the benefits of cannabis in Crohn's disease patients? First small study showed decreased steroid requirement associated with cannabis use Follow -up first randomized control trial in 21 patients showing overall clinical improvement Smoked 2 cannabis cigarettes/day x 8 weeks Significant improvement in clinical symptoms and quality of life 45% patients achieved clinical remission, however no statistical difference from placebo Nochange in hemoglobin or C -reactive protein (inflammation marker) Small study looking at oralcannabidiol (no THC) showed no difference in clinical symptoms or lab assessment What are the benefits of cannabis in ulcerative colitis patients? Limited data in ulcerative colitis First randomized controlled trial in 60 patients with ulcerative colitis on mesalamine therapy Only 59% of patients completed assigned therapy vs. placebo No difference in remission rates Trend towards improved quality of life Preliminary data presented in 28 patients with ulcerative colitis showed improvement in clinical symptoms and endoscopic (colonoscopy) change So what are the risks? Long -term effects have not been well studied Large study published looking at risks in allcannabis users Risk for addiction to other substances, diminished life achievement, increased motor vehicle accidents, chronic bronchitis, psychiatric disturbances Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome Most studies in IBD show no significant adverse effects However the studies have been small in size Risks that have been shown in studies Increased risk for discontinuation of conventional therapy and relapse of disease Increased risk for surgery in Crohn's disease Summary: Cannabis in IBD Large percentage of IBD patients have used or are using cannabis to manage IBD -related symptoms Studies have shown some benefits of cannabis use in IBD, however no studies have shown significant impact on disease activity and some showing possible risk Important to discuss use with health care provider, important to not stop conventional medical therapy More studies are needed Hope as adjuvant therapyGut-Directed Hypnotherapy Hope or Hype: Gut -Directed Hypnotherapy Small study show that gut -directed hypnotherapy showed possible disease modifying benefit 17 patients who had a single session of gut -directed hypnotherapy had reduced mucosa levels of inflammatory proteins Randomized -control trial (only) in 54 ulcerative colitis patients showed prolonged clinical remission Attended 7 sessions of gut -directed hypnotherapy Remission 2.5 months greater than placebo University of Michigan has GI -specific psychologist who performs gut -directed hypnotherapy (Dr. Megan Riehl) Slide content c/o Dr. Megan RiehlHope or Hype: Complementary and alternative medicine In general there are several CAM therapies that have HOPE as adjuvant therapy in the management of ongoing symptoms Important for patients to work with health care providers about how they incorporate CAM therapies into existing treatment plans (not replace!) Thank you Questions will be taken at the end of the discussions today Some other therapies (not discussed today) Low dose naltrexone Exercise/yoga Hope or Hype?: Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) LDN is inexpensive, daily oral therapy with low risk profile that has been minimally studied Mechanism: opioid antagonist that can act in the gut, central nervous system and immune cells Two small studies Small open -label (no placebo) study in 17 patients showed clinical improvement in majority of patients, improvement in quality of life Small (n=34) placebo -controlled study showed clinical response but no clinical or endoscopic remission at 12 weeks Side effects present: diarrhea, abdominal pain, insomnia, nausea and vomiting Likely Hype: No clear evidenceHope or Hype?: Exercise/Yoga Exercise Low to moderate physical activity may improve symptoms of IBD Walking with improvement in mood, fatigue, weight maintenance and osteoporosis Yoga 100 patients (60 UC, 40 CD) in remission Decreased joint pain, abdominal pain, anxiety Hope as adjuvant therapy "}
