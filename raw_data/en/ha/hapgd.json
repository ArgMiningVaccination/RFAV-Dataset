The division may establish a range of amounts to be paid from the fund, or may base payments on methods such as pay for performance, task order, or firm fixed pricing, which are designed to provide incentives for contractors to more tightly control corrective action costs, and shall establish criteria to be met by persons who contract to perform corrective action to be eligible for reimbursement from the fund. The criteria may include the certification of individua ls, partnerships, and companies. Criteria shall be established to certify laboratories that contract to perform analytical testing related to the underground storage tank program. Owners and operators shall have all required analytical testing performed by a certified laboratory to be eligible for fund participation. Persons who contract with petroleum storage tank owners or operators shall not be paid more than the amount authorized by the division for reimbursement from the fund for the performance of cor rective action. At a minimum, the division shall promulgate administrative regulations that will insure an unobligated balance in the fund adequate to meet financial assurance requirements and corrective action requirements of KRS 224.60 -135(2) and CHAPTER 47 271 (4). If the unobligated balance in the fund is not adequate to meet the requirements of this paragraph, the division shall obligate funds necessary to meet these requirements; (b) Establish by administrative regulation the criteria to be met to be eligible to par ticipate in the financial responsibility and petroleum storage tank accounts and to receive reimbursement from these accounts.

Owners or operators seeking coverage under the petroleum storage tank account shall file for eligibility and for financial assistance with the division. To ensure cost effectiveness, the division shall promulgate adm inistrative regulations specifying the circumstances under which prior approval of corrective action costs shall be required for those costs to be eligible for reimbursement from the fund. In promulgating administrative regulations to carry out this sectio n, the division may distinguish between types, classes, and ages of petroleum storage tanks and the degree of compliance of the facility with any administrative regulations of the cabinet promulgated pursuant to KRS 224.60 -105 or applicable federal regulat ions; (c) Establish a financial responsibility account within the fund which may be used by petroleum storage tank owners and operators to demonstrate financial responsibility as required by administrative regulations of the cabinet or the federal regulati ons applicable to petroleum storage tanks, consistent with the intent of the General Assembly as set forth in KRS 224.60 -120(5). The account shall receive four-tenths of one cent ($0.004) from the one and four -tenths cent ($0.014) paid on each gallon of gasoline and special fuels received in this state pursuant to KRS 224.60 -145.

The account shall receive one cent ($0.01) from the one and four -tenths cent ($0.014) paid on each gallon of gasoline and special fuels received in this state pursuant to KRS 224.60 -145. This account shall not be used to compensate third parties for bodily injury and property damage. Within three (3) months after July 15, 2004, the division shall develop a plan to address the payment of claims and completion of corrective action at facilities eligible for reimbursement from this account. The division shall establish a ranking system to be used for the distribution of amounts from this account for the purpose of corrective action. In promulgating administrative regulations to carry out this section, the division shall consider the financial ability of the petroleum storage tank owner or operator to perform corrective action and the extent of damage caused by a release into the environment from a petroleum storage tank; (f) Hear complaints brought before the division regarding the payment of claims from the fund in accordance with KRS 224.10 -410 to 224.10 -470; (g) Establish and maintain necessary offices within this state, appoint employees and agents as necessary, and prescribe their duties and co mpensation; (h) Employ, in accordance with the procedures found in KRS 45A.690 to 45A.725 for awarding personal service contracts, a qualified actuary to perform actuarial studies, as directed by the division, for determining an appropriate reserve in the financial responsibility account and the petroleum storage tank account sufficient to satisfy the obligations in each account for all eligible facilities and to satisfy future liabilities and expenses necessary to operate each account.

The expenditures shall be paid from the appropriate account; (j) Establish a small operators' tank removal account within the fund to reimburse the reas onable cost of tank system removal for small owners and operators. The account shall not be used when an owner or operator is removing the tank with the intention of replacing or upgrading the tank.

The division shall not place a limit on the number of tanks that an owner or operator has in order to be eligible to participate in the p rogram and receive reimbursement under this paragraph; (k) Establish by administrative regulation the policy, guidelines, and procedures to perform financial audits of any petroleum storage tank owner or operator receiving reimbursement from the fund or an y entity contracting or subcontracting to provide corrective action services for facilities eligible for fund reimbursement.

Financial auditing services may be contracted for or personnel may be employed as ne eded to implement the requirements of this paragraph; (l) Be authorized to enter and inspect any facility intending to seek reimbursement for the cost of corrective action to determine the reasonableness and necessity of the cost of corrective action. The division may collect soil or water samples or require storage tank owners or operators to split samples with the division for analytical testing. Refusal to allow entry and inspection of a facility or refusal to allow the division to collect or split sampl es shall make the facility ineligible for fund participation; (m) Have inspectors on site at all tank system removals. Failure to comply with this provision shall make the facility ineligible for fund participation. A petroleum storage tank owner or operat or may request through certified mail that the division schedule an inspector to be present at an upcoming tank removal. If the request is made at least two (2) weeks before the time for the removal and an inspector fails to be present at the time schedule d, the tank removal may proceed without making the facility ineligible for fund participation unless the owner is notified by the division no later than ten (10) days prior to the proposed date that an inspector is not available on the proposed date, in wh ich event a representative of the division shall contact the operator and schedule a new date. If no inspector is present at the rescheduled date, the removal may then proceed without penalty; and (n) Establish that the deadline for submission of final rei mbursement requests under the petroleum storage tank account is two (2) years after receipt of a no further action letter. (2) The division may advise the cabinet on the promulgation of administrative regulations concerning petroleum storage tanks. (3) The division may sue and be sued in its own name. (4) The division may transfer funds from the petroleum storage tank account to the small operator tank removal account as needed to satisfy the obligations, future liabilities, and expenses necessary to operat e that account.

The [ Bond Pool] commission may provide coverage under the bond pool fund established pursuant to Section 2 of this Act not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the bond amount which the cabinet determines under KRS 350.060 is necessary for t he abandoned mine land. (2) When the bond required for the abandoned mine land under KRS 350.060 is increased or reduced, or is released in whole or in part, the coverage provided by the bond pool shall be proportionately increased or reduced. (3) In the e vent of bond forfeiture on the property, moneys from the bond pool fund shall be used to supplement the forfeited bond [ as provided in KRS 350.745] . Section 11. KRS 350.990 is amended to read as follows: CHAPTER 78 431 (1) Any permittee, person, or operator who violat es any of the provisions of this chapter or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto or who fails to perform the duties imposed by these provisions, except the refusal or failure to obtain a permit or other authorization as provided in this chapter, or who violates any determination or order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be liable to a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the violation, and an additional civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each day during which the violation continues, and in addition, may be enjoined from continuing the violations provided in this section. Any permittee, operator, or person who fails to abate a violation noted in a notice of n oncompliance or an order for immediate compliance and cessation within the time period prescribed for the abatement shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for each day during which the violation continues. Any person issued an order pursuant to KRS 350.130(4) shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation cited in the underlying notice of noncompliance issued therewith. No separate civil penalty shall be ass essed for the order issued pursuant to KRS 350.130(4). Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessment. The cabinet shall develop a method for calculating monetary penalties and shall promulgate it as an administrative regulation. The secretary or a designated representative, upon his or her own initiative or upon written request received within fifteen (15) days after the cabinet mails its proposed penalty assessment, may waive the use of the method fo r calculating monetary penalties if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the penalty is demonstrably unjust. The basis for every waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the case. If the secretary or his or her designated representative waives the use of the formula, he or she shall determine the appropriate penalty upon consideration of the permittee's history of previous violations at the particular surface coal mining o peration, the seriousness of the violation, whether the permittee was negligent, and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. The penalties shall be recoverable in a n action brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Kentucky by the cabinet. The Franklin Circuit Court shall hold concurrent jurisdiction and venue of all civil and injunctive actions instituted by the cabinet for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the orders and administrative regulations of the cabinet promulgated pursuant thereto.

[ If the bond pool fund falls below sixteen million dollars ($16,000,000) or a higher amount as may be established by the most recent actuarial study, all excess moneys shall be deposited in the bond pool fund until that fund r eaches sixteen million dollars ($16,000,000) or a higher amount as may be established by the most recent actuarial study.] All moneys previously deposited in the abandoned mine land enhancement fund shall be redeposited in the reclamation guaranty [bond poo l] fund. (2) Any person or operator who engages in surface coal mining operations without first securing a permit, as provided in KRS 350.060, or any person who engages in coal exploration operations, exclusive of core drilling, without proper authorizatio n, as required by the cabinet pursuant to KRS 350.057 or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, or any person or operator who engages in other mining operations, without proper authorization as required by this chapter or administrative r egulations promulgated pursuant thereto, shall be liable to a civil penalty for damages to the Commonwealth of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) nor more than twenty -five thousand dollars ($25,000) and in addition, may be enjoined from continuin g the violations. Each day shall constitute a separate violation. In addition to the foregoing penalties, any permittee, person, or operator who fails to abate a violation of KRS 350.060 or KRS 350.029 or KRS 350.057, as noted in a notice of noncompliance or an order for immediate compliance and cessation within the time period prescribed for the abatement, shall be assessed an additional civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for each day during which the violation continues. How ever, the penalties provided in subsection (1) of this section shall apply in lieu of the penalties provided in this subsection where an operator or permittee through inadvertence has exceeded the boundaries or expiration date of the permit in effect at th at time. (3) The cabinet shall bring an action for the recovery of penalties and bring an action for a restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction, against any permittee, operator, or person violating or threatening to violate any of the provision s of this chapter or violating or threatening to violate any order or determination issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The Franklin Circuit Court shall hold concurrent jurisdiction ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 432 and venue of all civil and injunctive actions instituted by the cabinet for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the orders and administrative regulations of the cabinet promulgated pursuant thereto. (4) Any permittee, operator, or person who knowingly and willfully violates any of the provisions o f this chapter, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, or any determination or order issued pursuant to the sections of this chapter which have become final, shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.

ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 508 (6)[(8)] The department may prescribe forms and promulgate administrative regulations to execute and administer the provisions of this section. (7)[(9)] The General Assembly recognizes that increasing taxes on tobacco products should reduce consumption, and therefore result in healthier lifestyles for Kentuckians. The relative taxes on tobacco products proposed in this section reflect the growing data fro m scientific studies suggesting that although smokeless tobacco poses some risks, those health risks are significantly less than the risks posed by other forms of tobacco products. Moreover, the General Assembly acknowledges that some in the public health community recognize that tobacco harm reduction should be a complementary public health strategy regarding tobacco products. Taxing tobacco products according to relative risk is a rational tax policy and may well serve the public health goal of reducing s moking -related mortality and morbidity and lowering health care costs associated with tobacco -related disease.

If the amount paid for a certificate of delinquency is above seven hundred one dollars ($701), actual reasonable fees incurred up to seventy percent (70%) of the amount of the certificate of delinquency, not to exceed seven hundred dollars ($700). d. If a third -party purchaser is the owner of more than one (1) certificate of delinquency against the same taxpayer, actual and reasonable prelitigation attorneys' fees for all ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 520 certificates of delinquency against the same taxpayer shall not exceed one and one -half (1.5) times the maximum amount permitted in paragraph (a) of this subsection for the largest tax bill owed by the taxpayer; and 3. The amounts allowed by subparagraph 2. of this paragraph shall not accrue to the account of the delinquent taxpayer, nor be charged by the third -party purchaser against the delinquent taxpayer all at one (1) time unless the amount of certificate of delinquency is one hundred seventy -five dollar s ($175) or less. The third -party purchaser may accrue to the account of the delinquent taxpayer, and charge the delinquent taxpayer an amount equal to the lesser of prelitigation attorney's fees incurred by the third -party purchaser since the prior notice was sent or one hundred seventy -five dollars ($175), for each notice sent to the delinquent taxpayer, provided that: a. The total aggregate amount of prelitigation attorneys' fees that may accrue to the account of the delinquent taxpayer and be charged by the third -party purchaser against the delinquent taxpayer shall not exceed the limitations established by paragraph (a) of this subsection; and b. Additional fees shall not accrue to the account of the delinquent taxpayer or be charged by the third -party purchaser against the delinquent taxpayer more frequently than every ninety (90) days, regardless of how many notices the third -party purchaser may send. (2) If the delinquent taxpayer and the third -party purchaser enter into a payment agreement, the third -party purchaser may collect the installment payment processing fee authorized by KRS 134.490(5). (3) (a) In addition to the fees established by subsections (1), (2), and (4) of this section, a third -party purchaser may collect actual, reasonable attorneys ' fees and costs that arise due to the prosecution of collection remedies or the protection of a certificate of delinquency that is involved in litigation. Fees and costs permitted under this subsection include fees and costs incurred from the first day af ter the notice required by KRS 134.490(2) is sent through the day any litigation is finally concluded. (b) For purposes of this subsection: 1. Actual attorneys' litigation fees up to two thousand dollars ($2,000) may be reasonable if the fees are based upo n documented work performed at a rate commensurate with hourly rates customarily charged by private attorneys in that jurisdiction for similar services. A flat rate, without hours documented for work performed, may be reasonable if the flat fee is determin ed to be discounted from the usual and customary rates for comparable work; and 2. Any attorneys' litigation fee in excess of two thousand dollars ($2,000) shall be allowed if authorized by the court upon a finding that the third -party purchaser incurred a ctual attorneys' litigation fees in excess of two thousand dollars ($2,000) and that those attorneys' litigation fees were warranted based upon the complexity of the issues presented in the litigation. (4) The third -party purchaser may collect administrati ve fees incurred for preparing, recording, and releasing an assignment of the certificate of delinquency in the county clerk's office, not to exceed one hundred fifteen dollars ($115). (5) The General Assembly recognizes that third -party purchasers play an important role in the delinquent tax collection system, allowing taxing districts to receive needed funds on a timely basis. The General Assembly has carefully considered the fees and charges authorized by this section, and has determined that the amounts established are reasonable based on the costs of collection and fees and charges incurred in litigation. (6) A certificate of delinquency owned by a third -party purchaser shall be deemed a general intangible for the purposes of Article 9 of KRS Chapter 35 5. Signed by Governor March 22, 2013.

Funds shall be distributed by the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority in accordance with Section 1 of this Act. Section 3. KRS 157.360 is amended to read as follows: (1) (a) In determining the cost of the p rogram to support education excellence in Kentucky, the statewide guaranteed base funding level, as defined in KRS 157.320, shall be computed by dividing the amount appropriated for this purpose by the prior year's statewide average daily attendance. (b) When determining the biennial appropriations for the program, the average daily attendance for each fiscal year shall include an estimate of the number of students graduating early under the provisions of Section 1 of this Act. (2) Each district shall recei ve an amount equal to the base funding level for each pupil in average daily attendance in the district in the previous year , except a district shall receive an amount equal to one -half (1/2) of the state portion of the average statewide per pupil guarante ed base funding level for each student who graduated early under the provisions of Section 1 of this Act . Each district's base funding level shall be adjusted by the following factors: (a) The number of at -risk students in the district. At -risk students sh all be identified as those approved for the free lunch program under state and federal guidelines. The number of at -risk students shall be multiplied by a factor to be established by the General Assembly. Funds generated under this paragraph may be used to pay for: 1. Alternative programs for students who are at risk of dropping out of school before achieving a diploma; and 2. A hazardous duty pay supplement as determined by the local board of education to the teachers who work in alternative programs with students who are violent or assaultive; (b) The number and types of exceptional children in the district as defined by KRS 157.200. Specific weights for each category of exceptionality shall be used in the calculation of the add -on factor for exceptional c hildren; and (c) Transportation costs. The per -pupil cost of transportation shall be calculated as provided by KRS 157.370. Districts which contract to furnish transportation to students attending nonpublic schools may adopt any payment formula which assur es that no public school funds are used for the transportation of nonpublic students. (3) Beginning with the 2015 -2016 school year and each year thereafter, the General Assembly shall annually allocate funds equal to one -half (1/2) of the state portion of the average statewide per pupil guaranteed base funding level for each student who graduated early under the provisions of Section 1 of this Act the previous school year to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority for deposit in the early graduat ion scholarship trust fund. (4) The program to support education excellence in Kentucky shall be fully implemented by the 1994 -95 school year. (5)[(4)] (a) Except for those schools which have implemented school -based decision making, the commissioner of ed ucation shall enforce maximum class sizes for every academic course requirement in all grades except in vocal and instrumental music, and physical education classes. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the maximum number of pupils enrolle d in a class shall be as follows: 1. Twenty -four (24) in primary grades (kindergarten through third grade); CHAPTER 104 523 2. Twenty -eight (28) in grade four (4); 3. Twenty -nine (29) in grades five (5) and six (6); 4. Thirty -one (31) in grades seven (7) to twelve (12). (b) Except for those schools which have implemented school -based decision making, class size loads for middle and secondary school classroom teachers shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) pupil hours per day. (c) The commissioner of edu cation, upon approval of the Kentucky Board of Education, shall adopt administrative regulations for enforcing this provision. These administrative regulations shall include procedures for a superintendent to request an exemption from the Kentucky Board of Education when unusual circumstances warrant an increased class size for an individual class. A request for an exemption shall include specific reasons for the increased class size with a plan for reducing the class size prior to the beginning of the next school year. A district shall not receive in any one (1) year exemptions for more classes than enroll twenty percent (20%) of the pupils in the primary grades and grades four (4) through eight (8). (d) In all schools the commissioner of education shall en force the special education maximum class sizes set by administrative regulations adopted by the Kentucky Board of Education. A superintendent may request an exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. A local school council may request a waive r pursuant to KRS 156.160(2). An exemption or waiver shall not be granted if the increased class size will impede any exceptional child from achieving his individual education program in the least restrictive environment. (6)[(5)] In grades four (4) throug h six (6) with combined grades, the maximum class size shall be the average daily attendance upon which funding is appropriated for the lowest assigned grade in the class. There shall be no exceptions to the maximum class size for combined classes. In comb ined classes other than the primary grades, no ungraded students shall be placed in a combined class with graded students. In addition, there shall be no more than two (2) consecutive grade levels combined in any one (1) class in grades four (4) through si x (6). However, this shall not apply to schools which have implemented school -based decision making. (7)[(6)] If a local school district, through its admission and release committee, determines that an appropriate program in the least restrictive environme nt for a particular child with a disability includes either part -time or full-time enrollment with a private school or agency within the state or a public or private agency in another state, the school district shall count as average daily attendance in a public school the time that the child is in attendance at the school or agency, contingent upon approval by the commissioner of education. (8)[(7)] Pupils attending a center for child learning and study established under an agreement pursuant to KRS 65.210 to 65.300 shall, for the purpose of calculating average daily attendance, be considered as in attendance in the school district in which the child legally resides and which is party to the agreement. For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, teacher s who are actually employees of the joint or cooperative action shall be considered as employees of each school district which is a party to the agreement. (9)[(8)] Program funding shall be increased when the average daily attendance in any district for th e first two (2) months of the current school year is greater than the average daily attendance of the district for the first two (2) months of the previous school year. The program funds allotted the district shall be increased by the percent of increase. The average daily attendance in kindergarten is the kindergarten full -time equivalent pupils in average daily attendance. (10)[(9)] If the average daily attendance for the current school year in any district decreases by ten percent (10%) or more than the average daily attendance for the previous school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the next school year shall be increased by an amount equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the decrease in average daily attendance. If the average daily attendance remains the same or decreases in the succeeding school year, the average daily attendance for purposes of calculating program funding for the following school year shall be increased by an amount equal to one -third (1/3) of the decrease for the first year of the decline. (11)[(10)] If the percentage of attendance of any school district shall have been reduced more than two percent (2%) during the previous school year, the program funding allotted the district for the current school year shall be increased by the difference in the percentage of attendance for the two (2) years immediately prior to the current school year less two percent (2%). ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 524 (12)[(11)] (a) Instructional salaries for vocational agriculture classes shall be for twelve (12) months per year.

During extended employment, no vocational agriculture teacher shall receive salary on a day that the teacher is sche duled to attend an institution of higher education class which could be credited toward meeting any certification requirement. (b) Each teacher of agriculture employed shall submit an annual plan for summer program to the local school superintendent for ap proval. The summer plan shall include a list of tasks to be performed, purposes for each task, and time to be spent on each task. Approval by the local school superintendent shall be in compliance with the guidelines developed by the Department of Educatio n. The supervision and accountability of teachers of vocational agriculture's summer programs shall be the responsibility of the local school superintendent. The local school superintendent shall submit to the commissioner of education a completed report o f summer tasks for each vocational agriculture teacher. Twenty percent (20%) of the approved vocational agriculture programs shall be audited annually by the State Department of Education to determine that the summer plan has been properly executed. (13)[(12)] (a) In allotting program funds for home and hospital instruction, statewide guaranteed base funding, excluding the capital outlay, shall be allotted for each child in average daily attendance in the prior school year who has been properly identified a ccording to Kentucky Board of Education administrative regulations. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported monthly on forms provided by the Department of Education; and (b) Pursuant to administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education, local school districts shall be reimbursed for home and hospital instruction for pupils unable to attend regular school sessions because of short term health impairments. A reimbursement formula shall be established by adminis trative regulations to include such factors as a reasonable per hour, per child allotment for teacher instructional time, with a maximum number of funded hours per week, a reasonable allotment for teaching supplies and equipment, and a reasonable allotment for travel expenses to and from instructional assignments, but the formula shall not include an allotment for capital outlay. Attendance shall be calculated pursuant to KRS 157.270 and shall be reported annually on forms provided by the Department of Educ ation. (14)[(13)] Except for those schools which have implemented school -based decision making and the school council has voted to waive this subsection, kindergarten aides shall be provided for each twenty -four (24) full -time equivalent kindergarten stude nts enrolled. (15)[(14)] Effective July 1, 2001, there shall be no deduction applied against the base funding level for any pupil in average daily attendance who spends a portion of his or her school day in a program at a state -operated career and technica l education or vocational facility. (16)[(15)] During a fiscal year, a school district may request that the Department of Education recalculate its funds allocated under this section if the current year average daily attendance for the twenty (20) day scho ol month as defined in KRS 158.060(1) that contains the most days within the calendar month of January exceeds the prior year adjusted average daily attendance plus growth by at least one percent (1%). Any adjustments in the allotments approved under this subsection shall be proportional to the remaining days in the school year and subject to available funds under the program to support education excellence in Kentucky. (17)[(16)] To calculate the state portion of the program to support education excellence in Kentucky for a school district, the Department of Education shall subtract the local effort required under KRS 157.390(5) from the calculated base funding under the program to support education excellence in Kentucky, as required by this section. The v alue of the real estate used in this calculation shall be the lesser of the current year assessment or the prior year assessment increased by four percent (4%) plus the value of current year new property. The calculation under this subsection shall be subj ect to available funds. (18)[(17)] Notwithstanding any other statute or budget of the Commonwealth language to the contrary, time missed due to shortening days for emergencies may be made up by lengthening school days in the school calendar without any los s of funds under the program to support education excellence in Kentucky. CHAPTER 104 525 Section 4. KRS 157.420 is amended to read as follows: Public school funds made available to the credit of each district during any year shall be received, held, and expended by th e district board, subject to the provisions of law and administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education. The following restrictions shall govern the expenditure of funds from the public school fund: (1) The salary paid any rank of teachers sha ll be at least equivalent to the amount set forth in the biennial budget schedule for each rank and experience for a term of one hundred eighty -five (185) days for full -time service during the regular school year. (2) Beginning with the 2004 -2006 biennium, the Kentucky Board of Education shall not approve any working budget or salary schedule for local boards of education for any school year unless the one hundred eighty -five (185) day salary schedule for certified staff has been adjusted over the previous year's salary schedule by a percentage increase at least equal to the cost -of-living adjustment that is provided state government workers under the biennial budget. The base funding level in the program for support education excellence in Kentucky as defin ed in KRS 157.320 shall be increased by the statewide dollar value of the annual required cost -of- living percentage adjustment that shall be estimated on the sum of the previous year's statewide teachers' salaries. (3) A district that compensates its teach ers or employees for unused sick leave at the time of retirement, pursuant to KRS 161.155, may create an escrow account to maintain the amount of funds necessary to pay teachers or employees who qualify for receipt of the benefit. The fund is limited to no t more than fifty percent (50%) of the maximum liability for the current year to be determined according to the number of staff employed by the district on September 15. Interest generated by the account shall be calculated as part of the total amount. The funds shall not be used for any purpose other than compensation for unused sick leave at the time of retirement and shall not be considered as part of the general fund balance in determining available local revenue for purposes of KRS 157.620. (4) (a) The per pupil capital outlay allotment for each district from the public school fund and from local sources shall be kept in a separate account and may be used by the district only for capital outlay projects approved by the commissioner of education in accor dance with requirements of law, and based on a survey made in accordance with administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education. These funds shall be used for the following capital outlay purposes: 1. For direct payment of construction costs; 2. For debt service on voted and funding bonds; 3. For payment or lease -rental agreements under which the board eventually will acquire ownership of a school plant; 4. For the retirement of any deficit resulting from overexpenditure for capital construction , if such deficit resulted from an emergency declared by the Kentucky Board of Education under KRS 160.550; and 5. As a reserve fund for the above -named purposes, to be carried forward in ensuing budgets. (b) A district may submit a request to the commissioner of education to use funds from the per pupil capital outlay allotment to purchase land for a new school or to modify an existing school if the project is included on the district facility plan for completion within eight (8) years. The land sh all not be included in the calculation of the school district's unmet need. The commissioner may grant or deny the district's request at his or her discretion. (c) A district which has experienced an increase in adjusted average daily attendance, as define d by administrative regulation, of twenty percent (20%) or more over a five (5) year period may submit a request to the commissioner of education to use capital outlay funds for the operation of a new school for the first two (2) years following its openin g.

(6) If any district has a special levy for capital outlay or debt service that is equal to the capital outlay allotment or a proportionate fraction thereof, and spends the proceeds of that levy for the above -named purposes, the commissioner of education under administrative regulations of the Kentucky Board of Education, may authorize the district to use all or a proportionate fraction of its capital outlay allotment for current expenses. However, a district which uses capital outlay funds f or current expenses shall not be eligible to participate in the School Facilities Construction Commission funds, except when the current expenditures are approved by the commissioner of education under subsection (4)(b) or (c) of this section. (7) If a sur vey shows that a school district has no capital outlay needs as shown in subsection (4)(a)1., 2., 3., and 4. of this section, upon approval of the commissioner of education, these funds may be used for school plant maintenance, repair, insurance on buildin gs, replacement of equipment, purchase of school buses, and the purchase of modern technological equipment, including telecommunications hardware, televisions, computers, and other technological hardware to be utilized for educational purposes only.

Provided, however, that any legislator who was in office on July 1, 1980, and who is in office at the time he makes the election may, after the expi ration of the thirty (30) day period and until May 1, 1982, make the election, in which event he shall pay to the Legislators' Retirement Plan, for the months between July 1, 1980, and the date of his election such sum as, when added to any member's contri bution by him that is transferred from another retirement system under KRS 6.535, will equal the member's contribution required by this section. If the member makes his election after February 1, 1981, he shall in addition pay to the plan interest on the f oregoing sum, at six percent (6%) per annum, calculated as if the sum consisted of equal monthly payments, one (1) of which was due at the end of each month between July 1, 1980, and the date the election was made. The election shall be addressed to and fi led with the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet and shall constitute an authorization to the secretary to thereafter cause to be deducted from the member's monthly creditable compensation an amount equal to five percent (5%) thereof, as a voluntarily elected contribution by the member towards the funding of the Legislators' Retirement Plan.

The state shall pay these picked -up employee con tributions from the same source of funds which is used to pay earnings to the employee. The employee shall have no option to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the system. Employee contributions picked u p after August 1, 1982, shall be treated for all purposes of KRS 6.500 to 6.535 in the same manner and to the same extent as employee contributions made prior to August 1, 1982.

However, any credit he then has in such other retirement system, earned for service in any capacity other than a legislator, shall not be affected. No person may attain credit in more than one (1) of the retirement plans or systems mentioned in this section, for the same period of service. (6) A member of the Legislators' Retirement Plan who would be entitled, under KRS 61.552, to repurchase credit in the Kentucky Employees Retirement System, for previous service as a legislator, which credit had been lost by refund of contributions, may pay the amount required by KRS 61.552 directly to the Legislators' Retirement Plan and thereby obtain credit in that plan for such service, rather than making payment to the Kentucky Employees Retirement System for credit which would be transferred to the Leg islators' Retirement Plan. In such event, the Kentucky Employees Retirement System shall transfer to the Legislators' Retirement Plan an amount equal to the employer's contributions that originally were made to the Kentucky Employees Retirement System for the regained service credit, with interest as provided in KRS 6.535. Six (6) months' current service shall be required in the Legislators' Retirement Plan in order for the repurchased credit to remain in force, the same as provided in KRS 61.552.

The service credit shall be awarded and the cost shall be determined in conformity with the rate which applies to the legislator in question under KRS 6.520. Service credit awarded under this subsection shall be equivalent, for all purposes of the Legislators' Retirement Pla n, to other service credit earned in the plan. 2. Any active member who began participating in [of] the Legislators' Retirement Plan prior to January 1, 2014, who has at least five (5) years of service credit in the Legislators' Retirement Plan may purchase and receive service credit for one (1) month of service for each six (6) months of service in the reserves or the National Guard by paying the retirement system one hundred percent (100%) of the actuarial cost of the service as determined by the board of trustees, based on the assumptions used in the most recent biennial evaluation.

Payment of the total or the increment may be made by lump -sum or by monthly installments through payroll deduction. If the member chooses to pay by installment, the cost of the service credit shall be computed in the same manner as for a lump -sum payment, which shall be the principal. Interest, at the annual actuarial rate in effect at the time each payment is made, shall be added to each monthly paym ent at the rate of one-twelfth (1/12) of the annual interest rate applied to the declining principal amount. Installment purchases shall be for no less than twelve (12) nor more than sixty (60) months. If the member leaves office before completing his inst allment payments, he may satisfy his contract by a lump -sum payment of the remaining principal amount, but no further installment payments shall be accepted thereafter.

The member shall be entitled to the transferred service credit, at the rate at which he qualifies under KRS 6.520, when he pays the total difference between the amount of the funds transferred and the cost of the credit to the Legislato rs' Retirement Plan, as determined by the actuary for the Legislators' Retirement Plan. The member may pay by transfer, if authorized under subsection (7)(d) of this section, by lump sum, or by increments, as provided for in this section.

CHAPTER 130 ( HCR 109 ) A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION urging the United States Congress to persuade the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw its proposed Greenhouse Gas New Source Performance Standard for Electric Generating Units. WHEREAS, the United States is the world's storehouse for coal, accounting for 27 percent of the world 's supply with 261 billion recoverable short tons, while only consuming one billion short tons of coal per year; and WHEREAS, coal is the leading fuel source for electricity generation in the United States, accounting for roughly 45 percent of all electric ity generation over the past two years, and providing more than 550,000 jobs in the United States; and WHEREAS, coal produced in the United States provides energy at the most affordable rates, with the United States' power sector over the last ten years pa ying on average three and one -half times less for coal than the next most affordable fossil fuel; and WHEREAS, EPA's proposed rule limits options for future electricity generation and will lead to higher electricity rates, because renewable generation sour ces are too expensive, too intermittent, and too small in scale to serve as base load electricity, additional nuclear capacity is not currently being built, and natural gas has a history of extreme price volatility; and WHEREAS, eliminating diversity in th e United States' electricity mix and unnecessarily relying on a single fuel for the vast majority of new electricity generation will deplete domestic natural gas resources more quickly and significantly increase electricity prices; and WHEREAS, EPA's propo sed Greenhouse Gas New Performance Standard also puts the United States at a tremendous disadvantage in the global marketplace, as China and India, which use coal for 80 percent and 68 percent of their electricity generation respectively, continue to embra ce coal and greatly increase new coal -fired generating capacity with 240 gigawatts and 70 gigawatts of coal -fired capacity to be constructed respectively in those countries over the next four years; and WHEREAS, worldwide coal use is projected to increase by 50 percent through 2035, yet while other countries continue to rely on coal to provide low -cost electricity, EPA seeks to ban new coal -fired power plants, shrink America's use of this valuable natural resource, and move to higher -cost electricity; and CHAPTER 130 799 WHEREAS, no other upcoming administrative or legislative action compares to the grave threat posed by EPA's proposed Greenhouse Gas New Performance Standard for both the future production and consumption of coal in the United States, because EPA's proposed standard constitutes a de facto ban on new coal -fired generating units, and this action may embolden the EPA to introduce an even more egregious rule imposing similar standards on existing coal -fired units; and WHEREAS, for all of its increased costs, EPA' s proposed rule would provide no meaningful benefit, as EPA does not claim that the proposal would result in any reduction, and certainly no measurable reduction, in the risk of global climate change; NOW, THEREFORE, Be it resolved by the House of Represen tatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Senate concurring therein: Section 1. The General Assembly of Kentucky urges the Congress of the United States of America to persuade EPA to withdraw its proposed Greenhouse Gas New So urce Performance Standard for Electric Generating Units. Additionally, members of Congress should work to persuade the President to direct EPA to set two separate standards for coal and natural gas rather than EPA's proposed combined standard. The new stan dard for coal should be based upon a new supercritical coal -fired power plant. Further, Congress should preemptively enact legislation allowing supercritical combustion technology to be compliant for new source performance standards, to prohibit EPA from e xtending new source performance standards to existing plants, and to amend new source review rules to allow generators to make technological improvements to existing coal plants. Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall send a copy of this Resolution and notification of its adoption to the President and Vice President of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Minority Leader of the United States Senate, and each member of Kentucky's delegation to the United States Congress.
