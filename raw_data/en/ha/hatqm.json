The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior and productive performance of piglets submitted to creeps enriched with different types of sensory stimuli. The study had a completely randomized design. The animals were submitted to seven treatments: T1) Enrichment with blue LED lighting; T2) Enrichment with fragrance of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) essential oil; T3) Enrichment with fragrance of lavender (Lavandula) essential oil; T4) Enrichment with fragrance of lemon (Citrus \u00d7 latifolia) essential oil; T5) Enrichment with classical music, \"The Four Seasons\" by Vivaldi; T6) Creeps heated without environmental enrichment (control group); T7) Enrichment with fragrance of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil.

The environmental conditions of the creeps - air temperature, relative humidity, luminous intensity, and decibels - were evaluated within the creeps with environmental enrichment to determine the influence on the piglets' behavior and productive performance. The results show that piglets submitted to creeps with environmental enrichment with blue artificial light and thyme essential oil showed reduced frequency outside the creeps when compared with treatment T6 (control). This showed the reduction of the stay of piglets in areas susceptible to crushing, in proximities to the mother. Piglets showed greater preference for creeps enriched with fragrance diffusion of thyme essential oil and with blue artificial lighting. 11 Keywords: Environmental enrichment, creeps, piglets, animal welfare, sensory stimuli. 12.

Heated creeps can 20 attract the piglets away from areas with danger of crushing close to the mother, reducing 21 the likelihood of crushing [2]. Since newborn piglets, by instinct, seek to lay along with 22 the mother to maintain thermoregulation, they are very prone to death by crushing due to 23 their small size when compared with the mother [3]. 24 The use of heated creeps meets the needs of protection and comfort. However, the 25 training for animals to identify this environment is still performed manually: piglets must 26 be placed inside the creep one by one, and must be locked up a few times a day, in the 27 first days of life. Newborn piglets need to be trained, in the first 24 hours of life, to access 28 the creeps several times [4]. In this process, it is important to determine whether the 29 piglets are able to make an active choice based on their individual preferences. Through 30 the training, the piglets learn to use the creeps from the 3rd day of age after birth [5,6]. 31 To prevent piglets from seeking thermal comfort with their mother, the use of 32 environmental enrichment of creeps through sensory stimuli (aromatization, lighting, and 33 music) can arouse curiosity and exploration of the thermal environment comfortable to 34 them. 35 Newborn piglets are attracted by thermal, olfactory, visual, and tactile stimuli 36 [7,8]. Fragrances can be one of these resources, showing favorable characteristics both .

Examples of fragrances that can be used and that 40 have these favorable characteristics include essential oils extracted from plants [11]. 41 Visual stimulation of piglets using artificial lighting can influence their investigative 42 behavior. [12] observed that young piglets prefer exploring illuminated environments, 43 rather than those without lighting. [13] demonstrated that piglets exposed to music in the 44 farrowing stage had decreased aggressive behavior after weaning. [14] observed higher 45 consumption and weaning weight of pigs submitted to musical sound. [11] emphasized 46 that the use of music has relaxing effect on humans and animals. 47 Thus, it is necessary to seek alternatives for environmental enrichment through 48 sensory stimuli that arouse the piglets' attraction to the heated creeps in conditions of 49 thermal comfort. 50 This study was developed with the objective of evaluating the behavior and productive 51 performance of piglets submitted to creeps enriched with different types of sensory 52 stimuli. 53Material and methods 54 The experiment was conducted in Holambra, SP, Brazil, at latitude 22\u00b037'59\"S and 55 longitude 47\u00b003'20\"W and altitude of 600 meters over sea level. The climate of the region 56 is humid subtropical (Cfa) according to the K\u00f6ppen classification. 57 The research followed the ethical standards and was approved by the Ethics Committee 58 on Animal Use (registration No. 4317-1) of the University of Campinas, SP..

The piglets were submitted to creeps (1 m long by 0.56 m 61 wide and 0.54 m high, polyethylene material, 5 mm thick) heated (heating established by 62 the farm management - 100 W lamp) with and without environmental enrichment, in the 63 period of 21 days (January 4 to 25, 2017). 64 Visual (blue lighting), olfactory (fragrance of essential oils), and auditory (music) sensory 65 stimuli were chosen based on results documented in the literature for the welfare of 66 humans and other animals, since there are few scientific studies on the effect of sensory 67 stimuli on pigs. 68 The swine identified the blue artificial lighting (visual stimuli) (440-490 nm) [15]; the 69 aromatization of the environment with infusion of volatile essential oils (olfactory 70 stimulation) of lavender (decreases anxiety), Tahiti lime (sedative effect in humans) [16], 71 Chamomile (soothing effect for dogs) [17], and thyme (antibacterial effect [18] and 72 muscle relaxing effect for mice [19]); and classical music (auditory stimuli) [20] that has 73 soothing effect [21], and to which swine respond at frequency of up to 85 dB [14]. 74 The sows (n=21) were distributed into 7 treatments in completely randomized design with 75 about 32 piglets in each treatment (mean of 10.6 piglets/repetition). The treatments were: 76 Treatment - T1: Enrichment with blue LED lighting; 77 Treatment - T2: Enrichment with fragrance of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) 78 essential oil; 79 Treatment - T3: Enrichment with fragrance of lavender (Lavandula) essential oil; 80 Treatment - T4: Enrichment with fragrance of lemon (Citrus \u00d7 latifolia); 81 Treatment - T5: Enrichment with classical music, \"The Four Seasons\" by Vivaldi;.

A time switch (RTST/20) was used for the automatic programming 87 of environmental enrichment (blue led lighting and electric diffuser) every 15 min 88 (on/off) in the creeps, from 8 am to 5:45 pm. 89 Environmental enrichment of the creeps with classical music, The Four Seasons, 90 composed by Antonio Vivaldi, was programmed by means of the Zara Radio software 91 with the aid of the computer. The time switch and the Zara Radio software were 92 programmed to trigger the environmental enrichment of the creeps in the same time 93 interval of the other treatments. Figure 1 (A, B, and C) shows the installation of 94 environmental enrichment within the creeps: 95 Fig 1 .Speaker (A), essential oil fragrance diffuser (B), LED lighting (C). 96 Data on air temperature (\u00b0C), relative humidity (%), luminous intensity (lx), and sound 97 pressure (dB) of creeps with environmental enrichment were evaluated to determine the 98 influence on piglet's behavior (%) and piglet's performance (kg).Temperature and 99 relative humidity (USB Datalogger, model TM-305U accuracy \u00b10.6\u00b0C and \u00b13% RH) 100 were registered within the creeps every 10 minutes. Luminous intensity (digital lux meter 101 LUX METER, Model Lx-101) and noise level in decibels (model ITDEC-3000, 102 accuracy\u00b12 dB) were measured on 3 random days at 9 am and 3 pm. 103 Piglets' behavior was evaluated based on exposure to the environmental enrichment of 104 the creeps. Piglets' behaviors were measured through direct observation [13], in the 105 morning at 8 am, 9 am, and 10 am and in the afternoon at 2 pm, 3 pm, and 4 pm, in the 106 period of 10 random days (total of 1,080 observations).

The lower behavioral frequency of 167 piglets lying scattered was 36.94% for group T5, indicating that the piglets remained more 168 active and less rested when submitted to stimulation of classical music.

However, the 191 increased frequency of piglet suckling did not result in better piglet performance (Fig. 3). 192 The total frequency of piglets (Fig. 3) outside the creeps differed (p<0.05) between 193 treatments T4 (Lemon essential oil diffusion) and T7 (Thyme essential oil diffusion). The 194 frequency of the piglets' behavior outside the creep did not differ (p>0.05) between 195 treatments T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6, showing that the environmental enrichments used 196 (diffusion with essential oil of Chamomile, Lavender, Lemon, and classical music) in the 197 creeps were not attractive for piglets compared with control treatment (T6). 198 Piglets submitted to treatments T1 and T7, enriched with artificial blue lighting (53.27%) 199 and Thyme essential oil (50.28%), showed lower frequency outside the creeps compared 200 with treatment T6 (control).

There are few scientific 226 studies concerning the amount of lighting indicated for pigs. [24] indicated 80 lux to 227 ensure animal welfare, while the European legislation [25] recommends a minimum of 228 40 lux. According to [26], providing additional lighting for swine influences on their 229 behavior, making them more active in their activities. [27,28] claim that animals react to 230 the contrast of light and tend to opt for a more illuminated area. [12] observed that young 231 piglets prefer illuminated environments over dark ones, as they appear to be afraid of the 232 latter. 233 The increase in the mean value of decibels in treatment T5 is due to the environmental 234 enrichment with classical music (Table 2). The noise level was below the recommended 235 for swine, 84 dB, and brought no risk to the welfare of piglets [29]. Piglets submitted to 236 environmental enrichment with musical sound at a frequency level between 80 and 85 dB 237 showed better performance compared with the environment without music [14]. 238 Experiments were conducted (groups submitted to different types of environmental 239 enrichment and control group) in creeps with the same thermal condition (heating 240 management established by the farm), close to the minimum air temperature of thermal 241 comfort (30\u00b0C) for piglets (Table 2). Piglets must be maintained in the air temperature 242 range between 30 and 34\u00b0C to avoid hypothermia [4] and obtain satisfactory weaning 243 gain. Relative humidity between the treatments remained in the range of thermal comfort 244 between 50 and 80%, adequate thermal conditions and relative humidity for swine [30]..

Piglets also lie scattered or on top of one another to 250 sleep and rest. 251 Piglets submitted to environmental enrichment with classical music showed lower 252 frequency in behavior (Fig. 2) of rest (lying scattered). However, we observed that the 253 noise level and the rhythm or sound frequency can cause scare reactions in piglets [14] or 254 stimulate playful behavior [13], making them more active. 255 The frequencies of behaviors of exploration and of lying on top of each other inside the 256 creeps were correlated between the treatments, because the air temperature remained 257 homogenous in both treatments (Fig. 2). Studies prove that piglets seek to lie down, 258 quickly, in groups when the air temperature decreases below the thermal comfort range 259 [32]. The piglets' exploratory behavior was consistent with that observed in the study of 260 [33], in which they spent about 10-15% of the time exploring the environment. This 261 shows that the animals in confinement show limited natural behavior, even with the use 262 of environmental enrichment. 263 Piglets showed preference for accessing creeps enriched with artificial blue lighting (T1 264 - 46.63%) and with the fragrance of Thyme essential oil (T7 - 49.72%), compared with 265 the other experimental groups (Fig. 2). Even with luminous intensity above 80 lx in all 266 treatments, the piglets showed greater preference for creeps with artificial blue lighting 267 (T1 - 803.15 lx) than in treatments T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6. These results suggest that 268 piglets can identify the blue lighting.

For [35], the swine identify and distinguish blue (440-490 271 nm) from the other colors but cannot perceive the colors red and green. [36] claim that 272 the wavelengths identified by swine species range from 439 to 556 nm, classified as the 273 color blue (440-490 nm). [37] tested colors in water troughs and found that swine were 274 attracted by red or blue objects and ignored the green object. 275 Piglets submitted to fragrance diffusion of Thyme essential oil were more attracted 276 (49.72%) in entering the creeps compared with the other essential oils used as 277 environmental enrichment and with the control treatment without environmental 278 enrichment. This result could be due to the composition and concentration of the chemical 279 constituents volatilized by diffusion of essential oil fragrances absorbed through the 280 respiratory tract of piglets. Chemical constituents released by diffusion of essential oils 281 can act on neurotransmitter activation, producing the feeling of calmness and welfare for 282 animals in creeps. 283 In swine rearing, there are few scientific studies on the use of essential oils regarding the 284 welfare effect of animals. A study with humans by [38] showed that inhalation of a small 285 dose of essential oil activates the olfactory system by the olfactory nerves and bulb, with 286 action on the Central Nervous System and activates brain regions responsible for social 287 and behavioral emotions, and production of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, 288 acetylcholine, norepinephrine, endorphins and others that make communication with all 289 systems of the body. 290 Environmental enrichment by diffusing fragrance of essential oil of Chamomile, 291 Lavender, and Lemon had no effect on the frequency of piglet's access to the creep (Fig. 292 2) compared with control treatment without environmental enrichment (T6).

Thus, smells related to food of wild swine were 298 presented as lure for hunting, including animal and vegetable oils, considered attractive 299 [39]. [40] observed that the use of straw bed with lavender smell during transport of pigs 300 decreased the malaise, without reducing stress, measured by salivary cortisol 301 concentrations. 302 On the other hand, studies show that the lack of attractiveness for piglets to stay within 303 the enriched creeps can be related with the loss of interest in the kind of environmental 304 enrichment, which limits its usefulness [41]. [33] concluded that to provide 305 environmental enrichment in alternating periods of the day to increase piglet's interest is 306 ineffective, but to stimulate them through rewards can increase their curiosity. 307 [42] claims that the swine are motivated to express and to perform behaviors that are 308 rewarding to them. [43] report that the valuation of the swine by environmental 309 enrichment will depend on several factors, including the properties of the material itself 310 to allow the investigation and manipulation and the degree of novelty. [3] observed that 311 the most attractive environmental enrichment to pigs are ingestible, flavored, and 312 chewable objects, since these animals are curious and show investigative behavior in 313 search of food. 314 The piglets' agonistic and exploratory behaviors outside the creeps referred to 315 investigating, rooting, smelling, and interacting between siblings, which had no effect as 316 to the different types of environmental enrichment in the creeps. 317 Piglets submitted to environmental enrichment showed higher frequency in suckling 318 behaviors and in total piglets outside the creeps in treatment T2, indicating that the use of .

The 320 piglets preferred to remain less frequently outside the creep, close to the mother, in the 321 creeps enriched with Thyme essential oil and artificial blue lighting. This result was 322 satisfactory to reduce the stay of piglets in areas with risk of crushing, close to the mother. 323 However, it is known that the stay of piglets close to their mothers leads to increase in 324 mortality caused by crushing. [44] concluded that piglets maintained in environments 325 without environmental enrichment showed higher frequency in the behavior of rooting 326 and chewing directed to components of the pen, manipulation of the udder of the mother 327 and of the siblings. In another study, [24] emphasize that piglets lie close to the mother 328 to establish a bond, seek warmth, stay in comfort, feed, and protect themselves. 329 In this experiment, piglets were weaned at 21 days of age and showed better final body 330 weight at weaning in treatment T4 (6.45 kg) in comparison between treatments T1 (4.07 331 kg), T3 (5.55 kg), T5 (5.27 kg), and T7 (5.64 kg). Piglets submitted to treatment T4 had 332 the best initial body weight (1.95 kg) and thus resulted in the greatest final weight gain at 333 weaning in treatment T4 (6.45 kg). The results for the final mean weight at weaning 334 corroborate the results found by [45], who evaluated the effect of piglets' weaning age 335 and found that piglets weaned at 21 days of age weighed about 6.10 kg. [46] evaluated 336 the body weight of piglets weaned at early age (weaning before 18 days) and moderate 337 age (weaning between 18 and 27 days) and emphasized that piglets weaned at early age 338 weighed 5.20 kg and at moderate age weighed 6.07 kg at weaning. The values found 339 (Table 3) for the daily weight gain of piglets in treatments T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, and T7 are 340 similar to those found by [47] in which piglets obtained mean daily weight gain of 0.221 341 kg in the period of lactation. 342 Mortality rate was higher (5.13%) in treatment T2 using Chamomile essential oil in creep 343 environmental enrichment, resulting from the increased frequency of suckling behavior .

According to [23], the cause of piglets' mortality by crushing by 346 the sow is 6.4%. Thus, inadequate management and discomfort in creep environment lead 347 piglets to lie down close to sows, which predisposes to crushing [48]. Another factor that 348 predisposes to crushing of piglets is low birth weight [49]. This study enabled analyzing 349 the positive effect for piglets submitted to treatment T1 (artificial blue lighting), which 350 showed lower birth weight and resulted in 0% of deaths. For piglets submitted to the other 351 environmental enrichments in creeps, mortality rate was similar (2.56 and 2.70%) 352 between the treatments (T4, T5, T6, and T7). 353 Conclusion 354 The effect of environmental enrichment in creeps using sensory stimuli to arouse the 355 curiosity of piglets was proven. The piglets showed greater preference for creeps enriched 356 with fragrance diffusion Thyme essential oil and with blue artificial lighting. Thus, 357 olfactory (Thyme essential oil diffusion) and visual (blue lighting) stimuli reduce the stay 358 of piglets in areas susceptible to crushing, in the proximities of the sow. 359 360 Acknowledgments: The authors are thankful to FAPESP, CAPES and FAEPEX- 361 UNICAMP for the financial support. 362 363 References 364 1.
