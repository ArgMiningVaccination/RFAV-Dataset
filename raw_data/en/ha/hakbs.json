A call to the local ambulance and a fast ride to the emergency room are not available to you. How would you know what potions to use and what would heal your wounds? This was the dilemma of the Native American People hundreds of years ago. How did they handle it? The medical traditions and customs have remained a mystery to us for hundreds of years. This paper will try to explore some of these customs and possibly uncover some of the mystery. Erika Lenis-Abril REL-337 5/10/2015 Native American Religion: Medicine and Spiritual Healing Native American traditional medicine and spiritual healing rituals go back for thousands of years, these traditions often focus on different variations of alternative medicine. This knowledge is passed on throughout generations, many of the tribes learn that by mixing natural plants such as herbs and roots they can make remedies with healing properties. It is believed that being healthy is when people reach a state of harmony not only spiritually, mentally but physically. To be able to overcome the forces that cause illness people must \"operate in the context of relationship to four constructs \u2014namely, spirituality (Creator, Mother Earth, Great Father); community (family, clan, tribe/nation); environment (daily life, nature, balance); and self (inner passions and peace, thoughts, and values)\" (Portman & Garret, 2006, p.453). In this research paper I am going to show evidence of the tremendous influence that Native American medicine and spiritual healing have over modern medicine in the course of healing About Herbs Herbs have been used throughout the ages not just for their culinary benefits. In the use of magick and healing certain herbs and plants are used for their spirits or characteristics. Iroquois Indians The Iroquois Indians consisted of six tribes which were under one confederation: The Mohawk Indians, the Seneca, the Oneida, the Cayuga, the Onondaga, and the Tuscarora. The Iroquois tribes were spread throughout much of what we now call New York. Many traditional Native medicines and healing practices were discouraged with the advent of Western medicine, but now there is a movement to return to traditional ways (Zubek, 1994, p. 1924). Modern Western medicine treats the symptoms to cure a diseased state when the body is out of homeostasis. Native American healing traditions do this as well with herbs and plants suited to the purpose. These Native healing traditions also include sacred rituals, chants, and purification rites to help bring the spirit and mind of the afflicted back into balance. In effect, treating the whole person, not only the disease. A blending of these two healing practices could bring about better prognoses for today's patients. The purpose of this paper is Professionals say there are many side effects of herbal medicine however there are some alleged purposes: It can be used to treat migraines, eczema, migraines and chronic fatigue. Understanding Native Americans and Western Medicine Essential Knowledge for Providing Culturally Competent Care to Native Americans Brittany Schelitzche Writing for Healthcare Hennepin Technical College Native Americans and Western Medicine: Essential Knowledge for Providing Culturally Competent Care to Native Americans Many Alaskan Natives and Native Indians, also known as American Indians, share the same or similar views on health and medicine. Their definition of \"traditional medicine\" incorporates medicine and religion, various chants and rituals, and being one with Earth (Broome, B., Broome, R., 2007). \"In the United States we are challenged to think about health care from our tradition as a cultural melting pot. Therefore, we must address the large range of individual health care needs from populations living the inner-city and suburbia to those in rural environments.\" (O 'Brien, Anslow, Begay, Pereira, & Sullivan, 2002). It is important for healthcare workers to understand the views of American Indians in order to integrate their traditional medicine as well as western medicine. Examining areas such as common health conditions, treatments, and attitudes towards health, natural and alternative health will lead to a better capability of providing culturally competent care. Shakespeare, self proclaimed poet and renowned playwright, lived in the age of the Renaissance. More specifically, the time at which the Tudor family ruled England, during these times, there were deep-rooted religious cleansings and ongoing witch hunts, that sought out anyone and everyone that did not follow suit. Shakespeare American Indians used horticulture techniques to protect preferred native plants that were used for food, medicine, and to cultivate desired characteristics in those modified for tools and other products. To achieve specific desired traits American Indians practiced soil and weed management. They also used a burning technique, where they burned small tress and brushes where they lived. This resulted in large open corridors which increased visibility, and made it easier to hunt, protect against enemies, and gather acorns and other plant products. The burning of an area stimulated the growth of certain plants such as berry bushes. This aided in production of valued Native Americans and Their Contributions to the Advancement of Health and Medicine Stories of Native Americans contributions to the advancement of health and medicine traces were discovered in a small town in Nali, Africa. The very first onset of the beggining of modern pharmacology is the substance called \"quinine\". This is the substance that came from a bark of a tree that grew in high elevations. The Indians has been using this substance to cure malaria, cramps, chills, hear-rythm disorders and many other ailments. Prior to the disovery of quinine, the old world suffers enormously because the lack of medical knowledge that the old world posess. Quinine would have probably been introduce somewhere in 1630, as it was mention in Native American culture although thought to be static for centuries until the arrival of Europeans it has been discovered to have been a much more diverse and changing culture. Their ancestors are thought to be those that migrated from Siberia around fifteen thousand years ago. Through the extinction of the largest mammals and effects from global warming bands diverted from larger game towards a more extensive spectrum of food sources. Over time after generations and generation the practice of Horticulture was beginning to evolve among Native Americans cultures. Around 1500 B.C. in the American southwest and midwest began cultivating maize and squash but for only small supplements. Around 300-1100 A.D. two complex cultures known as Hohkam The Aztecs made great advances in many areas. One of their accomplishments was herbal medicine. Aztec medicine was based on two areas which are spiritual healing and herbal healing. Many of the illnesses that affected the Aztecs were caused to religious reasons: an angry god, bad An increasing number of medical schools are now offering courses in alternative medicine for their students, and some hospitals already have alternative medicine departments. The availability of healers and doctors practicing holistic medicine has also increased in recent years, and more and more people are educating themselves in these new fields. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that between 65 and 80 percent of the world's population (about 3 billion people) rely on traditional medicine as their primary form of health care. II. Herbal medicine has been used for many, many years and is a great natural alternative to modern medicine. Good for Health Modern medicine and healthcare system have categorized herbal medicine as a natural remedy used when people can't afford to purchase conventional drugs. They are perceived inferior because they cost less but the health benefits are endless. However, there have been various situations and instances that prove that herbal medicine is good for health. "}
