We will implement the Seven Sacred Branches Program, this approach honors the strengths of both Indigenous and Western knowledge as essential for a culturally empowering substance abuse treatment outpatient program. We understand the potential of an integrated approach used by treatment centers among Ingenious populations (Mays, et al., 2009). Based on research, culturally-based interventions are effective at improving functioning in all areas of wellness for Indigenous people in treatment for substance use problems and addictions (Mays, et al., 2009). However, there is a need to develop reliable culturally based interventions or methods that are meaningful to Indigenous wellness and provide needed office-based treatment, Cognitive Behavioral therapy and psychosocial interventions. Our Culturally competent substance abuse treatment outpatient program will promote recovery and abstinence for Native American mental health. 1) Debwewin (Truth) Truth represents the turtle, he was here during the creation of the earth and carries the teachings of life on his back, and he lives slowly and meticulously because of his understanding of the importance of the journey and ultimately reaching his destination.

The program will have at least two licensed counselors available to be contacted during hours in which the HHEW is closed. |FG000246-01 Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 Seattle Indian Health Board's project, COVID-19 Behavioral Health Response, will focus on reaching American Indians and Alaska Natives, including those experiencing homelessness, in Seattle/King County, Washington State. Services will include culturally-attuned evidence-based practices embedded within our agency's Indigenous Knowledge-Informed Systems of Care, which combines skills, services, and cultures to holistically integrate primary care, behavioral health care, dental care, Traditional Indian Medicine, housing, nutrition, and other social services. Seventy percent of participants will have SUD, SMI, or co-occurring SMI/SUD. To remove barriers to safe, COVID-era care among members of our target population who are unhoused, our project will use social distancing therapy rooms and safe therapy rooms with our clinic location. Social distancing therapy rooms allows people to see providers face-to-face from a safer distance, and safe therapy rooms connect people to telehealth through a phone or tablet to reach a physician in a separate location within our clinic or from a confidential space in their home. We plan to develop other safe therapy rooms at our satellite clinics and with community partners who serve our clients, such as King County Work Release. We also plan to identify HIPAA-compliant technology to facilitate access to group therapy. People served through COVID-19 Behavioral Health Response will access culturally attuned MH and SUD counseling, a new Level 2 Intensive Outpatient Program, Medication Assisted Treatment, Traditional Indian Medicine, and Recovery Support Services. Case managers will help our clients access the services that will support them in their SUD recovery goals and to manage SMI. This project will ensure that urban AI/ANs in Seattle/King County may access the behavioral health services necessary to their wellbeing during this crucial time. It will also reach our catchment area's healthcare professionals, who have been on the frontlines of COVID-19 response since patient zero was identified in the greater Seattle are in January 2020. |FG000247-01 ||STANDING ROCK SIOUX TRIBE 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (SRST) through their Tribal health program proposes the \"Addressing Mental and Substance Use Disorders (Emergency COVID-19) project to provide treatment on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, North Dakota, for 1). Tribal members with Substance Use Disorders (SUDs), Serious Mental Illness (SMI), and co-occurring SMI and SUDs; 2). Health care practitioners with mental disorders requiring mental health care as a result of COVID-19; and 3). All other Tribal members with mental disorders. The goals of the \"Emergency COVID-19\" project include: strengthening the capacity of SRST tribal health and tribal systems to increase utilization of evidence-based programs for providing clinical services and supports to address SMI and/or SUD among Tribal Members, including health care providers impacted by COVID-19; improving patient tracking systems among providers both on and outside the reservation; improving client access to treatment through use of telehealth; identifying signs and severity of SUDs and/or SMIs, planning and providing culturally appropriate evidence-based and population appropriate treatment services; helping treatment clients become and stay engaged in the recovery process; and activating the Crisis Response Team to implement a mental health crisis intervention plan on the Reservation. To achieve these goals the project team will utilize the following strategies: increase staff capacity by hiring a Project Director, evaluator, a licensed professional mental health counselor, and 3 peer recovery specialists; develop a systematic network of communication channels for improved coordination of care by creating a well written and agreed upon plan between partner agencies; improve integrated data capturing capabilities of the electronic systems used on the reservation so that no patients are lost through either system; use tools like Zoom, Skype and Facetime to conduct telehealth; utilize culturally appropriate treatment for Tribal members with SMI/SUDs; implement curricula and training that help clients through recovery and provide community with knowledge on mental health risks, how to identify and respond; and revise the existing Tribal strategic plan for crisis responses to provide 24-hour mobile crisis services, emergency crisis intervention services including psychiatric/medical assessment and where indicated, medication administration, and crisis stabilization. The project is scheduled to serve the entire population of 8,612 Tribal community members, including healthcare professionals with SMI/SUDs treatment needs through the sixteen months of the project. |FG000248-01 ||IDAHO STATE DEPT OF HEALTH AND Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 Comparable to the rest of the nation, Idaho is combating the COVID-19 pandemic, with the number of contaminated Idahoans rising significantly daily. As these numbers increase and the economy simultaneously crashes, Idaho is realizing a subsequent upsurge in the need for crisis and on-going behavioral health supports and treatment. Additionally, hospital beds currently used to serve individuals with psychiatric needs are now needed for COVID-19 patients, creating a gap in services for Seriously Mentally Ill (SMI) population. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) intends to help mitigate this gap by providing an alternative for this population. DBH plans to implement a 3-pronged approach to bring needed resources to Idahoans during this time of crisis: Emergency Department Behavioral Health Diversion and Triage: Idaho will stand up a Diversion and Triage unit to provide emergency services to patients with psychiatric conditions, but do not have critical medical health needs. This includes the establishment and utilization of a COVID19 Behavioral Health Distress Line, emergency department diversion and triage, and utilization of crisis centers to provide subacute care for patients not requiring acute inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. Access to Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment: Idahoans uninsured due to the economic devastation resulting from COVID-19 will be provided access to SUD treatment. Target population includes individuals with SUD and those co-occurring individuals with either SMI or less than SMI symptoms and who fall between 138-200% of FPG. Services include residential and out-patient treatment, and recovery support services. Access Behavioral Health Services for Professionals: Professionals of all types currently on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, including medical professionals, as well as other behavioral health providers, are often in need of services themselves. Those needing assistance will be offered five (5) free sessions of evidence-based counseling or assistance in accessing services if already insured. |FG000249-01 ||OMAHA TRIBE OF - 2021/09/19 The \"Omaha Crisis Intervention Project\" is to serve as the tribal centerpiece to provide crisis intervention services, mental and substance use disorder treatment, and other related recovery supports for Native American population impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis comes on the heels of a rash of completed suicides and numerous attempted suicides as well as a homicide that has left the community shattered and little time to heal. A comprehensive planning and implementation approach will be developed to improve the Tribe's current community health system to respond to current condition of our community. This includes addressing emotional and mental stress created by COVID-19 and meeting the immediate need for accessing mental health and substance abuse services. |FG000250-01 ||ARIZONA HLTH Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The Arizona Emergency COVID-19 Project is to address the increased need for substance use, mental health, and crisis support services to Arizonans that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Arizona Emergency COVID-19 Project will meet the required activities of the grant by meeting the following proposed goals and objectives: Goal 1: Develop and implement a comprehensive plan of evidence-based mental and/or substance use disorder treatment services for individuals impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Goal 2: Improve access and connection to services for Arizonans that are at greater risk for developing substance use disorders, mental health disorders (including individuals diagnosed with a Serious Mental Illness (SMI)), and/or co-occurring disorders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Goal 3: Increase evidence-based practice (EBP) and population appropriate practices and service utilization for Arizonans that are experiencing substance use disorders, mental health disorders, and/or co-occurring disorders due to the COVID pandemic. The first phase of the project will be a planning phase to inventory resources available to Arizonans, which will include the appropriated funding for Emergency COVID-19 allocated to Arizona, to ensure service gaps, barriers, and potential overlap has been addressed before project implementation. Once planning has concluded, Arizona will be in a better place to address identified priorities with these funds, which may include, but is not limited to, the following items: increase infrastructure of current crisis services (e.g. crisis phone lines) in Arizona through additional services and/or both licensed and non-licensed staff substance use and mental health professionals to address the increased need for crisis services, identify Arizona service providers who are in need of telehealth or teleconference software to address the needs of the target populations, and appropriate, and deliver recovery support services, including rapid re-housing, to improve access to, and retention in services. Project outcomes will include, but is not limited to, the following: increased collaboration and partnerships across service providers, increased access and connection to services, increase identification of service providers experiencing greatest need related to COVID-19, increased utilization of evidence-based treatment services, increased number participants referred to recovery support services, increased access to crisis mental health services, and increased number of participants receiving services within telehealth context. Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The Montana Emergency COVID-19 project will strengthen the capacity of nine counties and four tribal behavioral health programs to provide mental health and substance use services, including crisis services, during COVID-19 pandemic to individuals with serious emotional disturbance (SED) for youth, serious mental illness (SMI) for adults, and substance use disorder (SUD) for youth and adults. Funding will also be utilized to support healthcare workers and others with less severe mental disorders who are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our state strategy involves contracting with nine counties who work through their existing partnership networks to fund licensed / state approved mental health and substance abuse treatment programs who will provide direct services identified most critical and needed in their community. The nine counties who will participate in this initiative are: Yellowstone, Missoula, Gallatin, Sanders, Ravalli, Silver Bow, Flathead, Lake, and Lewis and Clark. Collectively, these counties represent 62% of Montana's overall population and are home to an estimated 178,000 adults in the target population. As of April 8,2020, 78% of the COVID-19 cases in Montana were in one of these 9 counties. Our second strategy involves funding four tribally operated state approved substance abuse treatment facilities, located in four American Indian Reservations. White Sky Hope on the Rocky Boy Reservation, Spotted Bull on the Fort Peck Reservation, Fort Belknap Chemical Dependency Program on the Fort Belknap Reservation, and Crystal Creek on the Blackfeet Reservation. American Indians compromise the largest racial minority in Montana with 6.4% of residents identifying as American Indian / Alaska Native. American Indians in Montana are disproportionately impacted by behavioral health issues including substance misuse and abuse. The goal of this project is to increase Montana's capacity to provide behavioral health crisis services, including telehealth services, along with assessment, treatment and recovery support services to individuals impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Our measurable objectives include documenting behavioral health crisis service provision to at least 1,000 individuals in Montana supported by this funding over the course of the project period and document behavioral health assessment, treatment and recovery service provision supported by the funding to at least 400 individuals over the course of this project period. We anticipate at least 1000 individuals will be served in the first year of the project and 1,400 will be served over the course of the project period. |FG000252-01 ||WABANAKI HEALTH AND Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The five tribal communities in Maine, Band of Houlton and Penobscot Nation, are known as the Wabanaki, the People of the First Light- located in Maine's three most rural counties: Penobscot, Washington, and Aroostook Counties. Overall, the Native American (NA) population in Maine is estimated at just over 13,000 people. This grant will focus on COVID-19 response for those with mental health and substance use disorders. Our population of focus will be individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), those with substances use disorder (SUD), an those with co-occurring SMI and SUD. This is the population that Wabanaki Health and Wellness serves and has served for over 20 years. In addition, WHW works collaboratively with tribal behavioral health programs and will be supportive of their efforts to address COVID-19 related issues. WHW will provide crisis intervention services, mental and substance use disorder treatment, and other related recovery supports for children and adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. |FG000253-01 ||SOUTHCENTRAL - 2021/09/19 Southcentral Foundation (SCF), through its primary care center and behavioral health programs, respectively, the Anchorage Native Primary Care Center (ANPCC) and Fireweed Center, will work with other SCF health programs to reduce unmet mental health and substance use disorder treatment needs related to COVID-19 through the provision of screening, prevention, treatment and recovery activities by increasing access to culturally appropriate and evidence-based treatment over a sixteen month period. The ANPCC is a major health center located on the Alaska Native Health Campus located central to Anchorage charged with the health of the Alaska Natives and American Indians (AN/AI) in the Anchorage Indian Health Service Unit. Along with the Alaska Native Medical Center (co-owned and operated by SCF and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium) are the central points for testing and treating those impacted by COVID-19. For this project, ANPCC will refer all or most of those needing treatment for mental health and/or substance use disorders exacerbated by COVID-19 to the SCF Fireweed Clinic, also located on the Alaska Native Health Campus. Fireweed Clinic provides behavioral health services for Alaska Native and American Indian people including adults, children, and adolescents. This project will strengthen the integrated health system during this time of great need by pulling much needed behavioral health capacity into the process of addressing the impacts of COVID-19 within the Native community of Anchorage. The primary objectives are: 1) Review, assess, and document current service delivery to address gaps and use of telehealth; 2) Screen and assess 500 AN/AI Customer-Owners who visit the ANPCC needing mental health and/or substance use disorder treatment based on the SAMHSA required ratio of service recipients; 3) Provide mental health and substance use disorder treatment and related services to 500 AN/AI Customer-Owners who visit the ANPCC needing treatment; 4) Provide recovery services to 500 AN/AI Customer-Owners who receive mental health and substance use disorder treatment; and, 5) Analyze and enhance the development of the SCF Mental Health Crisis Services to address pandemics such as COVID-19 to include further exploration of elements of crisis management. The plan includes sharing lessons learned, experiences throughout the process, and successful events as a result of the project. |FG000254-01 ||SACRAMENTO NATIVE AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER, Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 Sacramento Native American Health Center is an Urban Indian Health Organization that provides mental health and physical wellness services to residents of Sacramento County, including American Indians/Alaska Natives. The Sacramento Region COVID-19 Emergency Response (ReCOVER) program will provide services related to substance use, serious mental illness, and mild-to-moderate mental health disorder to people impacted by COVID-19, including local health care providers. As a Patient Centered Health Home recognized by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, SNAHC is experienced in providing these services and well-suited to provide whole-person, patient-centered care to individuals experiencing substance use disorder (SUD) and/or mental health (MH) challenges as a result of COVID-19. Evidence-based practices will include the health home model as well as a range of additional approaches to be selected based on client needs. ReCOVER will employ team comprised of a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), two Associate Clinical Social Workers (ACSW), and two Certified Addiction and Drug Abuse Counselors (CADAC) to provide services to people affected by COVID-19. These services will include support groups as well as individual one-to-one services to people with substance use disorder, those experiencing mild to moderate mental health challenges, as well as to those with serious mental illness. ReCOVER will outreach to local hospitals to promote and engage healthcare workers to participate in a mental health support group specifically for those individuals on the front lines of the COVID-19 epidemic. ReCOVER will provide services to 150 people over the grant period and GPRA 60 who are engaged in direct SUD and/or MH services, in the following formats: 1) Individual SUD and/or MH visits (30 or 60 minutes) to 60 people; 2) Individual services for people with SMI to 5 people; and 3) SUD and/or MH Support Groups to 100 people. Groups will focus on the following subjects: Relapse Prevention Skills, Harm Reduction Approaches, Grief & Loss, Health Providers Mental Health Support Group. Resources will be directed towards support for individuals with SUD, SMI or a combination (70%), with a subset of services to individuals experience mental disorders less severe that SMI (20%) and services health care professionals (10%). Services will be evaluated based on the numbers of individuals we are able to serve and GPRA 2021/02/01 - 2022/05/31 ABSTRACT The 2019 coronavirus pandemic began with an apparent cross-species transmission of the virus from an exotic animal species to a human host. From there, the virus, #COVID19, exploded across the globe and has been reported in nearly every country. The coronavirus preferentially infects the upper respiratory tract (URT) of its victims and establishes disease in the lungs and respiratory tract. Human to human transmission is reportedly by aerosolized droplets containing virus, and by contact with contaminated surfaces and transmission to the URT through hand to face contact. Epidemiologists and researchers have pointed to social isolation and quarantining as the most effective means to stop transmission until a neutralizing vaccine is available in 12-18 months. Pueblo of Acoma Tribal Council issued a #StayAtHome order in early March 2020 to acknowledge the importance and functionality of social distancing. That action effectively closed all nonessential work in the Tribe. The state of New Mexico issued a statewide #StayAtHome shortly after. Nationally, as 9 April 2020, nearly 17 million people in the US are unemployed as a result of the service-based economy. Cibola County, the home county for Acoma, had am employment rate of 6.5% prior to #COVID19. Economists predict a national unemployment rate of at least 12-13%. Unemployment coupled with societal stresses from social isolation and economic and financial losses have increased the burden on the mental and behavioral health of the entire nation and Pueblo of Acoma is no exception. Recent reports have suggested a dramatic rise in domestic violence abuse at home and a significant increase in on the job alcohol consumption. Acoma is as concerned for alcohol misuse, substance and opioid use disorders, at-risk behaviors, mental health and behavioral health status as is Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The Tribe has instituted a virtual/telehealth program to continue to address the needs of the people of Acoma. The SAMHSA Emergency COVID19 program will be a welcome resource and asset base to the community of Acoma as we develop a comprehensive and refined Telebehavioral health program for the COVID19 pandemic and predicted following waves of infections. Evidenced-based practices (EBP) and culturally responsive best practices have been identified by the Health and Human Services Division (HHSD) of Acoma as well as Acoma Behavioral Health Services (ABHS). We have adapted several EBPs to virtual settings using Zoom for videoconferencing and doxy.me for one-on-one consultations between clinicians and clients. An HHSD system for client contact and intake has been established with formal data collection, collation and analysis procedures created. The Acoma Emergency COVID19 will address the required activities within a newly created telehealth program, supported in part by the Indian Health Service Telebehavioral Health Center for Excellence (TBHC) and local and regional partners including the Indian Health Acoma-Canoncito-Laguna Service Unit Hospital near Pueblo of Acoma. Treatment, supportive and recovery services are in place and will be applied to the Acoma Emergency COVID19 project. Based on current capacity, experience and relevant partnerships and Tribal Council support, Acoma Emergency COVID19 will be in position to implement the telehealth component to address the current COVID19 pandemic and any potential subsequent waves of infection with the four-month requirement. By the end of the 16-month project, Acoma will be positioned to run traditional and telehealth services in parallel to better serve the needs of the people of Acoma. |FG000256-01 Period: 2021/02/01 - 2022/05/31 The Wichita and Affiliated Tribes will launch a COVID-19 emergency program for American Indian (AI) behavioral health. The WAT-ECI program uses Telehealth to screen, assess and treat AI persons and families for Serious Mental Illness, Substance Abuse Disorder and co-occurring disorder and provide social supports and professional treatment through Telehealth enabling Natives receive virtual help in Caddo and Comanche counties in southwest Oklahoma. Our target population is approximately 20,000 individuals, and their families, who are AI alone or in part in Caddo and Comanche counties. Caddo county has no behavioral health practitioners or treatment centers. Comanche county has behavioral health services in Lawton, Oklahoma a mid-size city of 93,000, however, rural areas of the county are underserved. In addition to providing identification and assessment of behavioral health needs, the WAT-ECI will link and support Natives with additional services such as food, housing, hygiene supplies and other essential needs to assist in relieving stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral health care is not accessible to large portions of our society and AIs, in particular, face many economic, cultural, and historical barriers in accessing such services. We know that AIs tend to have lower income and much greater health and behavioral disparities than the general population. Telehealth offers a low cost easily accessible medium of engaging with them. It is essential, however, that therapists are Native or have extensive Native experience to reinforce the client patient relationship. The grant will work with a local media enterprise to manage social media pages about these opportunities and assess the response for evaluation purposes. There will be extensive data collection and all clients will be required to complete intake and discharge data collection documents, but they will be aided in that process by a grant facilitator. There will be small non-cash incentives offered for participation. The Goals of the WAT-ECI are to: Provide Telehealth Behavioral Health screening, assessment and treatment to 200 American Indian clients affected by COVID-19 in Southwestern Oklahoma. Establish a Tribally controlled, culturally appropriate Telehealth system that is accessible and cost effective. Identify, treat, and support American Indian individuals and families that have Serious Mental Illness, Substance Abuse Disorder or both. Document and disseminate our efforts for the benefit of the scientific community and American Indian people throughout the state of Oklahoma. We will serve a minimum of 200 American Indian clients during the 16-month span of the grant. - 2021/09/19 Kenaitze Indian Tribe (Kenaitze) is a federally recognized tribal government reorganized in 1971 under the statutes of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, as amended for Alaska in 1936. The project \"Kenaitze's COVID-19 Emergency Response\" is intended to address significant increases in the number of Tribal, Alaska Native/American Indian (AN/AI), and other community members suffering from depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, substance abuse, and/or PTSD stemming from COVID-19-related stressors. A Comprehensive Strategic Planning process will identify service gaps related to serious mental illness (SMI), and expanded Case Management will support distance-delivered treatment and support services to those with SMI, substance use disorder (SUD), and/or co-occurring SMI and SUD. Grant-funded activities will be concentrated at the Tribe's Dena'ina Wellness Center (DWC) health facility in Kenai, Alaska, serving a 15,000-mile geographical area in rural Alaska. The project goal and measurable objectives include the following: Project Goal: Expand capacity to provide Behavioral Health and support services. Objective 1: Hire two (2) 1.0 FTE Behavioral Health Case Managers by the end of three (3) months. Objective 2: Develop a Comprehensive Strategic Plan including information and service gaps related to treatment and support services linked to SMI within the Kenaitze service area by the end of four (4) months. Objective 3: Provide telephonic evidence-based Behavioral Health support services for at least 40 unique persons affected by SUD and/or SMI by the end of 16 months. Case Managers' activities will include 1) conducting intake screenings; 2) facilitating telephonic \"warm handoffs\" to Clinicians; 3) engaging in telephonic coaching; 4) connecting to resources and services; 5) administering transportation punch cards for necessary travel; and 6) conducting data collection. Case Managers will trained by the Project Director to utilize the \"Strengths-Based Case Management Model\"; and to conduct intake screenings telephonically using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT); Alaska Screening Tool (AST); and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Case Managers will facilitate warm handoffs to Behavioral Health Clinicians and/or Chemical Dependency Counselors using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for those with advanced treatment needs to be addressed telephonically or, where applicable, face-to-face. Any Tribal/AN/AI persons requesting medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) will be referred to Kenaitze's existing program, a partnership with DWC Primary Care. Using the CSAT GPRA \"Client Outcomes for Discretionary Measures\" interview tool, Case Managers will collect data at initial screening, at 3-month intervals, and at discharge to determine the project's efficacy. |FG000258-01 ||D. C. 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The District of Columbia's (DC) emergency grant to address mental health and substance use disorders during COVID-19 has two primary goals: 1) to promote community resilience during the COVID-19 public health emergency; and 2) to improve timely access to emergency mental health services for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) or a co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder (SUD). Services supported by this grant also will be made available to health care practitioners and individuals with less serious mental health conditions who are impacted by COVID-19. Based on estimates from the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 4.6% (26,620) of adults in DC, ages 18 or older, are living with an SMI and 3.7% (21,412) of adults are living with a co-occurring mental illness and SUD. COVID-19 has strained the resources of DC's behavioral health provider network, some of whom were already financially fragile and had limited telehealth capability for providing services. DC's Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) will implement a multi-pronged, evidence-based approach to treatment and recovery of impacted individuals. This will include expanded access to crisis intervention services, treatment, recovery support services, and greater adoption of tools for telehealth services. Specific strategies include: Implementing a mental health hotline/warm-line specific for individuals (including health practitioners) impacted by COVID-19; Providing grief and loss counseling to health care workers; Improving discharge planning at DC's 24-hour Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (known as CPEP) by enhancing connections to recovery support services (e.g. housing, employment) and care coordination and support provided by peer specialists; Engaging providers in telehealth training and technical assistance opportunities; Utilizing the faith-based community to educate the community on the availability of services to support residents impacted by COVID-19; and Creating a multidisciplinary team of providers to serve individuals with mental illness or SUD who are in isolation or quarantine and who require intensive services to maintain safety. Over the duration of this grant, the project expects to serve 20% of District residents with SMI, 10% of residents with a co-occurring disorder, and at least 500 health care practitioners providing care during the COVID-19 emergency. |FG000259-01 ||TURTLE MOUNTAIN 2021/02/01 - 2022/05/31 Project Title: Turtle Mountain Crisis Prevention Line Applicant - Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Belcourt, ND Through this project, the Fifth Generation program and the Turtle Mountain Outreach program will cooperatively develop and implement a 24-7 crisis line staffed by four Behavioral Health Technicians.

The project utilizes remote connectivity to ensure Tribal members and their families can access services and supports to cultural-based and evidence-based best practices, including therapy, telemedicine, and treatment. The project also provides added capacity to ensure fundamental supports such as recovery housing, childcare assistance, and transportation vouchers are available for Tribal members and their families as they work to recover from mental health, behavioral health, and/or co-occurring issues including those with diagnosed serious mental illness, substance abuse disorder, as well as healthcare workers and other Tribal members with less serious mental illness. The measurable objectives associated with this project include: Objective 1: Within 16 months of the project launch, provide direct service and supports to a minimum of 70 Tribal members with SMI, SUD, or co-occurring conditions. Objective 2: Within 16 months of the project launch, provide direct service and supports to a minimum of 10 healthcare workers with less severe mental illness. Objective 3: Within 16 months of the project launch, provide direct service and supports to a minimum of 20 other Tribal members and their families with less severe mental illness. |FG000262-01 ||GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ||$2,000,000 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 Title: Georgia Emergency COVID-19 Project The purpose of this program is to provide crisis intervention services, mental and substance use disorder treatment, and other related recovery supports for children and adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, the purpose of this program is to address the needs of individuals with serious mental illness, individuals with substance use disorders, and/or individuals with co-occurring serious mental illness and substance use disorders. Additionally, the program will also focus on meeting the needs of individuals with mental disorders that are less severe than serious mental illness, including those in the healthcare profession. The project will serve four subpopulations: 1) youth survivors of human trafficking, 2) deaf individuals with SUD, 3) homeless individuals, and 4) medical, behavioral, and public health care professionals. Strategies/Interventions: 1. Allocation of project funding, based on need, to DBHDD providers across the state for emergencies resulting from COVID-19 to help them continue to provide treatment (including expansion of telehealth capabilities) for people with SMI, SUD or co-occurring SMI and SUD that need behavioral health services. 2. Expansion of the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network and Georgia Council on Substance Abuse peer warm lines to address increased call volume and the need for text/chat capability due to COVID-19 3. Expansion of COVID-19 Emotional Support Line that was established on April 6, 2020 by DBHDD in partnership with Behavioral Health Link and Beacon Health Options to provide 24/7 free and confidential assistance to callers needing emotional support or resource information as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project funding will support line expansion to include an enhanced, dedicated line for service and supports for healthcare workers in need of behavioral health treatment and recovery services. 4. Technology and videoconferencing upgrades will be implemented at Hope House, one of the only residential addiction treatment options in the Southeast for deaf persons, so that individuals whose preference is to communicate in American sign language (ASL) can remotely connect to AA/NA recovery support groups at Hope House. AA/NA groups with remote ASL participation option will be provided on a weekly basis. 5. Using COVID-19 response grant funding, Wellspring Living's Receiving Hope Center, a ground breaking 20-bed, immediate triage receiving center for Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking (DMST) victims across the state of Georgia, will partner with Highland Rivers Health, to provide clinical and therapeutic support to meet the behavioral health needs of minors, ages 12-17, who are victims of human trafficking. Licensed Clinicians will deliver two to seven weekly individual session per participant, daily group sessions, and one monthly family session (when appropriate). 6. Project funds will be used to obtain housing resources for persons with SME and SUD who are homeless and that need to be quarantined or isolated. There is also a critical need for the availability of emergency housing to temporarily house individuals while they are in the process of being permanently housed via a Permanent Supportive Housing program. Additionally, DBHDD will pursue collaboration with the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network on the funding of quarantine/isolation emergency housing for individuals with SPMI/SUD. |FG000263-01 Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) will partner with the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, Inc. (APIA), both tribal health service providers, to provide crisis intervention services, mental and substance use disorder treatment and other related recovery supports for Alaska Native and American Indian children and adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will focus on implementing the five required activities outlined in the funding announcement while developing sustainable infrastructure to continue to offer behavioral health teletherapy statewide once the project period ends. |FG000264-01 ||INDIAN INC. 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 To address co-morbid mental illness and substance use disorders expected to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic within the 15,000-person service area of Indian Health Council, Inc. (IHC), a Tribal clinic serving a consortium of nine governing Federally recognized California Indian tribes, proposes to conduct an evidence-based program incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy and trauma-informed care via telemedicine as well as in-person by experienced therapists. Indian Health Council's proposed SAMHSA Emergency COVID-19 Project will serve three largely distinct population subgroups: (1) Adults and Transition-Aged Youth (ages 16-99) with mental health problems and substance use disorders (70% of the team's effort will be devoted to serving the first group). The second subgroup consists of healthcare providers from all IHC departments including Behavioral Health but also Medical and Dental (10% of team effort) who will be coping with traumatic experiences in serving clients who become incapacitated or die as a result of contracting the Covid-19 virus; a key partner in treating these providers is an existing Employee Assistance Program and treatment contractor, the Holman Group. The third subpopulation will receive treatment services for less severe mental health problems (20% of team effort). Following extensive outreach for treatment via local reservation radio stations and social media (e.g., Instagram and Facebook) as well as clinician calls to former clients, the Emergency Project Team will use evidence-based practices including cognitive behavioral therapy with telehealth and eventually in-person meetings. Trauma-informed care techniques will be bolstered through staff training and incorporation in treatment team checklists. The expansion of IHC's existing telehealth capabilities will offer long-term value to the geographically widely-dispersed reservations, because they will increase availability of mental health and substance use treatment for these rural residents. Evaluation of client treatment progress will rely upon the analysis of pre- and post- use of survey instruments (GPRA, PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, and ANSA in addition to ACES at the outset of treatment). |FG000265-01 ||UTAH STATE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES ||SALT ||$2,000,000 ||2020 Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The Utah Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (DSAMH) has developed the Utah Emergency COVID19 Program for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders to bridge gaps in mental health (MH) and substance use (SUD) treatment services which have been exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic. This program will focus on development and expansion of services across the crisis continuum. A significant majority of COVID19 cases have been located on the Wasatch Front (Salt Lake, Utah, Weber and Davis Counties), Summit County, a community directly east of Salt Lake County, and Washington County in the southern portion of the state. Therefore, any services that are not provided statewide will be targeted to these areas. The multi-pronged implementation plan will include increased and aggressive outreach, screening, referrals and service efforts, with an emphasis on services for those who are particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. This will involve individuals experiencing exposure or exacerbation of symptoms due to their living situation (individuals experiencing homelessness, SUD residential, mental health supportive housing, skilled nursing facilities, domestic violence victims), due to job-related stressors (unemployed), and those who already struggle with access to services (refugees, transition-aged youth, those who are being discharged from incarceration). In addition, special consideration will be given to children and families dealing with disruption in family structure due to COVID19. GOAL 1 - Increase access to the full continuum of crisis services for Utahns (SMI and SED) will focus on targeted development and enhancement of statewide crisis and warm lines, a mobile crisis outreach team, one to two no-refusal receiving centers, and adding the Bridge program to emergency rooms. Improved outreach, screening and referral for healthcare workers and individuals with an exacerbation of symptoms will be included. GOAL 2 - Improve Outreach and Screening Services will include the development of a comprehensive and interactive screening site, a referral list with emphasis on providers with telehealth capability and identification of providers with expertise working with specific populations, and proactive outreach to key stakeholders and partners who may be at increased risk of mental health and substance use disorders from the COVID19 pandemic. Goal 3 - Improve access to mental health and substance use treatment services for healthcare practitioners impacted by COVID19 includes community partnership for the Utah COVID Emotional Relief Line to ensure identification, streamlined referrals and ongoing service delivery to impacted healthcare professionals, and with the two largest employee assistance programs (EAPs) providers among health care practitioners to provide training on evidence-based brief interventions for this population. A minimum of 5,000 people will be served by this program. |FG000266-01 - 2021/09/19 The Pueblo of Pojoaque COVID-19 Emergency Mental Health and Substance Misuse Services Enhancement Project will complete three goals in crisis because of COVID-19: (1) expand direct services, including linkage to MH and SUD treatment, nutrition/food services, medication support; (2) implement a 24-hour Crisis Response Team to help de-escalate first responder contact with people struggling with MH or SUD issues; and (3) provide emergency/transitional housing for victims of domestic violence or others who become unsheltered as a result of COVID-19 related MH or SUD issues. |FG000267-01 ||HEALTH CARE 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA), Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery (DBHR), Emergency COVID-19 grant application is designed to increase treatment access, particularly to low-income and underinsured Washington State residents, and to swiftly provide services to healthcare workers who may have experienced trauma, anxiety, or exacerbated pre-existing mental health issues working on the front lines to support the initial COVID-19 pandemic efforts in the highest impacted county within Washington State. Similar services may also be provided in other hot zones as they develop; simultaneously provide increased Recovery Support Systems within the newest community health care recovery facilities located in King County that is focused on individuals that have been isolated due to residing in the highest COVID-19 impacted county in Washington State. Grant activities will include: The BH-ASO's Grants Program- Each of Washington State's 7 regional Behavioral Health Administrative Service Organizations (BH-ASO's) will receive funding to expand access to mental and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment for low-income and underinsured individuals that have lost access to, or were previously unable to receive treatment services. The Healthcare Worker Services Program- The Healthcare Worker Services Program will provide mental health (MH) and SUD outreach services to individuals working on the front lines in the COVID-19 pandemic efforts in the highest impacted county within Washington State. Similar services may also be provided in other hot zones as the develop. The Recovery Supports System Program- Recovery support services will be provided to individuals residing in the highest COVID-19 impacted county in Washington State who may need emotional support and who are temporarily housed in Isolation & Quarantine Facilities, at-home, or within the newest community health care recovery facilities located in King County. They will have access to telehealth or telephonic services delivered by a network of peers. The overall objective of this project is to provide increased access to MH and SUD treatment services for low-income and underinsured Washington State residents and healthcare workers that have supported the COVID-19 pandemic efforts in the highest impacted county who may have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder, trauma, and anxiety, and provide increased Recovery Support Systems within the newest community healthcare recovery facilities in King County for individuals experiencing SMI/MI that have been isolated due to residing in the highest COVID-19 zone. Washington is well positioned to swiftly implement these programs and disseminate grant funding to the identified entities within the required 4 months after receiving funding. These programs will be used to further Washington's effort to expand, integrate, and sustain culturally relevant and developmentally appropriate services and supports statewide. |FG000268-01 ||ILLINOIS STATE Period: 2020/04/20 - 2021/09/19 The Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS), Division of Mental Health (DMH) and Division of Substance Use Prevention and Recovery (SUPR) collaboratively submit this application in response to SAMHSA FOA FG-20-006, Emergency COVID-19. These divisions are respectively the Illinois single state authorities for mental health and substance use disorders. Among the serious and wide-ranging problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are the impacts that this emergency has had on the IDHS/DMH and IDHS/SUPR provider systems and the clients that they serve. As a result of stay-at-home and social distancing expectations, both systems are transitioning to a greater dependence on telehealth strategies to deliver services. This switch in the primary means of providing care to persons in need presents challenges to providers in each of these two IDHS service systems. The network of IDHS/DMH-certified community mental heath centers which provide a safety net of services to Illinoisans has converted the majority of their staff to the provision of telehealth-based service delivery, and children and families who are new to the need for mental health support may struggle with locating, accessing, and identifying what supports are needed. The likely impacts of the pandemic on the multiple levels of care that make up the IDHS/SUPR provider system are also discussed. One of the more general impacts of the stay-at-home and social distancing expectations is a likely decrease in new admissions to the SUD treatment system provided by IDHS/SUPR-licensed organizations. While the resources available through this grant are insufficient to alone adequately address the varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, services are proposed that will assist each IDHS provider system in addressing these impacts. Emergency COVID-19 funds will be used to support IDHS/DMH sub-recipient agreements with two IDHS regional community mental health centers to expand mental health assessment and treatment services for children, adolescents, and their family members. Youth and parents who meet SED/SMI diagnostic criteria will be offered grant-supported mental health services consistent with those available to Medicaid eligible individuals supported by evidence-based PracticeWise interventions. Individuals who do not meet SED/SMI diagnostic criteria will be provided access to a full array of mental health services including Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) services. In response to the likely decrease in new SUD treatment admissions, Emergency COVID-19 funds will also support sub-recipient agreements with three IDHS/SUPR-licensed organizations to provide evidence-based screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) services for patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) in multiple hospitals in Illinois. These SBIRT activities and services will be augmented by mental health screening and referral services. Illinois Emergency COVID-19 funds will also be used to support a sub-recipient agreement to develop and implement periodic virtual support sessions through which IDHS/DMH and IDHS/SUPR funded organization staff can share their feelings and concerns, and potentially receive support from their colleagues. A contract with a sub-recipient will support provision of the data collection and reporting expectations contained in this SAMHSA funding announcement. A total of $2,000,000 is requested for a 16-month grant period. - 2021/09/19 The \"Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Emergency COVID-19 SMI and SUD Response\" project will provide for expansion of interventions, supports, and programmatic structure for those suffering from SUD and SMI within the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe catchment area. The overall goal of this project is to provide for the necessary expansion and refinement of SUD and Mental Health response mechanisms at MLBO which have resulted and will result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives in pursuit of this goal include 1) By the end of 16 months, MLBO SUD and MH staff will have a system in place accommodating increased demand for assessment and enrollment without significant disruption or overload of mechanisms; 2) By the end of 16 months, MLBO SUD with MLBO HR will have prospected, hired, and trained a new LADC for delivery of SUD programming in response to increased demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; 2b) By the end of 8 months, the hired LADC will have a full caseload of successfully managed and reached clients; 3) By the end of 16 months, MLBO SUD and MH with the Care Coordinator and Project Director will have successfully expanded the Telehealth and Nontraditional care continuum sufficiently to respond to increased load resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic without significant disruption or overload of mechanisms; 4) By 16 months, MLBO SUD and MH with the Care Coordinator and Project Director will have successfully expanded the Crisis and Triage response continuum sufficiently to respond to increased load resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic without significant disruption or overload of mechanisms; 5) By the end of 16 months, MLBO SUD and MH with the Care Coordinator and Project Director will have successfully integrated expanded and refined services as outlined in Objectives 1-4 with existing data collection system in order to engage in ongoing quality improvement processes for programming sustainability; and 6) By end of 16 months, MLBO SUD and MH with the Care Coordinator and Project Director will have ensured through expansion and refinement of remote communication and care systems that individuals receiving treatment are properly led to needed support services during and after programming.
