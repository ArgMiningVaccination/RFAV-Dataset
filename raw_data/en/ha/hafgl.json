Nursing Home Administrator Workforce: At a Glance: The Workforce Background Current Employment t Licensees: 916 Rural Childhood: 41% Employed in in 94% Survey Response Rate Health Admin. All Licensees: -19% Source: Va. Healthcare Workforce Data Center 45Results in Brief The Virginia Department of Health Professions' Healthcare Workforce Data Center (HWDC) administered the 2018 Nursing Home Administrator (NHA) workforce survey in March 2018. 769 NHAs responded to this survey, which represents 84% of the 916 NHAs who are licensed in the state. In 2018, there were a total of 730 Nursing Home Administrators (NHA s) in Virginia's workforce, and the se professionals provided 811 \"full -time equivalency units\", which the HWDC defines a s working 2,000 hours per year (or 40 hours per week fo r 50 weeks with two weeks off). 56% of all NHAs are female, and the median age of the NHA workforce is 51. In a random encounter between two NHAs, there is a 24% chance that they would be of differen t races or ethnicities, a measure known as the diversity index. For Virginia's population as a whole, the diversity index is at 56%. 41% of all NHAs grew up in a rural area. In total, 18% of Virginia's NHA workforce is currently employed in non - metro area s of the state. 39% of all NHAs hold an Administrator -in-Training certificate as their highest professional degree , while another 26% hold a Master's degree in health administration . 30% of all NHAs hold education debt, including 49% of those who are unde r the age of 40. The median deb t burden of those with education debt is between $30,000 and $40,000. 87% of Virginia's NHAs are currently employed in the profession, and 89% have one full -time job. The median annual income for NHAs is between $110,000 and $120,000. 97% also receive at least one employer -sponsored benefit. 94 % of Virginia's NHA s are satisfied with their current employment situation, including 68% who are \"very satisfied\". 4% of NHAs have been involuntarily unemployed at some point in the past year, while 2% have been underemployed. 22% of NHAs work in Central Virginia, while another 19% work in Hampton Roads. 61% work in the for -prof it sector. In addition, 52% are employe d in skilled nursing facilities. The typical NHA spends nearly half of her time on administrative tasks and treats betwe en 100 and 124 patients at her primary work location. 31% of NHAs expect to retire in the next ten years, while one -half of the NHA work force expect to retire by 2038. Summary of Trends Over the past five years, the survey response rate among all licensed NHAs has increased from 75% to 84%. At the same time , the size of the NHA workforce has increased by 8% from 674 to 730. In addition, t he number of FTEs has increased by 7% from 760 to 811. Females make up a smaller proportion of Virginia's NHA workforce in 2018 (56% vs. 60%), and this decline is particularly pronounced among NHA s who are under the age of 40 (50% vs. 59%). Meanwhile, Virginia's NHA workforce has become more diverse since 2013 (24% vs. 18 %). Although there was little change in the childhood background among NHAs since 2013 , they are more likely to receive either their high school or professional degree in the state (79% vs . 75%). I n addition, Virginia's NHAs are somewhat more likely to earn an Administrator -in-Training certificate (39% vs. 36%) and somewhat less likely to earn a Baccalaureate degree in health administration (23% vs. 26%). There were not many significant ch anges with respect to the current employment situation o f Virginia's NHAs, but they are more likely to hold one full -time job in 2018 (89% vs. 86%). On the other hand, fewer NHAs have been at their primary work location for at least two years (52% vs. 57%) . The median annual income of NHAs increased for the first time in mor e than four years, and NHAs are also more likely to receive an employer -sponsored benefit (97% vs. 92%). Since 2013, NHAs have become somewhat more likely to work in the f or-profit sector (61% vs. 59%). With respe ct to time allocation, NHAs are considerably more likely to serve an administrative role (30% vs 23%) as well as being somewhat more likely to serve a patient care role (3% vs. 0%). In general, the future plans of Virginia's NHAs have not changed much over the past five years , but NHAs are now less likely to plan to pursue additional education over the next two years (12% vs. 15%). In addition, more NHAs expect to retire within the next two years (9% vs. 7%). However, they are also slightly less likely to intend to retire by the age of 65 (30% vs. 31%). 46Survey Response Rates A Closer Look : Response Rates Statistic Non Respondents Respondent Response Rate By Age Under 30 12 24 67% 30 to 34 10 48 83% 35 to 39 8 65 89% 40 to 44 15 87 85% 45 to 49 15 116 89% 50 to 54 17 109 87% 55 to 59 22 102 82% 60 and Over 48 218 82% Total 147 769 84% New Licenses Issued in Past Year 43 34 44% Metro Status Non -Metro 16 107 87% Metro 75 513 87% Not in Virginia 57 149 72% Licensees License Status # % Renewing Practitioners 746 81% New Licensees 77 8% Non -Renewals 93 10% All Licensees 916 100% Response Rates Completed Surveys 769 Response Rate, All L icensees 84% Response Rate, Renewals 98% At a Number: 916 New: Renewing Practitioners: 98% Definitions 1.

Assisted Living Facility Administrator Workforce: At a Glance: The Workforce Background Current Employment t 45% Employed Survey Response Rate Health Admin. All Licensees: -19% Source: Va. Healthcare Workforce Data Center 75Results in Brief The Virginia Department of Health Professions' Healthcare Workforce Data Center (HWDC) administered the 2018 Assisted Living Facility Administrator (ALFA) wor kforce survey in March 2018. 534 ALFAs responded to this survey, which represents 82% of the 653 ALF As who are licensed in the state. In 2018, there were a total of 620 ALFAs in Virginia's workforce, and these professionals provided 751 \"full -time equivalency units\", which the HWDC defines as working 2,000 hours per year (or 40 hours per week for 50 weeks with two weeks off). 81% of all ALFAs are female, and the median age of the ALFA workforce is 52. In a random encounter between two ALFAs, there is a 41% chanc e that they would be of different races or ethnicities, a measure known as the diversity index. This makes Virginia's ALFA workforce less diverse than the state's overall population with its diversity index of 56%. 45% of all ALFAs grew up in a rural area during their childhood , and 26 % of these professionals currently work in non-metro areas of the state. O verall, 17% of Virginia's ALFAs work in non -metro areas. 34% of all ALFAs hold a Baccalaureate degree as their highest overall degree. With respect to professional degrees specifically, 33% hold an Administrator -in-Training certificate as their highest degree. 28% of all ALFAs carry education debt, i ncluding 59% of those under the age of 40. For those ALFAs with education debt, the median debt burden is between $20,000 and $30,000. 90% of all ALFAs are currently employed in the profession, and 84% hold one full -time job. Meanwhile, 2% of ALFAs have b een involuntarily unemployment at some point in the past year, and another 2% have been underemployed. The median annual income for ALFAs is between $70,000 and $80,000. In addition, 87% of ALFAs receive at least one employer -sponsored benefit , including 8 5% who receive paid vacation time . 95% of ALFAs are satisfied with their current employment situation, including 70% who are \"very satisfied\". 46% of all ALFAs work in either Hampton Roads or Northern Virginia. 80% work in the for -profit sector, and 70% a re employed in assisted living facilities as their primary work location. The typical ALFA spends approximately half of her time on administrative tasks and treat s between 50 and 74 patients at her primary work location. 27% of Virginia's ALFA workforce ex pect to retire in the next ten years, and one -half of the workforce expect to retire by 2038. Summary of Trends Although the number of licensed ALFAs has hard ly increased since 2013 (653 vs. 642), the response rate among these licensees has increased si gnificantly (82% vs. 68%). Meanwhile, the size of the ALFA workforce has increased by just 1% (620 vs. 612), and the number of FTEs provided by this workforce has increased by 3% (751 vs. 728). While the percentage of females in the ALFA workforce has fa llen over the past five years (81% vs. 83%), the ALFA workforce has also seen an increase in its diversity index (41% vs 37%). Among AFLAs who are under the age of 40, the increase in the diversity index has been even more pronounced (50% vs. 41%). In addi tion, Virginia's ALFAs are less likely to have grown up in rural areas (45% vs. 49%), and thos e professionals are less likely to work in non -metro areas (26% vs. 33%). ALFAs are now more likely to hold an Administrator -in-Training certificate as their high est professional degree (33% vs. 24%). ALFAs are also more likely to hold a Baccalaureate degree as their highest overall degree (34% vs. 32%). Since 2013 , ALFAs have become less likely to be employed in the profession (90% vs. 93%). ALFAs are also less likely to work at their primary work location for at least two years (63% vs. 69%). Meanwhile, their median annual income has increased by $10,000 since 2014, and more ALFAs earn at least $100,000 per year (20 % vs. 13%). Regardless, ALFAs are less likely t o consider themselves \"very satisfied\" at their primary work location relative to 2013 (70% vs. 73%). ALFAs have become less likely to be employed at an assisted living facility since 2015 (70% vs. 78%). Instead, they are more likely to work at continuing care retirement facilities (5% vs. 4%) and hospices (2% vs. 1%). Meanwhile, ALFAs have become more likely to serve an administrate role since 2013 (28% vs. 23%). ALFAs are also less likely to be planning to pursue additional educational opportunities (15% vs. 18%) or increase patient care hours (5% vs. 8%). 76Survey Response Rates A Closer Look : Response Rates Statistic Non Respondents Respondent Response Rate By Age Under 30 7 10 59% 30 to 34 7 39 85% 35 to 39 6 46 89% 40 to 44 20 61 75% 45 to 49 15 82 85% 50 to 54 16 72 82% 55 to 59 17 88 84% 60 and Over 31 136 81% Total 119 534 82% New Licenses Issued in Past Year 35 27 44% Metro Status Non -Metro 17 104 86% Metro 87 393 82% Not in Virginia 15 37 71% Licensees License Status # % Renewing Practitioners 536 82% Licensees 653 100% Response Rates Completed Surveys 534 Response Rate, All L icensees 82% Response Rate, Renewals 94% At Renewing Practitioners: 94% Definitions 1.

The internship is a unique phase of education consisting of the supervised practice of long term care administration in the Nursing Home (NHA), Assisted Living (RCAL) and/or Home and Community Based Services (HCBCS) environment. In this manual, we will refer mostly to the AIT Program for the Nursing Home Administrator. However, the manual, forms and Self-Assessment Instrument can be applied to all service lines, with minor modifications. The purpose of the AIT Program is to spur and enhance the professional develop- ment of the AIT in the field of long term care (LTC) administration. It equips the AIT with the tools and knowledge for when they become an administrator. A significant portion of the program involves observing and participating in activities associated with administration or resident/patient care. Many college health care administration programs have incorporated an intern- ship/AIT program into their curric ula. All National Association of Long Term Care Administrator Boards (NAB) accredited schools have an AIT component built into their programs. There have been several research studies that hav e validated the importance of the AIT experience towards a successful LTC administrator career. The goal of this manual is to help to provide the AIT with a solid foundation in the exciting field of long term care. Another objective is to encourage state licensing boards to adopt this manual for their AIT programs. The more states that use the Model AIT Program, the more consistent our AIT training and our requirements become. 1075 Chapter 1 Guidelines for Designing an Administrator-in-Training ProgramThe AIT Program is designed by both the Preceptor and the AIT. It is developed specifically for the AIT based upon education, experience, knowledge, skills and abilities. The Preceptor and AIT are expected to exercise considerable initiative in planning and implementing the training program in order for the AIT to succeed. The AIT program must conform to the number of AIT hours required by your State Board. Please be advised that, in addition to the following guidelines for designing the program, there may be a requirement in your state to submit the proposed Administrator in Training Program to the appropriate state board for approval prior to the beginning of the AIT Program. State boards typically have standard forms to use. However, sample forms can be found in Appendix 10 for your review and use. Required Activity Areas: The AIT Program should be based on the five domains of practice, which are cov - ered in the various departments found in a long term care facility. The tool presents the departments as modules and rotations; it is through these departments/modules that the program should be designed, so that the individual AIT can meet an appro- priate and tailored amount of time in each of the domains as appropriate. These modules include: Administration Human Resources Nursing Business Office/Financial Management Diet Rehabilitation Medical Records Activities Social Services/Admissions Housekeeping/Laundry Environmental Management/ Maintenance The AIT must complete a rotation in each of these areas. The preceptor and the AIT may work together to determine the order in which these modules are undertaken, and the amount of time allocated to each. For example, if the AIT's background experience is in nursing, he/she would ideally spend less time in nursing, and more in other areas. However, each activity area, including those in which the AIT has prior exper ience, must be included in the training program. The AIT should, through a combination of observation and participation, become familiar with all aspects of each activity area, including its purpose, the services it provides, staffing, and any problem areas. They should try to gain an under- standing of the roles of the front line staff in that area, the role of its department manager , and the administrator's perspective on how to oversee that area. They should also understand how that area interacts with other areas in the provision of care and services. 1086Inventory of Knowledge: Self- Assessment Instrument The preceptor and AIT are encouraged to develop an inventory of the AIT's knowledge in each of these areas to determine where the AIT Program should be focused. To help with this process, we have included a Self-Assessment Instrument for the AIT to complete at the initiation of the AIT Program. Once this instrument is completed, the Preceptor will have a better indication of the AIT's strengths and weaknesses. Self-Assessment Forms are included in this manual. We also recommend that this Self-Assessment be completed again, either mid-way or at the end of the program, to indicate the progress of the AIT. Other Activities: Since state licensing regulations differ in terms of the number of AIT Program hours required, the AIT experience must be customized to individual needs based upon the state's particular licensing requirements. The tool we provide enables the preceptor to make such customization. The preceptor is strongly encouraged to either arrange for the AIT to visit or con- duct research to become familiar with state licensing agencies and professional associations, such as the state affiliates of the American Health Care Association (https://www.ahcancal.org/), Leading Age (http://www.leadingage.org/), and American College of Health Care Administrators (http://www.achca.org/), as well as the National Association of Long-Term Care Administrators Boards (http://www.nabweb.org/). The purpose of such visits is to provide the broadest possible experience for the AIT. Membership in and attending meetings of relevant industry associations and/or professional organizations should also be encouraged. Length of the Program: Since state licensing regulations differ in terms of the number of Administrator in Training Program hours required, the AIT experience must be customized to the AIT's needs based upon the state's particular licensing requirements and the tool provided will enable the preceptor to make such customization. NAB recommends a minimum of 1,000 hours for a Nursing Home Administrator's AIT Program. Some state boards require 2,000 hours for an NHA AIT, but there are also states that require less than 1,000 hours. Some state boards award credit based upon education and supervisory experience. NAB includes state-by-state board requirements on its website at http://www.nabweb.org/state-licensure- requirements for reference. Guidelines for Designing an Administrator-in-Training Program 1097Training Schedule: Typicall y, it is expected that the AIT will work a full-time (40 hours/week) schedule. The AIT can be completed on a part-time basis unless your state precludes this type of schedule. The AIT generally works a usual day shift of the facility where the training is taking place . However, it is strongly suggested that each program also include some coverage of night and weekend shifts to familiarize him/her with the unique aspects of facility administration during those times. The schedule should be individualized for each AIT. It is expected that the preceptor and AIT develop a schedule that maximizes exposure to new and previously unfamiliar aspects of the facility. Administrator in Trainin g Program Approval Once the preceptor and the AIT have developed a program outline, it may be required to be sent to the state board for approval, using the appropriate form that the board requires. In some states, the program may not begin without such approval. We have developed sample forms for the state boards to utilize, if they so choose. These forms were created by reviewing many of the state's current forms. The Administrator in Training Program Forms can be located in the Appendix 10: Forms and Flashcards section of the manual. Guidelines for Designing an Administrator-in-Training Program 1108 Chapter 2 NAB recommends the following Process for use by the Preceptor and the AIT Phase 1: Application and Interview Process This partnership can be advantageous to both parties. The Preceptor can provide valuable training to the AIT, and both the AIT and the facility will benefit as a result of the AIT completing quality improvement projects and other activities. It is ulti- mately the Preceptor's decision if the AIT is a good fit for the profession. Through this experience, it may be determined that the AIT may be better suited for other career options. The AIT must carefully select his/her Preceptor, and should be someone from whom the AIT feels they can learn. It is very important that you select someone you respect and who is willing to share information with you that will ensure a quality internship that will prepare you for a successful career in long term care administration. Therefore, prior to committing yourself to an internship, it is very important to spend time with a potential preceptor in their building to learn their management style; how they relate to staff, residents, and families; to what extent they are professionally i nvolved; and their longevity with the corporation. The AIT should also be familiar with other information about the preceptor's corporation. From visiting with the potential preceptor, you should be able to recognize the personality of the communi ty. The quality of the facility is based on the leadership of the communit y, which takes on the personality of its leader. If you are having difficulty finding a Preceptor, you might want to arrange an infor - mational interview with a corporation and share the AIT Sample Learning Activities which is included in Appendix #2 of this manual. It is a comprehensive list of projects that an AIT could perform and will hopefully help to demonstrate how valuable the AIT could be to their organization. In most cases, the AIT Program is initiated with an interview between the Preceptor and the AIT. Prior to the interview, the AIT should provide a resume to the Preceptor and a follow up call to meet with the Preceptor. The interview should center on the AIT's prior work experience, educational background and professional goals. It is very important for the AIT to make the very best impression on the Preceptor at this initial interview. The learning environment is most important to your success. You want to feel welcomed, accepted, and a part of the organization. Office space, access to a computer and telephone are contributing factors to a solid learning environment. A preceptor that provides a strong learning environment sends a positive message to the AIT and to a successful internship. Phase 2- Self-Assessment Instrument Once the Preceptor and the AIT commit to the AIT Program, the Preceptor should have the AIT complete the Self-Assessment Instrument. The Self-Assessment Instrument helps establish a foundation of what the AIT thinks he or she already knows. It is important for the AIT to be honest and open in this self- assessment; it is not a test but a guideline instrument to help the Preceptor develop a quality plan of action for the AIT. The self-assessment includes various tasks that the AIT scores numerically based on their own knowledge and skills in each of the five Domains of Practice. This provides the Preceptor the ability to tailor the AIT program in order to make the most of the experience based on the AIT's strengths and weaknesses. The Preceptor will see areas that may need more or less focus and can design the program accordingly.AIT Program Process 1119The Self-Assessment Instrument is where the Preceptor determines how much time the AIT should expect to spend in each of the various Domains. For example, if the AIT has a nursing background, we would expect less time devoted to Domain 10 (Customer Care) and perhaps more somewhere else such as Human Resources or Finance. On the other hand, if the AIT has an accounting background, they would likely need to spend more time in Customer Care and less in Finance. This tool assists the Preceptor and AIT in making these determinations. This tool can be found in Appendix 3: Self Assessment Instrument for AITs We also recommend the use of NAB's Practice Examinations during the beginning phase of the AIT and at the conclusion of the AIT program. T aking this examination in the beginning will provide a good assessment of the areas of strength and weakness, and also help inform the candidate of their areas of competency and where they need further development, even prior to completing the self-assessment. The information on the Practice Examinations can be found at http://www.nabweb. org/practice-exams . The results of the practice examination will include your overall score and will provide the percentage of passage within each domain. Phase 3 - AIT Program Design The next phase is designing the AIT Program using the Self-Assessment Instrument. The Preceptor should input the number of state mandated AIT hours in the Self- Assessment Instrument. Once the required hours are entered, it will self-populate a suggested number of hours in each sub-task and domain. The Preceptor and AIT should go through this tool together to determine modifi cations that would individu - alize this program for the AIT, as previously addressed. Creation of the AIT Professional Development Plan involves determining activities that are designed to meet the objectives of each subtask. There are sample activi- ties included in the Self-Assessment Instrument as well as the Manual, but they are not exhaustive but rather should be used as a sort of \"brainstorming\" platform by the Preceptor in designing the plan of study . The goal is to design an \"AIT Plan\" that works both for the Preceptor and advances the AIT's development. For the first-time Preceptor, a master template should be saved so it can set the foundation for future AITs. It will allow the Preceptor to fine-tune these activities and improve at teaching and demonstrating the objectives. Another advantage of using this tool is that it helps the Preceptor to communicate with the department heads (who also spend considerable time with the AIT ) exactly what the objectives are and how the team intends to get that message across. For that reason, it is also a good idea to include the department heads in the development of the plan and the design of the activities that will help teach the objectives. NAB recommends all AI Ts go throu gh CNA (Certified Nurse Aide) training if the AIT does not have a nursing background. These hours can count towards your AIT progra m. Incorporated in the appendices are several tools\u2014including a glossary and flashcards--to assist the AIT in a successful AIT Program completion and passage of the national examination. Additionally, NAB's Nursing Home Administrators Examination Bibliography References and the Assisted Living Administrators Examination Bibliography References can be found at http://www.nabweb.org/exam- references . AIT Program Process 11210Phase 4 - The AIT Experience Research has shown that Preceptors play a significant role in influencing the AIT's success.1 The learni ng environment is also very important to the success of the AIT . Making the AIT feel we lcomed, providing adequate office space including a computer, name badge an d an email address will help the AIT to feel a part of the organization. Phase 5- Program Completion Once you have completed your AIT program, submit the required forms to your state board. We have included sample NAB AIT Forms in case the state board wishes to utilize them.

Have the AIT take the Self-Assessment on page 57. For each sub-domain, there are tasks that an administrator performs. The AIT needs to rate themselves based on the sub-domain presented. To complete the rating response, select the box and click on the arrow in the lower right hand corner. This data feeds directly into the rest of the worksheet. It should be saved (when they start) with a new name that the preceptor will recognize as the AIT's self assessment. Step 2. Review the AIT's assessment and see how it translated into the Modules (departments). Please visit page 82 to weigh their assessment against the typical number of hours in each domain, the NAB percentages in each domain and their self-assessed weaknesses/ strengths. This will create worksheets for the Preceptor to design that will suit the AIT in the various modules. Those percentages are the weighted areas of the NAB Exam.Step 3. The Preceptor should consult with their depart- ment heads to design activities for the AIT to do in each of these areas. The Preceptor will need to either print and allow the AIT to handwrite their plan of study or collaborate to complete the plan electronically. By completing an electronic plan, it can be used with future AITs.This tool is an instrument to use to help the Preceptor design a plan of study for the AIT. It will require the AIT to complete the self-assessment first and will assist the Preceptor to determine the areas in which the AIT would like to concentrate on and compare this to the NAB suggested times. The Preceptor can adjust the times as they see fit in any area. 159Instructions: Rate yourself on the following items. Please be honest as this self-assessment will be kept confidential and used only by your Preceptor to design a plan of study. For additional instructions, please reference the previous page.This will help the Preceptor prepare an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses...and will translate into helping define your needs for the number of hours in each AIT Program Module.

Providers are advised to also check the General Services Administration (GSA) monthly \"List of Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement and Non-procurement Programs\" at http://epls.arnet.gov .30.0 - Finance Loan-to-Value Percentage The maximum loan amount based on a percentage of the borrowing facility's appraised value.30.0 - Finance Long-Term Asset An asset with future economic benefits that are expected for a number of years. Long-term assets are reported on the balance sheet as noncurrent assets and include buildings and equipment.

Alternatively, the ratio of occupied beds to available licensed beds. For example, if a facility has 100 beds and 80 are occupied for a day, the occupancy rate is 80/100 or 80%. This may be reported as the average of the daily occupancy rates for a period , such as 30 days or a year. A particular resident's bed may be considered an occupied bed in calculating this rate even though that resident is in the hospital or temporarily discharged for some other reason, if the facility is receiving a \"bed-hold\" or \"bed-reserve\" rate and/or is reserving the bed for that resident.30.0 - Finance Office of Inspector General (OIG)Office in the US Department of Health and Human Services charged with identifying and eliminating fraud, abuse and waste in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other DHHS programs. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, inspections, and investigations, and through issuance of Special Fraud Alerts. 30.0 - Finance Operating Margin Total profit (or loss) as a percent of total revenue. 30.0 - Finance Opportunity Cost The value of the benefits sacrificed when money or other asset is used one way rather than in an alternative way. It is the net benefits that might have been obtained had the money been spent on the next best use. For example, if $1,000 is spent for activity program supplies, the opportunity cost of NOT having the benefits of $1,000 worth of food or landscaping services, or of not earning the interest had the money simply been left in the bank.30.0 - Finance Payback Period A simple device for comparing investment proposals. It is the time in years for the net cash inflow from a capital investment to be equal to its cost, that is for the item to \"pay for itself.\" It is criticized for failure to consider the time value of money, expected net cash flows after the payback period, and some key benefits from use of an item. If the estimated net cash receipts are the same amount each year, the payback period is calculated by dividing the total investment by the expected annual savings or increase in net cash inflow. Depreciation does not affect cash flow, so it is ignored. EXAMPLE: A machine is purchased for $30,000 to replace a worker earning $20,000 per year. Payback period = Total Investment Annual savings or increased net cash flow = $30,000 $20,000 = 1.5 years30.0 - Finance 231Pledging of Accounts ReceivableUse of receivables as security or collateral for a loan. When this is done \"with recourse,\" the borrower remains responsible for collecting the receivables but promises to use the proceeds for repaying the debt. In contrast, factoring of receivables is the sale of receivables as a means of short-term financing. When this is done \"without recourse,\" the seller transfers not only the receivables but also the risk of default.30.0 - Finance Posting A step the accounting process when journal entries are transferred (posted) to accounts in the general ledger in order to summarize information such as cash on hand.30.0 - Finance Prepaid Expense Expenses paid in advance for several months, e.g., building rental payments, journal subscriptions, insurance premiums.

Payment is determined by a case mix classification system (RUGs).30.0 - Finance Prospective Rate-Setting Practice by Medicare and most state Medicaid programs of using predetermined rates to reimburse nursing facilities without adjusting payment to cover actual costs. The states use a wide variety of methodologies to develop these rates. If the provider can keep costs below the formula determined rate, a profit can be made. If the provider's costs exceed the rate, a loss is incurred.30.0 - Finance Purchase Order Document from a prospective purchaser requesting a seller to provide certain quantities of described goods or services at a given price, with payment to be made later.30.0 - Finance Reserve Funds set aside to meet some future obligation. 30.0 - Finance Restricted Funds Funds established to account for assets with uses limited by the requirements of donors or grantees.

Patient service revenues accounts may also be segregated by level of care (skilled, intermediate) or by payer status (self-pay, Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance). b. Other operating revenues are revenues earned incidental to the main purpose of rendering patient care, such as revenues from the employee cafeteria, beauty shop, and other concessions. c. Non-operating revenues may include separate line items for interest and other investment income, unrestricted gift income or gains (or losses) on sales of property.30.0 - Finance RUG Creep A form of upcoding under the Medicare Prospective Payment System for SNFs which occurs when the SNF falsely or fraudulently completes the MDS, and this results in incorrect assignment of a resident to a higher-paying RUG category.30.0 - Finance 232Safe Harbors Federal regulations that define practices that, if fully followed, will not be considered violations of the federal anti-kickback. There are regulations, for example, that describe conditions under which discounts may be received from equipment suppliers, and conditions under which payments may be made to operators of referral services.30.0 - Finance Self-Insurance An alternative to purchased insurance. An entity assumes its own expenses relative to a specific risk of loss by periodically setting aside an actuarially determined amount of money, which may be held by a trustee.30.0 - Finance Special Fraud Alerts Statements issued by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) to the general health care community addressing national trends of health care fraud and providing guidance relative to violations of the anti-kickback statute and other federal laws.30.0 - Finance Stark Act Common name for a set of laws, including the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, that prohibits the practice of \"self-referral\" by physicians, that is, referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to a provider of services paid for by government programs, when the physician has a direct or indirect ownership or investment interest in that provider. \"Safe harbors\" is the name given to permissible referral practices, as outlined in laws. Some states have a law limiting \"self-referral\" regardless of payer source.30.0 - Finance Statement of Cash Flows Financial statement that displays how the cash balance has changed during a fiscal period. Cash increases and decreases are reported in three categories of activities: operating, investing, and financing. This information can be useful in assessing the entity's ability to generate positive future net cash flows, meet its financial obligations, and pay dividends.30.0 - Finance Statement of Changes in Owners' Equity (or Fund Balance)A financial statement that reflects the beginning owner's equity, the profit or loss of the current period, and the ending owner's equity as of the balance sheet date. Not-for-profits use \"fund balance\" instead of \"owner's equity.\"30.0 - Finance Straight-line Method of DepreciationA depreciation method that allocates equal amounts of depreciation expense to each full period of the asset's life: Annual Depreciation Expense = (Historical cost) / (Years of estimated useful life)30.0 - Finance Subacute Care As defined by the American Health Care Association, this is: \"a comprehensive inpatient program designed for an individual who: (1) has had an acute event as a result of an illness, injury or exacerbation of a disease process, (2) has a determined course of treatment; and (3) does not require intensive diagnostic and/or invasive procedures.\" Sub-acute medical and rehabilitative care programs in nursing facilities may include specialty programs for : Post-operative recovery, extensive wound care, ventilator support, brain injury care, hospice care, and respiratory or pulmonary management.30.0 - Finance Supplies Items consumed in the normal course of business operations, e.g., bandages and soap. Projected supply expenses are included in the operating budget, not the capital budget.30.0 - Finance Swapping Practice of a supplier giving a nursing facility excessive discounts on Medicare Part A items and services in return for the ability to service and bill nursing facility residents with part B coverage.
