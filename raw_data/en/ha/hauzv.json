Naturopathic Medicine is a form of healthcare that prioritizes customized approaches and whole-person wellness with the belief that all patients, all humans have an innate, natural capacity to heal. Naturopathic Doctors provide care based on these foundational principles: The Healing Power of Nature First Do No Harm Find the Cause Treat the Whole Person Prevention Doctor as Teacher Wellness In addition to these foundational principles, naturopathic doctors are trained to use a \"therapeutic order\" that prioritizes minimally invasive treatment such as diet, lifestyle, and herbs over drugs and surgery. While more invasive treatment may be necessary or appropriate for some patients and/or certain disease processes, the naturopathic approach to care highlights our belief in the patient's innate capacity to heal. The naturopathic therapeutic order includes approaching care in the following way: Re-establish basis of health Identify cause and remove the obstacles to cure Stimulate healing processes Support weakened or damaged systems/organs Restore structural integrity Address pathology Palliative treatment What is a Naturopathic Doctor? Naturopathic Doctors complete intensive four-year, graduate-level naturopathic medical school programs and take rigorous professional board exams to become licensed as primary care providers in their respective states. A Naturopathic Doctor (ND) is educated in the same basic sciences as a Medical Doctor (MD) but studies natural and holistic approaches to treatment in addition to pharmaceutical management.
