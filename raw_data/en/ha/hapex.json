Background [1](#B1-medicina-57-01303), [2](#B2-medicina-57-01303)]. These public health crises are related, at least in part, to behavior and lifestyle [ [3](#B3-medicina-57-01303)]. There is increasing interest and growing evidence that the integration of conventional medicine with traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine (TCAM) may be useful for the prevention and treatment of communicable and chronic diseases related to behavior and lifestyle [ [4](#B4-medicina-57-01303), [5](#B5-medicina-57-01303), [6](#B6-medicina-57-01303)]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been developing standards and documentation for the state and practice of TCAM [ [7](#B7-medicina-57-01303)]. The aim of this special issue of Medicina on \"The Future of Medicine: Frontiers in Integrative Health and Medicine\" was to explore the scientific evidence for these approaches of integrative medicine, which hold promise for the future of healthcare and medicine. [8](#B8-medicina-57-01303), [9](#B9-medicina-57-01303), [10](#B10-medicina-57-01303)]. TCAM includes modalities such as Ayurveda, Yoga, traditional Chinese medicine, other traditional systems of medicine, meditation, herbal medicines, nutritional supplements, movement therapies, and other mind-body practices. The World Health Organization (WHO) now refers to this set as Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-01303)]. [12](#B12-medicina-57-01303)]. The World Health Organization and governments of several countries have established agencies to support research and practical utilization of TCIM [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-01303)]. [Figure 1](#medicina-57-01303-f001). According to the WHO, non-communicable or chronic diseases continue to rise globally [ [14](#B14-medicina-57-01303), [15](#B15-medicina-57-01303)]. These diseases are not adequately prevented or treated by modern medicine and are often accompanied by high rates of adverse side effects. With an ageing population using polypharmacy, adverse events are also increasing [ [16](#B16-medicina-57-01303)] The costs of modern healthcare are high [ [17](#B17-medicina-57-01303)], with chronic disease accounting for approximately 75% of the US aggregate health care spending according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [ [18](#B18-medicina-57-01303), [19](#B19-medicina-57-01303), [20](#B20-medicina-57-01303), [21](#B21-medicina-57-01303)]. The trends also show high utilization of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) amongst the public with most patients using CAM in conjunction with modern medical care and majority of them do not inform their primary care physicians about the use of CAM modalities [ [4](#B4-medicina-57-01303)]. There is inadequate education of physicians and other health professionals about CAM methods, and high interest amongst medical professionals in CAM education according to the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health [ [22](#B22-medicina-57-01303)]. New clinical practice guidelines from conventional medical organizations are starting to include considerations of CAM practices, e.g., in cardiovascular health [ [23](#B23-medicina-57-01303)], cancer [ [24](#B24-medicina-57-01303)], pain [ [25](#B25-medicina-57-01303)] and mental health [ [26](#B26-medicina-57-01303)]. [27](#B27-medicina-57-01303), [28](#B28-medicina-57-01303), [29](#B29-medicina-57-01303)]. However, with notable exceptions, much of this effort has been on quality, safety, and efficacy of TCIM products mainly due to the potential for exploitation in drug discovery and development [ [30](#B30-medicina-57-01303)]. 2. Current Contributions [31](#B31-medicina-57-01303)]. Compared to control group, 49 inflammation related genes were downregulated, while genes associated with antiviral and antibody components of the defense response were upregulated. Meditation might have an important role to play in the management of chronic diseases, including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and communicable diseases. As meditation practices have become more common place, Travis presents three strategies to organize and study brain patterns during meditation practice [ [32](#B32-medicina-57-01303)]. [33](#B33-medicina-57-01303)]. Vitamins such as A, B2, B3, B-12, C, D and E, and minerals such as Zinc may have a possible role in SARS-CoV-2 prevention by enhancing immunity. [34](#B34-medicina-57-01303)]. The notable phytochemical Artimesinin from Artemesia has shown not only to have potent antiviral actions but also utility against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Youyou Tu was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2015 for the discovery of antimalarial properties of Artemisinin [ [35](#B35-medicina-57-01303)], which holds promise for anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drug discovery from traditional plant sources. [36](#B36-medicina-57-01303)]. Wallace reviews and provides an update on the developments in Ayurgenomics, the field that integrates concepts in Ayurveda, such as Prakriti, with modern genetics research. He suggests that the Tridhosha theory of Ayurveda (the combination of three physiological modulators\u2014Vata, Pitta and Kapha) correlates with the expression of specific genes and physiological characteristics [ [37](#B37-medicina-57-01303)]. [38](#B38-medicina-57-01303)]. This has major implications in the field of integrative Ayurveda that combines the best practices of Ayurveda with modern medicine. [39](#B39-medicina-57-01303)]. Scientific evidence suggests that diet including fruits, vegetables, seeds, whole cereals, consumption of vitamins A, C, and E and the use of plants and natural extracts (phytotherapy) may help relieve symptoms of asthma. In particular, plants such as [40](#B40-medicina-57-01303)]. [41](#B41-medicina-57-01303)]. [42](#B42-medicina-57-01303)]. [43](#B43-medicina-57-01303)]. Whole person medicine includes dimensions of health that consider behavior and lifestyle, social and emotional dimensions, and an individual's mental and spiritual dimensions. The authors present the status of current evidence on holistic models for improved health outcomes, patient satisfaction, health care costs and clinical experience. [44](#B44-medicina-57-01303)] conducted a detailed comparison of the dietary intake of food groups in two cohort studies of diet and stroke that had disparate results. They applied the nutritional principles of Ayurveda to suggest how these apparently contradictory results may be explained. The authors propose that traditional systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda possess clinically relevant knowledge of the effects of food on physiology and health. 3. Post-COVID-19 Era: An Integrative Vision of Healthcare\u2014Public Health and Policy Recommendations [45](#B45-medicina-57-01303)]. Clinical management, research and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 have focused on either tackling the virus directly or immunize against it. Over the past century, society experienced a series of pandemics or epidemics, notably polio, smallpox, cholera, plague, dengue, AIDS, West Nile, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and now COVID-19 [ [1](#B1-medicina-57-01303), [46](#B46-medicina-57-01303)]. On the contrary, Ayurveda, amongst the oldest and most widely practiced traditional healthcare systems, recommends preventive measures for improving immunity through healthy lifestyle in addition to acute therapy when indicated. Ancient Ayurveda texts, notably Charaka Samhita discuss epidemic management and immunity enhancement to prevent disease, arrest its progression and to maintain health on the individual and public health scales [ [47](#B47-medicina-57-01303)]. The Ayurvedic texts explains the onset of pandemics when there is collective human stress the disrupts endogenous preventive capacities. The concept of building and maintaining balanced functioning of the mind and body to cope with internal and external stressors, including infectious microorganisms, is the fundamental strategy of Ayurveda [ [48](#B48-medicina-57-01303)]. Many of these preventive principles have garnered modern scientific evidence which then supports the proposal that they are physiologically applicable across cultures and geography [ [48](#B48-medicina-57-01303), [49](#B49-medicina-57-01303), [50](#B50-medicina-57-01303)]. [51](#B51-medicina-57-01303), [52](#B52-medicina-57-01303)]. Ayurveda describes this systems approach to health care in the concept of 'Swasthya' or wholeness. That is, optimal health and well-being are based on inner wholeness together with a balance of mind, body, social and physical environments [ [49](#B49-medicina-57-01303), [52](#B52-medicina-57-01303), [53](#B53-medicina-57-01303)]. This would require a revision of health care for the 21st century that shifts the paradigm from a standardized approach to personalized prevention and treatment, from a short-term to long-term sustainable intervention, from single molecular targets to an integrated system of networks and, from treatment with adverse effects to prevention and holistic health promotion. [54](#B54-medicina-57-01303)]. It calls out at us that the current preparedness to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDG) of the United Nations is a mirage and unachievable, unless deliberate drastic, and systemic changes are brought about in their approach by communities and nations, in its pursuit [ [55](#B55-medicina-57-01303)]. It is evident that unless all resources available to human societies are utilised in the most effective an appropriate manner, we might be found formulating an SDG 2050, in the year 2030 without much change of its expected outcomes. Integrative medicine therefore is not a possibility but and a necessity. Human societies, whether technologically and financially advanced or deprived, will have to find their own integrative models in public health to achieve their expectations in health outcomes by 2030. In Africa, for example, an integrative model might look at skilling traditional practitioners to identify diseases, create knowledge base of available medicinal interventions, support evidence generation, provide guidelines for specific clinical interventions which are safe and effective, and develop and establish clear referral models [ [56](#B56-medicina-57-01303), [57](#B57-medicina-57-01303), [58](#B58-medicina-57-01303), [59](#B59-medicina-57-01303)]. In India, the home of Ayurveda, the contemporary health care system might utilize the country's range of traditional modalities (AYUSH) in prevention and early management of diseases, and health management of categorised population groups such as the aged, women and children, healthy adults, palliative care etc [ [60](#B60-medicina-57-01303)]. In the United States, Germany, or Canada it might evolve to support specific public health initiatives in cancer care, pain management, palliative care etc. It could also extend to clinical conditions such as sleep medicine and support specific neurodegenerative conditions. Emerging areas such as wellness or mental health promotion, will progress faster, when TCIM knowledge gets integrated into research, practice, education, and policy. Whichever may be the course taken by contemporary society, integrative medicine is here to stay and nations who ignore its precious resources would do so at their own economic and health costs.
