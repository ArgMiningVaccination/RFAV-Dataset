A database was developed from 92 published reports which included a total of 1657 samples with high-qua lity matching sedime nt tox icity and chemistry data. The database was comprise d primarily of 10-to 14-day or 28-to 42-day toxicity tests with the HA10 or HA28 tests) and 10-to 14-da y toxicity tests w ith midg es tentans or C. riparius (desig nated as the CS10 Endpoints reported in these tests were pri marily survi val or growth. Because fi eld-col lected sediments typically contain comple x mixtures of contamina nts, the predictive ability of a sedime nt assessme nt is likely to increase when SQGs are used in combination to classify toxicity of sediments. For this reason, the evaluation of the predictive ability of probable effect concentrations (PECs) was conducted to determine the incidence of effects above and below various mean PEC quotients (mean quotients of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0). The PECs are SQGs that were established as concentrations of individual chemicals above which adverse effects in sediments are expected to frequently occur. A PEC quotient was calculated for each chem ical in each sample in the database by dividing the concent ration of a chem ical by the PEC for that chemical. A mean quotient was calculated for each sample by summing the individual quotient for each chemical and then dividing this sum by the number of PECs evaluated. When mean quotients were cal culated usi ng an approach of equal ly weighting up to 10 r eliable PECs (PECs for metals, total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated bipheny ls (PCB s), and sum DDE), there was an overall increase in the incidence of toxicity with an inc rease in the mean quotie nt in all three tests. For example in the HA10 test, the toxicity of samples was 20% at mean quotients of <0.1 and increased to 67% at mean quotients of >5.0. Similarly , for the CS10 test there was a 20% incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of <0.1 increasing to a 64% incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of >5.0. In contrast, the incidence of toxicity in the HA28 test was only 8% at mean quotients of <0.1 and increased to 91% at mean quotients of >1.0. In all three tests, there was a consistent increase in the toxicity at mean quotients of >0.5. However, the overall incidence of toxicity was greater in the HA28 test compa red to the short-te rm tests. The incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of <0.1 was somewhat higher in the HA10 and CS10 tests (20%) compared to the HA28 test (8%). This toxicity at low m ean quotients does not appear to be related to total organic carbon in sediment. There was insufficient information in the database to evaluate effects of grain size on toxicity. Unmeasured contamina nts in these field- collected sedime nts or contamina nts for which we do not have reliable PECs ( i.e., pesticides, herbicides) may have contribute d to this toxicity at low mean quotie nts. Alternatively, the data for HA10 and CS10 tests were obtained from numerous laboratories which may have contributed to variability in the data reporte d in these studie s. In contra st, a limite d numbe r of laboratories conducted most of the HA28 tests. The reason for the higher incidence of toxicity with increasing mean quotients in the HA28 test compa red to the short-te rm tests m ay be due to the duration of the exposure or the sensitivity of 2 growth in the longer HA28 t est. A 50% incidence of toxicity in the HA28 t est corresponds to a mean quotient of 0.63 when survival or growth were used to classify a sample as toxic. By comparison, a 50% incidence of toxicity is expected at a mean quotient of 3.2 when survival alone was used to classify a sample as toxic in the HA28 test. In the CS10 test, a 50% incidence of toxicity is expected at a mean quotient of 9.0 when survi val alone was used to classify a sample as toxic or at a mean quotient of 3.5 when survival or growth were used to classify a sample as toxic. In contrast, similar mean quotients resulted in a 50% incidence of toxicity in the HA10 test when survival alone (mean quotient of 4.5) or when survival or growth (mean quotient of 3.4) were used to classify a sample as toxic. Results of these analyses indicate that both the duration of the exposure and the endpoints measured can influence whether a sample is found to be toxic or not. The longer-term tests in which growth and survival are measured tended to be more sensitive than shorte r-term tests, with acute to chronic ratios on t he order of 6 indic ated for H. azteca. We were also interested in determining the predictive ability of PEC quotients for major classes of compounds. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of toxicity based on a mean quotient for metals, a quotie nt for total PAHs, or a quotie nt for total PCB s. Different patterns of toxicity associ ated with the various procedures for calculating quotients were observed. For example in the HA28 test, a relatively abrupt increase in toxicity was associ ated with elevated PCBs alone or with elevated PAHs alone, compared to the pattern of a gradual increase in toxicity observed with quotients calculated using a combination of metals, PAHs, a nd PCB s. These analy ses indicate that the different patterns in toxicity may be the result of unique chemical signals associated with individua l contamina nts. While mean quotie nts can be used to classify sample s as toxic or non-tox ic, individual quotients might be useful in helping to identify substances that may be causing or substantially contributing to the observed t oxicity. We chose to make comparisons across geographic areas using mean quotients calculated by equally weig hting the contribution of the three major classes of compounds (metals, or PAHs, or PCB s). This approach assumes that these three diverse groups of chemicals exert some form of joint toxic action. Use of this approa ch also maximize d the numbe r of samples that were used to make com parisons across geographic areas. General ly, there was an increase i n the incidence of toxicity with increasing mean PEC quotie nts within most of the regions, basins, and areas for all three toxicity tests. For the HA10 and HA28 tests, the incidence of toxicity for samples from each of the Great Lakes and within the areas of each Great Lake was relatively consistent with the overall pattern of toxicity in the entire database. Howe ver, the relationship be tween the incidence in toxicity and mean quotients in the CS10 test was more variable among geographic areas compared to either the HA10 or HA28 test. The r esults of these a nalyses indicate that the consensus-based PECs can be used to reliably predict toxicity of sediments on both a regional and national basis. This pa per presents results of the first analyses comple ted on t he entire freshwa ter sedime nt database. Some of the additional analyses planned for the database that are beyond the scope of this paper include: (1) comparing approaches for desig nating samples as toxic; (2) evaluating logistic-regression mode ls; (3) identifying a list of optima l analytes for broad scale applic ation and testing the relative efficacy of the mean versus the sum PEC quotients; (4) evaluating the influence of grain size and ammonia on the incidence of toxicity; and (5) developing a guidance manual for conducting an integrated assessment of sediment contamination. 3 Contents Abstract ....................................................................................................................... .................... 2 List of Figures .................................................................................................................. ............... 4 List of Tables ................................................................................................................... ............... ................... 28 Appendices ..................................................................................................................... ............... 33 List of Figures Figure 1.

Althoug h information in this report was developed in part by the USGS, USEPA, and NOAA, the report may not necessarily reflect the reviews of these organizations and no official endorsement should be inferred. Sedime nt quality guidelines (SQGs) can be used as one of several tools t o assess contamina ted sedime nts; howe ver, there is no intent expressed or implie d that these guidelines represent USGS, USEPA, or NOAA sediment quality criteria. Information in this report and the development of the database have been funded in part by the USEPA G reat Lakes National Program Office, USEPA Office of Research and Development, USEPA Office of Water, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and National Research Council of Canada. This report has been reviewed in accordance wi th US EPA and USGS policy. 5 Introduction Nume rical sedime nt quality guidelines (SQGs) have been developed by a variety of federal, state, and provincial agencies across North America using matching sediment chemistry and biolog ical effect s data. These S QGs have been routinely used to interpret historical data, identify potential problem chemicals or areas at a site, desig n monitoring programs, classify hot spots and rank sites, and make decisions for more detailed studies (Long and MacDonald 1998). Additional suggested uses for SQGs include i dentifying the need for source cont rols of probl em chem icals before release, es to sedime nt contamina tion, trig gering regulatory action, and establishing target remediation objectives (USEPA 1997). Numerical SQGs, when used with other tools such as sediment toxicity tests, bioaccum ulation, and benthic community survey s, can provide a powerful weight of evidence for assessing the hazards associated with contaminated sediments (Ingersoll et al. 1997). A critical component in the application of SQGs for assessing sediment quality is a demonstra tion of the ability of the guidelines to predict the absence or presence of toxicity in field-collected sediments (Ingersoll et al. 1996, Smith et al. 1996, Long et al. 1998a, Swartz 1999, Fairey et al. 2000, MacDonald et al. 2000a,b). This paper is the fourth in a series that is intended to address the ability of various SQGs to predict toxicity in contamina ted sedime nts. The first paper in the series focused on resolving the \"mixture paradox \" that is associated with the application of empirically -derived SQGs for individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this case, the paradox was addressed by developing consensus-based SQGs for total PAHs (Swartz 1999). A second paper developed and evaluated consensus-based SQGs for total polychlorina ted biphe nyls (PCB s) to address a simila r mixture paradox for that group of contaminants (MacDonald et al. 2000b). A third paper developed consensus-based SQGs for freshwater s ediments (MacDonald et al. 2000a). The published SQGs for 28 chemical substances were assembled and classified into two categ ories in accordance with their original narrative intent. These published SQGs were then used to devel op two consensus-based SQGs for each contaminant, including a threshol d effect concent ration (TEC ; below which adverse e ffects are not expected to occur) and a probabl e effect concentration (PEC; above which adverse effects are expected to frequently occur; Table 1; MacDonald et al. 2000a). A preliminary evaluation of the predictive ability of these consensus- based SQGs for freshwater sediment was conducted using a database of 347 samples obtained from 15 separate studies. The results of these three previous investig ations demonstrated that the consensus-based SQGs provide a unify ing synthesis of the existing guidelines, reflect causal rather than correlative effects, and account for the effects of contaminant mixtures in sediment (Swartz 1999, MacDonald et al. 2000a,b). The prima ry objective of this fourth paper is to furthe r evaluate the predictive ability of the consensus-based PECs developed by MacDonald et al. (2000a). The database used by MacDonald et al. (2000a) was expanded to include a total of 1657 samples from 92 published reports with high-qua lity matching sedime nt toxicity and chemistry data. The majority of the data from these reports were for 10-to 28-day toxicity tests with the amphipod Hyalella azteca or 10- to 14-da y toxicity tests the midg es Chironomus tentans or C. riparius . The endpoints measured in these toxicity tests prima rily included surviva l or growth of test organisms a t the end of the sedime nt exposure s. A second objective of this paper is to evaluate the predictive ability of these PECs on a regional basis within the larger database. We were interested in determining if there are diffe rences in the predictive ability of the PECs across the entire database compa red to various geographi c areas within the database, such as all of the sam ples from the Great Lakes or all of the samples from an area within a Great Lake, such as Indiana Harbor or Waukeg an Harbor located within Lake Michigan. Methods Developm ent of conse nsus- based sediment qualit y guide lines Individual SQGs for freshwater ecosy stems have previously been developed using a variety of approa ches (Table 1). Each of these approa ches has certain advantages and limita tions whic h influence their application in the sediment quality assessment process (Ingersoll et al. 1997). In an effort to focus on the agreem ent among these various published SQGs, consensus-based SQGs were developed by MacDonald et al. (2000a) f or 28 chemicals of concern in freshwater sediments (i.e., metals, PAHs, PCBs, and pesticides). For each contaminant of concern, two consensus-based SQGs were developed from published SQGs, including a threshold effect concent ration (TEC ) and a probabl e effect concent ration (PEC). The TEC s were cal culated by determining the geometric mean of the SQGs that were included in this category (MacDonal d et al. 2000a). Likewise, consensus-based PECs were calculated by determining the geometric mean of the PEC-ty pe values (Table 1). The geometric mean, rather than the arithme tic mean or median, was calculated because it provides an estimate of central tendency that is not unduly affected by extreme values and because the distributions of the SQGs were not known (MacDonald et al. 2000a). Consensus-based TECs or PECs were calculated only if three of more published SQGs were available for a chemical substance or group of substances. The evaluations of toxicity in the present study were based on the use of PECs because TEC s were devel oped to provide an estimate of conditions where toxicity would not be expected and PECs were developed to provide an estimate of conditions where toxicity would be expected. Evaluations of SQGs in the present study were based on dry -weight concent rations because previ ous studies have demonstra ted tha t norma lization of SQGs for PAHs or PCB s to total organic carbon (Barrick et al. 1988, Long et al. 1995, Ingersoll et al. 1996) or normaliz ation of metals to acid- volatile sulfides (Long et al. 1998b) did not improve the predictions of toxicity in field-collected sediments. The c onsensus-based PECs listed in Table 1 were c ritically evaluated by MacDonal d et al. (2000a) to determine if they would provide effective tools for assessing sediment quality conditions in freshwa ter ecosystems. The criteria for evaluating the reliability of the consensus- based PECs were adapted from Long et al. (1998a). Specifically , the individual TECs were conside red to provide a reliable basis for assessing the quality of freshwa ter sedime nts if >75% of the sedime nt sample s were correctly predicted to be not tox ic. Simila rly, the individua l PEC for each subst ance w as consi dered to be rel iable if >75% of the sediment samples were c orrect ly predicted to be toxic using the PEC. Therefore, the target levels of both false positive s (i.e., samples incorrect ly classified as toxic) and false negatives (i.e., samples incorrect ly classified as 7 not toxic) was 25% using the TEC and PEC. To assure that the results of this e valuation were not unduly influenced by the number of sediment samples, the various SQGs were considered to be reliable only if a minimum of 20 samples were included in the evaluation (i.e., 20 samples above at a PEC or 20 samples below a TEC; CCME 1995). The results of this evaluation described in MacDonald et al. (2000a) indicated that most of the TECs (i.e., 21 of 28) provide an accurate basis for predicting the absence of sediment toxicity. Similarly , most of the PECs (i.e., 16 of 28) provi de an accurat e basis for predi cting sediment toxicity (Tabl e 1). A reliable TEC or PEC was not available for mercury , an important contaminant of concern in sedime nts (Table 1). This la ck of reliability is most likely due to the speciation of mercury in the sediments, as well as the ability of methy l mercury to bioaccumulate in org anisms. Sediment quality guidelines developed using a tissue residue approa ch are needed to establish safe sediment concent rations for human health and piscivorus-wi ldlife recept ors (Ingersol l et al. 1997). For this report, only direct toxic effects on benthic invertebrates are considered in the evaluation of the predictability of the consensus-ba sed SQGs. Developm ent of the sediment toxicity dat abase To support the development of the sediment toxicity database, matching sediment chemistry and biolog ical effects data were compiled for various freshwater locations across North America (in addition to the data that were used in the analyses performed by MacDonald et al. 2000a). Candida te data sets we re identifie d by reviewing the publishe d lite rature and by contacting individuals active in the field of sediment quality assessment. More than 1500 documents were reviewed and evaluated to obtain the data required to evaluate SQGs in the present study . Because these data sets were generated for a wide variety of purposes, each study was critically - evaluated to assure the quality of the data used for evaluating the predictive ability of the SQGs (Long et al. 1998a, Ingersoll and MacDonald 1999). Data from individual studies were consi dered accept able for use in the present study if: The study was conducted in a freshwater location in North America; Appropriate procedures were used to collect, handle, and store sediments (e.g., ASTM 2000, USEPA 2000); Matching sediment chem istry and biological effect s data were report ed and concentrations of contaminants were measured in each sample or treatment group. Minimum data quality require ments w ere reporte d. For example , analytical detection limits were lower than freshwater probable effect levels (PEL ; Smith et al. 1996), accuracy and precision were within acceptable limits, and analy tes were not present at detectable levels in method blanks; Appropriate analy tical methods were used to generate chemistry data. For metals, concentrations of total metals needed to be reported. However, other measures of metal concentrations we re used (i.e ., simulta neously extracted me tals) if suffic ient informa tion was available to demonstrate that these measures are comparable to total metal concentrations (Ingersoll et al. 1996, 1998). For organic compounds, the concentrations needed to be m easured using gas chrom or comparable methods; and, 8 Toxicity tests needed to meet test acceptability criteria outlined in ASTM (2000) and USEPA ( 2000) and endpoints measured needed to be ecolog ically relevant (likely to influe nce the viability of the organism in the field) or needed to be indic ative of ecolog ically -relevant endpoints. Using these sel ection criteria, a total of 92 freshwat er data sets were incorporat ed into a database that included 1657 individual sediment samples. The toxicity tests in this database primarily include tests w ith the amphipod, Hyalella azteca ; the midg (Microtox ). We selected a subset of the samples from this database t hat report ed sediment chem istry for at least one of the substances for which reliable SQGs were listed in Table 1. We then selected a subset of these resultant sample s with matching toxicity data for the amphipod Hyalella azteca or the midg es Tests with H. azteca and Chironomus spp. were selected because t he samples that were t ested represent ed a broader geographic area c ompared to the other tests in the database. The selected studies provided 670 samples for H. azteca 10-to 14- day tests (desig spp. 10-to 14-day tests (CS10; 556 of the samples were for tests with C. tentans and 76 of the sample s were for tests with C. riparius ). We combine d the data for the two midg e species due to the limited a mount of data for C. riparius . Prelimina ry analyses of the database indicated simila r sensitivity for these two species of midg e. The selected studies represented a broad range in both sediment toxicity and contamination. A total of 28% of the samples were t oxic in the HA10 test, 35% of the samples were t oxic in the HA28 test, and 27% of the samples were toxic in the CS10 test (28% of the samples were toxic in the C. tentans tests and 21% of the samples were toxic in the C. riparius tests). Toxicity of sample s was determined as a significant reduct ion in survival or growth relative to a control or reference sedime nt (as designated in the original study or determine d using appropria te statistic al procedures). Sexual maturation and reproduction were periodically reported in the HA28 test; however, these two additional endpoints did not identify any additional samples as toxic relative to effects reported on survival or growth of amphipods. The total PCB concentration in each sediment sample in the database was calculated by summing dry-weig ht concentrations of individual congeners. If only aroclors concentrations were reported, total PCBs were calculated as the sum concentration of all individual aroclors. If both congeners and aroclors were report ed, the congeners were used to cal culate the concent ration total PCBs in a sample. If only total PCB s was reported for a sample, then this value was used. The total PAH concentration in each sediment sample was generally calculated by summing the dry-weig ht concentrations from as many of the following 13 Total PAHs were calculated using eight or less of these individual PAHs for <5% of the samples in the database. In calculating total PCB s or total PAHs, half the detection limit wa s used for compounds reported below the detection limit. Similarly , half of the detection limit was used f or concentrations of metals below the detection limit. For DDTs, the concentrations of p,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT were summed to calculate 9 the concentrations of sum DDD, sum DDE, and, sum DDT, respectively . Total DDT was calculated by summing the concentrations of sum DDD, sum DDE, and, sum DDT. If all individual PCBs, PAHs, DDD, DDE, or DDT were less that the detection limit, the detection limits we re summe d and reporte d as a less tha n value for the sum. Analysis of data The initial evaluation of predictive ability by MacDonald et al. (2000a) focused primarily on determining the ability of each SQG, when applied alone, to correctly classify samples as toxic or not toxic. Because field-col lected sediments typically contain complex mixtures of contamina nts, the predictive ability of these sedime nt qua lity assessme nt tools is likely to increase when the SQGs are used in combination to classify toxicity of sediments. For this reason, the evaluation of the predictive ability of the SQGs in the present study was conducted to determine the incidence of effects above and below various mean PEC quotients (mean quotients of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0; Ingersoll et al. 1998, Long et al. 1998a, Fairey et al. 2000). A PEC quotient was calculated for each chem ical in each sample in the database by dividing the concent ration of a chem ical by the PEC for that chemical. A mean quotient was then calculated for each sample by summing the individual quotient for each chemical and dividing this sum by the number of reliable PECs evaluated. MacDonald et al. (2000a) found that some PEC values were more reliable predictors of toxicity and that use of only these PECs re duced the variability in the prediction of sedime nt tox icity compa red to using all available PECs. The PEC for total PAHs, instead of the PECs for the individual PAHs, was used in the calculation to avoid double accounting of the PAH data (MacDonald et al. 2000a). This resulted in the use of up to 10 reliable PECs in calculating the mean quotient (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, total PAHs, total PCBs, and sum DDE; Table1 and designated \"Mean -all\" in Tabl e 2). This approach to the calculation of mean quotients weighs each of the chemicals and chemical classes equally (Ingersoll et al. 1998, Long et al. 1998a, MacDonald et al. 2000a). In the present study , a second approach was also used to calculate mean PEC quotients. We were interested in equally weighting the contribution of metals, PAHs, and PCB s in the evaluation of sediment chemistry and toxicity (assuming these three diverse groups of chemicals exert some form of joint toxic action). For this reason, we first calculated an averag e PEC quotient for up to seven metals in a sample. A mean quotient was then calculated for each sample by summing the averag e quotient for metals, the quotient for total PAHs, and the quotient for total PCB s, and then dividing this sum by three (n = 3 quotients/sample; desig nated \"Mean -MPP (and)\" in Table 2). Another approach for evaluating mean quotients was to calculate the mean of the averag e quotient for metals, the quotient for total PAHs, or the quotient for total PCB s (n = 1 to 3 quotie nts/sa mple ; designated \"Mean Hence, the \"Mean -MPP (or)\" approach uses any or all of the three cl asses of contaminants as available. For example, if a sample only had a measure of total PAHs and total PCB s, then the mean quotient would be calculated using just the quotients for these two classes of compounds. In contrast, the \"Mean - MPP (and)\" approach only uses samples with measures of metals, total PAHs, and total PCBs. Sum DDE was not included in these calculations of the mean quotient because there were a limite d numbe r of samples in the database with elevated concentrations of DDE and w e were 10 interested in equally weig hting the contributions of the major groups of contaminants in the database (metals, tota l PAHs, a nd tota l PCBs). Therefore, the diffe rences in this \"MPP approach\" from the approach used by MacDonald et al. (2000a) a re: (1) an averag e quotient for metals was used instead of the individual quotients for metals and (2) sum DDE was not used in the calculation. Results and Discussion Evaluation of approaches for calculation of mean PEC quotients The results of the evaluations of the incidence of sedime nt toxicity within ranges of mean PEC quotients in the entire database for each of the three tests (HA10, HA28, CS10) are summarized in Table 2. When mean quotients were calculated using the approach of weig hting equally up to 10 reliable PECs (designated \"Mean -all\" in Tabl e 2), there was an increase in the incidence of toxicity with an inc rease in the mean quotie nt in all three tests. For the HA10 test, the incidence of toxicity was 20% at mean quotients of <0.1 and increased to 67% at mean quotients of >5.0. Similarly , for the CS10 test there was a 20% incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of <0.1 increasing to a 64% incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of >5.0. In contrast, the incidence of toxicity in the HA28 test was only 8% at mean quotients of <0.1 and increased to 91% at mean quotients of >1.0 (the incidence of toxicity at a quotient >5.0 was not calculated for the HA28 test due to a limited number of samples above a quotient of 5.0; Table 2). Long et al. (1998a) conducted a similar analysis of the incidence of toxicity in sediment tests using a database developed for 10-day marine amphipod tests (n=1068). The incidence of toxicity was only 12% at mean quotients of <0.1 (quotients calculated using either marine effect range median (ERM) or probable effect level (PEL) guidelines; Long et al. 1998a). In the present study , the incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of <0.1 was somewhat higher in the HA10 and CS10 tests (20%) compared to the tests with marine amphipods (12%; Long et al. 1998a) or the HA28 test (8%; Table 2). The reason for this higher incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of <0.1 in the HA10 and CS10 tests is not clear. This toxicity at low m ean quotients does not appear to be related to total organic carbon in sediment. There was insufficient information in the database to evaluate effects of grain size on toxicity. USEPA (2000) and ASTM (2000) reported that amphipods and midges are relatively intolerant to effects of sediment grain size. Unm easured contaminants in these field-collected sedime nts or contamina nts for which we do not have reliable PECs ( i.e., pesticides, herbicides) may have contribute d to this toxicity at low mean quotie nts (see discussion of Figures 1 and 2 below). Alternatively , the data for HA10 and CS10 tests were obtained from nume rous la boratories which ma y have contribute d to variability in the data reported in these studies. In contrast, a limited number of laboratories conducted most of the toxicity tests for the marine amphipod or HA28 tests. In all three tests, there was a consistent increase in the toxicity at mean quotients of >0.5 (designated \"Mean -all\" in Ta ble 2). Howe ver, the overall incidence of toxicity was greater in the HA28 test (91% toxicity at mean quotients of >1.0) compared to the short-term tests (57% 11 toxicity at mean quotie nts of >1.0 and 67% toxicity at mean quotie nts of >5.0 in the HA10 test and 51% toxicity at mean quotients of >1.0 and 64% toxicity at mean quotients of >5.0 in the CS10 test). Similarly , Long et al. (1998a) reported a 56 to 71% incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of >1.0 in the 10-day sediment tests with marine amphipods. The reason for the higher incidence of toxicity in the HA28 test compa red to the short-te rm tests m ay be due to the duration of the exposure or the sensitivity of growth in the longer HA28 test (see discussion of Figures 1 and 2 be low). Howe ver, compa risons of the sensitivity between the se tests needs to be made with some caution. There were very few sample s in the database where tests we re conducted using splits of the same samples. Therefore, the differences observed in the responses of organisms may also be due to differences in the types of sediments evaluated in the individual databases for each test. We were also interested in determining the predictive ability of PEC quotients for major classes of compounds. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of toxicity based on an averag e quotient for metals, a quotient for total PAHs, or a quotient for total PCB s (second, third, and fourth rows for each toxicity test listed in Table 2). For the HA10 test, the incidence of toxicity across quotients of <0.1 to >1.0, based on m etals alone, total PAHs alone, or total PCB s alone were similar to the incidence of toxicity that was calculated for the mean quotient using up to10 PECs (designated \"Mean -all\" in Table 2). The incidence of toxicity in the HA10 test was some what higher at quotients >5.0 for total PAHs (80%) or total PCB s (73%) compared to metals alone (62%). For the CS10 test, t he incidence of toxicity was also similar across quotients of <0.1 to >5.0, calculated based on metals alone com pared to a mean quotient calculated usi ng up to 10 PECs (designated \"Mean -all\" in Table 2). Howe ver, the incidence of toxicity at a total PCB quotie nt <0.1 was 46%, suggesting that other compounds may be contributing to toxicity at low concentrations of PCB s. The incidence of toxicity in the CS10 test was somewhat higher for quotie nts based sole ly on total PAHs compa red to quotie nts based on metals alone, total PCB s alone, or mean quotients calculated usi ng up to 10 PECs. These analyses suggest that the CS10 test ma y be more sensitive to PAHs compa red to the other chemical classes. For the HA28 test, the incidence of toxicity was similar across the quotients of <0.1 to >1.0, calculated based on metals alone com pared to a mean quotient calculated usi ng up to 10 PECs (designated \"Mean -all\" in Table 2). Howe ver, the incidence of toxicity at quotie nt of 0.1 to <0.5 was higher for PAHs (61%) compared to the other three quotients (6 to 20% toxicity for metals alone, total PCB s alone, or mean quotients based on up to 10 PECs). The incidence of toxicity at PCB quotie nts of <1.0 was lower (4 to 17%), while the incidence of toxicity at a PCB quotient of >1.0 was higher (97%) compared to the other three quotients. Results of these analyses indicate a relatively abrupt increase in toxicity associ ated with elevated PCBs alone or elevated PAHs alone compared to the pattern of a gradual increase toxicity observed with quotients calculated usi ng the up to 10 P ECs (designated \"Mean -all\" in Tabl e 2). These results suggest that H. azteca may be more sensitive to PAHs a nd PCBs in longer-term tests tha n it is to metals. In the next analysis, we were interested evaluating the incidence in toxicity by equally weighting 12 the combined influence of metals, PAHs, and PCB s in a sample. A mean PEC quotient was calculated for each sample by summing the averag e quotient for metals, the quotient for total PAHs, and the quotient for total PCB s, and then dividing this sum by three (desig nated as \"Mean -MPP (and)\" in Table 2). This calculation was done for only those samples with reported concentrations of metals, total PAHs, and total PCBs (266 of 670 samples in the HA10 test, 109 of 160 samples in the HA28 t est, and 177 of 632 samples in the CS10 test). Results of this analysis indic ate a higher incidence of toxicity in the mean quotients >1.0 based on an equal weighting of metals, total PAHs, and total PCB s compared to a mean quotient calculated using up to 10 PECs (57, 91, and 51%, respect ively; designated \"Mean- all\" in Tabl e 2). The di fferent patterns of toxicity associ ated with these vari ous procedures for calculating quotients may be the result of unique chemical signals associated with individual contaminants in each sample. For example, there was a higher incidence in toxicity with quotients calculated using total PCB s alone compa red to quotie nts calculated using metals alone in the HA10 test. Alternatively , these different patterns may also be influenced by the total number of samples used to make these comparisons. For example, there were 670 total samples for the HA10 test. Of these 670 samples, 623 had metal chem istry data, 488 had measured concent rations of total PAHs, 326 had measured concentrations of total PCBs, and all three of these classes of compounds were measured in only 266 samples. In order to determine the influence of sample number on the observed incidence of toxicity, we first selected the same samples used in the analy sis described in the previous parag raph (samples in which metals, total PAHs, and total PCBs were al l measured). Quot ients were then calculated for these s ubset s of samples: (1) using up to 10 PECs (desig nated \"Mean -all (select1)\"), (2) using up ECs (not including DDE; designated \"Mean -all (select2)\", or (3) alone PCBs alone (\"total PCBs (select2)\"; Table 2). Results of these analyses indicate that the incidence of toxicity for all thre e tests was simila r in these s ubset s of samples using the three procedures to cal mean HA10 test, the incidence of toxicity in the subset of samples (n=266) was similar based on an averag e quotient for metals alone, a quotient for total PAHs alone, or a quotient for total PCB s alone compared to the \"Mean -all (select2)\". In cont rast, there were di fferent patterns of toxicity associ ated with individual classes of compounds in the subsets of samples in the HA28 ( n=109) or CS10 (n=177) tests where metals, PAHs, a nd PCB s were all reporte d. In the HA28 t est, a relatively abrupt increase in toxicity was associ ated with elevated PCBs alone or with elevated PAHs alone, compa red to the pattern of a gradual increase toxicity observed with quotie nts calculated using the \"Mean -all (se lect2)\". Simila rly in the CS10 test, a increase in toxicity was observed at lower quotients of PAHs alone or metals alone compared to the pattern of a gradual increase toxicity observed with quotie nts calculated using the \"Mean -all (se lect2)\". These analyses indicate that the different patterns in toxicity may be the result of unique chemical signals associated with individua l contamina nts in sample s rather than the result of a limite d number of samples used to make these comparisons. However, we could only make these compa risons with a limite d numbe r of samples where metals, PAHs, and PCB s were all reporte d. 13 Fairey et al. (2000) conducted a similar analysis of a larger marine database for amphipods and found that the number and type of SQGs used in the calculation of a mean quotient influenced the predictions of sediment toxicity to amphipods. T he incidence of toxicity to amphipods increased with increasing numbers of contaminants included in the derivation of the mean quotient (Fairey et al. 2000). While mean quotients can be used to classify samples as toxic or non-tox ic, individual quotients might be useful in helping to identify substances that may be causing or substantially contributing to the observed toxicity (MacDonald et al. 2000b). To use all samples in the database and e qually weig ht the contribution of metals, PAHs, a nd PCB s, a final analysis was conducted where the mean quotient was calculated as the averag e of the three major classes available in a sample. For example, if a sample only had a measure of total PAHs and total PCB s, then the mean quotient would be calculated using just the quotients for these two classes of compounds (desig nated as \"Mean - MPP (or)\" in Table 2). Results of these analyses indicate that the incidence of toxicity in all three tests was simila r when either \"Mean -all\" (based on up to 10 PECs) or \"Mean -MPP (or)\" were used to cal culate the mean quotients (Table 2). Evaluat ion of exposur e duration and e ndpoint s measur ed in toxicity tests In Figures 1 and 2, we evaluated the relationshi p bet ween mean PEC quotients and the incidence of toxicity as a function of the duration of the exposure or of the endpoints measured in the toxicity tests. In this analysis, a mean quotient for each sample was calculated usi ng the \"Mean - MPP (or)\" approach. The sam ples within each test were ranked in ascendi ng order by mean quotient. The incidence of toxicity and geometric mean of the mean quotients within groups of 20 samples for the HA10 a nd CS10 tests or within g roups of 10 samples for the HA28 t est was then plotte d (Figures 1 and 2, A ppendix 1). The geometric mean, rather than the arithme tic mean or median of the quotients, was calculated because it provides an estimate of central tendency that is not unduly affected by extreme values and because the distributions of the mean quotients were not known. In Figure 1, samples were c lassified as toxic based on an adverse e ffect on survi val or growth in the three tests. Results of these analyses plotte d in Figure 1 are consiste nt with the analyses presented in Table 2. Importa ntly, the incidence of toxicity increases with increasing level of contamination in all three tests. This increase was particularly pronounced at mean quotients of >0.5 in all three tests. There was a slightly elevated incidence of toxicity at the very lowest mean quotient in all three tests. Long et al. (1998a) also observed an elevated incidence of toxicity with marine amphipods at low mean quotients. Long et al. (1998a) suggested that these samples were some times fine-grained sedime nts w ith low concentrations of organic carbon and de tectable concentrations of butyltins, chlorina ted pesticides, alkyl-substitute d PAHs, ammonia , or other substances not accounted for with the SQGs. In the present study, the incidence of toxicity at low mean quotients did not appear to be related to total organic carbon in sediment. There was insuffic ient informa tion in the database to evaluate effects of grain size on toxicity. USEPA (2000) and ASTM (2000) reported that amphipods and midg es were relatively intolerant to effect s of sediment grain size. 14 We also evaluated relationshi ps between the toxicity and mean quotients calculated usi ng up to 10 reliable PECs or mean quotients calculated using all of the available PECs in Table 1 regardless of their reliability (plots not included in this pa per). An increase in toxicity was observed with increasing contamina tion using either 10 reliable PECs or all of the PECs to calculate mean quotie nts. Howe ver, the variability was higher when all of the PECs listed in Table 1 were used in this analy sis. Therefore, the use of reliable PECs improved the relationship between me an PEC quotie nts and the incidence of toxicity. In Figure 2, samples in the three tests were classified as toxic based on an adverse effect on survival alone or based on an adverse effect on survival or growth. The relationship between the incidence of toxicity and the geometric mean of the mean quotients was best described by a three parameter logistic model (SigmaPlot 1997; Figure 2; see Appendix 1 for the equations and coeffi cients). The best fit of the data was observed in the HA28 test (r2 = 0.79 based on survival or 0.93 based on survival or growth) relative to the HA10 test (r2 = 0.73 based on survival or 0.78 based on survival or growth) or CS10 test (r2 = 0.56 based on survival or 0.76 based on survival or growth; Figure 2). In the HA10 test, the relationship between tox icity and m ean quotie nt was simila r when either surviva l alone or surviva l or growth together were used to classify a sample as toxic. Howe ver, in the HA28 and CS10 tests, the relationship between the incidence of toxicity and mean quotient was different when survi val or growth were used to classify a sample as toxic compared to survival alone (Figure 2). The incidence of toxicity in the HA28 and CS10 tests ba sed on surviva l or growth was often double the incidence of toxicity based on survival alone at mean quotients of >0.3. A 50% incidence of toxicity in the HA28 test corresponds to a mean quotient of 0.63 when survival or growth were used to classify a sample as toxic (Figure 2, Appendix 1). By comparison, a 50% incidence of toxicity was estimated at a mean quotient of 3.2 when survival alone was used to classify a sample as toxic in the HA28 test. In the CS10 test, a 50% incidence of toxicity was estimated at a mean quotient of 9.0 when survival alone was used to classify a sample as toxic or at a mean quotient of 3.5 when survival or growth were used to classify a sample as toxic. In contrast, similar mean quotients resulted in a 50% incidence of toxicity in the HA10 test when survival alone (mean quotient of 4.5) or when survival or growth (mean quotient of 3.4) were used to classify a sample as toxic. Results of these analyses indicate that both t he duration of the exposure and the endpoint measured can influence whether a sample is found to be toxic or not. Again, comparisons of the sensitivity between the se tests needs to be made with some caution. There were very few samples in the freshwater database where tests were conducted using splits of the same samples. Therefore, the differences observed in the responses of org anisms may also be due to differences in the types of sediments evaluated in the individual databases for each test. Nevert heless, it appears that longer-term tests in which survival and growth are measured tend to be more sensitive than short-te rm tests, with acute to chronic ratios on t he order of 6 indic ated for H. azteca. Simila r diffe rences in sensitivity of H. azteca have been observed in 10- and 42-day water-only exposures to cadmium, fluoranthene or DDD (unpublished data). 15 Evaluation of the predictive ability of mean PEC quotie nts across various geographic al areas with the database A prima ry objective of this paper was to determine if there were diffe rences in the predictive ability of PEC quotients within geographic areas compared to the entire database. We chose to make these comparisons of geographic areas using the \"MPP (or)\" mean quotients calculated as the mean of the averag e quotient for metals, the quotient for total PAHs, or the quotient for total PCB s (Table 2). Use of this approa ch ma ximize d the numbe r of samples used in the evaluation and equally weig hted the contribution of the three major classes of compounds (metals, or PAHs, or PCB s) to the observed incidence of toxicity. The relationship between the incidence of toxicity and mean quotients is present ed in Tabl es 3 to 5 for the entire database and for vari ous geographi cal areas represent ed within the database. Designation of region, basin, and area for each geographi c area in Tables 3 to 5 is based on inform ation obt ained from the ori ginal report or by contacting the authors of the report. Comparisons of toxicity among the entire geographic areas listed in Tables 3 to 5 should be done with caution given the limited number of samples from each area (i .e., only 5 sam ples for the HA10 test from the ent ire Buffal o River). Samples were grouped by geographic areas in Table 3 to 5 to determine how well toxicity and mean quotients correspond in the entire database compared to subsets of samples within the database. Control samples were not included within each geographi cal area. However, the incidence of toxicity with and without control samples was similar for the entire database (first and second rows for each of the three t ests listed in Tables 3 to 5). For the HA10 test, there was typically an increase in the incidence of toxicity with an increase in the mean quotie nt within most of the regions, basins, and areas (Table 3). The incidence of toxicity for samples from each of the Great Lakes and within the areas of each Great Lake was relatively consiste nt with the overall pattern of toxicity in the entire database. No one area influenced the overall incidence of toxicity for the HA10 test. However, the absolute incidence of toxicity differed somewhat between areas. For example, the incidence of toxicity for the Great Lakes samples in the HA10 test (n=313) was 14% at mean quotients >1.0, and 78% at mean quotients of >5.0. This compares to an incidence of toxicity for the entire database (n=654) of 19% at mean quotients of <0.1, 54% >1.0, and at quotients of >5.0. Hence, at mean quotients of >1.0 there was about a 14% higher incidence of toxicity for samples from the Great Lakes compared to the entire database for the HA10 test. The lower incidence of toxicity for samples from non-Great Lakes areas was primarily due to the lower incidence of toxicity at mean quotients >1.0 for samples from the states of New Y ork (7%, n=15), Oregon (40%, n=20), and Washing ton (50%, n=34). In the HA10 test, there was also a higher incidence of toxicity at mean quotie nts of <0.1 for a limite d numbe r of samples from the lowe r Mississippi Rive r (89%, n=9) and from the Tembla der River in California (75%, n=4) compared to the entire database. These samples contributed to the 22% incidence of toxicity that was observed for samples from non-Great Lakes areas at quotients of <0.1 (n=89). By comparison, only a 14% incidence of toxicity was evident for samples with quotients of <0.1 for Great Lakes areas (n=51). One of the reasons for the difference between non-Great Lakes samples and Great Lakes samples may be due to 16 contaminants associated with agricultural practices in the non-Great Lakes areas (i.e., herbicides or pesticides) that contributed to the toxicity of these samples independently of elevated metals, PAHs, or PCBs. In the HA28 test, there was also an increase in the incidence of toxicity with an increase in the mean quotie nt within most of the regions, basins, and areas (Table 4). The incidence of toxicity for samples from each of the Great Lakes and within areas of each Great Lake was relatively consiste nt with the overall pattern of toxicity in the entire database. Simila rly, the incidence in toxicity for samples from the Great Lakes was consiste nt with the incidence in toxicity for samples from non-Great Lakes areas. Therefore, no one area influenced the overall incidence of toxicity within the HA28 test. There were a relatively high number of non-tox ic samples (n= 51 of 53) with low mean quotients from the upper Mississippi River. The incidence of toxicity for the Great Lakes samples (n=42) was 13% at mean quotients of <0.5, 71% at mean quotients of 0.5 to <1.0, and 100% at mean quotients of >1.0. This pattern is consistent with incidence of toxicity for the entire database (n=151) of 17% at mean quotients of <0.5, 56% at mean quotients of 0.5 to <1.0, and 97% at mean quotients of >1.0 (Table 4). In the CS10 test, there was typically an inc rease in the incidence of toxicity with an inc rease in the mean quotie nt within most of the regions, basins, and areas (Table 5). The incidence of toxicity for the Great Lakes samples (n=463) was 14% at mean quotients of <0.1, 56% >1.0, and 71% at mean quotients of >5.0. This pattern is consistent with incidence of toxicity for the entire database (n=611) of 20% at mean quotients of <0.1, 52% >1.0, and 68% at mean quotients of >5.0. The incidence of toxicity for samples from each of the Great Lakes and within the areas of each Great Lake was relatively consistent with the overall pattern of toxicity in the entire database; howe ver, there were some exceptions to this pattern. A lower incidence of toxicity was observed at mean quotients of >1.0 for samples from the St. Mary 's River (41%, n=17), Fox River and Green Bay (0%, n=8), n=8). However, at mean quotients of >5.0, there was a more consiste nt pattern in the incidence of toxicity in the CS10 test. An exception to this pa ttern at mean quotients >5.0 was observed for samples from the St. Mary's River (38%, n=8) and White Lake Monta gue (25%, n=4). Simila rly, a lower incidence in toxicity was observed at mean quotients of >5.0 for samples from the state of Washing ton (50%, n=4). In the CS10 test, there was also a higher incidence of toxicity at mean quotie nts of <0.1 for a limite d numbe r of samples from Sheboygan Harbor (75%, n= 4), from the lowe r Mississippi River (89%, n=9), and from the Trinity River (67%, n=3). The samples from the Lower Mississippi River and Trinity River contributed to the 53% incidence of toxicity that was observed for samples from non-Great Lakes areas with quotients of <0.1 (n=19). By comparison, only a 14% incidence of toxicity was evident for samples with quotients of <0.1 for Great Lakes areas (n=99). Again, one of the reasons for the difference between non-Great Lakes samples and Great Lakes samples may be due to cont aminants associ ated with agricultural pract ices in the non-Great Lakes areas (i.e., herbicides or pesticides) that contributed to the toxicity of these sample s independently of elevated me tals, PAHs, or PCBs. 17 In summa ry, there was generally an inc rease in the incidence of toxicity with increasing mean PEC quotie nts w ithin most of the regions, basins, and areas for all three tests (Ta bles 3 to 5). For the HA10 and HA28 tests, the incidence of toxicity for samples from each of the Great Lakes and within the areas of each Great Lake was relatively consistent with the overal l pattern of toxicity in the entire database. However, the relationshi p bet ween the incidence in toxicity and mean quotients in the CS10 test was more variable among geographic areas compared to either the HA10 or HA28 test. The results of these analyses indicate that the consensus-based PECs can be used to reliably predict toxicity of sediments on both a regional and national basis. Future analyses planned for the database This pa per presents results of the first analyses comple ted on t he entire freshwa ter sedime nt database. Some of the additional analyses planned for the database (beyond the scope of this paper) are listed below: Approaches for designating s amples as toxic. In the present study , samples were desig nated as toxic in the three tests based on a significant reduction in survival or a sublethal endpoint (typically growth) relative to a control or reference sediment. This desig nation of toxicity utiliz ed the results of statistical analy ses presented in each of the original studies. Alternatively , Long et al. (1998a) classified sediments in a marine amphipod database as either marginally toxic (significantly reduced relative to the control) or as highly toxic (significantly reduced relative to the control with a reduction greater than a minimum significant difference; MSD). The MS D was established by Long et al. (1998a) using a power analy sis of data from 10-day marine amphipod tests (Thursby et al.1997). Long et al. (1998a) and Field et al. (1999) reported reduced variability in the relationship between tox icity and sedime nt contamina tion when toxicity was evaluated using a standardiz ed approach. Future analyses of the freshwater database will compare relationships between tox icity and contamina tion using marginally toxic versus highly toxic sedime nts. This classific ation may be based on a powe r analysis to establish an MDS for each endpoint in each of the three tests. Alternatively , the MDS for each endpoint may be established using results of round-robin t esting (USEPA 2000). This latter procedure is currently being investigated for use in classifying the toxicity of freshwater samples in a revision to the report on the incidence and severity of sediment contamination in surface waters of the United States (USEPA 1997; Scott Ireland, USEPA, W ashing ton, DC, personal communication). Classification of sediments as either marginally or highly toxic may help to reduce the variability in the observed relationship between tox icity and m ean quotie nts. Additiona lly, this analysis may help to address the higher incidence of toxicity at mean quotients of <0.1 in the HA10 and CS10 tests compared to the HA28 tests. Logistic-regressi on modeling of the freshwater datab ase. Field et al. (1999) described a procedure for evaluating matching marine sedime nt chemistry and toxicity data using logistic regression mode ls. These mode ls can be used to estimate the proba bility of observing an effect at any contaminant concentration. The models were developed for marine amphipods using a large database (n=2524) from a variety of geographic areas. 18 The results of prelimina ry analyses using these technique s indicate that the freshwa ter database may have too few s amples to adequately develop these regression models. However, evaluations are ongoing to determine how well the regression models developed from the marine database can be used to predict responses of organisms in the freshwat er database. Optim al list of analytes for broad scale application and test of the relative efficacy of the mean versu s the sum PEC quotien t. Further c omparisons are needed of approaches for calculating the PEC quotie nt. Calculation of a mean quotie nt ma y include analytes whic h have limite d toxicological importa nce. The significant toxicological contribution of a few chem icals may be averag ed out by the use of the mean quotient. Analyses need to be conducted t o identify an optimal list of analytes for broad s cale application a nd to test the relative efficacy of the mean versus the sum PEC quotient. Even if the mean quotie nt continue s to be the best at predicting toxicity, identific ation of an optima l list of analy tes would be useful. If a consistent set of analytes is applied, the sum and the mean quotie nt will ma thematically equiva lent. Influe nce of sediment grain size and ammonia on the incidence of toxicity. Data on grain size and pore-water ammonia, pH, and water hardness were obtained for some studies evaluated in this paper. Future analyses of the database will evaluate the influence of either grain size or ammonia on the response of the test organisms in the HA10, HA28, or CS10 tests. ASTM (2000) and U SEPA (2000) provide the following guidance for dealing with the influe nce of grain size or ammonia in toxicity tests with freshwa ter sediments. Natural physico-chem ical charact eristics such as grain size or organic carbon can potentially influence the response of test organisms. A STM (2000) and U SEPA (2000) summariz e results from a variety of studies and conclude H. azteca can tole rate a wide range in grain size and org anic matter in 10- to 42-da y tests with sedime nts. Larvae of C. tentans in 10-day tests were tolerant of a wide range of grain size if ash-free dry weig ht was used to account for the influence of inorganic material in the gut. The content of organic matter in sediments does not appear to affect survival of C. tentans larvae in sediments; but, may be important with respect to larval growth. Future analyses of the database will evaluate potential relationships between grain size or organic carbon of sediments on t he toxicity in the HA10, HA28, or CS10 tests. Ammonia in pore water may contribute to the toxicity of some sediments in fresh water. The toxicity of ammonia to C. tentans is dependent on pH whereas the toxicity of ammonia to H. azteca is also dependent on water hardness (ASTM 2000, USEPA 2000). Water-only LC50 values may provide suitable screening values for potential ammonia toxicity; however, higher concentrations may be necessary to actually induce ammonia toxicity in sedime nt exposure s, particularly for H. azteca due to avoidance. ASTM (2000) and USEPA (2000) cite studies which describe procedures for conducting toxicity identific ation evaluations (TI Es) for pore-water or whole-sedime nt sample s to determine if ammonia is contributing to the toxicity of sedime nt sample s. Future analyses of the 19 database will evaluate potential relationships between pore-water ammonia, pH, and water hardness on toxicity in the HA10, HA28, or CS10 tests. These analyses will focus on the HA28 test due to limite d data available for the HA10 or CS10 tests. Guidanc e manual for conduc ting an int egrated assessment of sediment contam ination. Work is in progress to develop a guidance manual for USEPA G reat Lakes Nationa l Program Offic e that can be used to assess sedime nt quality and de termine the need for remediation at a site. Specifically, this g uidance manual will describe procedures for combining resul ts of sediment toxicity, bioaccum ulation, benthic communitie s surveys, and sedime nt chemistry in an integrated evaluation of ecological risk. Development of this guidance manual is being coordinated with ongoing efforts to develop simila r guidance by the Department of the Interior and by Environme nt Canada. Additional analyses of the freshwater database will be used to help develop this guidance. Specifically , these analy ses will focus on determining which endpoints provide the most sensitive and cost effective measures of sedime nt contamina tion. 20 Summa ry The prima ry objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate the ability of consensus-ba sed PECs t o predi ct toxicity in a freshwat er database f or field-col lected sediments in the Great Lakes basin; (2) evaluate the ability of these PECs t o pre dict sedime nt toxicity on a regional geographic basis elsewhere in North Am erica; and (3) compare approaches for evaluating the combined effect s of chem ical mixtures on the toxicity of field-col lected sediments. When mean quotients were calculated using an approa ch of equally weighting up to 10 r eliable PECs (PECs for metals, total PAHs, total PCBs, and sum DDE), there w as an increase i n the incidence of toxicity with an increase in the mean quotie nt in all three tests. A consiste nt inc rease in the toxicity in all three tests occurred at mean quotients of >0.5. However, the overall incidence of toxicity was greater in the HA28 test compared to the short-term tests. The reason for the higher incidence of toxicity in the HA28 test compared to the short-term tests may be due to the duration of the exposure or the sensitivity of growth in the longer HA28 test. Howe ver, compa risons of the sensitivity between these t ests needs to be made w ith som e caution. There w ere very few samples in the database where tests were conducted using splits of the same samples. Therefore, the differences observed in the responses of organisms may also be due to differences in the types of sediments evaluated in the individual databases for each test. Nevert heless, it appears that longer-term tests in whic h surviva l and growth are measured tend to be more sensitive than shorte r-term tests, with acute to chronic ratios on the order of 6 indicated for H. azteca. We were also interested in determining the predictive ability of PEC quotients for major classes of compounds. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of toxicity based on a mean quotient for metals, a quotie nt for total PAHs, or a quotie nt for total PCB s. Different patterns of toxicity associated with the other procedures for calculating quotie nts w ere observed. For example in the HA28 test, a relatively abrupt increase in toxicity was associ ated with elevated PCBs alone or with elevated PAHs alone, compared to the pattern of a gradual increase toxicity observed with quotients calculated using a combination of metals, PAHs, and PCB s. These analy ses indicate that the diffe rent patterns in toxicity may be the result of unique chemical signals associated with individua l contamina nts in sample s. While mean quotie nts can be used to classify sample s as toxic or non-tox ic, individual quotients might be useful in helping to identify substances that may be causing or substantially contributing to the observed t oxicity. We chose to make comparisons across geographic areas using mean quotients calculated by equally weig hting the contribution of the three major classes of compounds (metals, or PAHs, or PCB s). This approach assumes that these three diverse groups of chemicals exert some form of joint toxic action. Use of this approa ch also maximize d the numbe r of samples that were used to make com parisons across geographic areas. General ly, there was an increase i n the incidence of toxicity increasing with mean PEC quotie nts within most of the regions, basins, and areas for all three t oxicity tests. The i ncidence of toxicity for samples from each of the Great Lakes and within the areas of each Great Lake was relatively consistent with the overal l pattern of toxicity in the entire database for the HA10 and HA28 tests. However, the relationshi p bet ween the incidence in toxicity and mean quotients in the CS10 test was more variable among geographic areas compared to either the HA10 or HA28 test. Results of these a nalyses indicate that the 21 PECs developed using a database from across North America can be used to reliably predict toxicity of sedime nts on a regional basis. One of the prima ry goals of sedime nt quality assessme nts is to evaluate the effects of contaminated sediments on benthic communities in the field ( Ingersoll et al. 1997). Swartz et al. (1994) evaluated sediment quality conditions along a sediment contamination gradient of total DDT using information from 10-day toxicity tests with amphipods, sediment chemistry , and the abundance of benthic amphipods abronius,a nd H. laboratory toxicity tests w as positive ly correlated to the abundance of amphipods in the field and negatively correlated to total DDT concentrations. The toxicity threshold f or amphipods in 10-day sediment toxicity tests was about 300 g total DDT/g organic carbon. The threshold for reduction in abundance of amphipods in the field was about 100 g total DDT/g organic carbon. Therefore, correlations between toxicity, contamination, and the status of benthic macroinve rtebrates in the field indicate that 10-da y sedime nt toxicity tests can provide a reliable indicator of the presence of adverse levels of sediment contamination in the field. However, these short-term toxicity tests may be under protective of sublethal effects of contamina nts on benthic communitie s in the field. Similarly , Canfield et al. (1994, 1996, 1998) evaluated the composition of benthic invertebrate communities in sediments in a variety of locations including the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi River, and t he Clark F ork R iver in Montana. Results of these benthic invertebrate community assessme nts we re compa red to SQGs (ERMs) and 28-da y sedime nt toxicity tests w ith H. azteca. Good concordance was evident between measures of laboratory toxicity, SQGs, and benthic invertebrate community composition in extremely contamina ted sample s. Howe ver, in mode rately contamina ted sample s, less concordance was observed between the composition of the benthic community and either laboratory toxicity tests or SQGs. The laboratory toxicity tests better identified chemical contamination in sediments compared to many of the commonly used measures of benthic invertebrate community struc ture. As the status of benthic invertebrate communitie s may reflect other factors such as habitat alteration in addition to effects of contaminants, t he use of longer-term toxicity tests in combination w ith SQGs may provide a more sensitive and prote ctive measure of potential toxic effects of sedime nt contamina tion on benthic communitie s compa red to use of 10-da y toxicity tests. This pa per presents results of the first analyses comple ted on t he entire freshwa ter sedime nt database. Some of the additional analyses planned for the database that are beyond the scope of this paper include: (1) comparing approaches for desig nating samples as toxic; (2) evaluating logistic-regression mode ls; (3) identifying a list of optima l analytes for broad scale applic ation and testing the relative efficacy of the mean verses the sum PEC quotient; (4) evaluating the influence of grain size and ammonia on the incidence of toxicity; and (5) developing a guidance manual for conducting an integrated assessment of sediment contamination. 22 Referen ces American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). 2000.
