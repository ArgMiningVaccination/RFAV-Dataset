Ong, PhD13 On January 21, 2022, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website ( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr ). Estimates of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) have declined in recent months ( 1,2) because of waning vac - cine induced immunity over time,* possible increased immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 variants ( 3), or a combination of these and other factors. CDC recommends that all persons aged 12 years receive a third dose (booster) of an mRNA vaccine 5 months after receipt of the second mRNA vaccine dose and that immunocompromised individuals receive a third primary dose. A third dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine increases neutralizing antibody levels ( 4), and three recent studies from Israel have shown improved effec - tiveness of a third dose in preventing COVID-19 associated with infections with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) vari - ant (5-7). Yet, data are limited on the real-world effectiveness of third doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in the United States, especially since the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant became predominant in mid-December 2021. The VISION Network\u00a7 examined VE by analyzing 222,772 encounters from 383 emergency departments (EDs) and urgent care (UC) clinics and 87,904 hospitalizations from * https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3961378 CDC initially recommended a third dose of mRNA vaccine for all adults 6 months after receipt of the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. On January 4, 2022, CDC amended the interval to 5 months after receipt of the second dose for recipients of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. On January 7, 2022, CDC amended the interval to 5 months for recipients of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. CDC recommends the Pfizer-BioNTech booster at 5 months, and an additional primary dose for certain immunocompromised persons aged 5 years (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/ recommendations/immuno.html). CDC recommends the Moderna booster at 5 months. https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0107-moderna-booster.html \u00a7 Funded by CDC, the VISION Network includes Baylor Scott & White Health (Texas), Columbia University Irving Medical Center (New York), HealthPartners (Minnesota and Wisconsin), Intermountain Healthcare (Utah), Kaiser Permanente Northern California (California), Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Oregon and Washington), Regenstrief Institute (Indiana), and University of Colorado (Colorado).259 hospitals among adults aged 18 years across 10 states from August 26, 2021\u00b6 to January 5, 2022. Analyses were stratified by the period before and after the Omicron variant became the predominant strain (>50% of sequenced viruses) at each study site. During the period of Delta predominance across study sites in the United States (August-mid-December 2021), VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters was 86% 14-179 days after dose 2, 76% 180 days after dose 2, and 94% 14 days after dose 3. Estimates of VE for the same intervals after vaccination during Omicron variant predominance were 52%, 38%, and 82%, respectively. During the period of Delta variant predominance, VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hos - pitalizations was 90% 14-179 days after dose 2, 81% 180 days after dose 2, and 94% 14 days after dose 3. During Omicron variant predominance, VE estimates for the same intervals after vaccination were 81%, 57%, and 90%, respectively. The highest estimates of VE against COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters or hospitalizations during both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods were among adults who received a third dose of mRNA vaccine. All unvaccinated persons should get vaccinated as soon as possible. All adults who have received mRNA vaccines during their primary COVID-19 vaccination series should receive a third dose when eligible, and eligible persons should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations. VISION Network methods have been previously published (1,8,9). In brief, eligible medical encounters were defined as those among adults aged 18 years with a COVID-19-like illness diagnosis** who had received molecular testing (primar - ily reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay) for \u00b6 The study period at Baylor Scott & White Health began on September 11, 2021. ** COVID-19-like illness diagnoses included acute respiratory illness (e.g., COVID-19, respiratory failure, or pneumonia) or related signs or symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, vomiting, or diarrhea) using diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, T enth Revision .Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 140 MMWR / January 28, 2022 / Vol. 71 / No. 4 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) within 14 days before or 72 hours after the admission or encounter. The study period began on August 26, 2021, 14 days after the first U.S. recommendation for a third mRNA COVID-19 primary vac - cine dose in immunocompromised persons. The date when the Omicron variant became predominant was determined for each study site based on state and national surveillance data. Recipients of Ad26.COV2 (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]), 1 or >3 doses of an mRNA vaccine, and those for whom 1-13 days had elapsed since receipt of any dose were excluded. Immunocompromised patients were identified by previously published diagnosis codes\u00a7\u00a7 (9). VE was estimated using a test-negative design, comparing the odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients using multivariable logistic regres - sion models, as previously described\u00b6\u00b6 (1,8,9). Vaccination status was categorized based on the number of vaccine doses received and number of days from vaccination to the index medical encounter date.*** Potential effect modification by vaccine product, age group (aged 18-64 years versus 65 years), and immunocompromised status (for whom a third dose is the last dose in their primary series) was assessed by adding interac - tion terms for vaccination by these covariates to the regression model. Effect modification was only examined for medical encounters during the Delta period of predominance, given relatively sparse data during the Omicron period. A statistically significant difference was indicated by a p-value <0.01 for an interaction term, 95% CI that did not overlap, or standardized mean or proportion differences 0.2 indicating nonnegligible difference in distributions of vaccination or infection status ( 9). This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at participating sites or under a reliance agreement with the Westat, Inc. institutional review board. https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/ coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose- certain-immunocompromised \u00a7\u00a7 Immunocompromising conditions were derived from lists used in previous studies of large hospital-based or administrative databases and included the following conditions: 1) solid malignancies, 2) hematologic malignancies, 3) rheumatologic or inflammatory disorders, 4) other intrinsic immune conditions or immunodeficiencies, and 5) organ or stem cell transplants. \u00b6\u00b6 With a test-negative design, vaccine performance is assessed by comparing the odds of antecedent vaccination among case-patients with acute laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and control-patients without acute COVID-19. This odds ratio was adjusted for age, geographic region, calendar time (days from August 26, 2021), and local virus circulation in the community and weighted for inverse propensity to be vaccinated or unvaccinated (calculated separately for each vaccine exposure group). *** Index test date was defined as the date of respiratory specimen collection associated with the most recent positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result before the hospitalization or the hospitalization date if testing only occurred after admission. 45 C.F .R. part 46; 21 C.F .R. part 56.Among 222,772 ED or UC encounters, 204,745 (92%) and 18,027 (8%) occurred during the Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, respectively ( Table 1 ). A higher percentage of Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, per - sons of unknown race/ethnicity, and adults aged <65 years were unvaccinated or had not received a third COVID-19 vaccine dose; adults aged <65 years were more likely to have received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Among persons with COVID-19-like illness seeking care at ED or UC facili - ties who had received the second dose <180 days earlier and 180 days earlier, the median interval since receipt of the second dose was 137 days and 223 days, respectively. Among those who had received the third dose 14 days earlier, the median interval since receipt of that dose was 44 days. During the Delta-predominant period, VE against laboratory- confirmed COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters was significantly lower among patients who had received the second vaccine dose 180 days earlier (76%) than it was among those who had received the dose 14-179 days earlier (86%); VE among those who had received the third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose was 94% ( Table 2 ). VE after receipt of the third dose was lower among the 4% of patients with immunocompromised status (74%; 95% CI = versus those without 95% CI = 94%-95%) (p<0.001) (CDC, unpublished data, 2022). During the period of Omicron predominance, the pattern was similar, although all VE estimates were significantly lower. VE against COVID-19- associated ED and UC encounters 14-179 days after receipt of dose 2 was 52%, and at 180 days after dose 2 was 38%. VE after receipt of 3 vaccine doses among all adults was 82%. Among 87,904 eligible hospitalizations, 86,327 (98%) and 1,577 (2%) during the Delta- and Omicron- predominant periods, respectively ( Table 3 ). Hospitalized adults aged <65 years or who were Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, unknown race/ethnicity, or who did not have chronic nonrespiratory medical conditions were more likely to be unvaccinated or, if vaccinated, less likely to have received a third vaccine dose. In addition, adults aged <65 years and those without chronic nonrespiratory conditions were more likely to have received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Among persons hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness who had received the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose <180 days earlier and 180 days earlier, the median interval since receipt of the second dose was 144 days and 222 days, respectively. Among those who had received the third dose 14 days earlier, the median interval since receipt of that dose was 41 days. During Delta predominance, VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 90% among per - sons who had received the second dose 14-179 days earlier, 81% among those who had received it 180 days earlier, and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 28, 2022 / Vol. 71 / No. 4 141 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention94% among persons who had received a third dose 14 days earlier ( Table 2 ). VE after receipt of the third dose was lower among the 21% of patients with immunocompromised status (83%; 95% CI = 78%-87%) versus among those without (96%; 95% CI = 95%-97%) (p = 0.001) (CDC, unpublished data, 2022). During Omicron predominance, VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 81% among 2-dose recipients who had received the second dose 14-179 days ear - lier, 57% among those who had received it 180 days earlier, and 90% at 14 days after receipt of a third dose. VE estimates for patients who received dose 2 180 days earlier significantly declined during Omicron predominance compared with esti - mates during Delta predominance. Discussion In a multistate analysis of 222,772 ED and UC encounters and 87,904 hospitalizations among adults with COVID-19-like illness during August 26, 2021-January 5, 2022, estimates of VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 declined during the Omicron-predominant period compared with VE during the Delta-predominant period. During both periods, VE was significantly lower among patients who received their second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose 180 days before the medical TABLE 1.

COVID-19-like illness diagnoses included acute respiratory illness (e.g., COVID-19, respiratory failure, or pneumonia) or related signs or symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, vomiting, or diarrhea) using diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision . Clinician-ordered molecular assays (e.g., real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 occurring 14 days before to <72 hours after the encounter date were included. Recipients of Janssen, 1 or >3 doses of an mRNA vaccine, and those for whom 1-13 days had elapsed since receipt of any dose were excluded. Vaccination was defined as having received the listed number of doses of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine 14 days before the medical event index date, which was the date of respiratory specimen collection associated with the most recent positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result before the medical event or the admission date if testing only occurred after the admission. \u00a7 Partners contributing data on medical events and estimated dates of Omicron predominance were in California (December 21), Colorado (December 19), Indiana (December 26), Minnesota and Wisconsin (December 25), New York (December 18), Oregon (December 24), Texas (December 16), Utah (December 24), and Washington (December 24). The study period began in September 2021 for partners located in Texas. \u00b6 The \"3 doses\" category includes persons who have received a third dose in their primary series or have received an additional dose following their 2-dose primary series; this includes the reduced-dosage Moderna booster. ** An absolute standardized mean or proportion difference 0.20 indicates a nonnegligible difference in variable distributions between medical events for vaccinated versus unvaccinated patients; single SMD calculated by averaging pairwise comparisons of each vaccinated category versus unvaccinated and separately for patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive versus SARS-CoV-2-negative test results. For example, the age SMD calculation comparing unvaccinated versus different vaccinated categories was generated by averaging the pairwise SMD calculations for unvaccinated and 2 doses (<180 days earlier), unvaccinated and 2 doses (180 days earlier), and unvaccinated and 3 doses.

VE increased following a third dose and was highly effective during both the Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods at prevent - ing COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters (94% and 82%, respectively) and preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (94% and 90%, respectively). Estimates of VE for 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine were higher against COVID-19-associated hospitalizations than against COVID-19-associated ED or UC encounters, especially dur - ing the Omicron period, which is consistent with possible vac - cine attenuation of severity of COVID-19 disease but was not observed in this network previously ( 1,8). This study also found that immunocompromised adults had lower third dose VE against COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters and hospitalization, which is consistent with trends observed for VE following a second dose ( 9) and is consistent with recom - mendations for a booster dose for this group 5 months after the additional primary dose.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, VE estimates from this study do not include COVID-19-associated outpatient visits or non-medically attended COVID-19. Second, the median interval from receipt of dose 3 to medical encounters was 41-44 days; thus, the observed performance of dose 3 is limited to a relatively short period after vaccination. Third, the reasons for the decline in \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 CDC recommends that all immunocompromised persons receive a booster dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines 5 months after completing their 3-dose primary series. https://www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.htmlVE during the Omicron period are unclear; however, the drop in VE during a short period suggests increased immune evasion by the variant. Fourth, limited data during the Omicron period reduced the precision of the VE estimates and precluded tests for effect modification. Fifth, despite adjustments to balance the differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated adults, unmeasured and residual confounding (e.g., wearing a mask and close contact with persons with COVID-19) in this obser - vational study might have biased the estimates. Sixth, genetic characterization of patients' viruses was not available, and analyses therefore relied on dates when the Omicron variant became predominant based on surveillance data. The Omicron period of predominance in this study likely includes medical encounters associated with the Delta variant. If VE is reduced against medical care associated with Omicron variant, this study likely overestimated VE. Finally, although the facilities in this study serve heterogeneous populations in 10 states, the findings might not be generalizable to the U.S. population. These findings underscore the importance of receiving a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to prevent both moderately severe and severe COVID-19, especially while the Omicron variant is the predominant circulating variant and when the effectiveness of 2 doses of mRNA vaccines is significantly reduced against this variant. All unvaccinated persons should get vaccinated as soon as possible. All adults who have received mRNA vaccines during their primary COVID-19 vaccination series should receive a third dose when eligible, and eligible persons should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 28, 2022 / Vol. 71 / No. 4 143 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE 2. mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness * against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among adults aged 18 years, by number and timing of vaccine doses\u00a7 and vaccine product received \u2014 VISION Network, 10 states, August 2021-January 2022\u00b6 Encounter/Predominant variant period/Vaccination status TotalSARS-CoV-2 positive test result, no.

Generalized boosted regression trees were used to estimate the propensity to be vaccinated based on sociodemographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and facility characteristics. Medical events with a discharge code consistent with COVID-19-like illness were included. COVID-19-like illness diagnoses included acute respiratory illness (e.g., COVID-19, respiratory failure, or pneumonia) or related signs or symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, vomiting, or diarrhea) using diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision . Clinician-ordered molecular assays (e.g., real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 occurring 14 days before to <72 hours after admission were included. Recipients of Janssen, 1 or >3 doses of an mRNA vaccine, and those for whom 1-13 days had elapsed since receipt of any dose were excluded. \u00a7 Vaccination status was documented in electronic health records and immunization registries and was defined as having received the listed number of doses of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine 14 days before the medical event index date. Index date was defined as the date of respiratory specimen collection associated with the most recent positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result before the medical event or the admission date if testing only occurred after the admission. Three- dose recipients include persons who received a third dose in their primary series or received an additional (booster) dose after their 2-dose primary series; this includes the reduced-dosage Moderna booster. \u00b6 Partners contributing data on medical events and estimated dates of Omicron predominance were in California (December 21), Colorado (December 19), Indiana (December 26), Minnesota and Wisconsin (December 25), New York (December 18), Oregon (December 24), Texas (December 16), Utah (December 24), and Washington (December 24).

Summary What is already known about this topic? COVID-19 mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing COVID-19 might decline because of waning of vaccine-induced immunity or variant immune evasion. What is added by this report? VE was significantly higher among patients who received their second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose <180 days before medical encounters compared with those vaccinated 180 days earlier. During both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, receipt of a third vaccine dose was highly effective at preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters (94% and 82%, respectively) and preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (94% and 90%, respectively). What are the implications for public health practice? All unvaccinated persons should start vaccination as soon as possible. All adults who have received mRNA vaccines during their primary COVID-19 vaccination series should receive a third dose when eligible, and eligible persons should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations.References 1.

COVID-19-like illness diagnoses included acute respiratory illness (e.g., COVID-19, respiratory failure, or pneumonia) or related signs or symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, vomiting, or diarrhea) using diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Clinician-ordered molecular assays (e.g., real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 occurring 14 days before to <72 hours after admission were included. Recipients of Janssen, 1 or >3 dose of an mRNA vaccine, and those for whom 1-13 days had elapsed since receipt of any dose were excluded. Vaccination was defined as having received the listed number of doses of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine 14 days before the medical event index date, which was the date of respiratory specimen collection associated with the most recent positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result before the medical event or the admission date if testing only occurred after the admission. \u00a7 Partners contributing data on medical events and estimated dates of Omicron predominance were in California (December 21), Colorado (December 19), Indiana (December 26), Minnesota and Wisconsin (December 25), New York (December 18), Oregon (December 24), Texas (December 16), Utah (December 24), and Washington (December 24). The study period began in September 2021 for partners located in Texas. \u00b6 The \"3 doses\" category includes persons who have received a third dose in their primary series or received an additional dose following their 2-dose primary series; this includes the reduced-dosage Moderna booster. ** An absolute standardized mean or proportion difference 0.20 indicates a nonnegligible difference in variable distributions between medical events for vaccinated versus unvaccinated patients. First, a single SMD was calculated by averaging pairwise comparisons of each vaccinated category versus unvaccinated, and then, a second SMD was calculated separately for SARS-CoV-2-positive versus SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. For example, the age SMD calculation comparing unvaccinated versus different vaccinated categories was generated by averaging the pairwise SMD calculations for unvaccinated and 2 doses (<180 days earlier), unvaccinated and 2 doses (180 days earlier), and unvaccinated and 3 doses. Indicates the reference group used for standardized mean or proportion difference calculations for dichotomous variables. \u00a7\u00a7 Other race includes Asian, Hawaiian or Other Pacific islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, Other not listed, and multiple races. \u00b6\u00b6 Chronic respiratory condition was defined as the presence of discharge code for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other lung disease using diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. *** Chronic nonrespiratory condition was defined as the presence of discharge code for heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, other heart disease, stroke, other cerebrovascular disease, diabetes type I or II, other diabetes, metabolic disease, clinical obesity, clinically underweight, renal disease, liver disease, blood disorder, immunosuppression, organ transplant, cancer, dementia, neurologic disorder, musculoskeletal disorder, or Down syndrome using diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. 5.
