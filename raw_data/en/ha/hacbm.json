Take a look at this handy chart.", "sitename": "WebMD", "date": "2022-10-26", "cleaned_text": "There are four COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S. The Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are all highly effective in protecting you from the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC says there's a preference for the mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines over the Novavax or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. This is based on data from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). It discussed vaccine safety, vaccine effectiveness, rare negative side effects, and the U.S. vaccine supply. The CDC recommends that if you are ages 5 years and up that you get one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine dose. This last dose can be your final primary series dose or an original (monovalent) booster. If you have received more than one original (monovalent) booster, the CDC still recommends that you get an updated (bivalent) booster. The Pfizer vaccine received full FDA approval on Aug. 23, 2021, and was no longer under emergency use authorization (EUA). It is now marketed under the name Comirnaty. Vaccines continue to lower your risk for severe disease, hospitalization, and death, even against the widespread Delta variant of COVID-19. But each is slightly different. Compare them below. If you're still not sure which vaccine is best for you, talk to your doctor. |Vaccine developer:||Pfizer||Moderna||Johnson & Johnson||Novavax| |How 2021||Dec. 18, 2021||Feb. 27, 2022||Emergency use authorization was granted July 13, 2022 by the FDA| |What percentage of people did it protect from getting infected in clinical studies?||95%||94.1%||66.1% globally; 72% in the U.S.; 86% effective against severe |Who is it recommended for?||People 5 years and older||People 5 years and older||On May 5, 2022, The FDA limited its use to those 18 years of age and older for whom other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate||People 12 years and older| |How many shots do you need?||Two doses, 3 weeks apart||Two doses, 4 weeks apart||One dose||Two doses, 21 days apart| |When might you become eligible for a booster shot?||Ages 5 years and older get one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose, whether that was:| Their final primary series dose, or an original (monovalent) booster. |Ages 5 years and older get one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose, whether that was:| Their final primary series dose, or an original (monovalent) booster. |Ages 5 years and older get one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose, whether that was:| Their final primary series dose, or an original (monovalent) booster.
