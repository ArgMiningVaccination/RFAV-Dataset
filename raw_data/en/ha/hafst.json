NOTICE OF PROPOSED DISCIPLINARY ACTION: This document formally notifies a Licensee that the Board has found evidence to support a violation of the Medical Practice Act and proposes to take disciplinary action. This is a preliminary action by the Board and is not a disciplinary action. A Notice of Proposed Disciplinary Action was formerly referred to as a Complaint and Notice. CONSENT AGREEMENT: The Consent Agreement is a non-disciplinary, public agreement between the Board and the licensee to resolve an issue or address deficiencies identified by the Board. A Consent Agreement is often used to formalize a re-entry plan for a licensee who proposes to return to clinical practice after ceasing practice for a significant period of time. CORRECTIVE ACTION AGREEMENT: The Corrective Action Agreement is a public, non-disciplinary agreement designed to modify, monitor or otherwise correct an identified problem. The licensee and the Board agree to the remedial terms in this public document. FINAL ORDER: An order imposed by the Board after a Contested Case Hearing has been held. These orders conclude a Board disciplinary action and typically contain a legal finding of fact, an analysis of the applicable law and an order of action. Final Orders are usually disciplinary actions. INTERIM STIPULATED ORDER: This Order puts interim or temporary conditions on a license until the Board is able to conclude its investigation. ORDER MODIFYING BOARD ORDER: This Order modifies a previously issued Board Order. ORDER MODIFYING CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER: This Order modifies a previously issued Corrective Action Agreement or Corrective Action Order. ORDER OF EMERGENCY SUSPENSION: This Order immediately suspends a license to practice based on immediate concerns regarding the Licensee's ability to safely practice. ORDER TERMINATING BOARD ORDER: This Order terminates a previously issued Board Order. ORDER TERMINATING CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER: No longer appears on this website. This information is available in paper format. To request a Board Action please use the [Licensee Information Request](http://www.oregon.gov/OMB/ombforms1/request-licensee-info-verification.pdf). OTHER ORDER: This category refers to miscellaneous Board Orders. These types of Orders are usually not disciplinary actions. STIPULATED ORDER: The Licensee has voluntarily entered into an agreement with the Board in which the Board has found a violation of the Medical Practice Act, and the Licensee has agreed to specific terms or conditions. Stipulated Orders are disciplinary actions. VOLUNTARY LIMITATION: The Licensee has voluntarily entered into an agreement with the Board to restrict an area(s) of the Licensee's practice. There is no finding of a violation of the Medical Practice Act. Voluntary Limitations are not disciplinary actions. WHY CAN'T I VIEW ELECTRONIC COPIES OF ALL BOARD ACTIONS LISTED? Most Board Actions issued from January 1, 1998 until the present are available to view on the Board's website. Actions prior to that date are available from the Board in paper format only via US mail or fax. Electronic copies of Corrective Action Orders, and actions that modify or terminate them, are not posted because they are not disciplinary actions. Notices of Proposed Disciplinary Action are also not posted because they are not final actions by the Board. Both actions, however, are public and are available upon request, as described below. HOW CAN I GET COPIES OF THE ACTIONS LISTED? Printed copies of all Board Actions are available to the public. This report is called a Disciplinary Report. This report contains copies of ALL public actions on file for that Licensee. To obtain a Disciplinary Report for a particular Licensee, please complete a [Licensee Information Request](http://www.oregon.gov/OMB/ombforms1/request-licensee-info-verification.pdf) on the Board's website, submit it with the $10.00 fee per licensee and mail to: Oregon Medical Board 1500 SW 1st Ave, Ste 620 Portland , OR 97201 If you pay with a credit card, you may also fax this request to (971) 673-2669. WHY ARE THERE NOT WRITTEN SUMMARIES FOR EVERY ACTION LISTED? A brief, written description of all Board Actions is available for all actions issued after January 1, 2003. Prior to that date, written summaries of actions are not available. "}
