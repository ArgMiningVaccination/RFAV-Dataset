Reiki can be used to address physical, emotional, mental and spiritual issues. Reiki comes from two Japanese words. Rei means \"higher knowledge\" or \"universal consciousness\". Ki (also qi or chi) has been translated as \"life energy\" or \"universal life force\". Reiki is being used in hospitals nationwide including in such prestigious facilities as Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Mass General, Yale-New Haven, George Washington University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Reiki has been shown in several studies to reduce anxiety and pain, induce relaxation, improve fatigue, alleviate depressive symptoms, and promote overall wellbeing. During a session, the practitioner will either rest her hands lightly touching or slightly above the body for 2-5 minutes each, typically in a specific sequence. Some intuititive practitioners may move their hands to the areas where they feel an energetic imbalance. Reiki practitioners do not diagnose, and do not control the flow of energy. Reiki will flow where it is needed. Reiki is not affiliated with any religion or belief system. There are three levels of Reiki practitoners. Students learn hands-on healing and self treatment in the first level, distant and emotional healing at the second level, and acquire the knowledge to train others at the 3rd or Master level. Most people will practice for several years before advancing from one level to another. Susan is a Usui Reiki Master. You will typically lie down on a massage table, and remain clothed except for your shoes. It is best to wear loose-fitting garments on the day of your appointment, so you can relax and breathe freely. We usually play relaxing music and dim the lights for your treatment. "}
