Treating providers are solely responsible for medical advice and treatment of members. Members should discuss any Clinical Policy Bulletin (CPB) related to their coverage or condition with their treating provider. - While the Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs) are developed to assist in administering plan benefits, they do not constitute a description of plan benefits. The Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs) express Aetna's determination of whether certain services or supplies are medically necessary, experimental and investigational, or cosmetic. Aetna has reached these conclusions based upon a review of currently available clinical information (including clinical outcome studies in the peer-reviewed published medical literature, regulatory status of the technology, evidence-based guidelines of public health and health research agencies, evidence-based guidelines and positions of leading national health professional organizations, views of physicians practicing in relevant clinical areas, and other relevant factors). - Aetna makes no representations and accepts no liability with respect to the content of any external information cited or relied upon in the Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs). The discussion, analysis, conclusions and positions reflected in the Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs), including any reference to a specific provider, product, process or service by name, trademark, manufacturer, constitute Aetna's opinion and are made without any intent to defame. Aetna expressly reserves the right to revise these conclusions as clinical information changes, and welcomes further relevant information including correction of any factual error. - CPBs include references to standard HIPAA compliant code sets to assist with search functions and to facilitate billing and payment for covered services. New and revised codes are added to the CPBs as they are updated. When billing, you must use the most appropriate code as of the effective date of the submission. Unlisted, unspecified and nonspecific codes should be avoided. - Each benefit plan defines which services are covered, which are excluded, and which are subject to dollar caps or other limits. Members and their providers will need to consult the member's benefit plan to determine if there are any exclusions or other benefit limitations applicable to this service or supply. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that this service or supply is covered (i.e., will be paid for by Aetna) for a particular member. The member's benefit plan determines coverage. Some plans exclude coverage for services or supplies that Aetna considers medically necessary. If there is a discrepancy between a Clinical Policy Bulletin (CPB) and a member's plan of benefits, the benefits plan will govern. - In addition, coverage may be mandated by applicable legal requirements of a State, the Federal government or CMS for Medicare and Medicaid members. [See CMS's Medicare Coverage Center](https://www.cms.gov/Center/special-topic/medicare-coverage-center.html) - Please note also that Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs) are regularly updated and are therefore subject to change. - Since Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs) can be highly technical and are designed to be used by our professional staff in making clinical determinations in connection with coverage decisions, members should review these Bulletins with their providers so they may fully understand our policies. - While Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPBs) define Aetna's clinical policy, medical necessity determinations in connection with coverage decisions are made on a case by case basis. In the event that a member disagrees with a coverage determination, Aetna provides its members with the right to appeal the decision. In addition, a member may have an opportunity for an independent external review of coverage denials based on medical necessity or regarding the experimental and investigational status when the service or supply in question for which the member is financially responsible is $500 or greater. However, applicable state mandates will take precedence with respect to fully insured plans and self-funded non-ERISA (e.g., government, school boards, church) plans.
