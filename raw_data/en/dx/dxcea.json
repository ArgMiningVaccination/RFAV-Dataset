Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Chem 253 - Organic Chemistry I Lab 10: Isolation of Identification of the major constituent of clove oil 3/15/2012 Purpose: The purpose of this lab was to isolate the cove oil from ground cloves and determine the identity of the major constituent that is known to have the molecular formula C10H12O2 through IR It encompasses diet, nutritional medicine, therapies and self-care regimes to attain healing (Young, 2007). Naturopathy has six principles: 1. The healing power of nature (vis medicatrix naturae) - Naturopaths identify and remove obstacles to cure to ensure that the body can heal itself and maintain health. 2. First do no harm (primum no nocere) - Naturopaths use natural substances to prevent suppression of symptoms which leads to harm and a blockage to cure and health. 3. Identify and treat the cause (tolle causam) - Naturopaths look for the cause of the disease and don't just treat the symptoms. 4. The physician as teacher (docere) - Naturopaths advise and encourage their patients to take control of their own health and also see each patient visit as an opportunity for learning. 5. Treat the whole person (in perturbato animo sicut in corpore sanitas esse non potest) - Naturopaths treat the whole person, from their internal environment such as the physical, mental and emotional, to their external environment which includes social factors. 6. Prevention (principiis obsta: sero medicina curator) - Naturopaths focus on preventing disease by determining risk factors and assisting their patients to make healthy lifestyle choices (Bodhiclinic.com, 2018; Young, From a young age, I wanted to be a conventional physician, but as I grew older, I became more disillusioned with our current medical system. As I became more disillusioned, I was more drawn to the naturopathic field and the opportunities it presented to treat problems naturally. In addition, I felt that the naturopathic field offered more personalized care to the patient as they struggled with their different health problems. The way that conventional medicine practices tries to treat as many patients as possible in the shortest amount of time. The field seems not to respect the patient as a person, and I feel like every person should experience a favorable level of respect when interacting with medical professionals. In addition, I feel that patients should know that their doctor cares for them and their health, and that is difficult to convey in a 15-minute appointment, especially when compared with a 45-minute appointment. As a Naturopathic Physician, I feel that I will be able to provide my patients with the care that they deserve. Today, there are numerous integrative medicine programs in which individuals can choose to enroll. Botanical medicine, (also known as herbal medicine) is a great option to those medical professionals desiring to extend additional, non-invasive, and holistic healthcare treatments. Nurse practitioners, physicians and other healthcare providers who enroll in herbal integrative medicine programs gain education and training in the history of botanical medicine and pharmacy; herbal nutritional counseling, dosing and formulating; pathology in relation to botanical medicine, herbal safety and toxicity, and other related studies. Over the last couple of centuries, western countries adopted a range of alternative therapies from all over the world, such as: Acupuncture, yoga, reflexology, herbal supplements, acupressure, homeopathy, aroma therapy, hypnosis, mud therapy, etc. Over the past 10 years, the pharmaceutical formulary for licensed Naturopathic Physicians has absolutely expanded. In many states where Naturopathic Physicians have licensure, they also have the ability to prescribe pharmaceutical drugs to help their patients. While the Physicians may not always choose to go with pharmaceuticals as a treatment Naturopathy focuses on an individualized approach to treating the whole person, with a strong emphasis on health promotion and prevention, The Squeaky Wheel Gets the Greece Ancient Greece influence is the cornerstone of western civilization. Without Greece much of the world would have been delayed in discovering and implementing philosophy, democracy, and mathematics. Ancient Greece is responsible for either advancing or creating these concepts and may be considered the founders of western thought and politics. Greece brought forward philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates who expanded boundaries of thought by presenting questions and observations through deductible reasoning. Archimedes, Pythagoras, and Euclid brought forward advanced mathematics still currently used and recognized today. Democracy, the foundation of western government was created by the Greeks Because many of the treatments of alternative medicine do not adhere to the principles of conventional medicine, whether or not to allow practice of these techniques in the United States is a major concern of the medical community today. The Food and Drug Administration is the decision making body of issues such as this and more often than not, does not approve many of these practices. Due to the fact that holistic medicine sometimes contradicts the fundamentals of biomedicine, health care regulation boards such as the FDA find it difficult to accept many of these treatments. Because the Western world is so unfamiliar with these techniques it is only natural for medical community to often disprove these methods. However, as more and more doctors discover the limitations of There are several reasons why I have decided to pursue a career in Naturopathic medicine. First and foremost I want to help people. Septic arthritis in my hip at the age 9 months has led to a lifetime of being constantly involved in many disciplines of the healthcare system. And while medical doctors and surgeons have provided me with the ability to walk and lead a normal life, it was naturopathic and chiropractic doctors that really helped me overcome my overall health concerns. I owe a lot to naturopathic medicine and ultimately wish to become a naturopathic doctor so that I can help other people in ways that I was helped myself. I know that my passion lies within medicine, but the '10 minute appointment followed by a prescription' kind of healthcare does not appeal to me. People need to realize that going against basic treatment is not always a bad thing. Not using synthetic drugs for treatment is a smart and healthy choice. There are certain stigmas related to natural medicine, but being aware of the benefits may result in more people believing in these resources. People have been using herbal medicines and plants long before synthetic medicine was designed. Homeopathy closes the distance between healer and patient. A gap that some argue mainstream medicine not only created but continues to widen with it's tendency towards coldness and indifference to it's patients. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
