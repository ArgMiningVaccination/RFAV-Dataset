(2) Some of the procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 541/95 should therefore be adjusted but without departing from the general principles on which those procedures are based. (3) In consequence of the adoption of Directives 2001/ 82/EC and 2001/83/EC, which codified Community legislation in the field of veterinary medicinal products and medicinal products for human use respectively, references to provisions of that legislation should be updated. (1) OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67. (2) OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 1. (3) OJ L 55, 11.3.1995, p. 7. (4) OJ L 159, 3.6.1998, p. 31.(4) This Regulation should continue to apply also to the examination of applications for variation of the termsof a marketing authorisation granted under Council Directive 87/22/EEC ( 5) repealed by Directive 93/41/ EEC (6). (5) It is appropriate to provide for a simplified and rapidnotification procedure to enable the introduction of certain minor changes, which do not affect the approved quality, safety or efficacy of the product, without priorevaluation by the reference Member State. However, for other types of minor variation evaluation of the submitted documentation by the reference Member Stateshould still be required. (6) In cases where the evaluation procedure is maintained the reference Member State should evaluate the file on behalf of all Member States concerned in order to avoidduplication of work. (7) The various types of minor variation should be classifiedaccording to the conditions to be fulfilled in order to determine the procedure to follow; it is particularly necessary to give a precise definition of the type of minor variation for which no prior evaluation is needed. (8) It is necessary to clarify the definition of an 'extension'to a marketing authorisation, although it should still be possible to submit a separate, full application for amarketing authorisation for a medicinal product which has already been authorised, but under a different name and with a different summary of product characteristics. (5) OJ L 15, 17.1.1987, p. 38. (6) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 40.L 159/2 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union (9) It is appropriate to allow national authorities of the reference Member States to reduce the evaluation periodin urgent cases or to extend it in the case of a major variation entailing important changes. (10) The time-frame for the procedure to be followed where the competent authority imposes urgent safety restric- tions should be clarified. (11) Further clarification should be introduced as regardsrevision of the summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet/insert; nevertheless theprocedures laid down in this Regulation should not apply to changes to the labelling or to the package leaflet/insert which are not consequential to changes to the summary of product characteristics. (12) For the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to replace Regulation (EC) No 541/95. (13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are inaccordance with the opinion of the Standing Committeeon Medicinal Products for Human Use and the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Subject matter This Regulation lays down the procedure for the examination of notifications of and applications for variations to the terms of a marketing authorisation of medicinal products which have been considered within the scope of application of Directive 87/22/EEC, of medicinal products having benefited from the procedures of mutual recognition set out inArticles 17, 18 and 28(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC or Articles 21, 22 and 32(4) of Directive 2001/82/EC, and medicinal products for which there has been a referral to the procedures set out in Articles 32, 33 and 34 of Directive 2001/83/EC or Articles 36, 37 and 38 of Directive 2001/82/EC.

The urgent safety restriction shall be implemented within a timeframe, as agreed with the competent authorities. The corresponding variation application reflecting the urgent safety restriction, including appropriate documentation insupport of the change, shall be submitted immediately and in any case not later than 15 days after the initiation of the urgent safety restriction, to the competent authorities concerned for the application of the procedures set out in Article 6. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.Done at Brussels, 3 June 2003. For the Commission Erkki LIIKANEN Member of the CommissionThis paragraph is without prejudice to Article 36 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 40 of Directive 2001/82/EC. Article 10 Repeal Regulation (EC) No 541/95 is repealed. References to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation. Article 11 This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . It shall apply from 1 October 2003.27.6.2003 EN L 159/7 Official Journal of the European Union ANNEX I LIST AND CONDITIONS FOR MINOR VARIATIONS (TYPE IA AND IB) TO A MARKETING AUTHORIS- ATION AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLES 3 TO 5 Introductory statements The titles of the variations are numbered and subcategories depicted by letters and numbers in smaller font. The conditions necessary for a given variation to follow either a type IA or a type IB procedure are outlined for eachsubcategory and listed below each variation. To cover any other changes, it is necessary to submit applications for any consequential or parallel variations, which may be linked to the change applied for, at the same time and to clearly describe the relation between these variations. For notifications including a certificate of suitability from the European pharmacopoeia and when the variation concerns the dossier submitted for the certificate, the documentation required for this change is to be submitted to the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM). If the certificate is revised following evaluation of this change, any marketing authorisation concerned must be updated. In many cases this can be done through atype IA notification. A biological medicinal product is a product, the active substance of which is a biological substance. A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and for which a combination of physico-chemical-biological testing and the production process and its control is needed for its characterisation and the determination of its quality. As a result, the following shall be considered as biological medicinal products: immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood and human plasma as defined in Articles 1(4) and 1(10) ofDirective 2001/83/EC, respectively; immunological veterinary medicinal products as defined in Article 1(7) of Directive 2001/82/EC; medicinal products falling within the scope of part A of the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 ( 1); advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in part IV of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/ EC. A change in the manufacturing process of a non-proteinaceous component due to a subsequent introduction of a biotechnology step can be made in accordance with the provisions of variations type I No 15 or No 21 as appropriate. This specific variation is without prejudice to other variations listed in this Annex which can be applied in this particular context. Introduction of a proteinaceous component obtained through a biotechnology processlisted in part A of the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 in a medicinal product fall within the scope of said Regulation. Community legislation applicable to specific groups of products ( 2) shall be complied with. There is no need to notify the competent authorities of an updated monograph of the European pharmacopoeia or a national pharmacopoeia of a Member State in the case that compliance with updated monograph is implemented within 6 months of its publication and reference is made to the 'current edition' in the dossier of an authorisedmedicinal product. For the purposes of this document, test procedure has the same meaning as analytical procedure and limits have the same meaning as acceptance criteria. The Commission, in consultation with member states, the Agency and interested parties, will draw up and publish detailed guidance on the documentation to be submitted. (1) OJ L 214, 24.8.1993, p. 1.
