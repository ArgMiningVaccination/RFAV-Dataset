Central to the concerns is that the authors seem to have been too far out over their skis in asserting a link between the vitamin and the response to the infection. But as the EoC reveals, many of the potential problems can fairly be attributed to porous peer review as much as over-ambitious authors. The article, \"Vitamin D sufficiency, a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL reduced risk for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection,\" came from a group at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran and Boston University in the United States. According to the authors: Based on CDC criteria, among our study patients, 74% had severe COVID-19 infection and 32.8% were vitamin D sufficient. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was a significant association between vitamin D sufficiency and reduction in clinical severity, inpatient mortality serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and an increase in lymphocyte percentage. Only 9.7% of patients older than 40 years who were vitamin D sufficient succumbed to the infection compared to 20% who had a circulating level of 25(OH)D< 30 ng/ml. The significant reduction in serum CRP, an inflammatory marker, along with increased lymphocytes percentage suggest that vitamin D sufficiency also may help modulate the immune response possibly by reducing risk for cytokine storm in response to this viral infection. Therefore, it is recommended that improving vitamin D status in the general population and in particular hospitalized patients has a potential benefit in reducing the severity of morbidities and mortality associated with acquiring COVID-19. The paper caught some notice on social media, including this [lengthy post-publication analysis](https://twitter.com/GidMK/status/1310726774657966080) by Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist in Australia, who called the findings \"wildly unimpressive.\" After this article [ [1]] was published, concerns were raised about the validity of results and conclusions reported in the article and about undisclosed competing interests. Specifically, Concerns were raised about the reported study's sample size and whether it was adequate to address the aims of the study. Questions were raised about whether the statistical analyses and results were sufficiently robust to support the article's conclusions, and about how potential confounds were addressed in the data analyses. As one aspect of this, it was raised that vitamin D levels may be indicative of co-morbidities that may themselves impact COVID outcomes. There are statements in the article, including in its title and conclusions, that suggest a causal relationship between vitamin D levels and the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infections which is not supported by the data. Of the participants in the study, only 31.06% had RT-PCR tests confirming a COVID-19 diagnosis. As such, the COVID-19 status of other participants is in question, although in the article all are reported as patients with COVID-19. This is not taken into consideration in the subgroup analyses as reported in the article, and calls into question the overall interpretation of the results. The article's Competing Interests statement says, \"The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\" However, publicly available information indicates that corresponding author MFH may have potential competing interests that include non-financial interests based on his vitamin D research and other activities focused on vitamin D; contributions to an app that tracks vitamin D; and interests that include consultancies, funding support, and authorship of books related to vitamin D usage. The notice also includes a rebuttal from the researchers: The authors commented that the article did not claim a causal role of vitamin D on clinical outcomes, and that the limitations of the study were clearly described in the Discussion which said, \"we cannot explain the cause and effect relationship of vitamin D sufficiency and the reduced risk of severity from a COVID-19 infection.\" [ [1]] They also stated that COVID-19 diagnoses were made by infectious disease specialists per WHO interim guidance and recommendations of the Iranian National Committee of COVID-19 [ [2]]. We asked David Knutson, the senior manager for communications at PLOS, about the notice, and whether the peer review process might have identified some of the concerns prior to publication. He told us: Concerns raised via social media in late September prompted a reassessment of this article. Some of the scientific issues noted in the Expression of Concern were raised during peer review. However, we identified several concerns during our post-publication assessment and determined that this work, including aspects discussed during peer review, warrants further editorial consideration. We are currently following up on this case with high priority in light of the public health implications of the article's results.
