The \"Resolution on National Unity\" calls for unification to occur by Jan. 1, 2010. It was passed March 10, at ameeting of COCSA's board of directors. The resolution states that COCSA will merge its function with the resulting new association in order to create \"asingle national voice for the chiropractic profession.\" The resolution cites a number of reasons for the demand for unity. It states: The advancement of the profession depends upon resolution of issues of national scope; Two competing national associations prevent the chiropractic profession from speaking with one voice; The political and economic challenges facing the chiropractic profession have become too great and itsadversaries too strong to justify two competing nationalassociations; and The competition between two associations results in duplication of effort, waste of chiropractic resources, andperceived disunity. The resolution states: \"Be it resolved that the board of the Congress of Chiropractic State Associations demandsthat the ACA and the ICA set aside their philosophicaland political differences and begin the process of mergerfor the greater purpose of creating a single national voicefor the chiropractic profession.\" The board of directors also stated it would offer mediation, facilitation, or other support services to createa new unified national association.

How could we provide ongoing education without having the engineers travel long distances for each class? My plant did not suffer this problem alone. The Texas countryside at that time was dotted with small high schools that did not have the resources to offer advancedcourses in math or science. My company, as well as the high schools, came up with a solution: Install a large satellite dish and bringlearning to the students. Although distance learning is commonplace today, back then it wasn't. It required special, expensivehookups. Given the era, results were good. Students could see and hear the teacher deliver a lecture. Fast forward a few years. I attended a professional conference where new technology in distance learning was demonstrated. This new technology wasan interactive forum that used an infant Internet. The teacher typed information; students typed questions or answers. The delays in displaying information were painfully slow. But the forum was interactive. And teachers and students could send each other files electronically. The early chat rooms, bulletin boards, and forums did not resemble what you find on the Web today. Thanks to advances in technology, distance learning has come a long way. Teleseminars and videoconferencing are commonplace. And it is not unusualfor students of all ages to participate in online interactive tutorials. Even more fascinating and effective are Webcasts and Webinars. If you are unacquainted with this technology, I invite you to read our cover story,\"What's the word on Webinars?\" I predict this form of education will becomeincreasingly important to you in ways you may not even imagine today. I'm old enough to remember the very first live satellite communication broadcast from Europe. I hope I live long enough to see whatevercommunication changes are only an idea in today's kindergarten scientists.

LuckeyECONOMICSChiropractic DEDICATED TO PRACTICE GROWTH AND PROSPERITY SINCE 1954 Technology changes the way we learn. What advances will be next?Learning through technology VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007For years, chiropractors have attended seminars at universities,conferences, and clinics around the country. They take time away fromtheir practices, their patients, and theirfamilies to travel to and from theseeducational opportunities. If you do not have the time or chance to take part in live seminars, there are solutions. Webcasts, Webinars, and podcasts are three multimedia answers for chiropractors on the go. According to DCs who use them, these media typesare simple, cost-effective (for the most part), andpriceless in that they share new and updatedtechniques and practices. Chiropractic Economics pulled together experts familiar with these new media forms, and asked themabout the benefits and risks to DCs, as well as theirfuture effect on chiropractic as a whole. WHAT ARE THESE MEDIA? Webcasts, Webinars, and podcasts are called portmanteaus \u2014 new words formed by joining two others and combining their meanings. For example:\"smog\" is a portmanteau because it joins \"smoke\" and\"fog.\" Another example is \"brunch\" (\"breakfast\" and\"lunch\"). You get the idea. Webinar and Webcast both involve the World Wide Web. One word uses \"seminar,\" and the other uses\"broadcast,\" which means a Webinar is a seminarprovided over the Internet, and a Webcast is abroadcast delivered in the same manner. A Webinar is different from a Webcast in that a Web broadcast is a transmission of information without viewerinteraction, whereas a Web seminar is designed to beinteractive between the presenter and the audience.Podcasting, a portmanteau of Apple's \"iPod\" and \"broadcasting,\" is a method of publishing files to theInternet, allowing users to subscribe to a feed and receivenew files automatically by subscription, usually at no cost. In most cases, whether it is a Webinar or a Webcast, the viewer watches a PowerPoint presentation whilelistening to the audio of the speaker. A podcast,however, is audio only. A podcast with video is calledeither a vodcast or a vidcast (combining the words\"video\" and \"podcast\"). ANY BENEFITS? The benefits of this new technology are unlimited. The ease of message delivery, doctor/patient education,and practice research highlight just a small number ofadvantages of Webcasts, Webinars, and podcasts. Greg Clark is the seminar technical director for The Master's Circle (www.themasterscircle.com), aspecialized leadership training and practice-buildingorganization. Clark believes the convenience of thetechnology is one of the main benefits. \"The best part of combining the Internet and our Webinars is being able to offer convenient, instantaccess to information. Convenience, convenience,convenience,\" Clark says. \"It allows chiropractors to bemore efficient with their time, and to do more of whatthey're supposed to do \u2014 adjust people.\" Marilyn Gard, president of Clinic Pro Software, agrees. \"We do Webinars for software training and alsofor insurance billing classes. The big benefit is that theyare economical for attendees, since there is no traveltime involved or hotel costs.\" While being very informative, Webinars are very easy to find, join, and enjoy. According to LenSchwartz, DC, president of ChiroPractice MarketingSolutions, there's nothing to it. \"I collaborated with my partner, Chet Holmes, to create the first-ever chiropractic Webinar in 2004. Wewanted to teach doctors seven things they could do toWhat's the Word ON WEBINARS? How new technology can help your practice By John V. WoodCOVER STORYCHEC7p20.ps 4/12/07 10:01 AM Page 20create and maintain a financially successful practice,\" Schwartz says. \"There's nothing more [to a Webinar]than logging into a Web site, sitting back, andwatching the presentation unfold in front of your eyes.\" Clark goes on to say the benefit lies secondly with the technology. The true benefit is the message itself. \"The benefit is quite clear \u2014 the value of the content. The main advantage to the end user is not thetechnology; it just allows for convenience,\" Clark says.\"Without the value of the content, the technology isworthless. If you, as a DC, cannot afford to send yourstaff to a live educational seminar, you now have theability to share the quality content that the seminarprovided without breaking your budget.\" Another benefit of these new technology types is the increased reach of the individual message. MikeDorauche, DC, creator of the Planet Chiropracticpodcast, believes the additional reach of podcastingmakes what he does worthwhile \u2014 and even makeshim want to do more. \"The biggest thing for me, when I get an e-mail from someone stationed in Iraq who'sbeen able to listen to my information ... it justgets me motivated to do it more. I also get e-mails from chiropractic students in SouthAfrica, who are new to this stuff, andthey are really motivated,\"Dorauche says. \"I even got a voice mail last week from a chiro-practic patient in NewJersey, wanting to know howto distribute my podcast toother people \u2014 including herDC. The consumers want thisstuff, and we should give themwhat they want.\" RISKY BUSINESS? For the most part, experts believe there are absolutely no risks to this new technology. The only risk is not taking part in their benefit. Some Webinar presenters have experienced some bumps in the road,however. Gard says, \"The biggest detriment is that you have to sometimes mute folks,because they have background noise that gets CONTINUED VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 21 CHEC7p21.ps 4/12/07 10:02 AM Page C HIROPRACTIC VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007COVER STORY distracting. Of course, you can run into that same situation [noise] ifyou are holding a seminar in ahotel.\" Schwartz encountered more technical than informationalglitches when he started hisWebinars. \"The only bumps we've ever encountered are the occasionaltechnical bumps when someone'scomputer is loaded with Internetcookies or temporary files, and wehad to learn how to instruct thesepeople how to delete these files inorder to make room for the files theyare watching live on their screen,\"Schwartz says. \"Thankfully, we havenever received any skepticism, ordoubt from anyone coming onboard, about the success of ourteleclasses or other live Webcasts.\" IS HOSTING FOR YOU? Participating in a Webinar is easy \u2014 so easy that you may decidesome form of this media may beright for your patients. After all, if it's easy and convenient for youand your staff to learn via Webcastsor podcasts, couldn't you use thesemedia to teach your patients aboutchiropractic? Cost may be a roadblock, but it mainly depends on the level ofWebinar or podcast you want tocreate. Podcasting requires acomputer, audio-editing software,and a headset microphone. The next thing you need to do is find a company to host yourcomputer files. Depending on thesize of your files and the amount ofpodcasts you want to create,relatively inexpensive hosting canbe found. Webcasts and Webinars are much more involved, because they requirecompanies that actually facilitateyour presentation. The Master'sCircle, for example, hires a freelancevideo production company to recordall of their seminars. The companyturns them around in three or fourweeks for Internet viewing. Clark says, \"This is not an inexpensive process, and that'sbecause of the cutting-edgeproduction value and accessibilitywe provide. We want to make ourWebcast experience the bestpossible one for chiropractors andour other members.\" Aside from the financial cost, the investment of man-hours alsofactors into these technologicalmediums. Time spent away fromyour practice and your family issomething to be expected whencreating your own Webinars orpodcasts. \"In my experience, it takes roughly about 200 hours ofpreparation, research, and work inputting together the presentationitself \u2014 not to mention finding thesite and getting the Webinarhosting taken care of,\" Schwartz I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007COVER STORY says. \"If you want a quality presentation, it takes your own time to put it together.\" EDUCATIONAL RECRUITMENT The educational value of this new technology cannot be beat. Sherman College of StraightChiropractic has been using Webcasts, Webinars, andpodcasts to inform prospective students since 2006. Karen Rhodes, Sherman's director of public relations, says there are several reasons why the collegechose the Webinar format. \"We chose the Webinar format because we wanted to do something more interactive than just text on thepage. We chose the topic of straight chiropracticbecause we wanted a way to educate our prospectivestudents up front about Sherman College's philosophy,\"Rhodes says. \"We've also found we can use this Webinar as an orientation tool to explain the college's philosophy to some enrolling students who may not bevery familiar with straight chiropractic.\" Sherman has also branched out to include several technological mediums to increase the efficiency oftheir philosophical message. The college has includedpodcasts, Webcasts, and blogs. \"We've found our student bloggers to be very helpful in the recruiting process. They give prospectivestudents a realistic look at the day-to-day life of aSherman student,\" Rhodes says. \"The bloggers writeabout classes, social events, their hobbies and interests,the Spartanburg area, chiropractic, and more.\" One of Sherman's next projects will be student podcasts and perhaps even vodcasts. In the springquarter, Sherman will begin using an instant-messagingprogram on its admissions page, allowing for live, online CONTINUED CIRCLE 113FREE INFORMATIONCHEC7p24.ps 4/12/07 10:05 .COM VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007chats between prospective students and admissions counselors duringseveral set times throughout the day. WHICH TOPICS WORK BEST? Like Schwartz's Webinar, topics such as practice building or marketing work very well in theseformats. Educational topics such asnew subluxation techniques orimproved office management alsowork well. Dorauche helps improve the knowledgebase of the viewer/listener shouldbe a guaranteed hit. \"In my experience, topics that are anything 'how to' are big. Thingsthat help doctors grow their office,get motivated, and get up everymorning happy to see their amazingly popular,\" Dorauchesays. \"These re-energizing topicswork wonders for morale.\"\"We've really been able to, over the last two and a half years put onWebinars for over easily 1,200chiropractors at this point, andwe've received tremendousamounts of positive feedback,\"Schwartz says. \"Not only forputting on the presentation itself,but also being able to get thisinformation out to chiropractors.\" ARCHIVING Another side benefit of Internet- based broadcasting is the ability toarchive your files. Keep topicsactive for longer periods of time,and Dorauche says people willexponentially receive more of thebenefits. \"Some most popular CIRCLE 178FREE I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007COVER STORY podcasts at Planet Chiropractic are more than eight years old. Thatshows the total importance ofhaving an archive situation,\"Dorauche says. LIVE SEMINARS NOT THREATENED The availability of Webcasts, Webinars, and podcasts are not a substitute for attending liveseminars, says Clark. \"More people will buy a concert CD than actually go to the concert.This is the same thing, but itdoesn't replace seeing the band liveand in person,\" Clark says. \"There'sabsolutely nothing like a liveseminar experience. [Webinars]don't replace the experience; theyjust enhance the dissemination ofthe information.\" Clark goes on to say that attendees can never take enoughnotes, or never glean all theinformation provided from the liveseminar. Webinars and Webcastsallow people who have attended theactual seminar to weed out theinformation they don't need, watchclasses or teachers they really enjoyedagain, and also refer employees topertinent sections they need toreview in order to complement orimprove their education. With everything being easier, more convenient and moreaccessible via the Internet, ourexperts all agree \u2014 don't replacethe live experience with Webcasts,Webinars, and podcasts.

With distance education technologies progressing at a rapid rate and state boards accepting alternative methods of delivery, you can choose from hundreds ofclasses. But before you sign up for an online class orteleseminar, do your homework. Researching thecontent and delivery method is useful, but knowingyour learning style will help you select the classdelivery method most effective for you. To answer effectively which method is best for you, analyze your personal learning style to decipher whateducation environment will be successful for you.Recognizing and understanding your own learning styleallows you to implement successful learning techniques. A number of different types of learning-style inventories have been developed throughout the years,which help identify an individual's learningpreferences: Visual (spatial): Pictures, graphics, and spatial understandings; Speech and Logic, reasoning, and systems; Social (interpersonal): Collaboration with others; and Solitary (intrapersonal): Working alone. Individuals do not necessarily have just one learning style, but rather a mix with one being more dominant.And, depending upon the situation, the dominant stylemay change. Once you know your learning style, you can better evaluate which CE class format is conducive to yourstyle. If your dominant learning style is social, verbal, oraural, a class with no interaction between you, theinstructor, or fellow students may not be the best choice.Select one that allows you to share ideas or conceptswith others via chat, telephone, or discussion boards. If your style is solitary, you may want to avoid programs that force interaction with others throughrole-playing or group activities. For those with visual orphysical as a dominant style, select a class that includesimages, graphics, and exercises allowing you to practiceyour new skills.

Learning method categories Distance learning methods generally fall into two categories \u2014 asynchronous and synchronous. Asynchronous. Asynchronous classes allow only one-way communication and are presented with a time delay; therefore, live interaction between students and instructors is not permitted. Examplesof asynchronous distant learning delivery methods are Webcasts,podcasts, video classes, and self-paced online classes. Synchronous. By contrast, synchronous classes are live and permit two-way communication and interaction between students andinstructors. Examples of synchronous distance learning delivery methodsare Webinars, teleseminars, videoconferencing, and chatting.

Why?Because people are taking advantage ofthis convenient form of education. As of publication, 38 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, accept some online credits. New Jersey is the only state not requiring continuingeducation for relicensure. Since 2006, states such as Oklahoma and Tennesseehave increased the number of required CE hours \u2014from 12 to 16 per year in Oklahoma and from 12 to 24per year in Tennessee. However, Oklahoma does notaccept online CEs yet and Tennessee only accepts sixhours online. In addition, three states decreased the number of accepted online CEs compared to last year. Alabamanow offers six hours of online CEs instead of 18; inIowa, 36 hours instead of 60; and in Washington, 12hours instead of 25.

An IDP is a formal, written plan that identifies an employee's learning and developmental goals. This plan contains the training, education, and developmentactivities (formal and informal) needed to acquire thecompetencies to provide employees with careeropportunities. An IDP is a way to organize and set priorities for learning and development experiences that will helpemployees: Improve performance in their current work assignment or area of responsibility; Assist in acquiring competencies for improving their skills in their job; Prepare for another job or position within the practice; and Prepare for increased responsibility. HOW DO IDPs BENEFIT YOU? Using an IDP doesn't just benefit the team member \u2014 it benefits you as well. High-performing companiesand practices use IDPs to work with their employees toestablish objectives that support both their needs andthe needs and goals of their employees. An IDP gives the employee a clear guide for working toward long-term personal and practice goals. It also givesyou a chance to channel the employee's efforts in waysthat help your practice achieve its goals and mission. IDPs can be used: As a planning tool to set training priorities; To identify future skill and competency needs; To compare an individual's current ability with required job competencies; To identify their organizational developmental needs; and As a budgeting tool to assess the level of financial resources needed to fulfill employee developmentalgoals, training needs, and seminars. Benefits to you include: Identifying and assessing future developmental needs in required competency areas; Providing structured learning experiences linked to practice needs, goals, and job requirements; and Establishing an agreed-upon set of learning objectives and developmental activities as part of aformal career development program. IDPs are an excellent tool that you can use to develop and motivate your staff. By encouraging afocused approach to their training/developmentalneeds, you can help employees enhance their job skillsand become more effective and productive. Organizations that use IDPs also send a clear message to their employees that they view each person'sprofessional development as a priority. If done properly\u2014 with sincerity and follow-through \u2014 IDPs tend tobe an effective motivator for most employees. WHAT IS YOUR ROLE? Your role in the IDP process is to provide information employees need to plan realistically and to guide them CONTINUED INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS How to fine-tune your staff's performance By Kathy Mills Chang and Kevin Harkins Training is one of the most important tools you have to assure a high-performanceteam.

To reach this common goal, you should help employees: Understand the IDP process and its purpose; Identify their strengths and weaknesses in performing theircurrent work assignments; Identify areas in which they can take greater responsibility; Find possibilities for career progress in their current jobs; Obtain access to learning resources; and Find both traditional and nontraditional learningopportunities, as well as traditionaltraining opportunities. Learningopportunities may be a mix oftraining and experiential learning.Besides formal training in aclassroom setting (the commonand costly option), other excellentdevelopmental opportunities includecoaching, mentoring, self-directedstudies, shadowing, distance learningthrough the Internet, cross-training,and exposure to supervisoryresponsibilities. It's especially important to keep close track of planned activities withnew employees and meet with themregularly to discuss the plan, reviewprogress, and identify any changes. Be alert for changes in the work, resources, technology, or the workenvironment that make itnecessary to adjust IDPs. WHAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S ROLE? Employees typically initiate the IDP process for career progression and personal development. Expectthem to take charge of their ownlearning and development andparticipate actively in planninggoals and how they will meet them. Specifically, your employees should: Assess their existing skills, competencies, and interests; Set goals and objectives that will benefit your practice, as well asenhance their career; Research ways of meeting personal career goals andenhancing work performance; Complete the IDP forms; Identify developmental opportunities; and Evaluate their progress and keep you informed.

Busy employees typically lack the time to wade through a mountainof material on the subject. Thebottom line is each employeeshould be responsible fordeveloping the substance of theirown IDP and then gettingagreement on its contents with you. Although you don't have to use a specific form, having one greatlyfacilitates the process if it helps theemployee assess their needs andcommit them to paper. Use the IDPto match the individual's currentskill levels, strengths, and develop-mental needs with your goals. The best way to make that happen is to: 1. Integrate the IDP into your formal performance appraisal cycle;Example of a development plan Constructing an individualized development plan is easy when you know the competencies you are planning to train. For example, let's consider that the person we are training is an insurance specialist. Below is an example of several possible competencies and how we might begin a written training plan for them. INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN: INSURANCE SPECIALIST IDP Item Outline various patient-collection phone call dialogues and rehearse them with another team member. Find and attend classes specific to chiropractic billing, offered locally by your Medicare carrier. Gather and review monthly bulletins from your Medicare carrier and organize them in a binder for easy reference.

SOME FINAL THOUGHTS Some management experts have become critical of IDPs in recentyears, arguing that IDPs are oftenineffective because they typicallyfocus too much on addressingemployee weaknesses, with themisguided expectation that everyemployee can master allcompetencies and become perfectlywell-rounded. If an employee has no talent in a given area, they argue, a trainingcourse is not going to rewire hisbrain to make that nontalent into anew strength. It can be argued, however, that far from discouraging anyone frompreparing an IDP , such observationsshould simply help employeesprepare more effective ones. The keyis to identify the kinds of trainingand developmental opportunitiesthat will boost each employee'sperformance most effectively. The ideal IDP should primarily focus on: Leveraging each employee's strengths/talents; and Providing new skills and know- ledge that will help the employeeperform better in his job.

Small- and mid-sized businesses are at a distinct disadvantage as they are usually unable to offer or manage comprehensive employee training and professionaldevelopment programs that larger companies present.Still, implementing training programs can significantlyfurther your company's growth potential and profitability. Besides the direct financial impact to your business' bottom-line, investing in employee training programsresults in other benefits. Training programs can: Increase employee skill levels. Increasing skill levels can positively affect performance and productivityin your employees and provide them with valuable toolsto manage their activities more effectively. Boost employee satisfaction. If your current employees are satisfied, you defer the need to recruit,hire, and train new ones \u2014 which can add costs toyour business. Reduce employer liability. You, as an employer, are at risk for a myriad of lawsuits, includingdiscrimination, wrongful termination, and sexualharassment. You are less likely to face these situations ifyour employees and managers know their rights andresponsibilities. Training helps reduce the risk of inappropriate behavior and the resulting lawsuits, while increasingproductivity and employee satisfaction. CREATIVE TRAINING METHODS Some businesses have a misconception that training is costly, but any business can provide its workforcewith the necessary tools to succeed. Depending on theinvestment level you can or want to make, severaldifferent training options are available. Conduct in-house training. The most accessible training resource you have is your own workforce. Youcan conduct in-house training sessions led byemployees with remarkable skills in specific areas.

Join an association. By joining a local business association, you may yield new avenues oftraining options, includinggovernment-sponsored seminars. Work with a professional employee organization (PEO). PEOs can provide small- andmedium-size businesses with full-service human-resource payroll activities. PEOs are to help throughemployment-related situations withspecialists ranging from human-resource management advisors tocrisis-management counselors. Most PEOs also offer training programs that can increase youremployee productivity, with someoffering specialized developmentprograms with benefits such asonline and in-person trainingsessions, including pre-employmentand hiring, regulatory compliance,workplace safety, and legalterminations. Regardless of which training options you implement, there is aclear correlation betweenproductivity and training. In orderto survive the unexpected and alltoo frequent shifts in business, it isnecessary for you to have a well-prepared workforce. Training strengthens your employee's knowledge base,increases core skills that yieldhigher levels of productivity,creates a sense of loyalty and well-being within the company, and isan added benefit to help youmaintain and attract qualifiedindividuals. Carlos Rodriguez is the president of ADP TotalSource, a ProfessionalEmployer Organization (PEO). He canbe VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007PRACTICE MANAGEMENT SUCCESS FILE Employer-sponsored training can provide numerous benefits. It can: Aid in recruitment. Studies indicate that employer-sponsored training is a major attraction for employees entering the workforce or deciding whetherto remain in their current position. Encourage employee retention. Trained employees who have the skills to deliver needed services,feel they are contributing to the practice, and arerecognized by management are less likely to look foranother job. Spur innovation. Untrained employees seldom look for better ways of doing things. By training youremployees to hone their skills and boost theirefficiency, they'll be more likely to seek innovativeways of making your practice more successful. Be highly appealing. \"Training as a perk appeals to employees who value professional development andexcellence \u2014 the ones who will be especially importantto your organization's success in a talent-driveneconomy,\" says Lin Grensing-Popal, author of MotivatingToday's Employees . Justify higher salaries. Training enables employees whose salaries have \"maxed out\" for theircurrent position to move up to higher paying positions. Project a positive image for your organization. Knowledgeable, well-trained employees are highly effective \"ambassadors\" for your practice. Improve profitability. Companies listed in Fortune Magazine's annual \"100 Best Companies To Work For\" provide an average of 40 days of training per employee peryear. As far as impact to the bottom line, firms in the topquarter of training expenditure per employee (averaging$1,595 per year) had profit margins 24 percent higher thanthose in the bottom quarter (averaging $128 per year). Hard learned lesson: Some say they can't afford to train because of the expense and because better-trained, more highly skilled employees may decide toleave for better opportunities. That's true. But trainingnew employees and having them leave is not nearly asbad as not training them \u2014 and having them stay. Bob Levoy's newest book, 222 Secrets of Hiring, Managing and Retaining Great Employees in Healthcare Practices, is published by Jones and Bartlett Publishers. He can be reached at b.levoy@att.net.Training pays off Enjoy improved morale and more profits By Bob Levoy Role playing is one of many ways to enable your employees to learn new jobs and skills \u2014 and it is simple to do. What does your receptionist say to a patient who replies, \"I forgot my checkbook?\" How does your staffrespond to an irate patient? In such cases, is everyonefollowing a similar script and is what they're saying thebest response? If not, role playing may help. Role playing is a training technique in which two participants are assigned different roles (such asreceptionist and patient) that mimic everydayoccurrences (such as those above). The two act out the situation, improvising as they go, while the rest observe. Later, everyone critiques whatwas said and brainstorms for improvement. The rolescan then be reversed or assigned to others and caninclude any number of scenarios such as a disgruntled,demanding, argumentative, or extremely anxiouspatient. A few ground rules: Make critiques impersonal by using fictitious names or simply referring to them as\"patient\" and \"staff member.\" After the role play, askthe \"patient\" how he or she felt about the \"staffmember's\" response and ask the group how they mighthave handled the situation differently. Vote on the best ways to respond in these situations and use them as models for future encounters. The objective is to make everyone aware of the skill and diplomacy needed in these situations, agree on thebest response, and then practice saying it in anonthreatening environment. Done properly, it can be alot of fun and a great learning experience.Develop skills through role-play training VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007PRACTICE MANAGEMENT CODING QUESTIONS I am not sure what CPT - ICD9 code linking and pointing is. Can you explain? In order for your services to be consideredreimbursable, many insurance companies wantyour CPT codes to be compatible or \"link\" to your ICD9 codes. Many carriers also want to see yourCPT codes \"point\" to the most appropriate ICD9 codeson the CMS-1500 claim form. To understand how to become an expert at linking and pointing, you'll need to become more familiar withthe \"anatomy\" of the CMS-1500 claim form, especiallyboxes 24D, 24E, and 21. Box 24D of the CMS-1500 claim form is for CPT (and HCPCS) codes. Box 24E is for the diagnosis reference number(s) 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they relate to the four diagnosis codepositions in Box 21. Box 24E is labeled \"diagnosis pointer.\" This is one of the revisions that took place with the creation of thenew CMS-1500 Claim Form (08/05). Do not enter ICD9 codes in Box 24E. They should be entered in Box 21. A written description of yourdiagnosis codes in Box 21 is not necessary. You shouldtry and fill all four positions in Box 21 (but only ifclinically indicated). Figure 1 gives an example.In figure 2, Box 24D indicates that a patient received a chiropractic manipulative treatment(98940), mechanical traction (97012), and manualtherapy techniques that CPT codes 98940 and 97012 are linked to diagnosis codes 723.1 (cervical pain) and739.1 (cervical segmental dysfunction/subluxation),and these CPT codes are pointing to these two ICD9codes by using diagnosis reference numbers 1 and 2. Box 24E also indicates that CPT code 97140-59 are linked to diagnosis codes 724.2 (lumbar pain) and847.2 (lumbar sprain/strain) and are pointing byusing diagnosis reference numbers 3 and 4. Hundreds of CPT - ICD9 code pointing and linking combinations exist. Do your best to learn about thisvery important aspect of billing and coding.

The basic rule to follow is this: Hourly employees must be paid overtime for any hours worked over 40 inone week, and salaried employees are exempt fromovertime pay. However, a few exceptions to this generalrule exist. Federal and state regulations regulate employee classification and overtime exemptions. All businessesare required to follow the one that is most beneficial to the employee if there is a conflict between the two. In 2004, the federal government made modifications tojob classifications, which may also have an impact inthe way you classify your staff. The problem in many offices is this: The CA receives a salary position classification withoutfollowing the established guidelines to see if he or sheactually qualifies. The perceived benefit to classifyingall of your staff as salaried is there would be noovertime expenses. However, to properly claim theovertime salary exemption, the work performed must fitinto the rules provided in the regulations. Job titles alone do not determine exemption. In order for an exemption to apply, an employee's specific job duties and salary must meet all therequirements outlined in the Department of Labor'sregulations. Violations can lead to penalties andpayments for lost wages. Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act(FLSA) provides the information related to exemptionsfrom overtime pay for employees employed as bona fideexecutive, administrative, professional, and outsidesales employees. 1 The most common classification for salary exemption applicable to CAs within the chiropracticoffice would be the administrative professional.However, to qualify for the administrative employeeexemption, all of the following must be met: The employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate notless than $455 per week; The employee's primary duty must be the performance of office or nonmanual work directlyrelated to the management or general businessoperations of the employer or the employer's customers;and The employee's primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. 2 The first criteria is pretty clear: You either pay that amount ($455) or not. The other two are somewhat subjective, but the wiggle room for interpretation isvery small and will always defer to the employee'sbenefit, if challenged. In reviewing the second (nonmanual labor), it appears to generally fit within the CA's delegated dutieswithin the chiropractic office and should not be amajor factor in the classification process. The third one (discretion) appears to be the major factor in determining the CA's job classification. Tounderstand the department's interpretation of thephrase \"exercise of discretion and independentjudgment,\" visit the Department of Labor's Web site(www.dol.gov) and click on \"wages.\" If you determine your CA is an hourly employee and overtime is due, there is one last factor to consider \u2014To pay or not to pay (overtime) By Steven Conway, DC, DACBOH, JD, Esq.

Section13(a)(1) 68VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 69FINANCES If you have procrastinated writing a living will, think \"Theresa MarieSchiavo.\" Out of the almost interminable news coverage of the lingering death of Theresa Marie Schiavo, one image from a newspaper photo stands out: Demonstratorsoutside the home of Ms. Schiavo's husband carryingpickets saying, \"No Living Will = Feeding Tube.\" Whatever their motivations, the demonstrators correctly pointed out that under Florida law, as in most states, apatient who cannot speak for herself is presumed to wantto be kept alive by artificial feeding and hydration. In the Schiavo case, the presumption was ultimately, painfully, and expensively overcome by Florida courtdecisions. The courts' determination, which was appealednumerous times and challenged by the U.S. Congress, was that Ms. Schiavo's intent was not to continue living in the circumstances in which she found herself \u2014 a vegetative state with no reasonable hope of recovery. Which of us would want ourselves, our families, or our loved ones to go through this experience? In New York and in almost all states, the law sets forth a clear and simple procedure to be followed in order for aperson to effectively document his or her intent withrespect to medical treatment while incapacitated. Thislegal instrument is called a living will \u2014 or, in somestates, a healthcare directive. You can download a living-will form from the Internet or obtain it at hospitals. A living will is a completely personal statement and does not have to follow a particular format or define in any particular way either the medical circumstances inwhich it becomes operative (such as, \"If I should be in anincurable or irreversible mental or physical condition withno reasonable expectation of recovery), or the proceduresand treatment to be withheld in these circumstances(such as antibiotics, surgery, or respiratory support). The one rule which must be universally followed in preparing a living will is that if you want artificial feedingand hydration to be withheld, you must expressly say so. Tube feeding is considered to be in a separate category from other forms of medical treatment, and it requires anexpress and specific statement of intent in order to belegally withheld or withdrawn. This (and the fact thathuge political forces mobilized to keep the woman alive)is why the Schiavo case was so difficult. Legally, the requirement that the intention to forego tube feeding be specifically stated raises a particularlyhigh bar for the patient's family to overcome in court. PROXY ALSO NEEDED A living will does not stand alone. It is simply a statement of intention. It must be accompanied by aseparate document (or a separate part of the samedocument) known as a healthcare proxy, or healthcarepower of attorney. The healthcare proxy appoints an agent to act on behalf of the person signing it in connection with allhealthcare decisions. The agent's authority only becomesoperative when the person who signed the proxy is unable to make his or her own healthcare decisions (for example, if the person is comatose). The person named as agent is to be guided by the statement of intention in the living will, as well as by theagent's general knowledge of the wishes and philosophyof the patient. Since the enactment of HIPAA (HealthInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), itis recommended that the Healthcare Proxy specificallygive to the agent the authority to request, receive, andreview any medical records. When prepared correctly and customized to your individual wishes, a living will and a healthcare proxycan go a long way towards avoiding the Schiavocontroversy in your family. David B.

Mandell, JD, MBA; Celia R. VOL53: I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007FINANCES FINANCE & TAXES Few will admit it, but almost every chiropractor thinks abouteventually leaving the profession. Leaving, though, depends on having an exit strategy that deals with capital gains (or losses) on your terms. TYPES OF SALES In general, you can sell ownership of an incorporated chiropractic practice by either selling or redeeming the owner's stock or by selling corporate assets: Selling stock. This is probably easier than a redemption or asset sale, but buyers may not pay asmuch for stock as they would for the incorporatedchiropractic practice's assets \u2014 since liabilitiesgenerally remain with the stock. Redemption. A redemption is payment from the corporation in exchange for some or all of theprincipal's shares. A redemption is often preferable when the buyer has limited cash or borrowing ability and the owner doesnot want to finance the sale because corporate fundsare used to redeem an owner's stock. A combined sale-redemption transaction can also be used to bring a new owner into the practice without anexisting principal withdrawing. Asset sales. Unlike a sale or redemption, in which ownership of the corporation is transferred fromthe shareholder to the purchaser or remainingshareholders, an asset sale involves transferring practiceassets from the corporation to the purchaser. The shareholders retain ownership of the corporation. However, after the assets are sold, the corporation oftendistributes the sales proceeds along with any remainingassets to the owner in a complete liquidation. Buyers often prefer to purchase assets to protect themselves from existing liabilities and to be able toallocate the purchase price to assets rather than stock. Insome cases, buyers may prefer to acquire stock becausecertain intangibles (name recognition, franchise, orfavorable contracts) would not be transferred otherwise. Selling corporate assets, though, usually has a high tax cost for the owner because it generates corporate-level gain or loss. If the sale proceeds (net of corporate-level tax paid) are distributed to the owner orliquidated, the owner recognizes capital gain or loss,based on the amount of this distribution compared tohis or her stock basis. Thus, getting the sales proceeds to the owner usually creates two levels of tax. For those owners with a lowbasis in their stock and facing many practice assets thathave appreciated significantly, the tax bill can be high. OTHER, LESS-TAXING OPTIONS Although selling or redeeming stock or selling assets are common ways to exit a practice, you have other,less-taxing, options: ESOP . An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) can be used to raise funds for an incorporatedchiropractic practice \u2014 or to purchase part or all of theprincipal's shares of stock. The purchase of the owner'sshare is treated as an outright sale of the chiropracticoperation's stock, and the owner treats the proceeds ascapital gains or losses. From the practice's standpoint, an ESOP is much like a fringe benefit for employees. The chiropractic practicecan distribute profits in the form of dividends and,unlike dividends to regular shareholders, claim a taxdeduction for these distributions. In fact, the practicetreats all contributions to its ESOP , even amounts usedto pay the principal on loans that were incurred topurchase employer securities, as a deduction \u2014 at leastto the extent those distributions don't exceed 25percent of the compensation paid to participants. FLP . A Family Limited Partnership (FLP) is simply a limited partnership consisting of members of a family.A limited partnership has both general partners (theones who actually run the partnership) and limitedpartners (who are passive or uninvolved investors). General partners have unlimited personal liability for partnership obligations, while limited partners haveno liability beyond their capital contributions. Typically, FLPs are formed by the older generation, who contributes assets to the partnership in return forboth general partnership units and limited partnershipunits. The parents can then embark on a plan of givingunlimited partnership units to their children andgrandchildren while retaining the general partnershipunits that actually control the partnership.An exit strategy for all occasions By Mark E. I SSUE 7 M AY4, 2007FINANCES The result: The parents can retain control of the business and draw salary or wages from it, whilesharing the profits with otherfamily members who are taxed onthose profits at a lower tax rate. Although the IRS sometimes challenges FLPs in the courts, thatshould not deter you to transferyour practice, or its income, tofamily members. None of the IRSchallenges have been successful ineliminating FLPs, nor have theyseverely affected any practice thatclosely adhered to the rules. Although many closely-held corporations have buy/sellagreements already in place toprovide a mechanism for valuingand purchasing the shares of adeceased or disabled shareholder(or a shareholder whoseemployment with the corporationis terminating), few provide for theretirement of the chiropractor,partner, or principal shareholder. Utilizing an ESOP to gradually transfer the practice to employees,a FLP to transfer the practice tofamily members, or another tax-favored strategy recommended byyour advisors will ensure that thepractice you worked so hard tobuild and run will provide thefunds necessary for retirement. The alternative is a fire-sale of the abandoned practice's assets anda high tax bill. Mark E.

Many r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, especially forpeople who have had a number ofprofessional positions, cannot belimited in this way. Quantity is notas important as quality. What other information should I include in my r\u00e9sum\u00e9? Include information about your education and work background.Highlight special training andchiropractic techniques in whichyou have taken classes. Don't forgetto mention any practice-management training or seminarsyou have attended. Should I include references in my r\u00e9sum\u00e9? What should Iexclude from the r\u00e9sum\u00e9? Most experts suggest that you not include: A photo; Personal information (hobbies, marital status, children, religiousaffiliations); or References. (Provide these when requested on a separate sheet, anddon't forget to ask the referrer first.) Do I have to print my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter on fancy paper?Should I go to a copy place andhave the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 professionallyprinted? What is printed on the page is important, not the paper or printing.Everything needs to be neat, error-free, and professional-looking, butyou don't need expensive paper or tospend money on printing. Should I include a cover letter with my r\u00e9sum\u00e9? What should it say? You should always include a cover letter with any importantcorrespondence, including a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.The cover letter draws the readerinto the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, explains why youare sending it, and is part of theselling device. The cover lettershould be laid out in four parts(each with a separate paragraph): 1. Describe why you are writing (to apply for a scholarship, torespond to an ad for an associateposition, etc.). 2. Point out how your experience and education fit theposition. Your main purpose in thiscover letter is to get the person toread your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. 3. Discuss any personal characteristics that can't be includedin a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, such as your social skillsor your background working withchildren. Include any personalinformation the reader might needto know, such as your availability orwillingness to relocate. 4. Finally, close with a statement expressing interest in the position orscholarship, and indicate the bestway to contact you. Even if you haveincluded your contact information atthe top of the letter, include it again(e-mail address, phone, and cellphone) here. Go to the Resourcesection on studentDC.com to seesample r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters. Can I send r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to search for a position that's notadvertised? Certainly. Many students have found positions in specific areas bysending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to DCs andfollowing up with a phone call. One final note: Before you send your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter,proofread them carefully.
