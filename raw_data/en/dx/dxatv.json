According to health experts , our collective actions have had a positive impact. Hospitalizations for COVID -19 infected patients in San Francisco have been stable for several weeks. However, the vast majority of t he population remains susceptible to infection, and there is not yet an effective treatment or cure for the disease. San Francisco is working on building up its testing, case findi ng, case investigation and contact tracing capacity. While that happens, it is imperative that the City extend the duration of its stay -at-home or der. At the same time, we can ease restrictions on some activities with a lower risk of spreading the virus. The City will continue to strictly apply the Order consistent with its stated intent, and you must strictly follow it. The answers to frequently asked questions below should guide your compliance. The City will keep updating this information to align with the best public health practices and any changes to the Order as circumstances evolve. We have a path forward. Everyone needs to continue to pull together \u2014and together we will get through this. STAY SAFE AT HOME EXPLAINED What does the Order do? Effective at 11:59 p.m. on May 17 , 2020, a new Order (\"May 17 Order\") goes into effect that replaces the existing stay -at-home order (\"May 4 Order\") . The May 17 Order requires that most people continue sheltering in their place of residence. But the May 4 Order and May 17 Order made a number of significant changes to the original stay -at- home order , which are highlighted below: Essential Businesses: Under the May 4 Order, all construction projec ts can resume, provided they comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols issued as part of the Order. Commercial as well as residential real estate transactions are allowed to fully resume, but with continued restrictions on in -person viewings and appointments. Under the May 4 Order, childcare establishments, and other educational and recreational programs can operate to provide care and supervision for children to allow all persons who are working in essential businesses or outdoor businesses or performing minimum basic operati ons to access childcare. All of these operations must comply , to the greatest extent possible, with restrictions specified in the Order, including that they be carried out in stable groups of 12 or fewer children. This category is also subject to the Stat e's Shelter in Place Order, but the Health Officer will assess whether to ease childcare restrictions further in coordination with the State and as the spread of COVID -19 is further contained. Rev. 5/18/2020 2 Outdoor Businesses: Outdoor Businesses (as defined in the Ord er and described below) are allowed to continue to operate, and people are allowed to v isit them to perform work or to obtain goods, services, or supplies. Outdoor Businesses are those that normally operated primarily outdoors prior to the Shelter in Place Orders, and where social distancing of at least six feet can be maintained between all people. These include outdoor retail businesses like nurseries, outdoor service providers like landscapers, and agricultural operations. Outdoor businesses do not include outdoor restaurants, cafes, or bars. Retail Stores and Supporting Businesses: Under the May 17 Order , a new category of businesses is added called Additional Businesses. So long as the COVID -19 indicators continue to improve and the Health Offic er determines that the situation supports more activity, more businesses will be phased in over time, based on the health related risk of those businesses and with appropriate new safety precautions, as part of the City's economic recovery. With input fro m stakeholders, the City is in the process of developing a specific phasing economic recovery plan. Under the first phase of Additional Businesses, beginning May 18 , retail stores may operate for curbside pickup of goods, sub ject to certain conditions, and people are allowed to visit these stores to perform work or to obtain goods, services, or supplies. Also beginning May 18 , businesses that manufacture the goods sold at these retail stores are also permitted to operate, as are businesses that provide warehousing and logistical support to these retail stores. Outdoor Museums , Outdoor Historical Sites, and Public Gardens: Under the May 17 Order , a new category of activities is added called Additional Activities. So long as the COVID -19 indicators continue to improve and the Health Officer determines that the situation supports more activity, more permitted activities will be phased in over time based on their health related risks and with appropriate new safety precautions. Under the May 17 Order , outdoor museums , outdoor historical sites, and public gardens (e.g., the Botanical Gardens) may operate , subject to certain conditions, and people are allowed to travel to visit them . Social Distancing Protocols for Businesses: All business facilities operating in the County, including businesses carrying out minimum basic operations, must comply with the requirement to create a Social Rev. 5/18/2020 3 Distancing Protocol. (Note: construction activities must instead comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols.) In their Social Distancing Protocols, businesses must now ensure that personnel and customers wear face coverings when entering their facilities (except those customers for whom face coverings are not recommended, like young children). All existing Social Distancing Protocols must be updated to reflect the new requirements. We encourage businesses that are not yet allowed to operate to focus o n planning to effectively implement social distancing and related measures in their facilities so they are ready to safely reopen when allowed. Essential Activities and Travel : All residential moves are now allowed to proceed. Recreation: The new Order allows use of shared outdoor recreational facilities that do not encourage gathering or contain high -touch equipment. However, everyone must follow any restrictions that either state or local authorities impose. COVID -19 Indicators : The Health Officer w ill consider easing or expanding restrictions based on progress we collectively achieve on several key indicators described in the new Order and referred to as the COVID -19 Indicators. No Expiration Date: The May 17 Order does not have an expiration date; that is, the stay -safe-at- home restrictions will not expire on May 31. The Health Officer will continually monitor the COVID -19 indicators to determine whether any changes are needed, including allowing more businesses a nd activities in a planned, incremental way over time, or restricting businesses and activities if need be due to a surge in COVID -19 cases or an adverse change in the COVID -19 indicators. And the Health Officer will ultimately determine when health condi tions support terminating the order; while it is anticipated that more business and other activity will be allowed over time, termination of the order is not anticipated for many months. (Amended 4/29/2020 , 5/18/2020 ) When does the May 17 Order go into effect? The new Order is in effect starting at 11:59 p .m. on May 17, 2020. (Amended 4/29 /2020 ; 5/18/2020 ) Rev. 5/18/2020 4 How long does the new Order last? The new Order will be in effect until it is rescinded, superseded, or amended in writing by the Health Officer . How long the restrictions are in place will depend on progress we collectively achieve on several key indicators described in the new Order and referred to as the COVID -19 Indicators . (Amended 4/29 /2020 ; 5/18/2020 ) Can the new O rder be changed? Yes. The Health Officer may make changes to the new Order as more information emerges about the public health situation and may issue new orders and directive s as conditions warrant. Why aren't more businesses allowed to open? Thanks to the collective e ffort and sacrifice of the 7 million residents across the Bay Area, we have made progress in slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, ensuring our hospitals are not overwhelmed with COVID -19 cases and saving lives. This progress allows us to ease some restrictions to allow curbside retail to resume in addition to lower -risk outdoor businesses and outdoor activities, so long as they strictly comply with social distancing requirements and other protections in the Order. However, at this stage of the pand emic, we need to maintain most of the restrictions of shelter -in-place so that we do not lose the progress we have achieved. Lifting too many restrictions too soon could easily lead to a large surge in cases and result in avoidable hospitalizations and dea ths, and it may also lead to longer -term economic harms. (Added 4/29 /2020 ; Amended 5/18/2020 ) Is this mandatory or is it just guidance? It is mandatory. This Order is a legal Order issued under the authority of California law. You are required to comply, and it is a crime (a misdemeanor) not to follow the Order. I run an \"Essential Business ,\" \"Outdoor Business ,\" or \"Additional Business\" as defined by the Order. Do I need to get an official lette r of authorization from the City to operate a facility in the Ci ty? No. If your business is covered in the list of \"Essential Businesses ,\" \"Outdoor Businesses ,\" or \"Additional Businesses\" in the Order, then you may operate your business from a facility in San Francisco so long as you create , post, and implement a Social Distancing Protocol for each facility using the template attached to the Order . You do not need to obtain any spec ific authorization from the Ci ty to run your business . The Ci ty does not issue written determinations or authorizations. (Amended 4/29 /2020 ; 5/18/2020 ) 5 Is a building that has \"Essential Businesses\" as tenants required to create and post a social distancing protocol? Or is it the responsibility of the business tenants themselves? It is the responsibility of tenant essential businesses to comply with the social distancing requirements, including creating and posting a social distancing protocol. (Added 4/7/2020) I work for a business that is allowed to operate under the Order. Do I need to have a letter from my employer or other documentation to travel? No. You do not need to carry official documentation (and the Ci ty does not issue any) demonstrating that you are exempt under the new Order. But be prepared to explain if requested by law enforcement why your travel is allowed under the Order. (Amended 4/29 /2020) What does it mean to \"shelter in place?\" The term \"shelter in place\" means to stay safe in your home and not leave unless necessary for one of the exceptions listed in the Order (discussed more below). I heard that there is a statewide shelter -in-place order. Do I still need to comply with San Fr ancisco 's Order? Yes. In addition to the statewide order, the Ci ty Health Officer's Order remains in effect. All residents must comply with the restrictions in both orders . If the restrictions in the two orders are different, you must comply with the stricter of the two orders. What is the difference between \"sheltering in place\" and \"social distancing\"? Sheltering in place is a more rigorous form of social distancing. Sheltering in place means you: Must stay at home Can only leave your home for \"essen tial activities\" or \"outdoor activities,\" to work for an \"essential business \" or \"outdoor businesses,\" to provide or access \"essential governmental functions,\" to perform \"minimum basic operations\" for your employer, or for \"essential travel,\" as those terms are defined in the new Order ( you can also see the FAQs for details) Cannot host or attend any gatherings In addition, y ou should also maintain at least 6 feet of separation from other people who are not in your household ; wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time (or use hand sanitizer) ; cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve (not into your hands) ; wear a f ace covering when out in public ; and stay home if you are sick. (Amended 4/29 /2020) Rev. 5/18/2020 6 What if I am homeless? Persons experiencing homelessness are exempt from the Order's requirement that they shelter in place in their residence and its prohibition against all travel other than essential t ravel. However, individuals staying in homeless shelters sh ould stay there, and all shelter guests should wash hands frequently, and practice social distancing. Unsheltered people living in public spaces, tents, in vehicles, or otherwise unsheltered, should use the City's public restrooms and newly expanded hand -washing stations frequently, and should also practice social distancing. The Order also urges the City to keep 12x12 -foot spacing around tents and only one person per tent. The order urges the City to provide shelter to people experiencing homelessness, and the City has put in a place a program that rents hotel rooms to house people affected by the p andemic. Up-to-date information on the number of people provided emergency, temporary housing and shelter options because of the coronavirus can be found here.

Follow any care instructions that came with the face covering. More information can be fou nd Order says masks with one -way v alves cannot be used. Why not? One-way valves, which typically look like a raised plastic disk about the size of a quarter on the front or side of the mask, allow easy flow of your breath out of the mask when you exhale. This re sults in an easy route for airborne droplets to be exhaled, but the purpose of the face covering is to limit droplets that you expel. For that reason, masks with one -way valves are not allowed under the Face Covering Order. The Face Covering Order talks about children 2 years old and under not being allowed to wear a face covering. Why is that? Children 2 years old and under cannot safely use a face covering. There could be a risk of suffocation for children so young. Is a child between 3 and 12 years o ld required to wear a face covering? No. Children from 3 to 12 years old may wear a face covering, but it is not required. Parents and caregivers must supervise use of a face covering by children in this range in order to avoid misuse.

Generally you must ensure that your emplo yees and other staff wear a face covering in any area when working with the public or in areas where customers or the public may be present, even if there are no customers or members of the public present at the time. This is in order to avoid the spreadi ng of respiratory droplets in areas where customers or the public may be at some point. Employees also must wear masks if co - workers are nearby.

I run an essential business or outdoor business . How do I deal with children who are not wearing a face covering? Children between 2 and 12 years old are not required by the Face Covering Order to wear a face covering, but they also should not jeopardize social distancing for others in the area. You may ask a parent or caregiver if they have a face covering they can use for a child. If the child is putting other customers or the public at risk through their conduct, you ca n ask the parent or caregiver to prevent that behavior. You may warn them that they may be told to leave if they cannot prevent the misconduct. Can I use a plastic Halloween mask for myself or my child as a face covering? No. Face coverings cannot cover th e eyes or forehead. Also, a face covering should conform with the nose and mouth fairly well, and a rigid plastic mask would not do this. Am I required to wear a face covering when I'm driving my car? No, so long as you are the only person in your car or you are with members of your own household and nobody els e. If you operate a taxi, ride -share vehicle, or private town car, you must always wear a face covering in that vehicle regardless of whether someone else is in the vehicle in order to avoid breathi ng droplets that could contaminate areas where guests or customers will sit and touch. Rev. 5/18/2020 14 Am I required to wear a face covering on public transit and w hile waiting for public transit? Yes.

The Order recommends that you take steps to limit the droplets that you spread when exercising. When running, biking, or doing other activities outside, you may spread droplets fart her than normal. This makes the 6 -foot physical distance less adequate. You should avoid running or riding directly in front of or behind people or through groups of people so you don't expose yourself or others to droplets. You should have a face cover ing on you and wear it when you may be too close to others while engaged in these activities. Am I required to wear a face covering at home? No. The Face Covering Order does not require you to wear a face covering at home, but if you or someone at home i s sick, a face covering can be used to reduce exposure. You should contact your healthcare provider if you or someone in your home is sick. Rev. 5/18/2020 15 I'm going to my doctor or health care provider for an appointment.

If you are feeling sick, first call your doctor, a nurse hotline, or an urgent care center before going to the hospital. Do not go to the emergency room of a hospital unless you are having an actual emergency. But you can and should seek medical advice if you or a family member is sick. If it is not an emergency, please contact your primary care provider to determine next steps. Also, you can check online resources to help you assess symptoms if you are worr ied about whether you or a loved one has COVID -19. You should check https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/index.html for more information. Can I get my prescriptions or other healthcare needs? Can I leave home to go to the pharmacy to get my prescription filled? Yes. Drug stores and other medical supply stores are allowed and encouraged to operate. When possible , you should have prescription medicines and healthcare supplies delivered to your home. Rev. 5/18/2020 16 I have a doctor's appointment next week for routine medical care. Can I go to that appointment? Probably not. Under a separate order (Order No. C19 -08), the Health Officer has ordered all medical providers (such as doctors, and ophthalmologists) and healing arts practitioners (such as massage therapists, chiropractors, and acupuncturists) to postpon e routine appointments except in certain situations. You should contact your healthcare provider to discuss whether your appointment can be postponed without a negative medical or health impact on you.

I know the state is starting to re -open certain activities. Can my office start providing care to clients or patients in person? A: No, not yet, with a few exceptions. San Francisco Health Officer Order No. C19 -08 (available online here) currently allows certain doctors, dentists, co unselors, and other Healing Arts practitioners to meet with patients or clients in person for essential care where a patient or client would suffer a negative medical or health impact without the care and where certain infection control practices are in pl ace. That order also permits all tele -medicine or remote visits to occur. Other clinical visits are not yet allowed. The Health Officer is working on a revision to that order that will permit clinical visits to occur Rev. 5/18/2020 17 subject to specific safety protocols to avoid putting the patient/client or the office staff at undue risk. The new order is expected to be issued before May 11, 2020. (Added 5/6 /2020) Can I still go to my mental health or counseling appointments? Probably not in person, but you can part icipate remotely.

You should contact your mental health provider or counselor to discuss whether your appointment can be held via phone or videoconference, can be postponed, or should proceed in person. (Added 4/2/2020) What mental health resources are available for people experiencing distress? People who may be experiencing distress or heightened anxiety right now can contact the Peer -Run Warm Line for Coronavirus (COVID -19) Support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at 855 -845-7415.

Can and should I donate blood if I am healthy? Yes, blood banks, blood donation centers, and blood drives are exempt health care operations. If you are healthy and do not have COVID -19 symptoms, you are encouraged to donate. The need for adequate blood donations from health y people is critical. Should cafeterias in hospitals be closed? No. Hospital cafeterias fall within the exemption for healthcare facilities and may remain open. Hospital c afeterias must be structured to ensure six -foot minimum distancing between non -related individuals picking up food from or eating in the facility. Hospital cafeterias should increase cleaning and sanitization to minimize risk of exposure and follow other Social Distancing Requirements specified in the Order to the maximum extent feasible. Cafeterias in all other facilities must follow the requirements in the Order - specifically, food can be carried out or delivered, but cannot be eaten in the cafeteria. I work in a hospital or medical clinic, but I'm not sure I'm essential. Should I continue to work? What if I'm over 60? Yes. All employees of hospitals, clinics, and other organizations that provide health care, provide services to healthcare organizations, provide needed supplies to health care organizations, or otherwise maintain health care operations of all kinds may continue w orking. Rev. 5/18/2020 19 The Health Order does not advise or encourage health care workers over 60 to stop reporting to work. What if I am diagnosed with the COVID -19 virus or have been exposed to someone who was? If you have been diagnosed with the COVID -19 virus, you wil l need to be isolated to protect those around you. If you were exposed to someone who was diagnosed with the COVID -19 virus, you should quarantine for the recommended time in order to not expose others if you happen to have the virus yourself. Contact yo ur healthcare provider if you have additional questions, or go to the DPH website at www.sfdph.org. (Added 4/2/2020) CARETAKING AND EDUCATION Can I visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other residential care facility? Generally , no. There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 years old or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance. For most other situations, other existing Orders of th e Health Officer addressing this emergency prohibit non -necessary visitation to these kinds of facilities. If you need to know more, please contact the facility you want to visit by phone before you leave. This is difficult, but it is necessary in order to protect hospital staff and other patients. Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance to care for themselves? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities? Yes. B ut be extremely cautious when providing care to vulnerable people and ensure that you protect them and yourself by following social distancing guidelines such as washing hands before and after, using hand sanitizer, maintaining at least 6 feet of distance when possible, wearing a face covering, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue. (Amended 4/29/2020) Are child care facilities allowed to operate? As of May 4, childcare establishments and other educational or recreational institutions or programs can operate to provide care or supervision for children of all ages to enable people to work for an essential business or outdoor business, perform minimum basic operations for a business, or work as an essential governmental employee \u2014whether Rev. 5/18/2020 20 those people are working fr om home or from a business facility (e.g., a doctor doing telemedicine from home) . Childcare facilities need to comply with the following conditions in the Order to the extent possible: 1. Childcare must be carried out in stable groups of 12 or fewer . \"Stable\" means that the same 12 or fewer children are in the same group each day. 2. Children shall not change from one group to another. 3. If more than one group of children is cared for at one facility, each group shall be in a separate room. Groups shall not mix with each other. 4. Childcare providers shall remain solely with one group of children. Childcare establishments are also subject to the State's Shelter in Place Order, but the Health Officer will assess whether to ease childcare restrictions further in c oordination with the State and as the spread of COVID -19 is further contained. Parents are still prohibited from organizing gat herings of children, even in small groups. (Amended 4/29/2020 , 4/30/3030 , 5/1/2020 ; 5/4/2020 ) I am a nanny. Will I get in trouble if I go to work? You won't get in trouble if you go to work. The Order allows nannies and childcare providers caring for a child in the child's own home to continue working. Can music schools, dance studios, job skills classes, and other youth and adult education programs remain open to provide distance learning? Yes, these programs can still provide distance learning to their students, meaning that they may live stream or record sessions that are available to students on their devices. Staff may go to work for the purpose of providing distance learning to their students, but they must comply with social distancing requirements while at work including requirements that may limit the type of instruction that can be given (e.g., a video demonstratio n of couple dancing may not be given if the couple are not in the same household). And staff must limit the number of people needed to perform the video stream, and no more than 10 people total . (Added 5/4/2020) May a high school hold a drive -in graduation ceremony, where the students and members of their household stay in their own cars and the cars remain at least six feet apart from one another at all times? No. These ceremonies are large gatherings outside of a household that are not allowed under the current order. There are many potential health risks that such a gathering could pose, such as people getting out of their cars to use the bathroom or for Rev. 5/18/2020 21 other purposes; rolling down their car windows to get fresh air, hear a program or talk with others; and the handing out of diplomas to graduates. By contrast, certain limited outdoor activities like going to the beach are allowed so that individuals can continue to engage in healthy and safe recreation activities that do not involve the risk s of large gatherings of this sort. Still, we recognize the disappointment this restriction causes for students and their families. The Health Officer will continue to monitor the situation to see whether ceremonies of this sort may occur later this summ er, if health conditions warrant doing so and there are adequate guidelines in place to ensure the ceremonies may be conducted safely.

(Added 5/4/2020) I work in a cemetery -- can I go to work? Yes, cemeteries are essential infrastructure. Are funeral home providers and mortuaries allowed to continue operating? Yes, funeral home providers and mortuaries may continue operating to the ext ent necessary to the transport, preparation, or processing of remains. This means that any employee necessary for the transport, preparation and/or processing of a body may continue to report to these facilities to conduct their work. Are office supply sto res, stationary stores, and art supply stores essential businesses since they supply products needed for people to work from home? No. Businesses that supply products needed for people to work from home are no longer classified as essential businesses in the new order. Accordingly, they must temporarily close retail locations within the City, but they may deliver directly to residen ces and businesses and continue minimum basic operations. (Added 4/3/2020) My business manufactures, supplies, or repairs cell phones. Can it stay open? Yes. If your business is primarily engaged in supply or repair of cell phones or other telecommunications devices, then it is essential and may continue to operate under the Order for that purpose. (Added 4/29/2020) OUTDOOR BUSINESSES What is an outdoor business? What requirements apply to them? An outdoor business is a business that was primarily operating outdoors prior to March 16, 2020, and that has the ability to fully maintain social distancing of at least six feet between all persons. For retail businesses, this means that more than 50% of the total floor area regularly used for product sales was outdoors prior to March 16, 2020. The Order provides some examples of common outdoor businesses, such as plant nurseries, agricultural operations, and landscaping and gardening services. Outdoor businesses, including outdoor retail businesses, must conduct all business and transactions involving members of the public in outdoor spaces . This means that if an Rev. 5/18/2020 33 outdoor business includes an indoor facility or indoor portion of its retail space that typically serves the public, that indoor facility or indoor portion of retail space must be closed to the public and all sales must take place outdoors. Employees may continue to use the indoor space as necessary and may bring products outdoors for the pub lic. Outdoor businesses must comply with the Order's social distancing requirements and post a social distancing protocol. (Added 4/29/2020) Can flower stands and newsstands operate as outdoor businesses? Outdoor newsstands and flower kiosks that were op erating primarily o utdoors prior to March 16 are \"Outdoor B usinesses\" that may operate under the Order. These outdoor stands must comply with the following requirements: Customers ask the vendor for items, and then it is handed to the customer \u2014no self-selection of items or touching of items that the customer does not purchase. Chalk demarcations on the ground to indicate where shoppers should stand behind others, while waiting to purchase items. Post signage about the Public Health Order in multipl e languages. Staff and sellers are required to wear gloves. Provide for contactless payment systems or, if not feasible, sanitize payment systems, including touch screens, payment portals, pens, and styluses, after each customer use. Customers may pay wit h cash but to further limit person -to- person contact, Personnel should encourage customers to use credit, debit, or gift cards for payment. For clarity, this provision does not permit indoor newspaper or flower stores to resume in-store sales , but they may deliver and may open for curbside pickup under the May 17 Order . (Added 5/8/2020) Are auto dealerships now allowed to serve customers from their facilities under this new Order? Auto dealerships that qualify as an \"outdoor business,\" as that term is defined in the Order, may serve retail customers from their facilities. (All auto dealerships may provide s upply and repair services.) Rev. 5/18/2020 34 (Added 4/29/2020 , Amended 5/4/2020 ) Can auto dealerships that are not \"outdoor businesses\" sell cars online and deliver them to people's homes? Yes. The Order allows businesses to deliver products to people's residences. But car dealerships cannot sell or lease cars in -person. Are car washes allowed to continue operating under the Order? Car washes that qualify as outdoor businesses under the Order may operate . (Added 4/29/2020 , 5/4/2020 ) Can flea markets marke ts\u2014like flea markets and art markets \u2014that normally operated primarily outdoors before March 16, 2020 may operate under the Order as Outdoor Businesses. But they must comply with the following requirements. Any vendor who does not abide by these requirements may not continue to sell product. Spacing: All vendors are spaced at least 6 feet apart from one another. All vendors are required to put a physical barrier (such as caution tape) between them and the products they are selling. Customers ask the vendor for items, and then it is handed to the custo mer\u2014no self-selection of items or touching of items that the customer does not purchase. Chalk demarcations on the ground to indicate where shoppers should stand behind others, while waiting to purchase items. Signage Posting signage at each stand about th e Public Health Order in multiple languages Sanitation Staff and sellers are required to wear gloves. Provide handwashing stations and/or hand sanitizer throughout the area. Provide for contactless payment systems or, if not feas ible, sanitize payment systems, including touch screens, payment portals, pens, and styluses, after each customer use. Customers may pay with cash but to further limit person -to- person contact, Personnel should encourage customers to use credit, debit, or gift cards for payment . Rev. 5/18/2020 35 Security (crowd control) Have security to ensure social distancing of patrons. (Added 5/4/2020 ; Amended 5/7/2020 ) Do outdoor businesses include gyms and trainers that prior to the emergency conducted outdoor exercise sessions like boot camps? No. The Outdoor Businesses that are allowed to operate are considered low risk because they are outdoors and because they involve only brief and infrequent interactions among individuals. Training sessions and group exercise classes involve prolonged person -to-person interactions, even if outdoors. Also, they are higher risk because exercise causes people to more forcefully expel airborne particles, making the usual social distancing measures less adequate to prevent transmission. (Added 5/ 4/2020) CURBSIDE RETAIL AND ASSOCIATED BUSINESSES (Section added 4/20 /2020 ) My retail store is located in an enclosed shopping center (e.g., Stonestown Galleria or the Ferry Building). Can I open for curbside pickup? If your store has an entrance that opens directly to an adjacent sidewalk, street, parking lot, or alley, it may open for curbside pickup. If your store does not have an entrance that opens directly to the outside \u2014i.e., if the only way to enter the store is by going through an indoor space \u2014it may not open for curbside pickup at this time. If an indoor shopping center would like to reopen for its indoor retailers to do curbside pickup, it may submit a proposed plan to the Health Officer that includes: the number of retail stores that would be resuming operation; the number of employees who would be returning to work at those stores; and the specific social distancing/sanitation measures the shopping center would employ to prevent congestion at the door ways and streets, and to protect customers and employees. Subject to the written approval of the Health Officer or the Health Officer's designee, the shopping center may then operate for curbside pickup consistent with the approved plan, including any co nditions of approval for that plan. Rev. 5/18/2020 36 My retail store is small \u2014can I still have 10 personnel on site to handle curbside pickup? No. If your retail business cannot safely maintain a minimum six -foot distance between personnel, you must reduce the number of pe rsonnel accordingly. Ten people may be too many for a particular entity to safely operate. My retail store is large enough to accommodate more than ten employees at a time while maintaining adequate social distancing. Can I have more than ten people on s ite to handle curbside pickup? No. You may not have more than people on site to handle curbside pickup at this time. I already had 15 people working in my retail store to facilitate deliveries. Can I have more people come into the facility to handle curb side pickup? Yes, if you were operating for delivery before May 18, those personnel don't count against the 10 person limit. You may have up to ten more people come into the facility for purposes of facilitating curbside pickup, assuming the facility is l arge enough to maintain adequate social distancing, meaning at least six feet of physical distance between them. I already had 100 people in my warehouse handling food or sanitation products. Can I have more people come into the facility to handle goods t hat can now be sold curbside at retail stores? Yes, if you were operating before May 18, those personnel don't count against the 50 person limit, which applies to additional workers being added to the site. I run a shoe repair shop that also sells goods (e .g., shoe polish and shoe laces). Can customers hand me shoes to repair curbside? Can I sell my goods curbside? Operation of retail stores for curbside pickup applies only to the sale of goods and not the provision of services. So you may sell goods at the door under the rules that apply to curbside/outdoor pickup, but cannot exchange shoes to be repaired at this time. There's a metered parking space immediately outside the entrance to my store. How can I provide for use of that space for curbside pick up? You can request that the adjacent street parking be converted to temporary loading zone to help encourage physical distancing and reduce crowding. To do so, you can submit an online application to the MTA here. Can my business move its inventory outside to the sidewalk for sale? No, you may not move inventory outside to the sidewalk. But you can display goods in your window and also post and distribute a catalogue of your merchandise and information about how to order for curbside pickup. Rev. 5/18/2020 37 Can I pass goods through an open window for curbside pickup or through an open door if I block entrance to the store with a table inside t he doorway? Yes. You may do both. What safety protocols do I need to follow for me to begin operating my store for curbside pickup? You need to complete, post at your store, and implement a Social Distancing Protocol, which is a form attached to the Stay -Safe-At-Home Order and available here. You also need to develop and implement a Health and Safety Plan under the best practices directive that the Health Officer has issued \u2014a template for that plan is available here. Operators of retail stores that wish to provide curbside pickup should read carefully the requirements for the Protocol and Plan. Implementation includes training your personnel about the requirements and providing for adequate social distancing and sanitati on and wearing of face coverings. CONSTRUCTION AND ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE Are commercial, residential, and mixed -use construction projects allowed to proceed? Yes. The Order allows all construction projects, including public works, public facilities, commercial, residential, and mixed -use projects, as well as remodel and renovation work, to proceed, as long as the projects comply with the Construction Safety Protocols listed in Appendices B-1 and B-2 of the Order. This range of construction projects is consistent with those that are permitted under the March 19, 2020 Order of the California State Public Health Officer (the \"State Shelter Order\"). The State Shelter Order allows workers to leave home who support the construction, operation, inspection, and maintenance of construction sites and construction projects, workers who support the supply chain of building materials, and workers who provide serv ices that enable repair materials and equipment for essential functions. May public works construction projects, such as schools, public buildings, street improvements, and transport ation infrastructure, continue? Yes, as long as the projects comply with the Construction Safety Protocols listed in Appendices B -1 and B -2 of the Order, or other safety protocol that the Health Officer specifies for public works construction projects. May I get building permits or site inspections from the City for my construction project? Yes. You may contact the relevant agency to determine how to arrange the service you need. Rev. 5/18/2020 38 I have Code violations on my property and have been ordered to correct the violations. Can the abatement work be done while the Shelter in P lace Order is in effect? Yes. This work must comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols in Appendices B -1 and B -2 of the Order, or the Social Distancing Protocol s in Appendix A, as applicable. May I conduct site assessment, remediation, or mi tigation work that I have been directed to perform? Yes. This work must comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols in Appendices B -1 and B -2 of the Order or the Social Distancing Protocol s in Appendix A, as applicable. My business installs distributed solar, storage, and/or electric vehicle charging systems - may it continue to operate? Yes, this is permissible construction activity and must comply with the Construction Project Safety Protocols in Appendix B -1 or B -2 of the Order. Businesse s may also operate to manufacture distributed energy resource compone nts, like solar panels. Will private and public construction projects that are already underway be required to stop work if they cannot meet the safety protocols when the April 29th Order goes into effect on Monday? Yes. The projects must comply with the new protocols in order to proceed. In San Francisco, a Public Works Protocol will be issued, which must be followed for projects to proceed. The Public Works Protocol will be substanti ally similar to protocols currently in place, which the City developed in collaboration with indu stry and labor representatives. Will all project have to stop work or delay start of construction until they have a trained third -party supervisor on site? The third party supervisor does not need to be on site for the project to start, but must be ready to make site visits shortly thereafter. A company may use an outside consultant or contractor, or train one of their existing employees as needed. Projects may continue, and should make steps to have such a supervisor shortly. San Francisco does not have a training program for this supervisor, but industry groups may be able to help identify and train so that t he industry can proceed safely. How will the defin ition of a large construction project that contains 5 or more workers at a construction site be applied? This definition only applies to construction of Essential Infrastructure, as defined in Section 16.c of the Order. Essential Infrastructure includes a irports, utilities (including Rev. 5/18/2020 39 water, sewer, gas, and electrical), oil refining, roads and highways, public transportation, solid waste facilities (including collection, removal, disposal, recycling, and processing facilities), cemeteries, mortuaries, crema toriums, and telecommunications systems (including the provision of essential global, national, and local infrastructure for internet, computing services, business infrastructure, communications, and web -based services). In San Francisco, many of those ar e public works projects, which will be governed by the Public Works Protocol. The health officers made this determination in order to maximize safety for workers and the community. How will the staggering requirements for co nstruction projects be applie d? The requirements to stagger trade -specific work and work schedules are intended to minimize the number of workers at the jobsite at any one time. It is not an absolute requirement to stagger all trades and workers at all times, because in some instances more than one trade will be necessary to be on site. In those instances, the direction is to minimize as much as possible. For smaller projects, Appendix B -1 provides that construction sites should stagger trades as necessary to reduce density and allow f or easy maintenance of minimum six -foot separation. For larger construction projects, Appendix B -2 provides for 2 kinds of staggering. First, construction sites should stagger stop- and start -times for shift schedules to reduce the quantity of workers at the jobsite at any one time to the extent feasible . Second, construction sites should stagger trade - specific work to minimize the quantity of workers at the jobsite at any one time. The focus of this second requirement is to minimize the number of worke rs on the site and is not a prohibition against combining trades on -site. Does the Order allow for state -mandated testing, operator inspections, and repairs of underground storage tanks? Yes. State -mandated tests and operator inspections of underground s torage tanks are essential activities and should continue under the Order. Repairs necessary to maintain the safety of underground storage tank systems and activities to respond to alarms and address unauthorized releases are also essential and should con tinue. All such work must be conducted in accordance with the Order, including adhering to social distancing requirements. (Amended 5/1/2020) GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS Is the local government shutting down? No. Essential government al functions will continue, including first responders, emergency management personnel, emergency dispatchers, and law enforcement. Other government al functions or offices may be subject to reduced schedules or may be closed as part of the effort to fight t he spread of COVID -19. Each Rev. 5/18/2020 40 government agency identifies the services that qualify as Essential Governmental Functions, and designates the personnel who will continue providing those functions. I work for the government \u2014Can I continue to go to work? As a government employee , you can continue to go to work if your employer designate s you as an essential employee. Each government al agency is responsible for determining which of its workers are essential workers. Can I get a building permit or building inspection from the Department of Building Inspection for my construction project , or make sure my business gets the Fire Department 's fire safety and hazmat inspection that I need to keep operating? Contact the relevant city agency to determine if it is still providing the service you need as an essential governmental function. TRAVEL AND RECREATION I don't have a car. Can I ride the bus or train , or can I get a ride in my favorite ride-share/on -demand car service or a taxi? Yes, but public transit , ride -hailing services, or any other way of traveling can only be used for e ssential travel, which means: i.

When you use ride -share services for essential travel, keep in mind that you should avoid as much as possible being in close quarters in a vehicle that has been used by lots of other people . (Amended 4/29/2020) Can I use a bike from a bike -share service? Yes, you can use shared bikes and scooters for essential travel, such as commuting to work as an essential employee . But keep in mind that share d bikes and scooters are not routinely sanitized. Take precautions, including bringing sanitization wipes , not touching your face while on the bike or scooter, and washing your hands for at least 20 seconds immediately after. Am I allowed to commute into or out of the Ci ty for work or daily activities? Yes, but only to perform essential activities or essential government functions, operate an essential business, or perform minimum basic operations at a non -essential business, as those terms are defined in the Order. You can also leave to go back home or engage in other essential travel . Otherwise, the answer is no because that puts you and others in the community at risk. Keep in mind that Health Officers in neighboring counties have issued the same or similar shelter -in-place orders. If I'm outside San Francisco travelling for vacation or business, am I allowed to come home? Yes, t he Order allows you to come home. But you may need to self -isolate for 14 days if you were possibly exposed to COVID -19. I'm staying overnight here but live elsewhere . Can I go home?

The Order allows you to go outside for exercise activities like walking and running , as long as you strictly follow social distancing requirements , including maintaining a distance of at least six feet from everyone outside your household or living unit . I get anxious when I'm cooped up in side. Am I allowed to go on a hike? Can I go to a park or open space? Yes. Spending time outside improves mood and well -being, and is particularly beneficial to children. You can go for walks, go to the park, and enjoy other outdoor activit ies. But operators of parks, beaches, and other open spaces may restrict entry, close certain areas, or close the whole facility altogether if the Health Officer orders those measures to reduce crowding and limit risk of COVID -19 exposure . While you're on a hike or enjoying an open space area, you must strictly follow social distancing requirements , including maintaining a distance of at least six feet from everyone outside your household or living unit. Can I leave home to work out ? If you will be outdoors and not in close contact with other people , and will not be using equipment that other people outside your household have touched, yes. Otherwise, no.
