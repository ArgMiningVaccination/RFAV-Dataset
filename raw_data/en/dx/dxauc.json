The most supportive way for you to bring crystals into your home will depend on your intention. Whether you want to work on increasing your energy, inviting more passion into your life, or cultivating self-love, here are a few of our favorite ways to work with crystals in your home. Ground Yourself Since natural crystals come from the earth, they are connected to the earth element in feng shui. Earth energy encourages grounding and stability. If you are feeling unsettled, you may want to invite more earth element qualities into your home by working with crystals. Some crystals that have an especially strong connection to the earth element are [tiger's eye](https://www.thespruce.com/tigers-eye-in-feng-shui-1274379) and [tourmaline](https://www.thespruce.com/the-colour-power-of-tourmaline-stone-1274368). Once you've chosen a [crystal ](https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-hematite-1274384)to work with, a great place to put it in your home is in the center of your home or bedroom. In feng shui, the center of a space is connected to the earth element, as well as your overall wellbeing. This is an important area when it comes to grounding because it touches all other areas of your home, and provides a solid foundation for all aspects of your life. Cultivate Self-Love Sometimes, the most important thing that we need to work on is healing our own heart and cultivating self-love. If this resonates with you and you want to work with crystals, we would encourage you to find a crystal that connects to the energy of the heart, like [rose quartz](https://www.thespruce.com/rose-quartz-use-in-feng-shui-and-healing-1274376) or amazonite. You can place this crystal on your nightstand, or somewhere else in your [bedroom](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-feng-shui-your-bedroom-1274334) that is meaningful to you. You may also want to wear one of these crystals close to your heart, like on a necklace. Boost Energy When the goal is increased energy and vitality, we often look to the [wood element](https://www.thespruce.com/feng-shui-ways-to-decorate-with-wood-element-1274689), one of the five elements used in feng shui. Each element is associated with different qualities, and bringing that element into your home through design features and decor can help you to cultivate more of those qualities in your life. If you're feeling a little bit sluggish and could use a boost of energy, try placing green or blue crystals in your bedroom to represent the wood element. These colors are also healing and soothing, so adding them to your bedroom can help you to feel recharged, leaving you with more energy for the day ahead! Create Protection It's important to feel safe in your home, and at times this may mean adding in a layer of energetic protection. Many crystals have the ability to shield, absorb, and transmute negative energies, so they can be a perfect tool for this purpose. One of our favorite ways of using crystals for protection is to create a grid in your home or under your bed. You can do this by placing crystals like [black obsidian](https://www.thespruce.com/black-obsidian-use-in-feng-shui-1274369) or black tourmaline in each corner of your home, or under the four corners of your bed. Attract Abundance One of the most common topics feng shui practitioners get asked about is how to attract more abundance and prosperity. There are many ways to approach abundance from a feng shui perspective, and working one-on-one with a feng shui consultant can help you go deeper and uncover blocks that might be preventing you from welcoming more abundance into your life. Crystals are just one of the tools that you can use if you want to work on attracting more abundance. If you want to become more prosperous in your career or business, try placing a crystal in your home office or on your desk with this intention. Your front door is also an important place when it comes to welcoming in new energy and opportunities, so you might want to place a crystal in your home's entryway. A few of our favorite crystals for inviting more abundance are [citrine,](https://www.thespruce.com/citrine-crystal-in-feng-shui-1274371) [amethyst,](https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-amethyst-crystal-power-1274382) and [pyrite.](https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-pyrite-use-in-feng-shui-1274385) Cultivate Inspiration and Passion In feng shui, inspiration and passion are connected to fire, another one of the elements in the five element system. To connect to fire element energy, place red crystals like garnet or carnelian in your home. If you are feeling uninspired at work, try putting these crystals in your home office or on your desk. If you want to encourage more passion in your relationship, add a red crystal to your bedroom. Deepen Spiritual Practice Crystals can also be helpful tools in cultivating a connection to your spirituality and intuitive gifts. One way to support these intentions is to place crystals that are meaningful to you in your [meditation space](https://www.thespruce.com/meditation-spaces-that-inspire-4177495) and then hold or focus on those crystals as you are meditating. Some of our favorite stones for this purpose are amethyst, aquamarine, "}
