Everyone has a novel in him. Creative writing is one of the most enjoyable activities that one can have without necessarily aspiring to achieve overnight publishing success! Finding your creative outlet is reason enough to pursue a hobby as a creative writer. There are many reasons why one should put value in the ability of expressing thoughts and feelings through words. With a creative writing hobby, one gets a sense of well being. Writing creatively is an enjoyable and rewarding pursuit that can be a hobby, a field of study, and even a career. Anyone can be a creative writer. All it takes is a little creativity, some strong ideas, a command of the written language, and an understanding of how literature is typically structured. By reading extensively and practising the craft, one can become a talented and well-versed writer in his chosen field. Writing of any sort is hard, but rewarding work - the writer gains a huge amount of satisfaction from a finished piece. Being creative can also be difficult and challenging at times, but immensely fun. Every writer knows that as rewarding as the creative process is, it can often be a bumpy road. Have hope and keep at it! I must congratulate the Chairperson and members of the President's Fund for Creative Writing for their efforts in encouraging creative writing in Mauritius.

The water does not flow until faucet is turned on\" - Louis L'Amour I wish to commend the President's Fund For Creative Writing (PFCW) for the publication of its souvenir magazine in the context of the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the Independence of Mauritius. The PFCW, operating under the aegis of the Ministry of Arts and Culture, has for mission the promotion and preservation of creative writings in all languages written and spoken in Mauritius. For almost a decade now, the PFCW has been providing for an appropriate forum to our local writers to fulfil their educational, cultural and artistic aspiration, through creative writing. it has encouraged and assisted a number of deserving writers by publishing their works. We need to feel blessed that our country is home to many languages, both written and spoken. Mauritius has also known many prolific writers of international fame - such as late Abhimunyu Unnuth, Jean Marie Leclezio, the Nobel Price for Literature in 2008, Ananda Devi, who was made Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government, Nathacha Appanah. Prahlad Ramsurrun and many others. Writing is powerful tool that needs to be encouraged. We all know the latin proverb: \"Verba volant, scripta manent\" which means words remain\". The government is sparig no effort to promote all written and spoken languages through various incentives under the President's Fud for Creative Writing and the different Speaking Unions. We are also commited to providing a learning experience that enhances our student's creative, literary, and professional lives.

W . H. Davies I start my message for this Souvenir Magazine with these lines from British poet Davies, who emphasised on \" time to stand and stare\" in life, for it is in standing and staring that I find myself face to face with life, hence my ability to write. I continue with my writing then by thanking and congratulating all those writers, who during their standing and staring pause from the din of life, could scribble memorable memoirs on paper, which the PFCW could publish eventually. We stand here for you and without you we are not. I move on to grab this opportunity and thank the initiator of this prestigious Fund, Mr Cassam Uteem, a former President of the Republic of Mauritius and all the Hon Ministers of Arts and Culture, who all, by turns, kept this noble mission active and moving, under the aegis of their ministry, during their tenure of office. I wholeheartedly thank the actual Hon Minister of Arts and Culture, Mr Pradeep Roopun for having given the PFCW all the respect, help, advice and support, whenever we found ourselves in turbulence zones. I thank my team, the members on board the PFCW, my desk officers and staff who have always shown remarkable team spirit while working together as a closely knit family. I could not have achieved anything without their unflinching support, all throughout, be it in foul or fair weather . At the PFCW, we have always believed in Quality, rather than Quantity, as Literature has no place for mediocrity and sluggishness. This may have hurt some sensibitities, we cannot but apologise in the name of the noble aspects of all literature , be it Mauritian or otherwise. I enclose here some lines pertaining to Quality, a word to be admired, specially in the literary world.

ESU's commitment is to create global understanding and to promote human achievement through the worldwide use of the English language. One of the objects of the President's Fund for Creative Writing is \"the promotion of creative writing in all languages written and spoken in Mauritius\". Both our organizations therefore share the same goal, which is to encourage the enjoyment and constructive use of languages to explore and express one's feelings, opinions and perspectives. Creative writing is about the development of one's imagination, sharing human experiences and effective communication. ESU has worked in close collaboration with the President's Fund for Creative Writing on several occasions, namely by conducting creative writing workshops for aspiring writers. Our aim was to provide them with a platform for the exchange of innovative and positive ideas that could lead to good creative writing. Participants showed enthusiasm, dynamism as well as innovative writing skills and they were prepared to experiment and use their life experiences in their writing. They went away with greater confidence in their own ability and greater awareness of strategies learnt from practising and experienced writers such as Dr Sushilla Gopaul and Dr Anitah Aujayeb, authors of many short stories and poems. We like to think that we were able to light a small candle in the participants' souls and, in a small way, at least ignited their creativity and imagination. ESU wishes all the best to the board of the President's Fund for creative Writing. Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201911 PRESIDENT'S FUND FOR CREATIVE WRITING OBJECTIVES To promote Mauritian Literature To propagate awareness of Creative writing To publish books by Mauritian authors To cultivate the reading culture To organise launch of books published by the Fund To provide financial grants to deserving authors To establish a network of writers, printers and publishers To organise regular workshops in Creative Writing and other literary activities To collaborate with Speaking Unions, which are represented on the Fund's Board, for the benefits of creative activities. YEARLY ACTIVITIES Publication of books of Mauritian authors Launch of books Participation in World book day Books exhibition Workshops on Creative Writing Attending and supporting various activities of Speaking Unions Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201912Message from former Chairperson These lines are not new but are echoed in the introduction of my latest book entitled \" THE BIG LIE\" The principle of Darwin does not automatically translate itself into the paradigm of Might is Right. Are we different from animals we come from? The present ethical frame-work or moral ethos differentiates from us animals in hundreds of ways. Yet, how do we use our fertile imagination so well, to marginalise people, to crush them with money and power? Both money and power are false coins without relevance in the grave where we are all heading The message is always the same The messenger has a different voice, a different face The message is one of awakening to the life of the spirit, which is more powerful than the body Should evolution of the body wait for the evolution of the spirit? The evolution of the spirit is more powerful as it transcends the body at all times. If we go back to the introduction of THE BIG LIE, we see that \"The earth plane affords us all only one path, the path of dialogue, concensus, justice, mercy and peace. There is much to be done . Whether it be small or big. We must get ready to chisel a new world in which we can trust and in which we can live with a greater degree of security and peace!!!! There are so many tasks of rebuilding and recreating friendships. Writings, creations and books do this so smoothly and subtly. I wish the President's Fund For Creative Writing full steam ahead and my blessings and love to dear Anitah who is heading the Fund so ably.

My answer was quick and spon- taneous 'Mauritius'. For a few long seconds he looked at me as if to ascertain that I wasn't insincere, and then said, \"Mark Twain was probably right\". To be absolutely honest, I didn't know what Mark Twain had said about Mauritius; and, to be absolutely honest again, didn't want to let the interviewer know that I didn't know. And the first thing I did after reaching my hotel room at Voila Bagatelle was to search google to find out what Mark Twain had said about this beautiful island nation. When I learnt that he, Mark Twain, had called Mauritius the original of which heaven was a mimetic copy. As I put his idea in my words,I sent out a silent peal of joy recalling that lovely saying 'great men think alike'. Well, it would be far too vain of me to place myself in the category of the great Mark Twain. But, for sure, I would give to the people of Mauritius the entire credit of bringing up this island nation so nicely and of keeping it more or less free of the corrupting touch of crass materialism in a period of around a hundred and a quarter century after the visit here of that one-of-the-greatest men of letters the United States has had. My visit to the island was on account of the invitation by the Chairperson of the President's Fund for Creative Writing, Dr. (Mrs.) Anitah Aujayeb, to be a resource person at the Workshop on Creative Writing, that was one of the events to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the independence of Mauritius. As I saw it from my perspective, the workshop came out as a good showcasing of the exemplary cultural awareness Mauritians have. Functioning under the Ministry of Arts and Culture and with the President as its Patron, the President's Fund in a way extends its activities to almost every section of Mauritian population through the various language unions, which include French, English, Hindi, Urdu, Marathi, Telugu and Tamil Speaking Unions. The activities of the Fund become a platform for these unions to come together and work for a common cultural vision for the beautiful nation of Mauritius. Besides the workshop, the Chairperson of the President's Fund had made arrangements for me to deliver talks on topics related to creative writing at the Open University of Mauritius and at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute. At both the places, I met gatherings of people eager to know things about creativity and creative writing. For me, it was both enthralling and enlightening to see this eagerness and, hidden in this eagerness, an immense promise for the future of Mauritius. I believe that the President's Fund is doing an exemplary work in keeping the people of the island creatively and culturally alive and active as they contribute to the material prosperity of the island. With the constant reminder of their very humble but human beginning at the ApravasiGhat in their front yard, Mauritian people have kept their economic progress within sight of humanity and humanness. And the role of the Ministry of Arts and Culture in keeping that human spirit alive deserves to be fully lauded. I congratulate the President's Fund for Creative Writing and the Ministry of Arts and Culture for the great curatorial work they are doing to support new writers by extending them help in the publication of their work, in helping them know about the changing trends and conventions in the field of creative expression by organising workshops and seminars, and in helping them to reach Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201921out to a wider audience by holding literary events. I wish the President's Fund for Creative Writing and the Ministry of Arts and Culture, under which the Fund functions, the very best for all their future endeavours.Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201922CREATIVITY AND CREATIVE WRITING A CRITICAL THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE Creativity permeates human life. Creativity functions in science laboratories; it functions in the world of businesses and professions; it functions in the domains of architecture and crafts. It functions even in such unlikely areas as travelling where one can plan and travel creatively, or inkitchen in the preparation of recipes and dishes; it functions, too, in the way people plan and organize their days and weeks and years. Without creativity, humanity would not have progressed the way it has since the cave days of our long-ago ancestors. In the Preface of their book entitledThe Cambridge Handbook of Creativity, Kaufman and Sternberg write about \"three components\" of the definitions of creativity and creative ideas: \"First, creative ideas must represent something different, new, or innovative. Second, creative ideas are of high quality. Third, creative ideas must also be appropriate to the task at hand or some redefinition of that task. Thus, a creative response is novel, good, and relevant\" (xiii).Seana Moran in a chapter in the same book lists six exhaustive spheres of contemporary life where creativity works; and in the second sphere of the list she mentions \"the arts and sciences, with an abundant stream of paintings, dramas, theories and concepts\" (74). Without going any further into this argument and discussion, we can understand for sure that 'creativity' is indispensable in the life we live and is inevitable for our progress and even survival. Coming to the core issue of discussion here, it may raise some eyebrows if one begins by stating that creative writing is, scientifically speaking, Darwinian activity. However, this is the suggestion the reader would draw from E. O. Wilson's statement in his Foreword to the book entitled The Literary Animal.Wilson writes: The mind is a narrative machine, guided unconsciously by the epigenetic rules in creating scenarios and creating options. The narratives and the artifacts that prove the most innately satisfying, spread and become culture. The societies with the most potent Darwinian innovations export them to other societies (ix). The statement of Wilson lays it down as a theory that human creations, including those called 'scientific', have all flown and grown from that narrative machine. Creative writing is one among many Darwinian innovations that the human mind,being that narrative machine, has invented. And the function of this special invention of the human mind is to find the affirmation and endorsement of its scientific and cultural discoveries. As such, the function of creative writing is to unify and amalgamate all scientific and cultural discoveries of the human mind. Besides this function of amalgamation, creative writing also sublimates human creations in sciences and culture. One would instantaneously recall Wordsworth speaking as follows in his 'Preface to Lyrical Ballads': Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge: it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all Science. Emphatically may it be said of the Poet, as Shakespeare has said of man, \"that he looks before and after.\" He is the rock of defence of human nature; an upholder and preserver, carrying everywhere with him relationship and love (qtd in Brett & Jones 249). Having thus firmly established that creative writing is an instinctive and innovative activity of the human mind, and also having ensured the exalted place of this instinctive creative activity, the first questions that confront us are the questions about the character of creative writing, about what makes creative writing different from other types or kinds of writing, and about the origin of creative writing. Speaking of the character of artistic creativity, of which creative writing is a part, one would sooner or later refer to Aristotle's idea of an artist as one who carries out an idealization. Aristotle thinks of a creative writer as not the one who \"describes a thing that has been\" but as the one who speaks of \"a Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201923kind of thing that might be\" (43). Aristotle goes on to speak of art in general and poetry in particular, which is a form of creative writing, as \"more philosophical and of graver import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals\" (43). In Aristotle's theory, thus, an artist or a creative writer follows the principle of 'probability', which is almost akin to the principle of necessity, rather than that of 'possibility'. The former of the two deals with 'truth' rather than 'fact'. In Aristotle's theorization, therefore, a creative writer is the creator of 'universal truth(s)' -- such truths as are always alive and relevant, and not dead as the 'facts' in history. Larry Phillips presents a very much evolved and yet a simple view of artistic or creative writing: You have the sheet of blank paper, the pencil and the obligation to invent truer than things can be true...to take what is not palpable and make it completely palpable and...have it seem normal...so that it can become the part of the experience of the person who reads it (qtd. In Morley 03). In terms of simplicity, there cannot be a better definition of creative writing than what Phillips delineates; and this definition accommodates the two sets of people on the two sides of the 'act' of writing. On one side of the act of writing is the writer, and on the other is the reader. As it gets implied in this definition, an interesting aspect of creative writing is its dual ownership. While in the stage of creation, it is the writer who owns the writing in the sense that he/she puts his/her impressions and experiences in it. Once what has been written reaches the reader, he/she appropriates the writing by seeing his/her own experiences in it or by experiencing the experiences of the writer. Whether we go by the Aristotelian theory of it or by Phillips's definition, creative writing primarily or even essentially has or has to have a therapeutic purpose, which makes it remarkably different from other kinds of writing. First for the writer and then for the reader, this therapy of writing and reading can and does have many layers. To quote David Morley: [W]hile creative writing is no panacea, some writers find its practice therapeutic; and some teachers of writing believe that writing is a powerful aid to various types of therapy, from the treatment of depression to social rehabilitation. More accurately, writing may contribute towards self-development and self-awareness... (03). Writing becomes therapeutic for the writer because, as Morley goes on to say, it \"wakes you up - it forces you beyond your intelligence and quotidian attention - and anything that makes you think\" and, in the process, helps the writer in \"finding perspectives on\" themselves and on others (04). And to make his or her writing therapeutic, the writer also needs to delve deep into the unfathomable infinite in their own psyche, into the \"self\" that Sri Aurobindo sees as \"lone, limitless, nude, immune\" in his beautiful short poem 'Thought the Paraclete' (125-26).Here is a part of the poem, with the middle lines eliminated: Hungering, large-souled to surprise the unconned Secrets white-fire-veiled of the last Beyond, Crossing power-swept silences rapture-stunned, Climbing high far ethers wanderer Paraclete Disappeared slow-singing a flame-word rune. Self was left, lone, limitless, nude, immune. When and if the writing comes from that 'limitless' and 'immune' depth of the creative writer's psyche and being, it gets a therapeutic quality to work on the reader too. The belief that reading cures in a Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201924somewhat homeopathic way is nothing new to the people who have read and studied or taught the 'theory of literature' over a period of time. The belief has its origin in Aristotle's concept of 'catharsis', which he speaks of while talking of the dramatic form of 'tragedy' in his famous treatise 'The Art of Poetry', and by which he suggests that creative writing cures the reader by either providing an outlet to or by a reformation of certain unwanted emotions. In a somewhat different form, the idea of the therapeutic value of literature for the reader gets a strong mention in Wordsworth's romantic 'theory of pleasure' too. Delineating his theory, poet's \"task\" of \"producing immediate pleasure\" as \"an acknowledgement of the beauty of the universe\" and as \"a homage paid to the native and naked dignity of man\" (qtd in Brett & Jones 248). In our times, medical science has scientifically proved the therapeutic value of literature for the readers. Of the many findings, there is one that Blake Morrison singles out for extended mention in his article titled 'The Reading Cure' published in The Guardian of 5 January 2008. Referring to Jane Davis's \"Get into Reading scheme\", which, among others, had \"groups of people with learning disabilities, Alzheimer's, motor-neuron disease, mental health problems\", Morrison brings in the testimonies of the medical staff about how the scheme helped many patients with mental health issues showing remarkable improvement after their joining 'Get into Reading' groups. Many similarly successful stories of reading therapy have given us the word 'bibliotherapy'. There can be at least two answers to the question about the origin of literature in particular and art in general. One of these answers speaks of literature as a divine creation, a creation of God. The earliest literature in ancient India, for example, always claims its descendance from God. (To clarify a little, the earliest literature we are referring to here is not that of the Vedas, which have the reputation of being books of religion.) It usually happens in ancient Indian epic tradition that the narration is attributed to the Supreme God of the cult to which the epic belongs. For example, Vyasa, the author of the Mahabharata, attributes the narration to divine illumination and employs Lord Ganesha as the lexicographer for his oral narration. A more pertinent illustration is an adaptation of the selection of sections from Gunadhyaya's Brihatkatha, an epic written much before the 3rd Century CE but not available except in references and adaptations. Kathsaritsgara, which we are citing here, is an 11th Century adaptation of Brihadkatha by Somadeva and is the most well-known among quite a few adaptations of the original Brihatkatha. Loosely translated as the 'Ocean of Streams of Stories', Kathsaritsgara opens with a customary invocation; and then the story moves to the abode of iva. The teller of the stories in Kathsaritsgara is iva and the listeners are His Consort Prvati and Pushpadanta, iva's favourite Gana who steals into the place deceiving Nandi the guard, by his magic power. On being discovered, Prvati curses him to become a mortal and live on earth till he meets Kaabhti the Pischa and tells the stories to him. Mlyavan, the other Gaa, who pleads for Pushpadanta, too gets cursed to be born as a mortal, only to be released from the curse when he carries the stories to the humans on earth through Kaabhti, the Pischa. This, then, is the Indian theory of the divine origin of literature. The other theory of the origin of literature is evolutionist and comes from Darwinism. The theory comes for a brief explanation in the Introduction of the book titled Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative. Gottschall& Wilson, the editors of the book, cite the case of a researcher at the Department of English at the Binghamton University finding the immense possibility of applying the Darwinian theory as explained by \"the English zoologist Desmond Morris's 1967 bestseller The Naked Ape\" to understand Homer's Iliad as a drama of naked apes - strutting, preening, fighting, tattooing their chests, and bellowing their power in fierce competition for social dominance, desirable Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201925mates, and material resources\" (xviii). Talking about the origin of literature, therefore, is like talking about the origin of the universe - there is that Creation Theory that attributes the creation of the universe to God's act; and then there is that Evolution theory that thinks of the universe as a product of Big Bang and the follow up. Collectively, we humans are far too insignificant a part of the universe to make any conclusive statement about its creation. After all, even the 'Big Bang' is also a theory that may or may not be true. But, we can be sure of Literature and its creation because it is a phenomenon that belongs to the human world only. At least we can legitimately assume so and, therefore, can be proud of the fact that we can replicate God's or Nature's Creation in and through creative writing. In conclusion, it can be stated that Literature is a combination of 'inspiration' and 'craft' - the former presumably coming to us from some 'divine source' and the latter from our own 'practice' of it.Literature, thus, is a phenomenon of dual origin. If a biological metaphor would not be out of place, this discussion on 'creative writing' can be concluded by saying that while divine inspiration 'fathers' Literature, craft 'mothers' it.

Participants conveyed the idea that they would like such a conference to be an annual feature of the PFCW schedule Our Guest Speaker recommended that we should go for QUALITY instead of QUANTITY, after having a look at the books published Participants in the Exhibition of books deplored the fact that not much time was given to the guests for a proper tour of the exhibition. It was also sad that there were no buyers of books, so guests should be motivated to buy Mauritian Literature TITLE OF OU CONFERENCE: HEAVEN OF FREEDOM Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high Where knowledge is free Where the world has not been broken up into fragments By narrow domestic walls Where words come out from the depth of truth Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit Where the mind is led forward by thee Into ever-widening thought and action Into that FREEDOM OF HEAVEN my Father, let my country awake Rabindranath Tagore: GITANJALIMinistry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201928MESSAGE FROM QUALITY Control Unit As member of the quality control group for President Fund For Creative Writing, I have read, corrected and approved four books. There are few achievements a person can do in life: 1. Plant a tree 2. Write a book 3. And faith in your endeavours. Anton Chekhor rightly said: \"Medicine is my rightful wife and literature is my mistress, when I get tired of one, I spend the night with the other\". Creative writing has no barriers, no limits, it is within each one of us. If you have an idea, a theme, a topic to share, write it down, ideas will flow and the work is achievable. The PFFCW is the best platform and an opportunity to build a resilient rainbow nation. Nation building can be a reality when we read books written by Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Hindi, Mandarin, English and French creative writers. Mauritian writers have the potential and some writers have shown stunning creativity. The works have been appreciated and read. Hopefully CIE will prescribe some Mauritian writers in the syllabus at Ordinary & Advance level (English literature). Dr. Anitah Aujayeb , the president of PFCW has given a new impetus to the fund and her dedication is laudable. I wish the PFFCW a long and fruitful future. Mrs.T. Dewnarain. Mauritian Writer Quality Control Unit Mystery is the heart of Creativity Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201929Can Poetry Change the WORLD Everybody cannot be equally sensitive to the often subtle and delicate vibrations of poetry and yet, everybody has the potential to understand and enjoy poetry. However, it is only by looking at a poem in detail that we can do justice to the considerable creative effort that went into its crafting. Our purpose in life is not our happiness only, it is to serve the force that sent us into the world. We poets and writers do not need drums to beat before us or crowds to shout out our names. We identify the purpose of our existence and surrender to the forces and guiding hands of nature. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive. Poetry is 'The record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds,' says Shelley. And to be the happiest with the best minds, one has to sail in rough seas of life. It is after going through the vicissitudes of life that we as poets can understand the pleasures and pains of mankind. Definitely, poetry then becomes the most philosophic of writing as clearly stated by Aristotle. Thinking always ahead, thinking of always to do more, creates a state of mind in which all is possible. Poets may derive their sources of inspiration from anything, anywhere - an abundant solitude, the fragrance of sandal wood, a child knee - deep in mountain grass, the swirling clouds, animals mating, wind arabesque, the churchspire to mention but a few. 'A small scene of nature could contain the images of the Universe,' Says Leonardo Da Vinci. A well - crafted and engagingly contemplative work may change the mindset of a reader with a trigger of emotions. Poetry endowed with freshness, sensuality and rich inventiveness provides a liberating image of the indomitable spirit and versatility of man.Poetry voices man`s exposed condition in a world of severe conflicts. It catches the dewdrop and reflects the cosmos. Poets want to spread the message of peace, equality and fraternity where there is no sex discrimination, children are loved and protected, bridges are made instead of walls and all men live like brothers. Yes, Poetry can change the world for a better tomorrow. The poem below summarizes poets` feelings in general across planet earth. Mrs. Pramila Khadun Mauritian Writer Reader / Editor PFCW Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201930 A WORLD CALLED Tomorrow We sat around a hearth of dim fires Sipping our coffee laced with sugar. Considered as most acclaimed and influential poets, By the usual world of glitz and glamour, We were rather focusing on mankind's fate While the river flowed languidly. We remembered the illustrious moments Of great inventions, of great makers of civilization, Of fighters of liberty, the writers and the satires, The painters and the singers and the accompanying musicians, And the sweet sweat on the neck of farmers. We, as avant-gardistes of our times, Could not allow our minds to play old thoughts. Our unrelenting passion for humanity's progress Which must glow like paint on canvass, The gleaming light that stands on man's path Will never leave man like old trash or recycled garbage. Man's evolution must not lead to man's degeneration. While the columns of smoke rose Like falcons flapping their wings For the great heights, with graceful composure We eased our troubled hearts And prayed for man's unity, for peace and for love. Prayers have powers, conclusively, incisively. With our uniform loneliness, we started drawing On plain paper with our box of crayons Of a world called tomorrow Mrs Pramila KhadunMinistry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201931CELEBRATING BOOKS AND WRITERS According to prescribed International days, fixed by the United Nations Organisation, the 23rd April is considered to be the World Book day. It is a day to reflect on the importance of books, any book, scientific, spiritual, storytelling or any other genre. In brief it is a day to celebrate books in all solemnity and elegance which can be attributed to books. Books, as the storehouses of great knowledge have made many a life, have enthused many a reader with the requisite joys of living through good reading. \"Un homme qui lit en vaut dix\" say the French while the British gentry claim that. \"if we encounter a man of rare intellect, ask him what book he reads\" and the latin adage is more than famous. \"Toll\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e9, Toll\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e9 (Take up and Read, Take up and Read)\" because everyone in the golden old days knew that the Reading Culture was the best culture in the life of men even though no book day was celebrated. Every day was reading day, every time was reading time. Traditionally on World Book Day, the world of literature celebrates the Writer's day as well. Writers are put in the forefront, are given the floor, debates are organised around writers and their creations and so on. Writers are given a special place on World Book day, for books would never have crowded on shelves in libraries and at home without the wonderful pens of the more wonderful writers. Writers are invited by institutions to deliver exposes on their works, their creations and their achievements. Students of various institutions come to know about the world of literature and their creative skills get a boost. Some of them come up with lovely poems which they deliver on the day. They start seeing things in a different way. They realise that there is a world which is much better than the materialistic and vain world of intoxicants, rebellions and lies that they unfortunately indulge in, and that is the world of literature where they can take refuge anytime. Now, the Ministry of Education has decided to celebrate the 23rd April as the English Language Day. English, as we all know is the official language of our island. That has been the greatest legacy the British people left to us with great respect and gratitude for all the days, months and years they spent in our country. Generations of Mauritians ahead will always be proud of this legacy and will leave no stone unturned towards protecting and preserving it.The President's Fund for Creative Writing had been conceptualised to promote Literature in English The PFCW was then opened to all langauges spoken and written in English as we know that languages open all doors to all vistas of life and have also been the key to all achievements of Mauritians around the world. Academically and professionally, languages have been an asset to be proud of . Dr. [Mrs] Anitah AujayebMinistry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201932ink of a pen The thicker than the blood of a martyr Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man, writing an exact man\" wrote Francis Bacon. The three qualities are the most treasured possessions in a person's literary life.Reading enables one to keep abreast of the world around him and to imbibe the best that is known and thought in the universe. A learned man with a liberal outlook, according to Bacon, is a full- fledged man but he is not a ready man. A ready man must be sharp and quick-witted. He must cultivate this sharpness via conversation,discussions and debate.Lastly he must develop the exactness , must be able to express himself correctly and cogently and must write his thoughts and hereafter must lead to his parochialism.Thereupon he will emerge as a citizen of the world.He will henceforth shed his prejudices and be more objective in his approach and more humane in his outlook. He will at the end of the day develop a well-integrated personality. Our education should not be geared towards examinations only as if it is the end-all and be-all of life.Real education consists in a liberal outlook which one can cultivate or develop only if one exposes oneself to the thoughts and ideas of others.Richard Steele succinctly wrote : ''Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body''. When we read ,we can rub and polish our brain against that of others.Reading books,magazines and papers develop our personality.It is an art in itself.It is an escapism from the conundrum of daily routine and we are switched off from the anxieties of this fast changing world. For sure :''a man who does not read is like one who does not know to read and write.'' Despite the onslaught of technological break- through , reading still retains its primordial place in our midst.It is no doubt an uphill task to initi- ate old and young alike to read and write.Against this backdrop, the President Creative Writing Fund (PCWF), fathered by the then visionary President of the Republic ,Cassam Uteem,was initially created to stimulate budding writers with hidden talents to write in English language.It has weathered its ups and downs. Now with the recent nomination of Dr Anitah Aujayeb as president, the PCWF is set on its rails and given a new impetus on this noble mission after a long inertia.It has now been extended to all languages spoken in Mauritius.A new boost-up has been given and today we have a flowering of new hidden talents.An array of books are on the pipeline waiting for submission and final touch by the writers .A new synergia has been triggered. PSWF functions under a tutelage of the Ministry of Arts and Culture and with time it has been well structured and endowed with a secretarial team served as a link to record entries, distribute and collect manuscripts to all the components like Readers,Quality Control Unit,Editors and Printers.It has been endowed with a budget of its own to function. There is no reason to doubt that the PCWF will not honour its pledge in its mission and will henceforth convert our literary world into an oasis .Thus Mauritian literature will be made to shine more brightly in its firmament. Philip LI CHING HUM Mauritian Writer Quality Control unit Member Ministry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201933Message from Urdu Speaking Union Mauritius is a tiny island having a plural society where each community holds to its cultures. Each community takes pride of its culture and language which it ensures is imparted to its offspring. As far as the cultural and literary language of the Muslims is concerned, this community has identified themselves with Urdu as it treasures their religion and cultural heritage. Urdu flourished as the language of the Muslims who used it not only as a medium of instruction for religious education but also as a vehicle of cultural expression. Urdu is not only the ancestral language of Indian origin but is also the universally-recognized poetic language of love. Urdu is one of the most sophisticated languages defining beauty and grace. It is known to touch the soul the way it imparts hidden meanings in prose or poetry like other beautiful languages can. Urdu has been present and alive in Mauritius right from the early days of its history when its name was Isle de France. Today, Urdu is a vital part of the rich cultural and linguistic diversity of our rainbow island. The teaching of Urdu was initially established in Madrassahs and Mosques. Gradually it paved its way and with the help of the Government of Mauritius, Urdu is now present upto the tertiary level. Indeed it is remarkable that substantial efforts were made to raise the level of Urdu. According to UNESCO, Urdu is the 3rd most spoken language in the world. For the survival and cultural development of Urdu language, many institutions are in force and working in a collaborative endeavor for its promotion and progress. For instance, The Urdu Speaking Union, National Urdu Institute, Mahatma Gandhi Institute, Islamic Cultural centre, Mauritius Broadcasting cooperation, the President's Fund for Creative Writing, the High commission of India and the High Commission of Pakistan, many NGO's are indeed active institutions who are working in parallel to keep the ball rolling.

Ibrahimsah Mauritian W riter Art ,freedom and creativity will change society faster than politicsMinistry of Arts & CultureSouvenir Magazine 2019 Souvenir Magazine 201935My Impression I am pleased to convey my warm greetings to the Chairperson and members of the President's Fund for Creative Writing, on the issue of the first Souvenir Magazine of the PFCW, since its inception. The cultural fabric of our society is consolidated by the rich ancestral languages and values, and it is encouraging to note that Government continues to provide its unflinching support to uplift this precious heritage of ours. The setting up of the President's Fund for Creative Writing unfolds the commitment and dedication of Government for the promotion, propagation and preservation of creative writings in all languages written and spoken in this multi cultural society. It is a secret to none that creative writing encompasses a wide array of writing types. Everything from poetic works to works of non fiction can be found in the creative writing genre. It is also a fact that the style of creative writing focuses on writing from emotions and thoughts rather than just giving information. Any writing that expresses emotions or expresses free thinking falls into the category of creative writing. It is in this same context that the President's Fund for Creative Writing has been encouraging Mauritian writers in their respective fields: poetry, novel, novella, memoirs, short story, autobiography, drama, among others. Creative writing comes from simple thoughts and emotions that the writer is feeling or thinking before it is put on paper. So as Justice Parmenter has rightly pointed out: \"It is wrong to think that creative writing is a 'frivolous' waste of time\" Mariam Goodur, M.S.K Author, Translator.
