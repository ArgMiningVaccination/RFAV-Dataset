Often your acupuncturist is able to prescribe herbs as part of your acupuncture treatment (especially for things like acute pain, colds, cases of flu, coughs, allergies, menopause). Sometimes though we need to be able to talk a little more and review your goals, medications, and other supplements you may already be taking. In this case, you will need to schedule a separate Herbal Consultation. During your treatment, we review current medications, herbs, and supplements, and you will get a prescription for Chinese herbal medicine to support your acupuncture treatments. Certain conditions respond very well to a combination of acupuncture and herbal medicine. For example, allergies, symptoms of the common cold and flu, and digestive disorders can all be helped with the right combination of herbs. Chronic inflammatory, auto-immune, and hormonal conditions are also good candidates for herbal support. The herbs to fulfill your prescription can be purchased from our unstuck pharmacy, or from our online pharmacy.
