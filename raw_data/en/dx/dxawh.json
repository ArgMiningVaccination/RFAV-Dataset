Applicant's request/Work -sharing procedure) . 4 Nonclinical Aspects The a provided a comprehensive study package on Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil), a prodrug hydrolysed to the active compound baloxavir. This is the \"first-in-class\" compound that inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN) activity of the influenza virus PA (polymerase acidic protein) polymerase complex. Pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice (G LP). Pharmacodynamic Baloxavir inhibited the transcription of virus A and B strains by inhibition of CEN activity , with a higher potency against virus A strains than B strains ( IC50 1.4-3.1 nM and 4.5- assays (endpoints: virus titre reduction, plaque reduction, or cytopathic effect) were mainly performed using Madin- Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells infected with a broad spectrum of viruses (laboratory strains, seasonal influenza viruses, and clinical isolates). In a virus titre reduction assay, baloxavir was more efficient in inhibiting virus replication in highly virulent A strains ( EC 90 0.46-0.98 nM in A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) 90 range: 2.21- 6.48 nM ). Similar results were obtained in a cellular -based plaque formation inhibition assay, where EC 50 values ranged from 0.20- subtype nM for type B strains. Baloxavir also showed antiviral activity against avian strains ( H5N1, H7N9 ) and NA (neuraminidase) inhibitor -resistant strains carrying different mutations in NA protein. Baloxavir showed superior efficacy against laboratory strains compared to other approved antiviral agents. Combination of baloxavir with different NA inhibitors showed a synergistic effect (up to 4- fold) on cytopathic activity against influenza A -infected MDCK cells. Resistance analysis of A/H1 N1 and A/H3N2 strains showed that a single amino acid substi tution of I38T in the PA coding region caused a 41 -fold increase in the EC 50 value of baloxavir. In addition, a substitution of E199G led to an increase in the EC 50 value of baloxavir by 3-fold in A/H3N2 virus . The amino aci d substitution in PA region in B virus strain was not detected in vitro . Taken together, the results of the in vitro studies support the proposed mechanism of action of baloxavir and indicate that baloxavir has a potent antiviral activity against a broad panel of A and B influenza virus strains at concentrations below the clini cal C max, unbound of 16 nM. The IC values of baloxavir for the inhibition of virus replication were lower than the values derived from biochemical data. This suggests that in addition to CEN inhibition another mechanism of action could also play a role. The reason for the higher efficacy in A strains could be the difference in five amino acid residues in CEN of influenza A and B viruses. Higher efficacy of baloxavir on influenza A strains was also observed in in vivo studies. Nonlethal and lethal mice models were intranasally inoculated with various highly virulent influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B strains. Immediate treatment of mice with baloxavir marboxil significantly reduced virus titres in the lung s of the infected mice and showed superiority to other antiviral agents. In mouse influenza models receiving lethal doses of virus strains, baloxavir significantly improved survival time, which correlated with the reduction of virus titres in the lung. Prolonged survival after delayed treatment was shown wit h baloxavir marboxil alone or in combination with oseltamivir (96 h). The results in immunocompromised mice showed superiority of baloxavir compared to oseltamivir. An immediate antiviral effect was also shown in ferrets. SwissPAR 8 / 12 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 Taken together, the animal data s upport the antiviral activity of baloxavir marboxil at an exposure comparable to the clinical exposure. However, they are not predictive for the efficacy in human as the treatment schedule in hu mans is different (single dose). Based on the results of the s tudies on secondary pharmacodynamics, the potential for off -target effects is considered to be low. Baloxavir has a high therapeutic index ( 500), resulting in maximum antiviral activity with minimal cell toxicity . Baloxavir showed no specific toxicity on mitochondrial function. Baloxavir marboxil had no adverse effects on the central nervous system or respiratory system in rats. In monkey s, no effects on the blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) were observed. Baloxavir marboxil had no e ffect on hERG current up to 10 \u00b5M, whereas t he IC50 for baloxavir was estimated to be 7.31 g/ mL. There is no preclinical safety signal for cardiac toxicity in humans . Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of all nonclinical species (mice , rats, monkeys, and ferrets). After oral administration, baloxavir marboxil was rapidly hydrolysed to baloxavir and was therefore not detected in plasma or whole blood of any nonclinical species except ferrets . Tmax was reached within 1 hour in rats and after 5.33 hours in monkeys, similar to the time in humans (4 h). Plasma protein binding of baloxavir was similar in rats (92%), monkeys ( 85 to 89.5%), and human s (92.9 to 93.9% ). The distribution ratios of bal oxavir in bl ood cells were 57.1 to 59.6% in rats, 50.4 to 52.9% in monkeys, and 48.5 to 54.4% in humans. A negative food effect on plasma exposure was observed in nonclinical species, as in humans. In cynomolgus m onkeys, concomitant dosing with minerals and baloxavir marboxil resulted in a decrease in exposure of baloxavir . In rats and monkeys, bioavailability was approximately 10% under non-fasted conditions, and 10 and 50% , respectively, under fasted conditions . After repeated dose administratio n of bal oxavir marboxil once daily to rats, pregnant rabbits, and monkeys under non- fasted conditions, the C max and AUC 0-24h values of baloxavir in plasma increa sed less than dose proportionally. Slower drug conversion of prodrug was observed in juvenile rats as baloxavir marboxil was detected in plasma. The exposure to baloxavir was also the highest in juvenile animals and increased dose - proportionally. The elimination rate increased with age. Studies with oral administration of [14C]-labelled baloxavir marboxil to pregnant albino and pigmented rats showed rapid and wide tissue distribution. The highest concentration was detected in the intestinal mucosa, followed by the liver and other organs of elimination. In most of the tissues the radioactivity was eliminated after 8 hours , although longer persistence of drug -related radioactivity was detected in the liver (t 1/2 12.9 h), and bone (t 1/2 in bone 63.3 h). No radioactivity was detected in brain tissue. The radioactivity concentration in melanin- containing tissue was low and not detectable after 24 h ours. Radioactivity was observed in foetuses, suggesting that baloxavir crosses the placenta. Drug -related radioactivity in f oetuses was eliminated within 48 hours , except for bones and skin; a prolonged retention in t hese tissues cannot be excluded . Baloxavir marboxil was rapidly metabolised to baloxavir after incubation with S9 fraction from the liver or intestinal tract, and sera from rats, monkeys, and humans . Arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) was identified as the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis. In vivo in rats and monkeys, baloxavir marboxil metabolites were primarily products of glucuronidation and oxidation of baloxavir; this is comparable with the metabolism in humans. The only metabolite detected at >10% in all species , including human s, was baloxavir glucuronide (16.4% in As baloxavir glucuronide is an O- glucuronide , it is not considered to be of toxicological concern. Most drug- related radioactivity was excreted via bile/faeces, as in humans. Urinary excretion ratio was less than 1% . Baloxavir was detected in milk from lactating rats. Toxicology Studies to characterise the toxicological profile of baloxavir marboxil were conducted in rats, monkeys, and rabbits. The toxicology species selection is considered adequate since their PK is SwissPAR 9 / 12 Swissmedic Hallerstrasse 7 3012 www.swissmedic.ch Tel. +41 58 462 02 11 Fax +41 58 462 02 12 similar to that in humans. Animals were dosed orally with baloxa vir ma rboxil o nce daily for up to 1 month under non- fasted conditions. The most common clinical observations in these studies were occasional gastrointestinal (GI) adverse findings (loose stools, diarrhoea and vomiting). GI findings in rats (80 mg/day dose) occurred at an exposure comparable to the clinical exposure and, in monkeys, approx. 8- fold above clinical exposure (AUC). The main target organ for toxicity in both species was the liver. In rats, hepatotoxicity was characterised by increases in liver w eight with correlating gross pathology, histopathology, and increases in liver enzymes. In monkeys, no histopathological abnormalities were detected, although an increase in liver enzymes was observed. Although hepatotoxicity was observed at a clinically relevant exposure, the risk for humans is considered to be low, as single -dose administration of baloxavir marboxil is intended. A significant and dose - dependent, but reversible, decrease of colloid (minimal to mild) and hyperplasia of follicular epitheli um in thyroid were observed in rats at clinically relevant exposures. A direct association with baloxavir marboxil cannot be excluded, as radioactively labelled baloxavir was also detected in the thyroid. However, the risk for humans is considered to be low due to the different treatment regimen. Reversible testicular findings without clear dose dependency were observed in the 1- month study in monkeys (adhesion on the right testis/epididymis, marked fibrosis, and degeneration/necrosis in the seminiferous t ubule). The applicant provided historical control data to exclude a relationship with the treatment. The provided information is considered to be sufficiently satisfactory to conclude that no risk for humans is anticipated due to the single- dose treatment. The significant prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and increases in the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in platelets and fibrinogen observed at 200 mg/kg in rats were not considered to be drug- related, as further investigational studies confirmed that this was a consequence of the fasting conditions and a reduction in vitamin K. Baloxavir (marboxil) tested negative for genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo . Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted and are not necessary given the single- dose treatment. Baloxavir marboxil did not have an effect on female or male fertility parameters in rats up to an exposure of 2.1 -fold the clinical exposure. Embryo- foetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Decreases in maternal and foetal body weight were observed in both species at exposures 2- 3 fold above the clinical exposure. In rabbits, the incidences of post -implantation losses and skeletal variations were also observed at 1000 mg/ml dose (exposure ratio 6.1). Skeletal variations (i ncreased incidence of cervical ribs and a low incidence of full supernumerary ribs) were increased in high- dose rabbits. No malformations were observed. In the pre- and post -natal development study in rats, enlargement of the eyeball with dark red discolor ation was the only adverse finding. Since the finding was unilateral and occurred at a low frequency, this may not be drug- induced. Considering the single- treatment regime, the relevance for humans is considered to be negligible. There were no adverse ef fects of baloxavir marboxil on the overall growth and development of juvenile rats at clinically relevant exposures. All adverse findings were also observed in adult rats. Overall, there are no safety margins, which is acceptable considering the single- dose treatment in humans. Baloxavir marboxil is not phototoxic. There are no concerns regarding impurities. The submitted RMP includes an adequate description of the key safety findings from nonclinical studies and their relevance to humans. According to the environmental risk assessment, no significant risk for the environment is anticipated. Nonclinical Conclusions Overall, the submitted nonclinical documentation is considered sufficient to support the approval of Xofluza with the new active substance baloxavir marboxil for the proposed indication. The pharmacological properties, as well as the PK and toxicity profil es for Xofluza, are considered to be adequately characterised. All nonclinical data relevant for human safety are included in the information for healthcare professionals.

Product information for human medicinal products 4 / 18 Interactions No clinically significant drug -drug interactions are anticipated between baloxavir marboxil . Pharmacokinetic interactions Polyvalent cation- containing products may decrease plasma baloxavir concentrations. Xofluza should not be taken concomitantly with polyvalent cation- containing laxatives or antacids, or oral supplements containing iron, zinc, selenium, calcium and magnesium. Effects of b aloxavir marboxil or baloxavir active metabolite, baloxavir , did not inhibit any of the following isozymes in the CYP or UGT family in in vitro studies conducted at clinically relevant significant induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in in vitro studies conducted at clinically relevant concentrations . Baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir inhibited the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in in vitro transporter studies conducted at clinically relevant concentrations . Baloxavir , but not baloxavi r marboxil , inhibited BCRP . Based on in vitro transporter studies, despite a weak in vitro inhibitory potential, baloxavir is not expected to be pharmacokinetic interaction is anticipated between baloxavir and active substances which are substrates of these transporters. A single 40 mg dose of baloxavir marboxil had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate . This neither baloxavir marboxil , nor baloxavir , are expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of co- administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates . A single 80 mg dose of baloxavir marboxil had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, a P-gp substrate. This suggest s that neither baloxavir marboxil , nor baloxavir , are expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of co -administered drugs tha t are P -gp substrates . A single 80 mg dose of the Cmax and AUC BCRP substrate, by 18% and 17%, respectively. These decreases are not considered to be clinically meaningful and indicate that neither baloxavir marboxil , nor baloxavir , are expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of co -administered drugs tha t are BCRP substrates . Effects of o ther drugs marboxil or its active metabolite , baloxavir Product information for human medicinal products 5 / 18 Itraconazole, a P -gp inhibitor , increased baloxavir 1.33 -fold and 1.23 -fold, respectively. These increases are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Probenecid, a UGT enzyme inhibitor , decreased for baloxavir by 21% and 25%, respectively. These decreases are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Immun e response No studies have been conducted on the interaction between influenza vaccines and baloxavir marboxil. A clinical study carried out on naturally acquired and experimental ly induced influenza revealed that treatment with Xofluza had no adverse effect on the normal humoral antibody respons e to infection. Pregnancy, lactation Pregnancy No adequate and well -controlled studies have been conducted with Xofluza in pregnant women. The potential risk associated with Xofluza in pregnant women is unknown. Baloxavir marboxil did not cause malformations in rats or rabbits. High doses of baloxavir marboxil given to pregnant rabbits caused maternal toxicity , resulting in miscarriages and an increase in the incidence rates of minor skeletal abnormalities , but no malformations. No s uch effects were detected in rats (see section Preclinical data, Reproductive toxicity ). Xofluza should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the f oetus. Product information for human medicinal products 6 / 18 Labo ur and d elivery The safe use of Xofluza during labou r and delivery has not been established. Lactation It is not known whether baloxavir marboxil and its active metabolite, baloxavir, are excreted milk. When dosed at 1 mg/kg, baloxavir marboxil and its metabolites pass into the milk of lactating rats. A decision should t herefore be made on whether to discontinue nursing or to initiate treatment with Xofluza , taking into consideration the potential benefit of Xofluza to the nursing mother and the potential risk to the infant. Fertility No effects were obs erved on fertility in animal studies conducted with balox avir marboxil (see section Preclinical data, Reproductive toxicity ). Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies have been carried out on the effects on the ability to drive and to use machines. Undesirable effects The overall safety profile of Xofluza is based on data from 2109 subjects in 17 clinical trials conducted with Xofluza . No adverse drug reactions were identified b ased on pooled data from 3 placebo- controlled clinical studies (studies 1518T0821, 1601T0831 and 1602T0832) carried out in adult and adolescent patients, in which a total of 1640 patients were given Xofluza . This includes otherwise healthy adults and adol escents , as well as patients at high risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g. elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease. 1' 334 patients (81.3%) were adults aged 18 to 64 years, 209 patients (12.7%) were adults aged 65 years , and 97 patients (5.9%) were adolescents ( aged 12 to < 18 years). Of these 1'640 patients , 1'440 patients received Xofluza at a dose of 40 mg or 80 mg and 100 patients each received a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg. The safety profile in patients at high risk was similar to that in otherwise healthy adults and adolescents . Undesir able effects after market launch The following undesirable effects of Baloxavir Marboxil were identified after the market launch based on spontaneous case reports and cases from non- interventional study programs. Undesirable effects are listed according to MedDRA system organ classes and the estimated frequency category for each undesirable effect is based on the fol lowing convention: very common ( 1/10); common ( 1/100 to Product information for human medicinal products 7 / 18 < 1/10); uncommon ( 1/1'000 to < 1/100); rare < 1/1'000); very rare (< 1/10' 000); not known (cannot be estimated based on the available data) . Immune system disorders Not known: anaphylaxis 1 Not known: reactions , Not known: erythema multiforme Skin and Uncommon : urticaria 2 Not known: angio -oedema 1 1 was not observed in the clinical trial. A reliable estimate of their frequency is not possible as these events were reported on a voluntary basis, on a patient collective for which the sample size is not known. 2 was calculated based on the frequency of ev ents in completed clinical studies. Description of selected undesirable effects after market launch Hypersensitivity reactions were reported after the market launch, including anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reactions, on the one hand, as well as less serious hypersensitivity reactions , such as urticaria and angio- oedema. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is very important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected new or serious adverse reactions online via the ElViS portal (Electronic Vigilance System). You can obtain information about this at www.swissmedic.ch . Overd ose Reports on overdoses with Xofluza stem from clinical trials and postmarketing experience. No adverse events were noted i n the majority of cases reporting an overdose. Whil e cases of overdose were reported in association with adverse events, the data are insufficient to determine what symptoms are to be expected as a result of an overdose. Product information for human medicinal products 8 / 18 Treatment There is no known antidote to Xofluza . In the event of an overdose, standard supportive medical care should be initiated based on the patient's signs and symptoms. Baloxavir is unlikely to be significantly removed by dialysis due to high serum protein binding. Properties/Effects ATC code J05AX25 Product information for human medicinal products 9 / 18 Mechanism of action Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis in to its active metabolite, baloxavir, the active form that exerts anti -influenza activity. Baloxavir acts on the cap -dependent endonuclease (CEN), an influenza virus -specific enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex , and thereby inhibits the transcription of influenza virus genomes , resulting in the inhibition of influenza virus replication. The mean inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of baloxavir was 1.4 to 3.1 nmol/L for influenza A viruses and 4.5 to 8.9 nmol/L for influenza B viruses in an enzyme inhibition assay . Pharmacodynamics Preclinical studies demonstrate potent antiviral activity of baloxavir against influenza A and B virus in vitro and in vivo . The antiviral activity of baloxavir against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses was determined in the MDCK cell culture assay. The median effective concentration (EC a MDCK cell - based virus titer reduction assay, the EC90 ( 90% effective concentration (EC 90)) values for baloxavir were in the range of 0.46 to 0.98 nmo l/L for subtype A/H1N1 A/H7N9 viruses, and 2.21 to 6.48 nmol/L for type B viruses . Viruses bearing the PA/I38T/M mutation, selected in vitro or in clinical studies , exhibited reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. Baloxavir is effective A/H3N2, and R152K B virus es, H274Y in A/H5N1, R292K in A/H7N9. The relationship between antiviral activity in cell culture and inhibition of influenza virus replication in humans has not been investigated. Xoflza did not prolong the QTc interval at a concentration corresponding to twice the expected exposure compared with recommended dosing. Clinical efficacy Otherwise healthy patients CAPSTONE -1 (Study 1601T0831) Study 1601T0831 is blind, multicent re, placebo- and active- controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with placebo or Product information for human medicinal products 10 / 18 oseltamivir in otherwise healthy adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 to 64 years , weighing at least 40kg) with influenza. A total of 1 '436 patients were treated in this study in the 2016- 2017 Nor thern Hemisphere influenza season. Patients were randomi sed to receive 40 mg or 80 mg Xofluza according to their weight (< 80 kg or 80 kg, respectively), or oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days (if aged > 20 years) , or placebo. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was the A/H3 subtype (84.8% to 88.1%) , followed by 9.0%) and the A/H1N1pdm subtype (0.5% to 3.0%). In this study, 78% of patients were Asian, 17% were White, and 4% were B lack or African American. Out of the 1'436 patients who were enrolled, 1'062 had influenza confirmed by RT -PCR and were included in the efficacy analysis (Xofluza n=455, placebo n=230 or oseltamivir n=377). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to alleviation of symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, fever or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue). A statistically significant improvement was seen in the primary endpoint for Xofluza when compared with placebo ( see Table 2). Table 2 Time to Alleviation of Symptoms in Otherwise Healthy Patients with Influenza (Xofluza vs Placebo) Time to Alleviation of Symptoms (Median [hours]) Xofluza 40/80 mg (95% CI) N=455 between Xofluza Confidence interval There was no statistically significant difference in time to alleviation of symptoms when the Xofluza group was compared with the oseltamivir group (53.5 h vs 53.8 h, respectively). The number of patients who received X ofluza at the recommended dose and who were infected with influenza type B virus was limited to 38 patients . In the influenza B subset, the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 93 hours (95% CI: 53, 135) in patients who received 40 mg or 80 mg Xofluza compared with 77 hours (95% CI : 47, 189) in patients who received placebo. Study 1518T0821 This phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with placebo in otherwise healthy adult s (aged 20 to 64 years) with influenza. A total of 400 patients were randomi sed to one of three Xofluza dose groups (10, 20 or 40 mg) or placebo in Product information for human medicinal products 11 / 18 the 2015 -2016 influenza season in Japan. The predominant influenza virus strain was the A/H1N1pdm subtype (61% to 71%) , subtype (5% . The median time to al leviation of symptoms was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) in all dose groups compared with the placebo group . Following administration of 40 mg Xofluza , the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 49.5 hours (95% the placebo group . The number of patients who received X ofluza at the recommended dose and who were infected with influenza type B virus was limited to 24 patients . In the influenza B subset, the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 63 hours (95% CI: 43, 70) in patients who received 40 mg X ofluza compared with 83 hours (95% CI : 58, 93) in subjects who received placebo. High risk patients Capstone 2 ( Study 1602T0832) Study 1602T0832 is double- blind, multicent re, placebo- and active- controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Xofluza compared with placebo or oseltamivir in adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 years ) with influenza and at high risk of influenza- related complications (e.g. asthma or chronic lung disease, endocrine disorders, heart disease, age 65 years, metabolic disorders, morbid obesity) . Patients who had suffered from cancer within the past 5 years ( apart from non-melanoma skin cancer), an untreat ed HIV infection or a treated HIV infection with a CD4 count of below 350 cells/mm3 in the last 6 months , were not enrolled. A total of 2'182 patients were randomi sed to receive a single oral dose of 40 mg or 80 mg Xofluza depending on body weight (patients who weighed 40 to < 80 kg received 40 mg Xofluza and patients who weighed 80 kg received 80 mg) , oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days or placebo. The predominant influenza viruses in this study were the A/H3 subtype (46.9% to 48.8%) and influenza type B (38.3% to 43.5 %).Of these patients, 43% were Asian, 46 % White and 10% Black or African American (1% other). The majority of patients had underlying asthma or chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, morbid obesity or were aged 65 or older. In this study , 1'158 of the 2' 182 patients who were enrolled had influenza confirmed by RT -PCR and were included in the efficacy analysis ( Xofluza n=385, placebo n=385 or oseltamivir n =388) . The primary efficacy endpoint was time to improvement of influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, fever or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue). This endpoint included the alleviation of new symptoms and improvement of any pre-existing symptoms that had deteriorated due to influenza. A statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint was observed for X ofluza when compared with placebo ( see Table 3). Product information for human medicinal products 12 / 18 Table 3 Time to Improvement of Influenza Symptoms ( Xofluza vs Placebo) Time to Improvement of Influenza Symptoms (Median [hours]) Xofluza 40/80 mg (95% CI) N=385 the X ofluza group was compared with the oseltamivir group, there was no statistically significant difference in time to improvement of influenza symptoms (73.2 h vs 81.0 h, respectively) . Virus subtype For patients infected with the subtype A/H3 virus (predominant strain), the median time to improvement of the symptoms was statistically significantly shorter in the Xofluza group compared with the placebo group, but not compared with the os eltamivir group (see Table 4). In the patients infected with type B virus, the median time to improvement of the symptoms was statistically significantly shorter in the Xofluza group compared with both the placebo and oseltamivir group . Table 4 Time to Improvement of Symptoms by Influenza Virus Subtype Time to Improvement of Symptoms ( hours) of i nfluenza- related complications There were no significant treatment differences for the complications death, hospitalisation, otitis media and pneumonia. Resistance monitoring during clinical development Product information for human medicinal products 13 / 18 Cell culture: Influenza A virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir were detected by the serial passage of the virus in cell culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of baloxavir. Reduced susc eptibility of influenza A virus to baloxavir was associated with the amino acid substitutions I38T (H1N1 and H3N2) and E199G (H3N2) in the polymerase acidic (PA) protein of the viral RNA polymerase complex . No influenza B virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir were detected in cell culture. Clinical studies: Influenza A virus isolates with treatment -emergent amino acid substitutions at position PA/I38T/F/M , associated with a > 10 -fold reduc tion in susceptibility to baloxavir , were observed in clinical studies. The clinical relevance of this reduced susceptibility is unclear. No pre- treatment isolates, with amino acid substitutions associated with a reduced susceptibility to baloxavir, were found in clinical studies or in the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the NCBI Influe nza Virus Resource databases. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use X ofluza . In the phase 3 study conducted in otherwise healthy patients (1601T0831), the amino acid substitution PA/I38T/M was detected in 36 of 370 patients (9.7%) in the Xofluza treatment group. In the phase 3 study conducted in high risk patients (1602T0832), the amino acid substitution PA/I38T/M/N was detected in 15 of 290 patients (5.2%) in the Xofluza treatment group. Cross -resistance No single amino acid substitution was identified that might confer cross -resistance between baloxavir and neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., peramivir, oseltamivir, zanamivir). However, a virus may carry amino acid substitutions in the PA protein and in the neuraminidase that are associated with a reduced susceptibili ty to baloxavir and to neuraminidase inhibitors , respectively, and which effect reduced susceptibility to both classes of inhibitors. The clinical relevance of evaluations of phenotypic cross- resistance has not been investigated . Pharmacokinetics Absorpt ion After oral administration, baloxavir marboxil is converted in to its active metabolite, baloxavir, by arylacetamide deacetylase in the gastrointestinal lumen, epithelium, and liver. The plasma concentration of baloxavir marboxil was very low or below the limit of quantitation (< 0.100 ng/mL). The pharmacokinetic parameters for baloxavir in healthy Japanese adult s after a single oral administration of 40 mg baloxavir marboxil in the fast ing and postprandial states are summ arised in Product information for human medicinal products 14 / 18 Table 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters for baloxavir in healthy Caucasian adult s after a single oral administration of 80 mg baloxavir marboxil in the fast ing state are summari sed in Table 6. Table 5 Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Baloxavir in the Plasma in Healthy Japanese Adults after Administration of a Single Oral Dose of 40 mg of Baloxavir Marboxil in the Fasting and Postprandial State s Parameters Geometric Mean (CV%) Fasting Postprandial N 14 14 Cmax (ng/mL) (19.1) (35.6) a Median ( min, max) Table 6 Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Baloxavir in the Plasma in Healthy Caucasian Adults after Administration of a Single Oral Dose of 80 mg of Baloxavir Marboxil in the Fasting State (Study 1612T081C) Parameters Geometric Mean (CV%) N 12 CL/F (L/h) 10.3 (22.5) Following a single oral administration of 80 mg of baloxavir marboxil, the time to peak plasma baloxavir concentration (T max) was reached after approximately 4 hours in the fast ing state . The absolute bioavailability of baloxavir marboxil was not investigated . Product information for human medicinal products 15 / 18 A food -effect study on absorption, involving the administration of baloxavir marboxil to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and after a meal (approximatel y 400 to 500 kcal , including 150 kcal from fat) , indicated that the C max and AUC for baloxavir were decreased by 48% and 36%, respectively, after a meal . Tmax was unchanged in the presence of food . No clinically relevant differences in efficacy were observed in clinical studies with influenza patients where X ofluza was administered with or without food. Distribution In an in vitro study, the binding of baloxavir to human serum proteins, primarily albumin, was 92.9% to 93.9%. The apparent volume of distribution for baloxavir following a single oral administration of 80 mg of baloxavir marboxil is approximately 1' 180 lit res in Caucas ian patients and 647 lit res in Japanese subjects. Metabolism In vitro studies revealed that baloxavir marboxil is primarily converted to baloxavir by arylacetamide deacetylase gastrointestinal lumen, Baloxavir is primarily metaboli sed by UGT1A3 , with a minor contribution from CYP3A4. In a human mass balance study, after administration of a single oral dose of 40 mg of [14C]-label led baloxavir marboxil, the active metabolite baloxavir accounted for of total radioactivity in the plasma. Baloxavir glucuronide (16.4% of total radioactivity in the plasma) and (12aR,5R,11S) sulfoxide of baloxavir (1.5% of total radioactivity in the plasma) were also detected in the plasma. This confirm s that the in vivo metabolism of baloxavir marboxil occurs via ester hydrolysis to form baloxavir , decomposition a glucuronide. Elimination Baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir were excreted mainly via the faeces in humans. Following a single oral administration of 40 mg of [14C]-label led baloxavir marboxil, the total radioactivity recovered in the faeces was 80.1% and 14.7% in urine. The amount of baloxavir excreted in the urine was 3.3% of the administered dose. The apparent terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2,z) for baloxavir after a single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil is 79.1 hours in Caucasian patients, and 93.9 hours in Japanese subject s, see Tables 5 and 6. Linearity/non -linearity Following the single oral administration of 6 mg to 80 mg baloxavir marboxil, baloxavir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the fasting state. Product information for human medicinal products 16 / 18 Kinetics in specific patient groups Body weight Body weight was identified as the significant covariate based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The recommended dose is 40 mg for adult patients with a body weight of 40 kg to < 80 kg, and 80 mg for adult patients with body weight s 80 kg . Gender A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required based on gender. Ethnicity Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, ethnicity was identified as a covariate of plasma clearance of baloxavir after oral administration (CL/F ), in addition to body weight . However, no dose adjustment is required for baloxavir marboxil based on ethnicity . Age A population pharmacokinetic analysis of clinic al studies conducted with baloxavir marboxil did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir for subjects aged 12 to 64 years in relation to plasma baloxavir concentrations . Hepatic impairment Geometric mean values (90% confidence interval) for Cmax and AUC in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class B) compared with healthy controls were 0.80 (0.50 - 1.28) and 1.12 (0.78 - 1.61), respectively. Since no clinically meaningful differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class B) compared with healthy controls with normal hepatic function, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or mod erate hepatic impairment . The pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in patients with severe hepatic impai rment . Renal impairment The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir have not been investigated . Renal impairment is not expected to alter the elimination of baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir. Renal excretion represents a minor pathway of elimination for baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir. A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinical ly meaningful effect of renal Product information for human medicinal products 17 / 18 function on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir. No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment . Baloxavir is unlikely to be signi ficantly removed by dialysis . Elderly patients Pharmacokinetic data collected i n patients aged 65 years show that exposure to the active substance, baloxavir , was similar to that in patient s aged 12 to 64 years . Children and adolescents The pharmacokinetics of X ofluza have not been investigated in paediatric patients ( aged < 12 years). Preclinical data Non-clinical data reveal no particular risks to humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity . Mutagenicity The pro-drug baloxavir marboxil and its active form, baloxavir, were negative in bacterial reverse mutation tests and in micronucleus tests conducted in mammalian cell cultures. Baloxavir marboxil was negative in an in vivo micronucleus test conducted in rodents . Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies have been conducte d with baloxavir marboxil. Reproductive toxicity Baloxavir marboxil had no effects on fertility when administered orally to male and female rats at doses of up to 1 '000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 2 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h). Baloxavir marboxil did not cause malformations in rats or rabbits. A study conducted on the embryo - foetal development in rats after the oral administration of daily doses of baloxavir marboxil from gestation day 6 to 17 revealed no signs of maternal or f oetal toxicity up to the highest tested dose of 1'000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 2 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h). In rabbits, a dose of 1' 000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 6 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h) caused maternal toxicity , result ing in 2 miscarriages (out of a total of 19 pregnancies) and an increased number of foetuses with skeletal variation (cervical rib), but no malformations. A dose of 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 3 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h) caused no adverse effects in rabbits . Product information for human medicinal products 18 / 18 The pre - and postnatal study conducted in rats revealed no active substance- related adverse findings in dams and pups up to the highest tested dose of 1' 000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 2 times the human exposure based on AUC 0-24h).
