Making a list of the best joint supplements for dogs is not as easy as it may at first seem. There are a huge number of dog joint supplement options on the market today, and many claim to do vastly different things from one another. In order to actually compare and contrast these dog supplements, we needed to create basic criteria that would allow us to quickly parse down the list and help us to focus on the very best options. Our main criteria for a quality dog joint supplement that was going to be considered for our list were overall safety and quality control. We first screened out any joint supplements that had possible issues with quality control or that had been flagged for improper ingredients. From there, we made sure to only look at joint supplements with high-quality ingredients made in safe facilities. From there, we had a much more manageable list of contenders that we were able to more closely examine. Most of what we then weighed is covered later under the question, \"How Do I Choose a Quality Joint Supplement for My Dog?\" but suffice to say, we took a holistic approach that allowed us to weigh all the pros and cons of a joint supplement. In the end, we had a list we could safely say contained 5 of the best dog joint supplements on the market today. What are the Signs of Joint Pain in Dogs? There are quite a few signs of joint pain in dogs though it can be challenging to identify the exact issue since dogs can't communicate their pain directly. There are a few common signs of joint pain you should definitely be aware of that we will briefly cover. The most obvious sign is limping or stiffness. If your dog is favoring one leg or appears to be limping or otherwise is having difficulty moving around or lying down, they likely have some issues with their joints. Dogs experiencing pain in their joints may also be less active than usual and may show a reluctance to exercise or play. Joint issues can make a dog more irritable or restless due to their discomfort. They may also seek more attention or become clingy. A change of posture, licking or chewing joints, or a loss of appetite can all also be signs of pain, though can also appear as a common side effect of many other issues. This is why if you notice one or more of these signs, it's essential to take your dog to a veterinarian for an examination and diagnosis. Early detection and treatment of pain can help improve joint issues and quality of life. What Dog Breeds Are More Prone to Joint Problems? Not all dogs are built the same, and many breeds are more prone to joint issues than others. Joint health can vary drastically by breed, and some breeds are simply more susceptible due to their size. - Large breeds such as Great Danes, Saint Bernards, and Mastiffs are prone to joint problems due to their size and weight. They are more likely to develop conditions such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis. - Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, and German Shepherds are popular breeds that are also prone to issues with their joints. They are at risk of developing conditions such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and osteoarthritis. - Bulldogs are also prone to joint problems due to their body structure. They are at risk of developing conditions such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and patellar luxation. - Dachshunds are prone to developing intervertebral disc disease, which can cause back pain and mobility problems. If you own a dog from a breed prone to issues with their joints, you should begin investing in joint supplements early on in their life so that you can help to postpone and mitigate common joint issues. How Do I Choose a Quality Joint Supplement for My Dog? Taking dog joint health seriously is essential to giving your pet a long, healthy, and fulfilling life. However, finding the perfect joint dog supplement that is able to promote healthy joints in your dog isn't always as easy as it may first seem. There are tons of dog joint supplements on the market today, and sorting through all of them can be a real challenge -hence the need for this article. When eventually picking the perfect hip and joint health supplement for your dog, you want to evaluate a few essential features first. When choosing a supplement to help with your dog's joints, be sure to consider the following: Ingredients You want to be sure your hip and joint supplement contains all the key joint health ingredients that your dog needs. Look for joint supplements that contain ingredients that are known to promote joint health, such as glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, and [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952327815300533). These ingredients can help reduce inflammation, improve joint mobility, and promote joint health, and are many of the same ingredients found in your common human joint supplement. Purpose This typically coincides with the ingredients, but you want to be sure you are getting the best supplement for your dog's unique needs. For example, senior dogs that need to reduce inflammation may be different from the needs of a younger dog with [hip dysplasia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070021/). You want the best supplement for the specific issue you hope to treat. Quality Choose dog joint supplements from a reputable manufacturer that uses high-quality ingredients and has a good reputation for producing effective supplements. Look for dog joint supplements that are certified by third-party organizations, such as the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC). Form Dog joint supplements come in different forms, such as tablets, chews, and powders. Consider your dog's preferences and choose a joint health supplement format that is easy for your dog to consume. For example, if your dog is a picky eater, a powder supplement you can mix in other foods may be a better option than a tablet or chewy treat. Cost Consider the cost of the joint health supplement and choose a product that fits your budget. However, keep in mind that the cheapest supplement may not always be the most effective, and investing in a high-quality supplement can save you money in the long run by reducing the need for expensive veterinary treatments. It's also important to consult with your veterinarian before starting your dog on any new supplements or medications. Your veterinarian can guide you on choosing a supplement and ensure that it is safe and appropriate for your dog's needs. What are the Benefits of Joint Supplements for Dogs? Joint supplements made for dogs can provide a range of health benefits for joints, particularly for dogs who are at risk of developing joint problems or senior dogs who are already experiencing pain and stiffness in their joints. Here are some of the potential benefits of the best joint supplements for dogs. Reduce inflammation Joint supplements often contain anti-inflammatory ingredients, such as glucosamine hydrochloride, omega-3 fatty acids, and [ turmeric,](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/turmeric-benefits) which can help reduce inflammation in the joints and alleviate pain and stiffness. Improve joint mobility Ingredients such as glucosamine and chondroitin can help improve joint mobility by promoting the production of joint fluid and supporting the cartilage and connective tissue in the joints. Support joint health Joint supplements can provide essential nutrients and building blocks that support the health of the joints, including amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Delay the progression of joint problems In dogs with joint problems such as arthritis or hip dysplasia, the best joint supplements for dogs can help slow the progression of the condition and prevent further damage to the joints. Promote overall health Some joint supplements contain ingredients that can provide additional health benefits for dogs, such as improved skin and coat health, immune system support, and digestive health. It really all depends on the active ingredients of a supplement. For example, some supplements have added ingredients like chondroitin sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate is a chemical found in cartilage and is often used to help issues related to osteoarthritis. Supplements with [chondroitin sulfate may be helpful in rebuilding cartilage in dogs](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/chondroitin). Chondroitin sulfate may also be helpful in preventing the degeneration of cartilage. Can Joint Supplements Cause Side Effects in Dogs? Joint supplements are generally safe and well-tolerated by dogs, but like any supplement or medication, joint supplements can cause side effects in some dogs. Here are some potential side effects of joint supplements in dogs. - Stomach Issues and nausea: Joint supplements may cause some dogs to experience digestive issues, such as vomiting or diarrhea. These effects are usually mild and can often be resolved by adjusting the dosage or administering the supplement with food. - Allergic reactions: Some dogs may be allergic to an ingredient in a joint supplement, such as shellfish-derived glucosamine. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itching, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. - Increase in thirst and urination: Many joint supplements made for dogs contain high levels of certain vitamins or minerals, which can cause increased thirst and urination. Of course, there are also more serious but rare side effects that can occur from using even the best joint supplements for dogs, such as blood clots (possibly due to high doses of omega-3 fatty acids) or negative drug interactions between a joint supplement and other medications, such as blood thinners. It's important to monitor your dog for any signs of side effects after starting a supplement regimen. If your dog experiences any adverse reactions, stop administering the supplement and consult with your veterinarian. What Causes Joint Pain in Dogs? There are a lot of reasons that your dog's joints may be acting up or causing them pain and not all of the reasons are as obvious as you may think, and not all of them are unique to senior dogs. [Osteoarthritis](https://www.acvs.org/small-animal/osteoarthritis-in-dogs)is perhaps the most typical cause behind pain in the joints and is found in many aging dogs, just as it is found in many aging people. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage that surrounds and protects joints erodes which leads to inflamed and painful joints. If you have aging dogs, you should be on the lookout for this medical condition. - Hip dysplasia is another common issue amongst many breeds. This is a genetic condition that affects the hip joint, causing pain and discomfort. Larger dogs, like Saint Bernards, tend to suffer from hip dysplasia more than smaller breeds. - Obesity or excessive body weight puts pressure on joints, weakening and damaging them over time. If you have an overweight dog you will want to help them lose some weight in order to maintain healthy joints in the long term. - There are also a number of infections and diseases that cause joint pain in dogs. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can cause pain. Septic arthritis can also cause pain. Certain autoimmune diseases can cause joint pain in dogs, such as rheumatoid arthritis. If you notice your dog is experiencing joint pain or stiffness, it's important to take them to a veterinarian for an evaluation and appropriate treatment.
