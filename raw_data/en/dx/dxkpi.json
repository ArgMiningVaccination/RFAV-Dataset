If you have got a cold or a cough, there is a possibility that you may also experience a loss of taste and smell. Based on the severity of your condition, it could be a partial or complete loss. Smell and taste loss is also a typical problem among the elderly healing from illnesses like cancer. A variety of medical problems can cause a loss of taste and smell. This article will look at what causes it, what alternative treatments you have, and how natural treatments can help you control the symptoms. Continue reading. In This Article How Do Smell And Taste Work? Your senses of smell and taste are often connected. However, as you age, these senses can change, and you may experience a change or even loss of smell and taste ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12425708)). The senses of smell and taste are a part of the chemosensory system. The ability to smell things around you comes from special sensory cells called the olfactory sensory neurons. These are found within the olfactory bulb inside the nose. Each of these olfactory neurons has an odor receptor that is stimulated by microscopic molecules released by the substances around us. Smells reach the olfactory receptors via two pathways. The first is through the nostrils, and the second is via a channel that connects the roof of the throat to the nose. The aroma from food releases aromas through the second channel. The ability to taste is also referred to as gustatory perception. The tongue has about 2,000 to 5,000 chemical receptors on its surface. These are also more commonly called taste buds. The five major tastes that are perceived by your taste buds are sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. You can perceive taste when water-soluble chemicals in your mouth come in contact with your taste buds ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5490520/)). The brain receives signals from the tongue and processes them into distinct tastes. The sense of taste can also be linked to other senses, like the sense of smell and brain functions. Taste and smell impairment can also be referred to as chemosensory dysfunction. In the next section, we will discuss some major factors that may cause a loss of taste and smell. What Causes The Loss Of Taste And Smell? As we have already mentioned, your sense of smell and taste are correlated. In fact, when you sense a loss in taste, it could actually be a result of impairment in the sense of smell. Conditions like hyposmia, anosmiai [X]A temporary or even permanent loss of smell caused due to smoking, medicinal side effects, nasal obstruction, or mucus. , parosmia, and phantosmiai [X] Also known as olfactory hallucination, a condition in which you detect smells that are not present in the environment. can cause impairment in perceiving smells. Similarly, some common taste disorders are ageusiai [X]A rare condition characterized by a loss of taste caused due to infections, certain medications, or nutritional deficiencies. , hypogeusia, dysgeusia, parageusiai [X]A bad or metallic taste in the mouth caused due to medication, treatment, or a medical condition. , and hypergeusiai [X]A taste disorder in which the sense of taste is abnormally heightened due to lesions in a small space located in the skull. ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558054)). Both taste and smell disorders are often the results of similar conditions or factors. Loss of smell and taste can be triggered by sinus, respiratory conditions, aging, head trauma, dental issues like oral infection, placement of dental appliances (like dentures), and Bell's palsy ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10670508)). A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9882440/) conducted on 10,953 individuals found that 3,356 were COVID positive and 602 were COVID-negative. Out of the COVID-positive participants, 21% of the participants reported a reduction in taste, 47% of them reported a reduction in smell, and 17% of them had oral irritation. If your senses of smell and taste seem to have been impaired, it is best to get diagnosed to determine the underlying cause of your condition. Diagnosis Of Loss Of Taste And Smell Both smell and taste alteration conditions are often diagnosed by an ENT specialist or otolaryngologist. Your doctor may test for the lowest concentration of taste that you can sense and odor you can smell. You may be asked to taste different substances of varying concentrations for the same. You may also be asked to take a simple 'sip, spit, and rinse' test. Your doctor might conduct a physical examination of your ears, nose, or throat. Once your condition is diagnosed accurately, the doctor will suggest the appropriate mode of treatment. Medical Treatment Options The method of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms, age, and general health. The treatment options may include: - If some medication is causing this condition, you will be asked to discontinue or stop taking it. - Zinc deficiency can hamper your sense of taste and smell ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6349457)). Zinc can help stimulate food intake by triggering the hypothalamusi [X]A structure deep inside the brain that controls appetite and plays a role in palate and taste perception. to enhance the sense of taste. - Quitting smoking can help regain a sense of taste over time. If you are looking for natural alternatives to your problem, the home remedies listed below might help. Home Remedies For Loss Of Taste And Smell 1. Castor Oil The ricinoleic acid in [castor oil](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-benefits-of-castor-oil/) imparts powerful anti-inflammatory properties to it ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11200362)).

You can also have foods like eggs, cheese, and white meats. - Consume foods rich in zinc like legumes, nuts, whole grains, shellfish, and dark chocolate. Zinc has been known to stimulate food intake via neuropeptidei [X]Small proteins produced and released by nerve cells in the body that stimulate the intake of food. ( [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23305423)). Therefore, zinc can potentially enhance the sense of taste. You will have to alter your lifestyle choices to manage your condition. Here are a few tips that can help. Prevention Tips [Drink plenty of water](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-many-litres-of-water-should-you-drink-daily-to-lose-weight/)and stay hydrated. - Try steam inhalation. - Maintain good oral hygiene. - Take the necessary precautions to avoid infections like cold and flu - one of the main factors responsible for the loss of taste and smell. Infographic: Home Remedies For Loss Of Taste And Smell Loss of smell and taste are uncomfortable symptoms associated with allergies, infections, respiratory conditions, aging, etc. One of the best ways to regain these lost senses is to treat the root cause. There are some simple remedies that you can follow to recover from olfactory dysfunction. Check out the infographic below to know more! Some thing wrong with infographic shortcode. please verify shortcode syntax Both loss of taste and smell may be triggered by similar conditions or factors, like sinus, respiratory conditions, oral infections, head trauma, aging, etc. Fortunately, some home remedies can help regain taste and smell by easing nasal congestion during episodes of flu, cold, and respiratory diseases. Thanks to the ingredients, like garlic, castor oil, lemon, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, etc., which have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. However, loss of smell and taste may be permanent in case of aging, Alzheimer's, and chemical exposure. So, consult a doctor if the loss of both senses persists to determine if you have any of these underlying conditions. Frequently Asked Questions How long does the loss of taste and smell caused by COVID-19 last? [Dr. Jonathan M. Fields](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmfields/), DAOM, says, \"The loss of taste and smell caused by COVID-19 can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to over a year, and even permanently in some rare cases. Luckily, it is generally about 2-4 weeks for most people.\" Does Omicron affect taste and smell? Dr. Fields says, \"Omicron and the later variants have dramatically reduced their abilities to inhibit the sense of smell and taste.\" However, he feels it is still possible. Is loss of taste and smell normal with aging? Yes, it is normal with aging. Dr. Field says, \"Some people begin to have a decline in their senses of smell and taste naturally as they age.\" How long does it take for your taste buds to come back? Usually, taste buds have a cycle that lasts between 10-15 days, and they should come back within this period. However, it may take longer, depending on the cause of your condition. Can stress affect your sense of taste? Yes, longer and more severe cases of stress can cause olfactory loss or flavor distortion, which can make you consume more foods than you normally would. It may even cause a weird taste in your mouth and make foods taste foul. Does the loss of smell affect memory? Recent research on older people residing outside nursing homes has found that a decline in smell is linked to a quicker accumulation of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology detected in brain scans. The results prove that loss of smell is a crucial early sign of Alzheimer's-related cognitive decline and the buildup of linked dangerous proteins ( [24](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/loss-smell-linked-alzheimers-cognitive-impairment-and-biomarkers#:~:text=The%20findings%20provide%20additional%20evidence,the%20Journal%20of%20Alzheimer's%20Disease.)). Does low estrogen affect the sense of smell? Yes. A study has found that since estrogen protects the olfactory function, variations in its levels during specific physiological stages in women - such as pregnancy and postmenopause - can impact a person's capacity to detect and identify smells ( [25](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12584889/#:~:text=Since%20estrogen%20and%20progesterone%20protect,to%20feel%20and%20recognize%20smells.)). What medications can cause loss of smell and taste? Some examples of medications that can impair taste and smell include antihypertensive drugs, antihyperlipidemic drugs, antibiotics, neurologic drugs, and endocrine drugs ( [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6428580/#:~:text=In%20this%20longitudinal%20cohort%20study,altered%20taste%20and%20smell%20perception.)). Does high blood pressure affect taste buds? Yes. According to a study, people who self-reported having changed taste and smell perception also experienced higher systolic blood pressure and arterial pressure ( [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6428580/#:~:text=In%20this%20longitudinal%20cohort%20study,altered%20taste%20and%20smell%20perception.)). How to get your taste back instantly? The time it takes for taste buds to work again depends on the underlying reason for the lack of taste in the first place. However, you can try the above-mentioned remedies a few times to get your taste buds working again.
