NY [Soloman): Department ofMedicine, University e-mail: eliseops@medicine.ucsf.edu INTRODUCTION Selection and recruitment of qualified medical school graduates is a major concern of internal medi\u00ad cine residency directors and faculty at teaching insti\u00ad tutions. The process of residency program selection is highly competitive, particularly with regard to top\u00ad ranked applicants.\" Highly qualified underrepresent\u00ad ed minority (URM) applicants represent an ever\u00ad smaller proportion of candidates for residency programs. This is true despite the fact that minority populations are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population.' According to the U.S. Census Bureau's projections, African Americans, Latinos, American Indians/Alaskan Natives and Asians, which made up nearly 30% of the U.S. population in 2000, will comprise 47.2% by the year 2050.4 Despite the overall demographic changes in the United States, a decrease in URM applicants of 7.1% was noted from 1996 to 1997, such that minority applicants represent\u00ad ed only 11 % of the entire applicant pool to medical school.\" Much of this decrease may be attributed to changes in political climate, including limits or elimi\u00ad nation on affirmative action policy in key states.' On the other hand, the number of women enrolling in medical school has steadily increased over the last 25 years, with women enrollees making up 44.6% of all medical school enrollments in 2000.8 While it is clear that the most important aspect of recruitment involves increasing the number of quali\u00ad fied medical school applicants, it remains critical to internal medicine residency programs to be able to recruit excellent URM applicants and maintain an VOL.97,NO.9.

Information on the importance of 46 factors in choosing a particular residency program was obtained. Items chosen for evaluation were derived from prior studies/,II,12,'4,15,,7,18 discussion with pro\u00ad gram directors in internal medicine and focus group discussions with current residents. Focus group dis\u00ad cussions were used to generate evaluation items but did not address the cultural validity of the survey. The surveys were then pretested for completeness and clarity. Factors assessed included 14 on location characteristics, 20 on program features, six on recruitment strategies, three on future plans and three reflecting advice received. Location character\u00ad istics included questions on gender and ethnic diver\u00ad sity of residents, faculty, and patients and geograph\u00ad ic aspects of area. Questions also addressed programmatic factors, such as academic reputation, program size, program description, benefits/finan\u00ad cial incentives and emphasis on primary care as well as interview techniques and process opportunities for future training or jobs in the area and advice received from a role model, friend or dean. Data were gathered using a five-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating that the factor was not important and 5 indicating that the factor was very important in the applicant's selection of a particular residency pro\u00ad gram. A factor was described as important if it received a mean response of 3 or greater. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using SAS version 8.2.1 9 Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations and percents, were computed for each of the variables by gender and ethnicity (URM, Cau\u00ad casian and Asian). Initial exploratory analyses for race and gender differences included Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. We further developed logistic regression models to explore the association of eth\u00ad nicity (URM vs. non-URM) with the demographic measures and the factors in selecting a residency program. Our primary measures of outcomes were the factors in choosing a residency program. The major hypotheses were evaluated using analysis of covariance models (ANCOVA) to examine any gen\u00ad der or ethnic/racial group differences. For each out\u00ad come variable, we investigated the interactions among ethnicity, gender, age, marital status and class rank; we also compared Akaike's information criterion (AlC) and the residual log likelihood of the models with and without the interaction terms.\" Since the main effects models tended to be more 1266 JOURNAL OFTHE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION parsimonious with smaller AIC values, we decided to base our results on the main effects models. Esti\u00ad mates of adjusted means and standard errors (SE) were obtained by gender and by race, controlling for ethnicity, age, marital status and class rank. A signif\u00ad icance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. RESULTS Of the 2,908 students to whom a survey was sent, 88 surveys were returned for insufficient address, resulting in a total of 2,820 surveys presumably received by students. A total of 1,043 students returned completed questionnaires, for a response rate of37%. Of these respondents, 38 were IMG and were excluded from all analyses. Another eight respondents did not indicate their gender and were not included in the analysis. The demographic char\u00ad acteristics of the respondents are presented in Table 1.No information was available on the demographic characteristics ofnonrespondents due to the confi\u00ad dentiality of the NRMP list. The factors described as important to all residen\u00ad cy applicants in choosing a residency program are presented in Table 2. The factors felt to be most important were good house staff morale, the aca\u00ad demic reputation of the program, a positive inter\u00ad view experience, the variety of clinical experiences and location near spouse or significant other. Regression analysis demonstrated no significant interaction among gender, ethnicity, age and marital status. However, class ranking in the top third of the class was significantly negatively associated with URM status [OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.04-0.02)]. All variables were adjusted for in the ANCOVA results described below and in Tables 2 and 3. Results pre\u00ad sented depict adjusted means, SE and corresponding p values. The importance placed on factors determining residency choice differed by applicant gender (Table 2). The greatest differences in importance were seen regarding issues of gender diversity, where women rated the gender diversity of the faculty and house staff as important factors in their choice of residen\u00ad cy, whereas men did not. Although having a same\u00ad gender interviewer was more important to women than men, such an experience was not particularly important to applicants of either gender. While both men and women felt that a positive interview experi\u00ad ence was important, it was somewhat more impor\u00ad tant to women. Women placed more importance than men on familial issues, such as the location of the residency program being near their spouse/signifi\u00ad cant other (SO) or spouse's job, program support of applicants with children, and the presence of mater\u00ad nity and paternity leave policies. Men placed more importance on issues, such as the location of the res- VOL. 97. NO.9. SEPTEMBER 2005 idency program being near their spouse's family and future fellowship opportunities. Women placed a higher importance than men on issues of ethnic diversity in location and program characteristics when choosing a residency (Table 2). Women rated the following characteristics as more important than men: politics of the area being sup\u00ad portive of ethnic minorities; program academics supportive ofethnic minorities; serving the medical\u00ad ly indigent; and the ethnic diversity of the city, patient population, house staffand faculty. Several factors differed in importance among URM, Caucasian and Asian applicants (Table 3). Of the factors that differed among these groups, those that were most important to minority applicants were serving the medically underserved; amount of minority recruitment; feeling of being wanted; and ethnic diversity of the city, patients, house staff and faculty. An academic environment supportive of eth\u00ad nic minorities and a political climate supportive of minorities were also noted as more important to URM applicants. DISCUSSION Our study reveals that the most important factors in choosing a particular internal medicine residency program are similar for all applicants and reflect the program location and characteristics of the program, such as good house staff morale, academic reputa\u00ad tion and variety of clinical experiences provided. Although location characteristics are fixed, our study suggests there are several factors that a pro\u00ad gram may improve or emphasize to make their resi\u00ad dency more attractive to applicants. The most impor\u00ad tant of these appears to be creating a positive environment that reflects good house staff morale and a positive, rather than competitive, interview experience. In addition, applicants are looking for a program with a diversity of clinical experiences. Program directors should emphasize the variety of hospitals, clinics and specialty rotations available to their residency applicants and expand such opportu\u00ad nities if not already available. Although these find\u00ad ings may seem intuitive, there are no previously published empiric data from applicants that support these observations. An earlier survey of family med\u00ad icine program directors also found high-quality resi\u00ad dents and faculty as well as having residents with \"good attitudes\" to be markers of'success.\" Several other modifiable factors were ofparticular importance to women applicants. For example, women place significant emphasis on issues of gen\u00ad der diversity among the faculty and house staff. Thus, increasing the number and visibility of women facul\u00ad ty and residents may improve recruitment of highly qualified female applicants. Women also place a high JOURNAL OFTHE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SELECTION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM value on family-friendly program characteristics and location characteristics that are favorable for their spouse/SO. Simple measures, such as clearly stating maternity and paternity leave policies and demon\u00ad strating support of residents with children, may also improve recruitment. A survey of matriculating and graduating medical students in 1993-1994 showed that compared to men, women rated specific curricu\u00ad lar areas as having had inadequate instruction and that women were more likely to select a generalist special\u00ad ty. However, data on factors influencing choice of program have not been reported. 10 Both women and ethnic minorities place more importance on the ethnic diversity of the faculty and house staff. This suggests that increasing the number and visibility of faculty and house staff from diverse ethnic backgrounds is important for recruitment of these groups. Ethnic minorities also value a feeling of being wanted by the program, implying the importance of developing and implementing out\u00ad reach efforts to such individuals. Attracting minority physicians is ofkey importance to caring for all patients in the United States. Studies have demonstrated that minority physicians tend to serve members oftheir own racial or ethnic population group significantly more than they serve members of other groups, even after accounting for socioeconomic differences of area.222l Minority physicians are also more likely to serve in a health workforce shortage area\" and are more likelyto care for patients with Med\u00ad icaid and with no insurance,\" In addition to providing a disproportionate amount of the care to ethnic minority groups and medically indigent patients, there is also evidence to suggest that language-concordant physi\u00ad cians provide better quality of care to monolingual Spanish-speaking Latino patients.\" Furthermore, minority physicians can help to increase cultural awareness and reduce the language and cultural barri\u00ad ers that limit access to care for many minority patients.' Given these studies, recruitment of highly qualified minority applicants needs to be a priority among resi\u00ad dency programs, particularly those serving ethnically diverse and medically underserved populations. In our study, ethnic minorities placed significant importance on the ethnic diversity ofpatients and serv\u00ad ing the medically indigent; this is consistent with data demonstrating the likelihood ofminority physicians to care for medically underserved.\"\" In addition, our data suggest that women may be more likely to have an interest in serving these populations as well.

It is unclear how this low response rate may bias the results, if at all. Because we could not obtain sig\u00ad nificant demographic information on nonrespon\u00ad ders, it is difficult to assess how this may have influ\u00ad enced our results. Importantly, the gender and ethnicity characteristics of the respondents were similar to those applying to internal medicine resi\u00ad dencies nationally,\" indicating less likelihood of sig\u00ad nificant response bias based on those variables. Our study did have a greater proportion of Asian respon\u00ad dents and fewer African-American respondents in comparison to the national statistics, but this is like\u00ad ly secondary to the geography of the institutions sur\u00ad veyed. Furthermore, although response rate was low, we were able to survey more than 1,000 students, a large sample size for such a study. We were also able to survey applicants applying to multiple institu\u00ad tions, and representing a broad geographic range. It is important to note that the institutions studied rep\u00ad resented the east and west coasts, and not the mid\u00ad west and south, and therefore may not be generaliz\u00ad able to applicants primarily interested in those geographic areas of the country. Another limitation is that the class standing of our applicants represents the top of the applicant pool. Although this information is limited by self-report, it is likely correct, as the four institutions participating in SELECTION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM the study tend to be among the most competitive inter\u00ad nal medicine programs nationally. Our study was specifically designed to obtain information from these top applicants and because the study does not attempt to obtain information from the entire applicant pool, it may limit generalizability to other programs. The survey nature of the study may limit the com\u00ad pleteness of the information obtained. It is possible that there are other factors that applicants value high\u00ad ly that were not asked in the survey. We attempted to limit the chance of this with a thorough review of the literature, discussions with program directors and pretests of the survey with residents to assess for completeness. Finally, we recognize that many of the numerical differences seen between applicant groups, although statistically significant, are small and may not represent meaningful differences. Furthermore, because we tested for multiple associations, it is pos\u00ad sible that some of the differences seen are simply a matter of chance. We attempted to limit this possibili\u00ad ty by adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Scheffe method. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, we are the first to report on the relative importance of various factors in choosing a residency program among minority applicants. In summary, we conclude that internal medicine residency applicants value programmatic and location factors most highly in choosing a particular internal medicine residency program.

JOURNALOF THENATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION VOL.97.NO.9. SEPTEMBER 2005 1269 SELECTION OF INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM may enhance applicant interest in an internal medicine residency program, as these factors appear to be key in applicants' choice of residency program. Diversity of clinical experiences should also be emphasized and enhanced. For those programs with particular interest in recruiting women and ethnic minorities, emphasis might be placed on expanding gender and ethnic diver\u00ad sity among residents and faculty in the long-term. In the short-term, program directors can pay particular attention to voicing an interest in these issues and in the case of ethnic minorities, reaching out to them to make them feel more wanted. These interventions should be studied further to evaluate their effect on the ability of residency programs to recruit highly qualified female and minority applicants.

CARR, MD A nemia is a com\u00ad mon medical prob\u00ad lem with multiple and varied causes that must be clearly under\u00ad stood to provide an ade\u00ad quate differential diagnosis and facilitate management. Appropriate treatment of anemia can significantlyim\u00ad prove quality of life. Anemia is defined as a disease resulting from a decrease in the normal amount of circulating hemoglobin, which leads to a reduction of the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. The normal he\u00ad moglobin range can be different in individuals, depend\u00ad ing upon age, sex, and race. I For example, in a neonate the hemoglobin level is between 18 and 22 g/dl., By the age of 3 months, it decreases to 1 to 17 g/dl., and in women of childbearing age, the normal range is from 12 to 14 gldL. In general, normal hemoglobin levels are 1 to 2 g/dl, lower in women and in African-American men than in white men. Also, some studies have found that the healthy elderly have lower hemoglobin than do younger adults.>' Overall, the World Health Organiza\u00ad tion (\\tVHO) recommends a hemoglobin level above 12.0 g/dl, for women and 13.0 g/dl, for men.\" EPIDEMIOLOGY prevalence of ane\u00ad Dr.Carr IsAssociate ProfessorofMedicineandAssociateDeanofStu\u00ad dents at Boston University School of is a sec\u00ad ond-year fellow ingeneralinternal medicine/women's healthatBoston women was among the elderly; 16.5% were anemic according to the WHO standard, with a he\u00ad moglobin level below 12.0 g/dl., The lowest preva\u00ad lence of anemia was among those ages 55 to 64, where the prevalence was 2.2%. The overall preva\u00ad lence of anemia was 2.5%. Iron deficiency is by far the most common cause of anemia among women of childbearing age because of loss of iron during menstru\u00ad ation. Anemia is less likely to occur in women taking birth control pills, due to decreased blood flow during menstruation, and more likely to occur in women with certain kinds of intrauterine devices, which can cause menorrhagla.V\" Perimenopausal women often have menorrhagia, which can result from fibroids and fluctu\u00ad ating hormonal levels. Therapy needs to be determined by the cause. Pernicious anemia is most prevalent in persons of Northern European descent, occurring in 0.1 %.9,10 Thalassemia minor is a common cause of mild anemia in patients from the Mediterranean or the Far East.'! Sickle cell disease affects one in 375 African-Ameri\u00ad cans; hence, screening for anemia in such populations is important. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Women with anemia most frequently present with fa\u00ad tigue, tachycardia, palpitations, and dyspnea on exer\u00ad tion. The history needs to include a detailed calendar of WOMEN'S HEALTH in Primary Care Vol. 8, No. 7/AUGUST 2005 Aggarwal &Carr: Work-Up of Women With Anemia The redbloo isllc of iron defici anemia, the mean corp redblood cells is decreased, t . pallor is increased, and the overall sizes shapes oftheredblood cells areless uniform. menstruation, with frequency, du\u00ad ration of flow, and the presence or absence of clots noted. Gastroin\u00ad testinal symptoms associated with etiologies of blood loss, such as peptic ulcer disease (abdominal pain one to two hours after eating), gastritis (heartburn), prolonged vomiting, and other forms of blood Joss in the gut, such as gastroe\u00ad sophageal reflux disease (GERD), as well as the presence of dark tarry stools or bright red blood in stools (evldenclng lower-gastrointestinal bleeding) should also be noted as a routine part of the history. INITIAL WORK-UP There are numerous ways to ap\u00ad proach the diagnosis and classifi\u00adcation of anemia. The most com\u00ad mon approach is on a pathophysi\u00ad ologic basis, ie, whether the ane\u00ad mia is related to diminished production of or loss of red blood cells (RBCs)y,13 Table 1 shows an anemia classification based on pathophysiology. This can be deter\u00ad mined by evaluating the reticulo\u00ad cyte count with the complete blood count. If the reticulocyte count is high, blood Joss is the etiology, al\u00ad though early on, reticulocytes may not be present. If reticulocytes are absent or low, the anemia results from reduced production of RBCs. Another diagnostic approach categorizes anemia based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV) into the subtypes microcytic, normocytic, iOPeg Gerrity 2005 or macrocytic, as outlined in Table 2.12,13 Either approach can be used, or they can be combined. Initial testing of the anemic pa\u00ad tient should include a \"complete\" blood count (CBC). This routinely includes hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit levels, RBC count, RBC indices, and the white blood cell count. Anemia is defined in terms of red cell mass and hemoglobin con\u00ad centration. In a new presentation of anemia, before further evaluation, the blood test should be repeated to avoid a false-positive diagnosis.This could occur when the plasma vol\u00ad ume is expanded, such as in preg\u00ad nancy, or alternatively, anemia could be masked ifthe patientisdehydrat\u00ad ed with a decreased plasma volume. WOMEN/S HEALTH in Primary Care Vol. 8, No. 7/AUGUST 2005 A.ggarwal &Carr: Work-Up of Women WithA.nemia Diagnosing nemia in Women Anemia is a common medical problem in women, occurring more frequently than in men, due to blood loss from menstruation and childbirth and as a result of certain problems that occur more often in women, such as collagen vascular disease. Finding the precise etiology is necessary to appropriately manage the anemia. Women with anemia typically present with fatigue, tachycardia, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion. History taking should include a detailed menstrual calendar that records frequency, duration of flow, and the presence or absence of clots. Gastrointestinal symptoms like heartburn or dark tarry stools should also be noted. Confirming the diagnosis of anemia is an essential first step. The most common approach is to measure hemoglobin and hematocrit in venous blood with a complete blood count and classify the anemia according to the diminished production or increased destruction of red blood cells. An alternative approach to diagnosing anemia is to measure mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and categorize the anemia into microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic subtypes. Iron deficiency anemia, thalassemias, and anemia of chronic disease are associated with low MCV (less than 80 fl.), while pernicious anemia is associated with a high MCV (above 100 fl.). Appropriate treatment can significantly improve quality of life, but the multiple and varied causes of anemia must be clearly understood to provide an adequate differential diagnosis and facilitate management. Confirming the anemia is the essen\u00ad tial first step. MCV.mean corpuscular hemo\u00ad globin concentration, and red cell distribution width (ROW) help in the assessment of erythrocyte size, hemoglobin concentration. and shape. The combined use of MCV and ROW can facilitate the classi\u00ad fication of anemia. If the MCV is normal but the ROW is high, there is variation of the red cell size, which can indicate an iron deficien\u00ad cy anemia, with large reticulocytes released prematurely from the bone marrow mixed with the small cells normally seen with decreased he\u00ad moglobin. Examination of a Wrlght's-stalned peripheral blood smear will confirm this etiology. CLASSIFICATION MICROCYTIC ANEMIA Low MCV (less than 80 fL) is asso\u00ad ciated with microcytic anemia. Al\u00ad though it is most commonly caused by iron deficiency, other common causes (eg, thalassemia and ane\u00ad mia of chronic disease) should also be considered. These syndromes can be differentiated by several simple blood tests (Table 3), such as an iron level and total iron-bind\u00ad ing capacity (TrBC), or a ferritin level for iron deficiency anemia. Another blood test, a hemoglobin electrophoresis, can detect a vari\u00ad ant hemoglobin, such as in sickle cell disease or thalassemia. A more difficult test, the bone marrow biopsy, can reveal absent iron stores in iron deficiency anemia or increased iron in the anemia of chronic disease. This test is rarely needed for these etiologies but is useful in anemias of bone marrow infiltration and the sideroblastic anemias. IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron stored in the body is critically balanced between dietary intake and the amount required by the body. The average American diet contains an intake of 10 to 15 mg of iron per day, but only 10% of that is absorbed. Women lose significant amounts of iron during menstrua\u00ad tion; these quantities can be highly variable.\" On average, women need 3 to 4 mg per day of absorbed WOMEN'S HEALTH in Primary Care Vol. 8, No. 7/AUGUST 2005 Aggarwal & Carr: Work-Up of Women With Anemia Table 1.Traditional classification of anemiabasedon pathophysiology iron in their diet to keep up with the menstrual loss. Also, during preg\u00ad nancy and lactation, dietary iron re\u00ad quirements increase. Another cause of iron deficiency in women is gas\u00ad trointestinal bleeding (Table 4). Clinical presentation: Mild ane\u00ad mia generally presents with easy fatigability, tachycardia, palpita\u00ad tions, and tachypnea on exertion. Severe anemia mucosal changes like glossitis, an\u00ad gular cheilosis, and koilonychias. like dysphasia (Plummer-Vinson syndrome) may also occur. Pica is often found among patients with iron deficiency anemia. Diagnostic test results: Microcyt\u00ad ic, hypochromic erythrocytes with occasional \"pencil\" and target forms are pathognomonic for iron deficiency anemia. Simple labora\u00ad tory blood tests such as the CBC, peripheral blood smears, and iron indices show low iron and ferritin levels, high TIBC, and high RDW (Table 3). Treatment: Oral iron supplements like ferrous gluconate or polysac\u00ad charide-iron preparations are well tolerated and have few gastroin\u00ad testinal side effects. Ferrous sulfate is a less well-tolerated iron supple\u00ad ment that also can be used. It is recommended to take iron with a citrus juice (for vitamin C) on an empty stomach for better absorp\u00ad tion and fewer side effects. Oral iron replacements can take up to eight or nine months to restore iron reserves, depending on the severi\u00ad ty of the anemia. Total body iron can be rapidly replaced by an intra\u00ad venous administration of iron, but this is rarely needed and is re\u00ad served only for patients refractory to oral iron replacement.\" ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE Anemia of chronic disease is the second most prevalent type of ane\u00admia after iron deficiency anemia.\" It is found primarily among pa\u00ad tients with chronic inflammation, infection, and autoimmune dis\u00ad ease.17IB Patients present with sim\u00ad ilar symptoms of anemia (fatigue, tachycardia, palpitations, and dys\u00ad pnea on exertion). Severity of symptoms depends upon the level of anemia, which can range from mild (hemoglobin levels of 10 to 11 gldL) to severe anemia (hemoglo\u00ad bin < 8 gldL; 20% of cases).\" In general, anemia of chronic disease is a normochromic, hypoprolifera\u00ad tive anemia, but when severe, it can be hypochromic and microcyt\u00ad ic. Measurement of total iron, TIBC, and ferritin help to distln\u00ad gulsh the anemia of chronic dis\u00ad ease from iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia (Table 3).20 Table 5 outlines the possible causes of anemia of chronic disease. THALASSEMIAS The thalassemias are hereditary dis\u00ad orders characterized by reduction in the synthesis ofglobin chains, either alpha (a) or beta (~), leading to de\u00ad creased production of hemoglobin (Tables 6 and 7). Normal hemoglo\u00ad bin chain synthesis is a 2/W.Thal\u00ad assemia trait is present when one gene is affected, as opposed to both genes; the latter is known as thal\u00ad assemia major. This is most com\u00ad monly found in persons ofAsian or African ethnicity and in those of Mediterranean extractlon.v-> Clinical presentation for a-tha\u00ad lassemia is variable, depending upon the number of alleles affect\u00ad ed (Table 6).13,16,22 Patients with only one allele are asymptomatic with a normal blood smear. (If all four alleles are affected, fetal demise occurs.) Patients with thal\u00ad assemia trait and thalassemia minor do not require any specific treatment. Thalassemia major re\u00ad quires appropriate monitoring of RBC indices and management de\u00ad pending on the level of hemoglo\u00ad bin. Low hemoglobin \u00ab 8 gldL) may require transfusion. Patients WOMEN'S HEALTH in Primary Care Vol. 8, No. 7/AUGUST 2005 Aggarwal & Carr: Work-Up of Women With Anemia Table 2. Differential diagnosis of with hemoglobin H (thalassemia anemia based on Mev major) have a tendency for oxida\u00ad tive injury in the presence of infec\u00ad tions and need to be monitored for transfusion.\" The majority of patients with ~\u00ad thalassemia minor (Table 7) are asymptomatic but have a mild hypochromic microcytic anemia similar to iron deficiency anemia. They have microcytosis (MCV above 75 fL) even when the hemo\u00ad globin is above 10 g/dl., and they have a normal RDW. Twenty per\u00ad cent of these patients develop splenomegaly. Women with ~\u00ad thalassemia develop more pro\u00ad found anemia of pregnancy, but outcomes are generally favorable.> Patients with thalassemia major first manifest symptoms at age 6 months with pallor, irritabili\u00ad ty, growth retardation, hepato\u00ad splenomegaly, and jaundice (he\u00ad molysts).> Later these patients develop symptoms associated with ineffective erythropoiesis, eg, bony abnormalities and abnormal skele\u00ad tal development. Eighty percent of untreated children die within the first five years of life, due to severe anemia, high-output congestive heart failure, and infections.\" ~-thalassemia minor requires constant monitoring and is treated with occasional transfusions as needed. Treatment for ~-tha\u00ad lassemia major is more complicat\u00ad ed and requires repeated transfu\u00ad sions. Management of transfusion complications is considered to be a regular part of therapy. Patients with l3-thalassemia major need splenectomy and iron chelation with deferoxarnlne.> There are other therapies under investigation, eg, the use of allogeneic bone mar\u00ad row transplant and gene therapy.\" MACROCYTIC ANEMIA Pernicious anemia, dietary defi\u00ad ciency of vitamin B12 (rare), and folic acid deficiency (more com\u00ad mon in the elderly) can lead to a macrocytic anemia (MCV above 100 fL). Alcohol abuse and medica\u00ad tions can also cause macrocytic anemia. PERNICIOUS ANEMIA Although more common in older adults of Northern European de\u00ad scent, pernicious anemia has also been found among younger black females. It is a hereditary disorder which presents only after age 35. Pernicious anemia is caused by de\u00ad fective absorption of vitamin Bt 2 (cobalamin). Cobalamin binds with intrinsic factor in the stomach to prevent enzymatic degradation and is absorbed in the terminal ileum. Antibodies against intrinsic factor decrease the cobalamin absorption leading to anemia. Gastric surgery, removal of the terminal ileum, or bacterial overgrowth in the ileum can also cause a decrease in ab\u00ad sorption of cobalamin. Absence of cobalamin leads to the formation of abnormal blood cells causing inef\u00ad fective erythropoiesis, or formation of blood cells. Clinical presentation: A mega\u00ad loblastic state causes changes in the Table 3. lab results typical of microcytic anemia WOMEN'S HEALTH in Primary Care Vol. 8, No. 7/AUGUST 2005 Aggarwal & Carr: Work-Up of Women With Anemia mucosal cells, such as glossitis and diarrhea. It also causes severe ab\u00ad normalities in the peripheral ner\u00ad vous system leading to paresthesias, difficulty in balance, neuropsychi\u00ad atric changes, and even dementia. Diagnostic test results: General\u00ad ly the MCV is above 110 fL, but sometimes there is a normal MCV with vitamin B12 deficiency in the presence of a combined microcyt\u00ad ic anemia. The peripheral blood smear shows hypersegmented count. Since vi\u00ad tamin Bl 2 deficiency causes abnor\u00ad mal hematopoiesis, it also leads to low production of white blood cells and platelets. The vitamin B'2 assay as part of the Schilling test helps to estab\u00ad lish the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Some recommend testing for increased serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are more sensitive in the early stages of Bl 2 deficiency, in making the diagnosis.\" Treatment: Replacement of vitamin B12 is initiatedwith intramuscular in\u00ad jections of 1,000 mg weekly for four weeks and then monthly for life. Oral supplements of Bl 2 can be used after the first month of injections, if absorption is not a problem.\" CONCLUSION The evaluation and diagnosis of anemia, a common medical prob\u00ad lem, requires finding the precise etiology in order to appropriately manage the underlying cause. Ane\u00ad mia occurs more frequently in women, due to blood loss during menstruation and childbirth and also as a result of certain problems that occur more frequently in women, such as collagen vascular disease. A full understanding of the pathophysiology of anemia facili\u00ad tates a rational approach to its management. ?~ WOMEN'S HEALTH in Primary Care Table 4.

BARNETT, Ph.D.,1KAREN C. GAREIS, Ph.D.,1and PHYLLIS L. CARR, M.D.2 ABSTRACT Objective : To better understand the career satisfaction and factors related to retention of wo- men physicians who work reduced hours and are in dual-earner couples in comparison totheir full-time counterparts. Methods : Survey of a random sample of female physicians between 25 and 50 years of age working within 25 miles of Boston, whose names were obtained from the Board of Registra-tion in Medicine in Massachusetts. Interviewers conducted a 60-minute face-to-face closed-ended interview after interviewees completed a 20-minute mailed questionnaire. Results : Fifty-one full-time physicians and 47 reduced hours physicians completed the study; the completion rate was 49.5%. The two groups were similar in age, years as a physician, meanhousehold income, number of children, and presence of an infant in the home. Reduced hoursphysicians in this sample had a different relationship to experiences in the family than full-time physicians. (1) When reduced hours physicians had low marital role quality, there wasan associated lower career satisfaction; full-time physicians report high career satisfaction re-gardless of their marital role quality. (2) When reduced hours physicians had low marital roleor parental role quality, there was an associated higher intention to leave their jobs than forfull-time physicians; when marital role or parental role quality was high, there was an asso-ciated lower intention to leave their jobs than for full-time physicians. (3) When reduced hoursphysicians perceived that work interfering with family was high, there was an associatedgreater intention to leave their jobs that was not apparent for full-time physicians. Conclusions : Women physicians in this sample who worked reduced hours had stronger re- lationships between family experiences (marital and parental role quality and work interfer-ence with family) and professional outcomes than had their full-time counterparts. Both ca-reer satisfaction and intention to leave their employment are correlated with the quality ofhome life for reduced hours physicians. INTRODUCTION WITH THE ADVENT OF MORE dual-earner cou- ples, increasing numbers of women physi- cians are seeking part-time or reduced hours em-ployment, largely to allow greater time for family. 1The percentage of part-time pediatricians in-creased from 11% to 15% between 1993 and 2000. 1 Previous work has shown that there is little dif-ference in a number of outcomes for reduced hoursphysicians compared w ith their fu ll-time counter- parts, including job role quality and career satis- 1Women's Studies Research Center, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts. 2Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.

Most women physicians who work reduced hours likely do so to accommodate family mat-ters. 13Little is known, however, about the effects of family on career satisfaction for full-time andpart-time physicians or of the effect of family onthe reported likelihood of retention of womenphysicians in full-time and part-time work roles.We conducted a study of full-time and reducedhours female physicians in dual-earner couples tobetter understand how career satisfaction and like-lihood of leaving the job were related to family in-dicators, such as marital role quality, parental rolequality, and a work interfering with family scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample The sample was randomly drawn from the Board of Registration in Medicine, which licensesall physicians practicing in the Commonwealthof Massachusetts. 2First, we identified a subsam- ple of female physicians between 25 and 50 yearsof age who worked within a 25-mile radius ofBoston and sent them introductory letters de-scribing the study. Next, trained screeners con-tacted each physician to determine if she met theeligibility criteria for inclusion in the study. A wo-man physician was eligible if she worked full-time or reduced hours as defined by her em-ployer. All reduced hours physicians worked atleast 20 hours per week, and all participants werein dual-earner couples, with husbands workingat least 20 hours per week, and all couples had atleast one child who was under high school age.Our goal was to interview 50 full-time and 50 re-duced hours physicians to have adequate statis-tical power to test our hypothesis. However, re-duced hours physicians were harder to locatethan were their full-time counterparts. Therefore,we expanded our sampling strategy by askingparticipants to nominate eligible physicians andby asking Partners, an umbrella organization representing physicians from a number of majorBoston hospitals, to send out a letter to memberphysicians asking eligible staff to contact us ifthey were interested in participating. These ef-forts resulted in 6 additional participants. Data were collected between September 1999 and March 2001. The final sample consisted of 51full-time doctors and 47 reduced hours doctors(n/H1100598). For purposes of this study, a doctor was categorized as full-time or reduced hours ifher employer considered her to be so. We alsoqueried participants, both full-time and reducedhours, to see if they were working their preferrednumber of hours. Among the 92 doctors obtainedvia random sampling, the completion or cooper-ation rate was 49.5% (calculated as participantsdivided by participants plus refusers). An addi-tional 6 respondents were volunteers or werenominated by other doctors as eligible. Procedures Screeners passed on the names of eligible and willing participants to trained interviewers.These interviewers sent a recruitment package toeach potential participant indicating that shewould be called shortly to set up an interview.The letter described the time commitment and re-muneration that participation in the study wouldentail. The package also included endorsementsfrom the Massachusetts Medical Society and the5504_07_p146-153 3/7/05 2:02 PM Page 147 American Medical Women's Association, along with two papers describing our previous projectwith reduced hours physicians. Trained inter-viewers conducted 60-minute face-to-face closed-ended interviews with each participant at a timeand place convenient to the participant. Each par-ticipant also completed a 20-minute mailed ques-tionnaire in advance and returned it at the timeof the interview. The interview and mailed sur-vey covered various objective and subjective as-pects of participants' jobs (e.g., salary, number ofhours worked, career satisfaction, schedule fit),the quality of their major social roles (partner,parent, employee), and various quality of life in-dicators (e.g., psychological distress, life satisfac-tion, physical symptoms). Each physician re-ceived $25 for her participation. Measures The outcomes for this analysis were (1) inten- tion to leave the job within a year and (2) careersatisfaction. Intention to leave the job was a sin-gle item question asking participants to use a 7-point scale to indicate the likelihood that theywould voluntarily terminate their present em-ployment within the next 12 months. We mea-sured career satisfaction using a scale developedfor a study of academic physicians (for a de-scription of the sample and methods, see ref. 14).Participants used a 7-point scale to rate six as-pects of career satisfaction: (1) their current worksetting, (2) their potential to achieve their profes-sional goals, (3) their overall professional prac-tice, (4) the extent to which this practice met theirexpectations, (5) their overall professional re-search, and (6) the extent to which this researchmet their expectations. Cronbach's alpha was 0.86in the present sample. The predictors of career satisfaction and likeli- hood of leaving the job in 1 year were parentalrole quality, marital role quality, and work-fam-ily interference. We used a measure of parentalrole quality by Barnett et al. 15Respondents indi- cated on a 4-point scale the degree to which eachof a list of 44 parenting items was currently ei-ther rewarding or of concern. Concern items werenegatively weighted, and reward items were pos-itively weighted in constructing the role qualityscore, which was the weighted average of the in-dividual item scores. In the present sample, Cron-bach's alpha was 0.92 for the rewards and 0.83for the concerns. We measured marital role qual-BARNETT ET AL. 148 ity using a 15-item brief form16of the marital role quality scale.17Respondents indicated on a 4- point scale the degree to which each of a list ofrelationship items was currently either reward-ing or of concern. Internal consistency was excel-lent, with Cronbach's alphas of 0.91 for rewardsand 0.89 for concerns in the present sample. Weassessed work-family interference using itemsfrom a scale developed by MacDermid et al. 18We selected one item each addressing the energy,strain, and behavioral components of work-fam-ily interference along with a fourth, more globalitem assessing the overall severity of work-fam-ily interference. Cronbach's alpha was 0.73 in thepresent sample. The moderator, which is a variable that can in- fluence the strength of the relationship betweentwo other variables, full-time vs. reduced-hoursstatus as defined by the employer, was scored asa dichotomous variable (1 /H11005full-time, 2 /H11005re- duced hours). Covariates for all regression analy-ses included the presence of at least one preschoolchild at home, years as a physician, household income per capita, and negative affectivity. Formoderator analyses involving marital role qual-ity, years married was included as an additionalcovariate; for moderator analyses involvingwork-family interference, husband's work hourswas included as an additional covariate. Years as a physician and years married are self- explanatory. We assessed husband's work hoursby asking respondents to estimate the number ofhours their husbands worked in an average workweek. Presence of a preschool child was coded asa dummy variable (1 /H11005at least one child under 5 years of age in the home, 0 /H11005else). We calculated household income per capita by dividing each re-spondent's report of yearly household income bythe number of people living in the household. Be-cause the distribution of this variable is highlyskewed, we used the natural log of per capita in-come. We assessed negative affectivity using the Trait Anxiety Scale, 19on which respondents indicated on a 4-point scale the degree to which they werecharacterized by 10 specific traits. Internal consis-tency was high, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.90 inthe present sample. We controlled for negative af-fectivity, an individual trait predisposing to a neg-ative view of the world, because it is thought to ac-count for spuriously high correlations betweenself-report measures of predictor and outcomevariables, especially in cross-sectional analyses. 20,215504_07_p146-153 3/7/05 2:02 PM Page 148 RETENTION PREDICTORS FOR PART-TIME PHYSICIANS 149 Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS software (Chicago, IL). We generated frequency distribu-tions and descriptive statistics (means and stan-dard deviations [SD]) for comparisons of responsesby work status. Independent sample ttests were computed to test the significance of differences be-tween full-time and reduced hours physicians. We hypothesized that the quality of family life\u2014which we assessed with measures of parentalrole quality, marital role quality, and perceptionsof work-family interference\u2014would be a strongerpredictor of career satisfaction and intention toleave their jobs among reduced hours physiciansthan among their full-time counterparts. To test this hypothesis, we first estimated a se- ries of six main effects simultaneous regressionmodels predicting two outcomes: career satisfac-tion and intention to leave one's job. In all mod-els, the predictors included one of the variablesassessing the quality of family life (i.e., parentalrole quality, marital role quality, or work-familyinterference) along with the hypothesized mod-erator, full-time vs. reduced hours status. As dis-cussed, all models included the following co-variates: presence of a preschool child, years as aphysician, household income, and negative af-fectivity. Additional covariates included length ofmarriage in the analyses involving marital rolequality and husband's work hours in the analy-ses involving work-family interference. To test whether there was a significant moder- ating effect of working full-time or reducedhours, we added an interaction term of the formPREDICTOR /H11003MODERATOR to each regres- sion model. In this way, we could determinewhether the addition of the interaction term ex-plained a significant proportion of the varianceover and above that explained by the simplermodel. A significant increase in proportion ofvariance explained would support the modera-tion hypothesis; that is, that the relationship link-ing quality of family life to a particular outcomewas different for full-time physicians than for re-duced hours physicians. RESULTS Our study included 51 full-time physicians. Re- duced hours physicians (47) worked a mean of 32.1hours per week (range 20-60 hours per week), andfull-time physicians worked 48.7 hours per week (range 35-90 hours per week), a difference of 16.5hours ( p/H110050.000). There was no difference in the mean age of the physicians in the two groups (40.5years vs. 39.9 years, p/H110050.563) or in the number of years as a physician (10.8 years vs. 9.6 years, p/H11005 0.354). Full-time physicians, however, had beenworking full-time for a longer period than reducedhours physicians had been working reduced hours(85.6 months vs. 48.2 months, t(93.4) /H110053.33, p/H11005 0.001). There was no difference in the mean house-hold income ($244,421 vs. $229,889; p/H110050.625), the proportion of physicians practicing in an academicsetting (3 full-time physicians vs. 2 reduced hoursphysicians), the number of children (2.3 vs. 2.1, p/H11005 0.468), or the presence of an infant in the home(19.6% vs. 17.0%; p/H110050.744). In addition, there was no difference between the two groups in the like-lihood of having a preschool (60.8% vs. 74.5%, p/H11005 0.150), a school age (59.6% a teenage child (27.5% vs. 14.9%, p/H110050.129) at home. In our sample, there was a difference between full-time and reduced hours physicians in the re-lationship between marital role quality and career satisfaction ( p/H110050.017). Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, the career satisfaction of re-duced hours women physicians was morestrongly associated with their marital role qual-ity than was the career satisfaction of full-timewomen physicians. Low marital role quality wasassociated with low career satisfaction among thereduced hours physicians, whereas marital rolequality appeared to be unrelated to career satis-faction among the full-time physicians. There was also a significant interaction effect of full-time vs. reduced hours status on the rela-tionship between marital role quality and inten-tion to leave one's job ( p/H110050.004) in our sample. As shown in Figure 2, when marital role qualitywas low, reduced hours physicians expressed agreater intention to leave their job within a yearthan did full-time physicians. When marital rolequality was high, however, reduced hours physi-cians expressed less intention to leave their jobsthan did their full-time counterparts. Full-time vs. reduced hours status in our sam- ple was also a significant moderator of the rela-tionship between parental role quality and inten-tion to leave one's job ( p/H110050.006). As shown in Figure 3, when there was high parental role qual-ity, there was no difference in intention to leavethe job between the two groups. However, when5504_07_p146-153 3/7/05 2:02 PM Page 149 BARNETT ET AL. 150 there was low parental role quality, reduced hours physicians were more likely than their full-time counterparts to express a greater intentionto leave their jobs within 1 year. Finally, full-time and reduced hours physicians in our sample differed in the relationship be-tween work-family interference and intention toleave their jobs ( p/H110050.038). As shown in Figure 4, for full-time physicians, there appears to be lit-tle relationship between work-family interferenceand intention to leave the job. In contrast, highwork-family interference for reduced hoursphysicians was associated with a higher intentionto leave their jobs within 1 year.DISCUSSION In this sample, family experiences were more strongly associated with professional outcomesamong women physicians who worked reducedhours than among their full-time counterparts.Career satisfaction and reported likelihood ofleaving their job within a year for reduced hourswomen physicians were strongly related to thequality of their marital and parental roles, as wellas their sense of work interfering with family. Forfull-time women physicians, there was much lessassociation between family life and professionaloutcomes. Interestingly, when marital role qual- FIG. 1.

It may be more difficultto spend greater hours away from home in thesecircumstances for full-time physicians, whereaspart-time physicians may have better balancedthe time they have to spend with their families intheir work schedules. As this is a cross-sectionalstudy, we have no way of knowing if the highmarital role quality is the predictor or the out-come of the higher intention to leave the job. Equal to or higher productivity and job per- formance of part-time women physicians com-pared with their full-time counterparts have beenfound in a number of studies, 5,10comparing fa- vorably to findings in other professions.11,12Wo- men physicians who choose reduced hours workmay be more concerned about the ways in whichthey meet their obligations both at work and athome and may find that such schedules improvetheir ability to meet both standards. More de-tailed research into the reasons that womenchoose reduced hours, other than the overarch-ing reason of accommodating family, is requiredto answer these questions. There is a general trend in studies of various populations for both men and women to reportthat they want jobs that allow them to be invested FIG. 3.

There are a number of limitations to our study. The time-consuming and in-depth quality of thiswork does not permit large sample sizes, whichmay restrict the generalizability of our findings.Similarly, our data are from one geographic re-gion, which may vary from other areas in termsof the percent of practice in managed care con-tracts, other styles of practice, and unmeasuredregional variations. There are a number of strengths to our study. We have examined the relationship of maritalrole quality, parental role quality, and work in-terfering with family with intention to leave thejob and career satisfaction for women physiciansworking reduced hours and full-time. Such astudy has not previously been done.

CONCLUSIONS Part-time women physicians appear to be more sensitive than their full-time peers to family ex-periences in terms of their career satisfaction andtheir reported intention to leave their jobs. Withhigher productivity, similar patient satisfactionand ambulatory costs, as well as equal to higher-quality performance, employers would be wise toencourage programs for reduced hours physi-cians, improve conditions, and permit flexiblework patterns for physicians who desire part-time or reduced hours employment.

Berlowitz, Arlene S. Ash, Mark Glickman, Robert H. Friedman, Leonard M. Pogach, Audrey L. Nelson, andAshley T . Wong Objective. To develop a valid quality measure that captures clinical inertia, the failure to initiate or intensify therapy in response to medical need, in diabetes care and to link this process measure with outcomes of glycemic control. Data Sources. Existing databases from 13 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals between 1997 and 1999. Study Design. Laboratory results, medications, and diagnoses were collected on 23,291 patients with diabetes. We modeled the decision to increase antiglycemic med-ications at individual visits. We then aggregated all visits for individual patients and calculated a treatment intensity score by comparing the observed number of increases to that expected based on our model. The association between treatment intensity and twomeasures of glycemic control, change in HbA1c during the observation period, and whether the outcome glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was greater than 8 percent, was then examined. Principal Findings. Increases in antiglycemic medications occured at only 9.8 per- cent of visits despite 39 percent of patients having an initial HbA1c level greater than 8 percent. A clinically credible model predicting increase in therapy was developedwith the principal predictor being a recent HbA1c greater than 8 percent. There wereconsiderable differences in the intensity of therapy received by patients. Those patients receiving more intensive therapy had greater improvements in control ( po.001). Conclusions. Clinical inertia can be measured in diabetes care and this process measure is linked to patient outcomes of glycemic control. This measure may be useful in efforts to improve clinicians management of patients with diabetes. Key Words. Diabetes mellitus, outcomes assessment, quality of health care Central to improving clinical practice is reliable and valid measures of the quality of care. While process and outcome measures each play an important role in quality measurement, it has long been recognized that the development of process measures that are linked to outcomes is an importantrHealth Research and Educational Trust DOI: 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00436.x 1836health services research goal (Brook, McGlynn, and Cleary 1996). The presence of such links helps validate the process measure and quality improvement resources may be redirected to those processes shown to havethe greatest impact on patient outcomes (Hammermeister et al. 1995). Yet establishing links between process and outcome measures in observational studies is not easy and paradoxical results in which more intensive care produces worse outcomes often arise because of confounding by indication (Rubin, Pronovost, and Diette 2001). We now attempt to develop a quality measure for describing clinicians' practices in the pharmacological manage- ment of diabetes mellitus and to link this process measures to important intermediate outcomes of glycemic control. Diabetes is a common medical problem that often has a signicant negative impact on a patient's health status. Studies of the quality of diabetes care have frequently demonstrated a wide gap between recommendedmedical practices and the care that diabetes patients actually receive (Saaddine et al. 2002). This is particularly true for the management of hyperglycemia in which many patients have inadequate glycemic control (O'Connor et al. 1996; Chin et al. 2000; Harris 2000; El-Kebbi et al. 2001). Guidelines published by the American Diabetes Association (2003) identify hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of less than 7 percent as desirable and have long recommended that clinicians take action when HbA1c levels are greater than 8 percent. Diabetes treatment protocols typically encourage stepped intensication of pharmacological therapy until goals for glycemic controlare et al. 1994; Abraira et al. 1995; El-Kebbi et al. 1997). Yet medical practice studies nd that clinicians often do not follow these Address correspondence to Dan R. Berlowitz, M.D., M.P.H., CHQOER, ENRM VA Hospital, 200 Springs Road, Dan R.

Recently, the term clinical inertia has been proposed to dene the phenomenon by which health care providers fail to initiate or intensify therapy when indicated (Phillips et al. 2001). Moreover, it is increasingly recognized as among the most important barriers to achieving control of chronic medical conditions ( Javors and Bramble 2003). Efforts to improve care by identifying and minimizing clinical inertia may then have a signicant impact in enhancing outcomes for patients with diabetes. Before this can be accomplished, however, one must be able to measure clinical inertia. Two measures of clinical inertia in diabetes care have been used previously: the proportion of patients having an intensication of pharmaco- logical therapy at visits with elevated measures of glycemic control (El-Kebbiet al. 1997; Wetzler and Snyder 2000) and the proportion of patients with elevated HbA1c levels on a greater-than-starting dose of medications (Grant et al. 2002). These measures have typically examined only a short time-frame and do not reflect the many clinical factors that influence treatment decisions. Furthermore, they have not been linked to outcomes, perhaps because such attempts are likely to suffer from confounding by indication (Rubin, Pronovost, and Diette 2001). Confounding by indication refers to the fact that poor glycemic control is simultaneously an indication for treatment intensication and a predictor of poor outcome. Thus, unless we adjust forvariations in patient status during the course of treatment, we are likely to see more intense therapy associated with worse glycemic control. Recently, we proposed an alternate approach to measuring intensity of pharmacological therapy in hypertension care that compares the observed number of increases in therapy over an extended time period to the number predicted by empirically modeling factors that affect the probability of an increase in therapy at individual visits (Berlowitz et al. 1998). Improved performance on this process measure was associated with better blood pressure control, reversing the negative association (likely because of confounding by indication) that appeared when predicting outcomes from aggregated measures of treatment intensity adjusted only for baseline patient character-istics. This intensity score approach has since been placed within the general framework of causal modeling for the effect of a time-varying treatment via structural nested mean models (Brumback et al. 2003). We now develop a similar quality measure for measuring clinical inertia in diabetes care by evaluating the pharmacologic management of diabetes in1838 HSR: Health Services Research 40:6, Part I (December 2005 )patients with ready access to clinicians and medications through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). To accomplish this, we perform the following three tasks. First, we identify factors associated with the decision toincrease antiglycemic medications at individual patient care visits. Second, using the resulting model, we describe the intensity of antiglycemic medication therapy received by patients over an approximately 16-month period. Finally, we examine the link between this process measure and outcomes by determining whether those patients receiving more intensive therapy had improved glycemic control. METHODS Data Sources Study data were obtained from two sources. First, we used two national VA databases, the Outpatient Clinic File (OPC) and the Patient Treatment File (PTF), which contain information on all outpatient and inpatient medical encounters. This included diagnoses described as ICD-9-CM codes, dates of encounters, and types of outpatient clinic visits. Second, we used the Computerized Patient Record System, available through each VA medical center, to obtain pharmacy records and the results of laboratory studies. Pharmacy records described the name, dosage, and rell date for each dispensed medication and diabetes-related equipment. Because these treat- ments are available to eligible veterans either for free or a small copayment,the VA is likely to be their primary source for diabetes-related medications. Study Subjects We studied veterans with diabetes mellitus receiving regular medical care at 13 VA medical centers located in two Veterans Integrated Service Networks, New England and Florida-Puerto Rico. Study patients met the following criteria. First, they had to have at least two primary care visits during the 6- month period beginning October 1, 1997. We randomly selected one primary care visit from this period as the ''index'' visit. Second, patients had to have at least one primary care visit between 1 and 1 1 2years after the index visit. If more than one such visit was available, we randomly selected one as the ''outcome'' visit. Third, patients needed a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes wasconsidered present if a recorded in VA databases on two occasions at least 7 days apart during theDeveloping a Quality Measure for Clinical Inertia in Diabetes Care 18391-year period beginning April 1, 1997. At least one diabetes diagnosis had to be from an outpatient encounter and at least one had to be no later than the index visit. Ninety-ve patients with more than 40 visits per year wereexcluded from this sample. Since onset of diabetes as a child would preclude military service, most patients had type 2 diabetes. Variable Selection and Statistical Analyses Analyses were performed in three steps. For the initial analytic step, we considered each individual visit contributed by patients in our study sample. We used visits as the focus of our analysis because we consider each visit as an opportunity for the clinician to assess the patient and make an informed judgment about whether or not to alter medication therapy. We constructed a model to predict the probability that an individual patient-care visit would result in an increase in antiglycemic medications based on characteristics at the time of that visit. We considered only those visits in which diabetesmanagement was likely to occur, specically visits to all primary care clinics and selected subspecialties of internal medicine such as diabetes/endocrinol- ogy. These visits were identied using the clinic stop variable from the OPC. An increase in antiglycemic medications was considered present at a visit if a new antiglycemic medication was started or the dosage of an existing medication was increased. Since increases in medications identied in the pharmacy database may not occur on the same day as a visit, we assigned any increase to the prior visit if it was within 14 days after the visit; otherwise it was assigned to the next visit. We chose a 14-day window after examining dates of increases in relation to visit dates. Use of a window acknowledges that clinicians may order laboratory tests at a visit and then subsequently contact apatient to change his medications. Each visit was thus classied as antiglycemic medication ''increase'' or ''no increase.'' Visits occurring after a patient was prescribed an insulin ''sliding scale,'' as indicated by this specic designation in the sigstatement of the prescription, were not considered as these patients were likely adjusting their own medications. This was present in 594 patients. We used clinical judgment to identify available factors likely to influence the decision to increase antiglycemic medication therapy. These potential predictors included demographic characteristics of the patients; results of lab-oratory tests such as measures of glycemic control, lipid levels, renal function, and urinalysis; measures of health care utilization including recent hospitaliza- tions and the time since the patient's last outpatient visit; pharmacy inform-1840 HSR: Health Services Research 40:6, Part I (December 2005 )ation including steroid use, insulin, and prescription of glucose monitoring equipment; and diagnoses. Diagnoses were used to identify the presence of specic diabetic complications (neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, orperipheral vascular disease), other cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse disorder), presence of any psychiatric or substance abuse disorders, and a summary measure of comorbidity burden as described by the Deyo modication of the index (Charlson et al. 1987; Deyo, Cherkin, and Ciol 1992). Diagnoses were considered present if there was a single ICD-9-CM code indicating the appropriate condition in the year prior to the index visit, an approach that we have previously found to have good agreement with medical records (Borzecki et al. 2004). Predictors were coded in alternate ways before deciding on the exact variation used in modeling. For example, for HbA1c at the time of a visit we considered different ways of coding whether any value was available, how long since thelast determination, the results of the most recent determination, and results of the second most recent determination. We settled on eight different categories of availability and level (not available, /C206,46b u t /C207,47b u t /C208,48 but/C208.5,48.5 but /C209,49b u t /C2010, and410), in addition to a separate variable for time since last determination. Of note, VA databases do not accurately differentiate fasting from nonfasting laboratory values. We modeled the decision to increase antiglycemic medications at a visit using classication and regression trees (CART) (Breiman 1984), a recursive partitioning algorithm as implemented in S-plus software version 3.3. This procedure repeatedly splits the data to create a division into subgroups of visits that are internally similar with respect to their probability of a medication increase. At each step, the procedure splits an existing group into two based on the values of a single independent variable. The variable to be split is chosen to result in the greatest degree of separation in the outcome. The model- estimated probability of a medication increase at a visit is the empirical frequencies of the outcome in each terminal group. The choice of the number of terminal groupings was guided by a cross-validation procedure in which we divided the sample into ve equal-sized subsets. Then, for each possible number of terminal groups, ranging from 2 to 150, a model of that size was t to each combination of four of the ve subsets, and applied to the remainingsubset. Based on the actual outcomes and estimated probabilities, c-statistics were calculated (Altham 1973). The nal number of terminal groupings was chosen by examining models with high cross-validated c-statistics that conform to clinical judgments about appropriate explanatory variables.Developing a Quality Measure for Clinical Inertia in Diabetes Care 1841We were concerned that many increases in insulin therapy might not be recorded in the pharmacy database. Thus, we initially developed separate models for visits in which the patient was receiving insulin and for noninsulinvisits. However, as the models were similar, and increases in insulin therapy were frequently evident in the pharmacy database, we combined all visits to develop a single model. For the next step in our analysis, we aggregated information from each individual visit for a patient to create a patient-specic measure of the intensity of medication therapy. This measure is norm-based in that it compares the intensity any given patient receives relative to the experience of other patients. We dened treatment intensity as a ratio with the numerator equal to the actual number of medication increases from the index to outcome visit minus the expected number of increases as predicted by the model for each visit. The denominator was the total number of visits. Scores on this treatment intensitymeasure must lie between /C01 and 11; positive values indicate more increases in therapy than expected. In the nal step, we examined the association between this process measure describing treatment intensity and two outcome measures of glycemic control. We used a linear regression model to explain the change in HbA1c levels between the index and outcome visit. The index visit HbA1c was the determination closest in date to the index visit during the 6 months surrounding the visit. As laboratory data after the outcome visit were not available, the outcome visit HbA1c was the determination closest to theoutcome visit during the 6 preceding months. We also used a logistic regression model to explain the dichotomous outcome of ''outcome visit HbA1c48 percent'' yes/no, adjusting for index visit HbA1c. For both models, we adjusted for other variables likely associated with glycemic control (Zhang et al. 2000). Patients without a HbA1c determination for both the index and outcome visit were excluded from these regression analyses. RESULTS The study sample consisted of 23,291 patients with 266,309 visits. Patientcharacteristics are described in Table 1. Nearly 29 percent of patients were on insulin at baseline, and 27 percent were on insulin for the entire study period.Among the 15,437 patients with a HbA1c determination at the index visit, the mean was 7.8 /C61.9 percent; 39.1 percent had a value above 8 percent. Patients were frequent utilizers of VA health care. Yet following 15.8 /C61.91842 HSR: Health Services Research 40:6, Part I (December 2005 )months of care, with 8.8 /C65.1 visits per year, the mean HbA1c level among the 16,800 patients with a determination was unchanged and 39.4 percent had a value above 8 percent. An increase in antiglycemic medication therapy occurred at 9.8 percent of visits. An increase occurred at 13.1 percent of the visits when a patient was on insulin and 7.8 percent of visits with no insulin therapy. Insulin was started on 1,884 patients during the study period. The strongest predictor of an increase was the most recent HbA1c being greater than 8 percent (Figure 1). Other factors associated with an increase included higher serum glucose, longer interval since the last visit (whenseveral visits are close together, an increase is less likely at any individual visit), HbA1c being performed within 3 months, being on insulin, and having received self-monitoring of blood glucose supplies. An increase occurred 32.0 percent of the time among the 10,581 visits in which the most recent HbA1c was greater than 8 percent, that HbA1c had been performed within the pastTable 1: Characteristics of the Study Patientsn Total SampleWith Index and Outcome HbA1cWithout Both Index and Outcome HbA1c .05 Diabetic complication (%) 41.6 43.1 factor at baseline (%) 28.6 32.2 24.5 o.0001 Index HbA1c\u00a77.8/C61.9 7.8 /C61.9 7.6 /C61.9 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Outcome /C61.7 \u2014 \u2014 Outcome HbA1c 48% (%)z39.4 40.3 36.6 \u2014 \u2014 No. of visits 11.4 /C66.6 12.2 /C66.7 10.6 /C66.4 o.0001 Months between visits15.8/C61.9 15.9 /C61.6 15.7 /C62.2 o.0001 nContinuous variables described as mean /C6standard deviation. wp-value compares group with index and outcome HbA1c to group without. zCharlson index excludes diabetes. \u00a7N515,437 for total sample and N52,914 for without both sample. zN516,800 for total sample and N54,277 for sample without both.

In contrast, an increase occurred at only 1.5 percent of visits when the most recent HbA1c was less than 7 percent, the serum glucose was less than or equal to 160 mg/dl, the prior visit was within the past 45 days, and the patient was not on insulin therapy. The expected number of increases per patient varied with some patients having all their visits in the group with the lowest predicted probability of an increase (1.5 percent), and others having each visit with a 32 percent predicted probability of an increase. Patient treatment intensity scores also varied among patients with a range from /C00.32 to 0.96. Twenty-eight percent of patients had intensity scores greater than 0.05, values we viewed as more intensive therapy than the norm, and 34 percent had values less than -0.05, indicating less intensive therapy. Mean intensity scores were slightly higher for patients with an index HbA1c 48 percent compared with those with one o8 percent (0.02 10.15 versus 0.01 10.11, po.001). More intensive antiglycemic medication therapy was signicantly associated with improved glycemic outcomes. An index and outcome HbA1c was available in 12,523 patients (54 percent of the sample). These patients differed from the 10,768 patients without these determinations (Table 1). Among patients in the highest quintile of treatment intensity scores, with scores greater than 0.09, HbA1c values declined by 0.12 percent between the indexTable 2: Multivariate Regression ModelsnRelating Intensity of Antiglyce- mic Medication HbA1c 48% Coefcient p-Value Odds Ratio 95% CI Intensity of (per increase of 0.1) /C00.064 o.0001 0.91 0.88, 0.98 Index visit HbA1c \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1.76 1.72, 1.81 Age (per increase of 10 years) 0.013 .39 0.78 0.75, 0.81 Male gender 0.147 .13 1.12 1.45Any complication /C00.131 o.0001 1.29 1.18, 1.41 Charlson index 0.026 .01 1.02 0.99, 1.05 Psychiatric diagnosis 0.156 0.69, 1.00 nA linear model was used when modeling outcome visit HbA1c minus index visit HbA1c; a negative coefcient indicates improved glycemic control.

In patients receiving less intensive therapy, the change in HbA1c values worsened progressively. In those patients in the lowest quintile, with intensity scores less than /C00.08, HbA1c values increased by 0.09 percent. Fifty-seven percent of patients in the lowest quintile had an outcome visit HbA1c greater than 8 percent, as compared with 36 percent among the remaining patients. These associations were signicant in regression models that adjusted for other patient characteristics (Table 2). Each 0.1 increase in the intensity score, equivalent to one additional visit during which there was an increase in therapy beyond that expected over 10 visits, was associated with an additional 0.06 percent decline in the HbA1c and an odds ratio of 0.91 that the outcome HbA1c would be greater than 8 percent. Regression models were almost identical when limited to the subsample of patients on insulin therapy for the entire study period. DISCUSSION Clinical trials have convincingly demonstrated that intensive medication management of diabetes improves glycemic control and prevents the development of microvascular disease (The Diabetes Control and Complica- tions Trial Research Group 1993; U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] Group 1998). Despite these facts, many patients with diabetes do not achieve recommended levels of glycemic control. Clinical inertia is now recognized as an important barrier contributing to inadequate glycemic control (Phillips et al. 2001). We now propose a quality measure that can be used to measure this phenomenon. This measure works by interpreting the total treatment received in the context of the level of treatment expected as a result of asequence of conditional decisions. Thus, the same amount of treatment is viewed as more intense for a person with better glycemic control during the treatment period than for a person who was seen repeatedly with poor control. Our approach to measuring clinical inertia in diabetes care has numerous advantages over past efforts (El-Kebbi et al. 1997; Wetzler and Snyder 2000; Grant et al. 2002). First, by evaluating care over an extended time period, our method recognizes that at any single visit, not increasing pharmacological therapy might be an appropriate action. However, over a longer time period, several increases might be indicated if treatment goals arenot met. Second, our approach recognizes that many clinical factors might be considered in the decision to increase therapy, including not only the level of hyperglycemia, but also the recency of these lab tests, the types of therapy1846 HSR: Health Services Research 40:6, Part I (December 2005 )being received, and the time since the previous visit. Third, our measure has face validity in that it is based on widely accepted clinical practice recommendations from the time frame of this study. The strongest predictorof an increase in therapy was a HbA1c greater than 8 percent. This is consistent with the American Diabetes Association recommendations that encourage action when the HbA1c is above this level, and also reflects many clinicians' beliefs that lifestyle modications will not be sufcient to achieve tight control at these higher levels. Interestingly, HbA1c levels further above 8 percent were not associated with a greater likelihood of an increase although higher blood glucose levels were an important predictor. Fourth, our measure appears to be sensitive to differences in practice. There were large differences in the intensity of therapy that patients received with some patients receiving many more increases in therapy than the norm. Finally, and most importantly, our process measure was linked to outcomes in that patients who received more intensive management were more likely to achieve better outcomes in glycemic control. We evaluated two measures of glycemic control and found for each that more intensive therapy was associated with signicantly better results. Establishing such links between process and outcome measures is an important goal in quality assessment. It further validates our measure of intensity of therapy and suggests that we are capturing an important aspect of care. These results also emphasize that interventions to improve care should focus on the problem of clinical inertia. Past studies in diabetes care have generally failed to establish such links between process and outcomes (Williams et al. 1967; Romm and Hulka 1979, 1980). Considerable advances have been made since these studies in develop- ing methods, especially those that use a ''propensity to receive treatment'' score, to reduce bias when using observational studies to determine treatment effects (D'Agostino 1998). Approaches that only adjust for baseline covariates, however, do not work well when examining a sequence of treatment encount- ers, such as in diabetes care, where there may be time-dependent confound- ing. A number of analytic strategies have been described for this type of problem (Robins 1997; Robins, Hernan, and Brumback 2000) that recognize the need to interpret the care given at each encounter in the context of the patient's status at that encounter. As recently discussed, our intensity score is areadily interpreted measure in the spirit of G-estimators, which represent the effect of a ''generalized treatment regime,'' for structural nested models (Brumback et al. 2003). Our diabetes intensity of medication therapy measure was able to associate more care with better outcomes, as was a similar intensity measure that we developed in hypertension (Berlowitz et al. 1998). TheseDeveloping a Quality Measure for Clinical Inertia in Diabetes Care 1847ndings are consistent with numerous studies showing that normative practice in these areas is insufciently aggressive. While we cannot prove that the measures are bias-free, they are helpful in addressing the problem of confoun-ding by indication. Our intensity of therapy measure may be used in a variety of ways. Quality improvement programs in diabetes care could prole clinicians' practices not only on the basis of their glycemic control but also in their pharmacological management of diabetes. Clinicians and settings with higher intensity scores and better glycemic control could be identied for bench- marking. Interventions to improve care could be developed that provide clinicians with feedback on their performance on this measure. Such interven- tions that focus on how clinicians decide to increase therapy may be particular- ly successful (Cook et al. 1999) and could be directed at that subset of clinicians whose patients have poor glycemic control in the setting of low intensitytherapy. As our intensity measure relies on data available from existing data- bases, such efforts would be relatively easy to implement. The measure may also be used to study care provided to important subgroups of patients such as ethnic minorities and individuals with mental health illnesses. For example, we recently studied hypertension control in patients with diabetes and found not only did they have worse blood pressure control than patients without diabetes, but they also were receiving less intensive therapy (Berlowitz et al. 2003). Thus, we were able to conclude that poor blood pressure control in patients with diabetes is not solely related to more difcult to treat disease, but also to the factthat clinicians were treating these patients differently. Our results provide additional evidence regarding the presence of clinical inertia. They are similar to past studies in that many patients had inadequate glycemic control. Over 39 percent had an initial HbA1c greater than 8 percent, and following an additional 16 months of care with more than 11 visits on average, glycemic control in the population was essentially unchanged. Despite less than optimal control, increases in antiglycemic medication therapy were relatively infrequent, occurring in only 9.8 percent of visits. Even among those visits with the greatest indication for an increase, an actual increase occurred only 32 percent of the time. Thus, many opportuni- ties for increasing therapy to achieve better glycemic control were beingmissed. In deciding on whether to increase therapy, our results suggest that clinicians tend to focus on relatively few factors. The process measure that we propose is norm-based; it compares clinicians to the usual performance of other providers. While this is often the standard approach when comparing outcomes such as risk-adjusted mortality,1848 HSR: Health Services Research 40:6, Part I (December 2005 )it is used less frequently for process measures that are often absolute. As with many HEDIS-type measures, either the appropriate process is performed or it is not. The specic situation in which performance of the process is indicated isusually well identied, for example ''when the HbA1c is elevated at a visit, therapy should be increased.'' This approach has a number of advantages including being easy to comprehend, indicating specic subgroups in which intensication is indicated, and being less susceptible to gaming by increasing therapy in patients with well-controlled diabetes. However when examining a complex behavior such as medication intensication, which typically takes place over several visits and in which there is signicant provider discretion with many factors contributing to the decision, we believe that a norm-based approach has many advantages. Because our approach is norm-based, care is required in using the model to calculate intensity scores for non-VA settings. Unique to our approach of measuring clinical inertia is that we combine information from multiple visits. We determine an expected probability for an increase in therapy at each individual visit and then sum the expected probabilities over all visits. It is this value we compare with the observed number of increases. In calculating these expected probabilities, we used CART modeling because of our belief that clinicians' actions are very much guided by clusters of signs and symptoms as well as discrete thresholds for action as emphasized in national guidelines. Additionally, CART models are useful for identifying interactions among predictors. However, CART models have also been criticized because subgroups may be difcult to interpretclinically and simple rules may not be uncovered (Marshall 2001). We also evaluated a logistic model and found it had similar discriminative ability as the CART model. Many factors go into the clinical decision on increasing therapy at an individual visit; our model captures only a few such factors. We cannot determine whether individual decisions to increase or not increase therapy might be appropriate for a patient. Such a determination would require a careful weighing of the risks and benets of changes as well as patient preferences. This level of detailed information could not be obtained from existing databases. This emphasizes the importance of applying our measure to studying groups of patients rather than the decisions made for individuals. We did not measure adherence to medications in our study. Clinicians may not be intensifying therapy because of concerns that patients were nonadherent. In at least one small study, however, this was not found to be the case ( Javors and Bramble 2003). Further work should examine this issue. It could be that even a stronger link between intensity of therapy and glycemicDeveloping a Quality Measure for Clinical Inertia in Diabetes Care 1849control would be demonstrated after considering adherence. However, the fact that we did demonstrate such a link without considering adherence suggests the validity of our approach. Several additional limitations should be noted. First, our study population was highly selected, consisting mostly of elderly men with type 2 diabetes and access to medical care. Second, we had no information on non- VA medical care. However, most patients are likely to be using the VA for obtaining medications, and the population had high rates of utilization. Third, we relied on pharmacy databases to identify increases in therapy. While these databases are likely to capture most episodes of initiating a new therapy, increases in dosage of a prescribed medication, particularly for insulin, may be missed. Fourth, HbA1c levels were missing for many patients and these patients differed from patients with such information. We cannot be certain how this affected our results. Finally, the magnitude of changes in HbA1cassociated with increased treatment intensity were not large. However, we followed patients for relatively short periods of time with some patients having as little as 6 months between determinations. This may not have been adequate time to see large changes. It should also be noted that we focused on the decision by clinicians to increase antiglycemic medication therapy. We were interested in studying whether clinicians, when confronted with poor glycemic control, changed pharmacologic management. We did not capture other important aspects of care such as which medication was selected or how much of an increase indosage occurred, as well as other actions that might be appropriate including enhanced patient education, efforts to improve dietary and medication adherence, or referral to a diabetes team. Additionally, we did not capture information related to potential overmedication, side effects, and risks of hypoglycemia. This may be a particular concern in an older population. We do not know why clinicians did not increase therapy more frequently. Phillips et al. (2001), in describing clinical inertia, ascribed this phenomenon to three problems in clinical practice: physician overestimation of care provided, use of soft reasons to rationalize decisions not to increase therapy, and lack of training and organizational focus necessary to achieve therapeutic goals. However, El-Kebbi et al. (1999) have also described howfailures to intensify therapy in a diabetes clinic are related to clinicians' perceptions that glycemic control is improving or that patients are nonadherent to therapy. Whatever the cause, overcoming clinical inertia is not likely to be easy, but it is essential if we are to substantially improve health outcomes for patients with diabetes. Our measure of treatment intensity may1850 HSR: Health Services Research 40:6, Part I (December 2005 )be a rst step in improving how clinicians prescribe medications used in the management of diabetes.

Keywords: Adaptation, psychological; Breast neoplasms; Homosexuality, female; Social support; Stress, psychological Introduction Spouses are the most frequently reported support person for married heterosexual women with breast cancer [I], as well as the most important source of support [2.3]. Studies that focus on spouses indicate that they provide breast cancer patients with emotional support and physical assistance [4] and that the provision of emotional and instrumental support is associated with better adjustment [5] and perceived as the most helpful forms of support [3,6,7]. Some studies indicate that the distress of spouses equals or even surpasses patients' distress [8-10] and a number of studies noted that patients' spouses lack social support [4, II ]. The assertion that breast cancer is a family disease, that primarily affects the couple, has led to a neglect of research of women who are not in traditional marriages, To date, we Corresponding author. CHQOER, 200 Springs Road (152), Bedford, MA - see front matter \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi: 10,1016/j.jpsyclJOres.2005.06.059 lack knowledge about sexual minority women with breast cancer, i.e., lesbians, bisexuals, and women who partner with women, who are expected to have a higher incidence of breast cancer than married heterosexual women [12\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b716]. Different studies focusing on sexual minority women suggest that they perceive less support from their family than do heterosexual women and instead are more likely to receive support from their friends [17\u00b721]. Yet, little is known about the social support of sexual minority women with breast cancer. One study by F obair et al. [22], which compared lesbian and heterosexual women with breast cancer, determined that lesbians were less frequently partnered, yet were more likely to obtain social support from their partners and friends than heterosexuals do, confirming the findings of previous research in that heterosexual patients received greater social support from their relatives, were eloser to their family members, more likely to count on them for help, and were more satisfied with their family members than were lesbian breast cancer patients. 308 U. Boehmer et al. / Journal of Psychosomatic Research 59 (2005) 307-314 Research on sexual minority women and their sources of social support, as well as the cancer literature that considers breast cancer patients' husbands and their support functions, inform the present study. Our research objectives are first to identify the most important support person for sexual minority women with breast cancer. Because not all sexual minority women will be partnered and the support choices of this population are mostly unknown, we decided against a mandatory recruitment of sexual minority women and their partners. Second, we examine the support persons' impact on sexual minority women with breast cancer. In particular, previous studies indicated dyadic influences; that is, the patient and support provider's collective coping and social support affects patient's and support providers' adjustment [23]. It has been shown that the perception that the spouse uses maladaptive coping was related to elevated distress in the individual who rated the spouse as coping poorly [24]. The present study assesses if these influences exist among sexual minority women with breast cancer as well. Method Study design The data used for this paper are derived from a retrospective cross-sectional study of sexual minority women with breast cancer and their support persons. We relied on community-based purposive sampling, which has been widely used to overcome the challenges of recruiting members of vulnerable or \"hidden\" populations into research studies [25.26] and is well suited for a compre\u00ad hensive exploration of lesbians' experiences with breast cancer. Recruitment has been further enhanced through the use of snowball sampling, where participants are asked to refer others who may be willing to participate in the study. We obtained institutional human participants approval for this study. All recruitment materials announced that participants would receive US$20 for their participation. Recruitment activities consisted of newspaper advertise\u00ad ments, Internet postings, and the distribution of flyers to organizations, at events, and medical centers. Extensive efforts were made to reach African-American and Latina lesbians. We used a separate flyer that explicitly stated that researchers were looking for African-American and Latina participants. This flyer was posted on the Internet, handed to known African-American or Latina lesbians, distributed to churches, organizations, and health centers with a high proportion of African-American and Latina patients, and at African-American or Latino centered events. Participants Women with breast cancer were eligible for this study if they met the following eligibility criteria: (I) sexual minority status, (2) a diagnosis of nonrecurrent and non-metastatic breast cancer, (3) having completed active treat\u00ad ment for breast cancer within the last 5 years, and (4) English proficiency. We defined sexual minority status as stating a lesbian or bisexual sexual identity. We included women who reported partnering with women, in an attempt to be inclusive of women who might feel uncomfortable embrac\u00ad ing a lesbian or bisexual identity. While we required that women had completed their treatment, we defined active treatment as surgery, radiation, and/or ehemotherapy to include women in this study who were currently using hormonal treatment, such as Tamoxifen. Procedures After consent was obtained, we conducted one tape\u00ad recorded, in-depth, semistructured interview. In addition to this one-time qualitative interview with women with breast cancer and their support providers, we collected infonna\u00ad tion on participants through a self-administered question\u00ad naire. In the course of the qualitative interview, the women with breast cancer were asked to identify their \"trusted other\", which we defined as their most important support person with respect to their cancer care, someone other than their treating physician. Having a significant support person or the support person's willingness to participate was not eligibility criteria for women with breast cancer. Once a support person was identified, we contacted this person and asked for participation in the study. After consent was obtained, we conducted one tape-recorded, in\u00ad depth, semistructured interview with each support provider and collected quantitative information through a self\u00ad administered questionnaire. Ten percent ofwomen with breast cancer (n=3) indicated not having a significant support person. Another 10% (n=3) identified a support person, but passively refused the support person's participation by not providing contact information. This included two women who identified their partner, one refused contact information because of her strained relationship with her partner, whereas the second woman reported that her partner had had breast cancer prior to her own breast cancer and that all interview will be too upsetting for her partner. Thus, 80% (n=24) identified a support person and provided contact information, including one woman who identified two support providers, because at the time of her breast cancer diagnosis, she had a strained relationship with her partner and was relying on a friend when her partner was unavailable. After we contacted all 25 identified support providers, all but I agreed to participate and were interviewed. The support provider who refused participation explained that she was no longer in contact with the woman with breast cancer. Measures Our key dependent variable is emotional distress, which we measured by a brief version of the Profile of Mood 309 U. Boehmer et al. I Journal ofPsychosomatic Research 59 (2005) 307-314 States (POMS). The POMS assesses mood disturbance by asking respondents to indicate to which degree mood\u00ad descriptive adjectives (e.g., weary, blue) applied to their emotional state during the past week [27]. The high correlation of the brief ll-item version with the full version of the POMS [28] led us to choose the brief version to reduce respondent burden. The l l-item POMS yields one total mood disturbance score, with higher scores indicating more mood disturbance. While we assessed mood disturbance in both women with breast cancer and their support providers, coping was assessed differently. Women with breast cancer were asked to report their coping, while the support providers were asked to serve as a proxy and report how they perceived the woman with breast cancer to cope. Coping was measured by the abbreviated 29-item version of the Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale (MAC; [29]). The mini-MAC measures coping responses to a cancer diagnosis, which are then summarized into five subscales that describe the coping styles of (1) fighting spirit, (2) helplessness-hopelessness, (3) anxious preoccupation, (4) fatalism, and (5) cognitive avoidance. Each subscale has acceptable reliability, with alpha coefficients ranging from .62 (fatalism) to .87 (helplessness-hopelessness; [29]). High scores on the scales helplessness-hopelessness, anxious preoccupation, fatalism, and cognitive avoidance can be interpreted as an indication of a maladaptive coping style in response to cancer, whereas a high score on fighting spirit is considered a positive reaction to the cancer diagnosis [29,30]. Independent variables The questionnaire asked women with breast cancer and their support providers to self-report the following demo\u00ad graphics: age at the time of the interview; race categorized into White, African American, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian, mixed race, or other; years of education; health insurance; and current employment and, if answered in the affirmative, hours worked per week. Participants were asked to report their income with respect to the following ranges less than US$20,000, US$20,000 to 99,999, and over US$IOO,OOO. In the absence of an agreed upon standardized measure of sexual orientation [31], we followed the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine Report on Lesbian Health, in that we defined our population using two of three (identity, behavior, and desire) dimensions of sexual orientation that we deemed essential for this research project's focus on breast cancer. Women with breast cancer were asked to report the sexual identity or the relationship behavior that best describes them, allowing for the responses lesbian, bisexual, partner with women, or other. In the questionnaire for support providers, the category \"heterosexual\" was added. Disclosure of sexual orientation to others was assessed by asking participants to report whether they disclosed their sexual orientation (= I), disclosed and openly talked about (=2), or did not disclose (=0) to each of the following 12 person groups: children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, parents, grandparents, siblings, other blood relatives, heterosexual friends, colleagues at work, one's boss, neighbors, or heterosexuals in general. Thus, higher scores indicate a greater level of disclosure. The illness factors, stage of the disease, time since diagnosis, and time since completion of treatment were collected from women with breast cancer using the ques\u00ad tionnaire. Information on women's cancer treatments, such as type of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal treatment, were derived from the qualitative interview data. In the questionnaires for both participant groups, an abbreviated social support scale based on five items from the Medical Outcome Study (MOS; [32]) was included to assess social support. This measure assesses the frequency with which respondents perceive that different dimensions of social support are available to them: none of the time, a little of the time, some of the time, most of the time, or all of the time. The dimensions of social support are measured by questions such as \"How often is someone available to you if you need it, to confide in or talk to about yourself or your problems?\" The social support dimensions include emotional and informational support, positive social interaction, tangi\u00ad ble support, and affectionate support [32]. We assessed the size of participants' social network, using one item from the MOS that asked, \"how many close friends and close relatives do you have'!' Current relationship status was categorized into single, being in a committed relationship, or other. Analysis Using SAS, we calculated summary statistics to describe participants' illness and demographic characteristics. We used t tests, chi square, and Fisher's Exact Test to determine significant differences between women with and those without support providers. Mean differences between women with breast cancer and their support providers in mood disturbance, social support characteristics, and level of disclosure were calculated and their significant differ\u00ad ences were assessed using univariate analyses. Women with breast cancer's coping and the proxy rating of their support providers was assessed using the intraclass correlation, a reliability measure of ratings performed by two different raters. We used regression analyses to determine which factors predicted the most variance in emotional distress of support providers and women with breast cancer. Results The illness-related information on the women with breast cancer are presented in Table I. At the time of assessment, more than 1 year had passed since women with breast 310 U.

Using bivariate analyses, we examined if there were differences between the 23 women with a participating support provider and the 7 women without such a person. The two groups did not differ on any illness-related characteristics. In Table 2, we added the demographic information on the 24 participating support providers to the demographic information on women with and women without support providers. There were no significant differences on any of the demographic characteristics between women with and without support providers. However, we did find differences with respect to social support in that women with a support provider had a significantly higher level of perceived support and those with a support provider were more likely to be partnered (Fisher's P=.0596) compared with women without a support provider. When we compared the two groups of women with breast cancer on coping styles and level of distress, there were no significant differences (results not shown). All support providers were female and 79% (19) were relationship partners, 3 were friends, I was a sister, and I a mother to the 23 women with breast cancer. Women with breast cancer had the respective relationships with their support provider, on average, for almost 17 years, with a range from 3 to 45 years. The 19 women who chose their partner as their support provider had this partner relationship for an average of more than 14 years, with a range from 3 to 33 years. For the remainder of this paper, we focus only on the women with breast cancer who had a support provider and their respective support providers, without further distin\u00adguishing if tile support person is a partner or has another type ofrelationship to the woman with breast cancer. Due to the fact that I of tile 23 women identified two support providers, we duplicated the data on this I woman, thereby increasing the sample size of women with breast cancer from 23 to 24, to obtain 24 matched pairs of women with breast cancer and support provider. We calculated the mean difference in tile level of disclosure, size of social network, social support, and mood disturbance between women with breast cancer and their support providers. Support providers had a significantly lower level of perceived support, and there was a trend toward a smaller social network compared with women with breast cancer.

Journal ofPsychosomatic Research 59 (2005) 307-314 The mean difference between patients' self-rating and the support providers' proxy ratings of coping indicated whether support providers over- or underestimated the coping of women with breast cancer. A negative score indicates that the support provider underestimated how poorly a woman is coping with breast cancer, unless the coping strategy is fighting spirit, which is reversed. Support providers' estimation of women's fatalistic coping was significantly lower than the women's self-rating. In the last column of Table 3, we reported the intrac1ass correlation of women's self-ratings and support providers' other-ratings of coping. Women with breast cancer and their support providers agreed moderately on the coping strategies of cognitive avoidance, anxiety preoccupation, and fatalism. They had, however, only fair agreement on fighting spirit and even less agreement on helpless\u00ad hopeless coping. The impact of demographic characteristics, such as age and education, on the coping with and adjustment to breast cancer among sexual minority women has been assessed elsewhere [33]. The focus here is on examining women with breast cancer and their support providers' level of disclo\u00ad sure, social support, and self or other coping on adjustment. To understand the predictors of level of distress experienced by women with breast cancer, we regressed women's social support characteristics and their coping ratings on their level of mood disturbance. To understand the impact of women's social support providers, we also regressed the support providers' social support characteristics, the support pro\u00ad viders' ratings of women's coping, the difference in social support characteristics between women with breast cancer and support providers, as well as the over- and under\u00ad estimations of coping on mood disturbance in women with breast cancer. To assess the predictors of the variance in support provider distress, the same factors were regressed on support provider distress (Table 4). The separate regression analyses revealed that women's helpless-hopeless coping increased their emotional distress. Women with breast cancer were also more distressed ifthere Table 3 Comparison of women with breast cancer and their support providers (/1=24) Mean P lntraclass WBC SP difference value correlation Disclosure hopelessness Fighting spirit 12.9\u00b12.4 12.7\u00b12.0 \u00b70.2\u00b12.8 ns .24 Table 4 Predictors of mood disturbance ill women with breast cancer and in support providers WBC POMS SP POMS b R2 b R2 Women with breast cancer (WBC) WBC friends -0.12 .04 0.20 .08 spirit .03 0.59 .03 Support provider (SP) SP friends -0.22 .04 -0,16* ,18 SP soc sup -0.05 .03 -0.45 SP 0.04 .01 -0.43 .09 fatalism -1.06*** .13 -0.18 .01 SP cognitive avoidance -0.36 .01 -1.03 .08 SP anxiety/preoccupation 0.22 .02 0.68*** .16 SP helplessness/hopelessness 0.14 .01 0.26 .01 SP fighting spirit -1.95** .32 -0.21 .01 Difference support provider-women SP-WBC friends 0.03 .01 -0.22*\" *** 1'<.0I. was discordance in the level of disclosure of sexual orientation between the support provider and the woman with breast cancer, in that the support provider was more open than was the woman with breast cancer. Lower emotional distress in women with breast cancer was related to being open about their sexual orientation and support providers' perception of high fighting spirit, and there was a trend towards lower level of distress in women with breast cancer whose support provider perceived them as having more fatalistic coping. The strongest predictor of support providers' level of distress was disclosure of sexual orientation among women with breast cancer, indicating that women who are more open about their sexual orientation lower support providers' distress level. Support providers' level of distress was lower if they had a larger network of friends and family and if there was a trend that the network of women with breast cancer surpasses that of support providers. Support providers' overestimation of anxiety and preoccupation in the women with breast cancer increased support provider distress, whereas support pro\u00ad vidcrs' underestimation of fatalistic coping in women with breast cancer lowered support providers' mood disturbance. 312 U. Boehmer et af. / Journal of Psychosomatic Research 59 (2005) 307-3/4 Discussion Sexual minority women, i.e., is lesbian or bisexual\u00ad identified women and women who partner with women, have been recognized as an underserved population in the United States [34], for which it has been suggested that certain negative health outcomes, including the cancer burden, are more prevalent compared with heterosexual women [31,35]. Because of their sexual orientation, these women are exposed to society's negative attitudes, stigma, prejudice, and discrimination, including while receiving health care, which constitutes a cultural barrier that interferes with their access to care [31]. How these women fair when diagnosed with breast cancer has hardly been researched, despite evidence that breast cancer incidence is higher in sexual minority women than in heterosexual women [34,36,37]. Our study sought to make a contribu\u00ad tion to this area by focusing on the social support that is available to these women. In particular, about three quarters (77%) of the sexual minority women with breast cancer ill our sample had a support provider available to them, and almost a quarter that did not have such a person refused to identify the person or whose support provider refused participation. Comparisons of women with support providers with those without such a person suggest that relationship status may be of importance for the availability of such a person, while no other demographic or illness-related characteristics appeared to explain the availability of a support provider. More importantly, patients with a support provider reported a significantly higher level of perceived support, while the size of the network did not differ between these two groups of women. We interpreted this as an indication that perceived support is directly linked to having a support provider, thereby underlining the importance of such a person for sexual minority women with breast cancer. On the other hand, the availability of a support provider was not linked to improved adjustment or particular coping styles. Our findings on sexual minority women appear to mirror the conclusions of studies of heterosexual or presumed heterosexual women with breast cancer to the extent that the relationship partner was the most frequently identified type of support provider [1,38,39]. In addition, as in studies of the spouses of heterosexual breast cancer patients, we found a lower level of perceived support among support providers than among women with breast cancer and a trend towards a smalJer network compared with women with breast cancer [4043]. Finally, we also found that patients' and their support providers' distress levels are equal [4346]. The particular value of our study is, however, its contribution to the understanding of distress in sexual minority women and their support providers. Sexual minority women's level of disclosure is the only aspect that has an about equal impact on the distress of women with breast cancer and their support providers, highlighting the importance of this aspect in this special population. Moreover, discordance in the level of disclosure, in that the support provider is more open about sexual orientation than is the woman with breast cancer, is linked to more emotional distress. This is an important finding that deserves further examination in a future study. Support providers' level of disclosure or the social support resources of women with breast cancer or their support providers are not linked to the distress level of women with breast cancer. Support provider distress is linked to their network size, and in addition, support providers appear to benefit if women with breast cancer have a larger network than their support provider. This leads one to hypothesize that the emotional well-being of women with breast cancer is dependent on the support provider, whereas support providers' emotional well-being depends on their own connections to others. In addition, one can hypothesize that support providers' distress is eased if the women with breast cancer who they are supporting are less isolated. Support providers' perception of how women cope with breast cancer is foremost associated with the adjustment of women dealing with the disease, whereas support providers' perception of women's coping has a limited relationship to their own distress. On the other hand, support providers' distress appears to be eased if they are supporting women whose coping is less anxious or more fatalistic than judged by the support provider. The findings of this exploratory study provides some insights that may be useful for the later design of cancer support interventions that target sexual minority women and their support providers, including sexual minority women who are without such a support person. However, before such interventions can be developed, it will be necessary to conduct additional research to overcome some of the limitations of this study. Consistent with the conclusions of previous researchers who targeted lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations, we think that the targeted sampling strategy was most appropriate for reaching a special population inflicted by a rare event, such as breast cancer [47]. However, an inherent limitation ofthis approach is that only participants who are motivated enough to participate in a study such as ours are recruited. We attempted to counteract this motivational bias by offering a stipend, in an attempt to provide an equal monetary motivation. Furthermore, the small sample size prevents us from making unequivocal conclusions about differences between women with and without support providers. In addition, our support provider sample consisted of only 5 nonpartners and 19 support providers who were partners to the woman with breast cancer. A larger sample size would have allowed for an assessment of differences between women partnered with their support providers and women who rely on support providers who are not partners. We hope that future studies will build on our findings and further expand our exploratory study of social support among sexual minority women. In particular, future studies should collect inforrna\u00ad tion on the types of social support provided by different 313 U Boehmer et al. ! Journal ofPsychosomatic Research 59 (2005) 307-314 sources of support as well as collect data on support providers' own coping. These limitations and suggestions for future research notwithstanding, valuable and new information has been gained about a particular group of breast cancer patients who have previously been neglected. While we concede that our findings need confirmation by additional studies, they make a contribution to improving the current care of sexual minority women with breast cancer by providing new insights into this group's social support conditions and other relevant aspects of their breast cancer experience.

FREUND, M.D., M.P.H.4 ABSTRACT Objective: To determine factors that influence sexual minority women's coping responses and adjustment to breast cancer. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 64 sexual minority women with breast cancer who were recruited through targeted community-based sampling. In this study, sex\u00ad ual minority women consisted of three sexual orientation groups: those who self-reported partnering with women and those with a lesbian or bisexual identity. We determined the number of years of sexual minority status and disclosure of sexual orientation and used stan\u00ad dardized measures to assess these women's coping and adjustment to breast cancer. Data were analyzed using statistical methods as appropriate for the level of data. Results: We determined that sexual minority factors, such as sexual orientation group, in\u00ad fluenced coping and adjustment even after illness and social support factors were controlled. In multivariate analyses, women who identified as lesbians or bisexuals used less maladap\u00ad tive coping compared with women who reported partnering with women. The association be\u00ad tween reporting a lesbian identity and lower distress approached significance in multivari\u00ad ate regression equations. Conclusions: Of the sexual minority factors that were considered, sexual orientation group, number of years of sexual minority status, and disclosure of sexual minority status, only sex\u00ad ual orientation group was related to coping and lower distress. Contrary to expectations, dis\u00ad closure of sexual orientation did not relate to coping and lower distress. The findings sup\u00ad port the need for future studies to include different aspects of sexual minority status, in particular, clearly defined sexual orientation groups.

A study by Fobair et a1.6 that used this methodology reported no differences in mood disturbance; however, in coping styles, les\u00ad bians had significantly less fatalism and less cog\u00ad nitive avoidance than heterosexuals.P Yet Fobair et a1. also found that lesbians experienced less fighting spirit compared with heterosexual wo\u00ad men.\" In order to understand the influences on sexual minority women's coping and adjustment to breast cancer, we chose a methodology of com\u00ad paring coping and adjustment within a group of sexual minority women. In this study, we focused on examining the variability in predictors of cop\u00ad ing and adjustment within sexual minority wo\u00ad men with breast cancer. The existing literature, generated from study\u00ad ing presumed heterosexual populations, states that coping and adjustment to breast cancer are influenced by three broad categories of factors: illness, person, and social support factors. Cop\u00ad ing strategies are related to the illness phase and the responsiveness of others in a person's envi\u00ad ronment,? thereby giving social support a central role in improving coping with cancer,\" The im\u00ad portance of social support has also been con\u00ad firmed for adjustment, in that some studies indi\u00ad cate single women are more vulnerable to poor adjustmentv'\" and propose to recognize singles as a vulnerable subpopulation among breast can\u00ad cer patients.ll,12 Coping styles differ by patients' age, in that older patients use more frequently op\u00ad timistic and palliative strategies and rate them as more effective.P Active coping strategies, such as fighting spirit, problem solving, seeking social support, and fo\u00ad cusing on the positive, are linked to improved psychosocial adjustment.l4-I 8 This knowledge about associations of coping and adjustment with certain illness, person, and social support factors provides the foundation for the development of psychosocial programs and interventions to im\u00ad pact women's coping and adjustment to breast cancer. Few studies have examined whether the same coping styles and other social factors in lesbians are associated with improved adjustment.s-'? Prior research studies of noncancer populations of gay men and lesbians linked disclosure of sex\u00ad ual minority status to better mental health and adjustment. 2D-22 Morris et a1.'s survey23 of a na\u00ad tional sample of lesbian and bisexual women suggested an empirically tested model of well\u00ad being that stated lesbians and those who had a sexual minority identity for more years were more open about their sexual minority status, and this openness predicted better psychological adjustment. The study by McGregor et aP4 con\u00ad tradicted one component of this model in that disclosure did not relate to lower distress in les\u00ad bians with breast cancer. Based on these contra\u00ad dictory findings, we wished to examine the sug\u00ad gested model in our sample of lesbians with breast cancer and were particularly interested in examining the relationship of disclosure to im\u00ad proved adjustment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design The data for this paper were derived from two cross-sectional studies of lesbians with breast cancer. Both studies relied on targeted commu\u00ad nity sampling, which was further enhanced through the use of snowball sampling where par\u00ad ticipants were asked to refer others who might be willing to participate in the study. This sampling strategy has been widely used to overcome the challenges of recruiting members of vulnerable or hidden populations into research studies25,26 and has been noted as essential for targeted research on rare populations.V We obtained institutional human subjects ap\u00ad proval for both studies, and all recruitment ma\u00ad terials announced that participants would receive $20 for their participation. Recruitment activities consisted of newspaper advertisements, Internet postings, and the distribution of fliers to organi\u00ad zations and at events and medical centers. Ex\u00ad tensive efforts were made to reach African Amer\u00ad ican and Latina lesbians, and we used a separate flier that explicitly stated researchers were look\u00ad ing for African American and Latina participants. This flier was posted on the Internet, handed to known African American or Latina lesbians, and distributed to churches, organizations, and health centers with a high proportion of African Amer\u00ad ican and Latino patients and at African American Or Latino-centered events. Participants Women were eligible for this study if they met three eligibility criteria: (1) sexual minority sta\u00ad tus, (2) a diagnosis of breast cancer, and (3) flu\u00ad ency in English. We defined sexual minority sta\u00ad216 BOEHMER ET At. tus as stating a lesbian or bisexual identity or partnering with women, as previous research on sexual orientation had shown that older, African American, or Hispanic women were more likely to report same-sex partner choice than a lesbian or bisexual identity.i\" Procedures After consent was obtained, we conducted tape-recorded in-depth, semistructured inter\u00ad views. At the end of each one-time qualitative in\u00ad terview, we asked participants to complete a self\u00ad administered questionnaire from which we derived almost all data for this report. Measures Our key dependent variable is emotional dis\u00ad tress, which we measured by a brief version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS). The POMS as\u00ad sesses mood disturbance by asking respondents to indicate to which degree mood-descriptive ad\u00ad jectives (e.g., weary, blue) applied to their emo\u00ad tional state during the past week.l? The high cor\u00ad relation of the brief l l-item version with the full version of the POMS3o led us to choose the brief version to reduce respondent burden. The 11\u00ad item POMS yields one total mood disturbance score, with higher scores indicating more mood disturbance. Coping was measured by the abbreviated 29\u00ad item version of the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) scale.P The Mini-MAC measures coping responses to a cancer diagnosis, which are then summarized into five subscales. The fighting spirit subscale includes such items as \"1 see my illness as a challenge.\" The helplessness-hope\u00ad lessness subscale includes such items as \"1 feel like giving up.\" The anxious preoccupation sub\u00ad scale includes such items as \"1 am a little fright\u00ad ened.\" The fatalism subscale includes such items as \"1 count my blessings,\" and the fifth and last subscale, cognitive avoidance, includes such items as \"Not thinking about it helps me cope.\" Each subscale has acceptable reliability with al\u00ad pha coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.87.31High scores on the helplessness-hopelessness, anxious preoccupation, fatalism, and cognitive avoidance scales can be interpreted as an indication of a mal\u00ad adaptive coping style in response to cancer, whereas a high score on fighting spirit is consid\u00ad ered a positive reaction to the cancer diagno\u00ad sis.31,32 As previous researchers suggested, we ex\u00adamined the correlation between the fighting spirit and helplessness-hopelessness scales to deter\u00ad mine if they ought to be combined into a single scale.33,34 Because the correlation between the two scales approached statistical significance in our sample (r = -0.22; p = 0.08), we chose to combine both scales into a modified fighting scale. A high score on this modified fighting scale indicates positive coping. Independent variables The questionnaire asked women to self-report four sexual minority factors. In the absence of an agreed on standardized measure of sexual orien\u00ad tation,35 we followed the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine (10M) Report on Lesbian Health, in that we defined our population using two of three dimensions (identity and behavior but not desire) of sexual orientation, which we deemed essential for this research project's focus on breast cancer. Women were asked to report the sexual identity or the relationship behavior that best described them, allowing for the re\u00ad sponses: lesbian, bisexual, partner with women, or other. Number of years women had their par\u00ad ticular sexual orientation was calculated by sub\u00ad tracting women's responses to the question \"How old were you when you first identified this way?\" from their current age. Disclosure to others in their social network was assessed by asking par\u00ad ticipants to report whether sexual orientation was disclosed (1), disclosed and openly talked about (2), or not disclosed (0) to each of the following 12 groups of people: children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, parents, grandparents, sib\u00ad lings, other blood relatives, heterosexual friends, colleagues at work, one's boss, neighbors, or het\u00ad erosexuals in general. Higher scores indicate a greater level of disclosure. Women's disclosure of their sexual orientation to any of their treating providers (yes vs. no) was assessed using the in\u00ad formation provided in the qualitative interview.I\" The illness factors, stage of the disease, and time since diagnosis were collected via question\u00ad naire, and the extent of women's cancer treatment was derived from the qualitative interview data. Person factors were assessed with the ques\u00ad tionnaire. Respondents were asked about their age at the time of the interview; race categorized into white, African American, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian, mixed race, or other; years of education; health insurance; current employment 217 SEXUAL MINORITY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER and if answered in the affirmative, hours worked per week. Income was determined by providing respondents with the following ranges: <$20,000, in $10,000 increments to $99,999, and >$100,000. Social support was assessed using an abbrevi\u00ad ated social support scale from the Medical Out\u00ad come Study (MOS).37 This short version of the social support scale consists of five items and as\u00ad sesses the frequency with which emotional, tan\u00ad gible, affection, and positive interaction support are available: none of the time, a little of the time, some of the time, most of the time, or all of the time. The individual items are (1) someone avail\u00ad able to confide in or talk to about yourself or your problems (emotional/informational support), (2) someone to get together with for relaxation (positive social interaction), (3) someone to help with daily chores if you are sick (tangible sup\u00ad port), (4) someone to turn to for suggestions about how to deal with a personal problem (emotional! informational support), and (5) someone to love and make you feel wanted (affectionate sup\u00ad port).37The responses to the five items were sum\u00ad marized into one scale that has a 0-100 range, with higher scores indicating more support. We assessed the size of women's social network, us\u00ad ing one item from the MOS that asked \"How many close friends and close relatives do you have?\" Current relationship status was catego\u00ad rized into single, being in a committed relation\u00ad ship with a woman, or other. Current or former membership in a cancer-related support group was derived from the qualitative interview data. Analysis We performed descriptive statistics, such as means and frequencies, to show the distribution of each of the study variables. We used t tests, Fisher's exact test, Pearson correlations, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Duncan mul\u00ad tiple comparison tests to as\u00ad sociations between study variables: sexual mi\u00ad nority, person, illness, and social support factors, coping, and mood disturbance. Based on the bi\u00ad variate analysis results, we selected variables that were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with cop\u00ad ing and mood disturbance to be included in a multiple regression model to determine the in\u00ad dependent association of these variables on each of the coping styles and on mood disturbance separately. For some analyses, we recoded sexual orientation into dichotomous variables. One re-coded variable compared lesbian-identified women with the combined group of bisexual\u00ad identified women and women who partner with women. The second variable compared lesbian\u00ad identified or bisexual-identified women with wo\u00ad men who partner with women. Previous studies suggested that anxious preoccupation coping is conceptually similar to our outcome of emotional distress measured by the POMS,33,34 which we confirmed in that anxious preoccupation coping and the POMS were significantly correlated (r = 0.36; P < 0.01). Based on this, we related this cop\u00ad ing style to the independent measures yet did not consider it for inclusion into a model of mood dis\u00ad turbance that included coping style as a predic\u00ad tor. The statistical package SAS was used for all analyses. RESULTS Descriptive statistics on sexual minority status and person factors in this study sample are shown in Table 1. On average, women were 50 years old, and the majority were white, had a high education level, were currently employed, and had health insurance. One quarter of the sample reported an income in the $60,000-69,999 range and supported more than one person. Sexual ori\u00ad entation was foremost reported as a sexual iden\u00ad tity in that 86% had a lesbian identity and 9% a bisexual identity. Five percent reported their sex\u00ad ual orientation as behavior in that they partnered with women. On average, women had had this sexual orientation for 27 years. Seventy-eight per\u00ad cent of the participants disclosed their sexual ori\u00ad entation to breast cancer care providers, and wo\u00ad men's average level of disclosure to others in their social environment was 18.1 on a scale that ranged from 0 to 24. The descriptive statistics on women's social support and illness characteristics are shown in Table 2. Seventy-two percent of women were in a committed relationship. On average, women re\u00ad ported having about 15 close friends or relatives, and the mean level of perceived support was 81.8 on a scale that ranged from 0 to 100. About half of the women reported membership in a cancer\u00ad related support group. The majority of women re\u00ad ported early breast cancer, stage 0, I, or II, and women received their respective diagnoses an av\u00ad erage of 4 years ago. More than half of the sam\u00ad ple received breast-conserving surgery. Sixty\u00ad218 BOEHMER ET At. TABLE 1.

Of the women treated surgically with a single or bilateral mastectomy, 38% chose breast reconstruction. Table 3 reports women's coping responses to breast cancer and their psychological adjustment. In the fourth column of Table 3, we show the scale developers' suggested cutoff points. Generally, scores above this point indicate maladaptive cop\u00ad ing, whereas for fighting spirit, maladaptive cop\u00ad ing is below the cutoff point. The proportion of our sample in this negative range is reported in the last column. Seventeen percent of fatalism, 3% of cognitive avoidance, 9% of anxious preoccu\u00ad pation, and 9% of fighting spirit coping was in the negative range, indicating coping below lev\u00ad els established in other cancer populations. Five percent of the study population experienced dis\u00ad tress higher than 2 SO from the mean. As suggested by Morris et al.,23 we related number of years with sexual minority status and sexual orientation groups to both of our disclo\u00ad sure measures. Number of years with sexual mi\u00ad nority status was significantly related neither to disclosure to providers nor to disclosure to oth\u00aders. When comparing lesbian-identified women with all others, we found that lesbian-identified women were significantly more likely to disclose to their breast cancer providers than bisexual\u00ad identified and women who partner with women combined (odds ratio = 6.39, CI = 1.43-28.5, P< 0.05), yet disclosure to others was not signifi\u00ad cantly related to sexual orientation group. Additional bivariate analyses focused on relat\u00ad ing sexual orientation to other independent mea\u00ad sures. We related the three groups, lesbian-iden\u00ad tified, bisexual-identified, and partnering with women, to age, race, educational level, employ\u00ad ment status, having insurance, and income. There were no significant differences in these demo\u00ad graphics among the three sexual orientation groups. Because other researchers had focused on lesbian-identity in particular, we also compared lesbian-identified women with the other two groups combined and confirmed our earlier find\u00ad ings of no significant association. When we com\u00ad pared the three sexual orientation groups on treatments (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone treatment, and breast reconstruction), we found no significant differences. We also related sexual orientation, disclosure, 219 SEXUAL MINORITY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER TABLE 2.

The sexual orientation groups did not dif\u00ad fer on relationship status, social support, number of friends, and support group membership. Number of years of sexual minority status was unrelated to all four social support measures. Women who were more open about their sexual minority status (r = 0.37,P < 0.01) and those who disclosed to breast cancer providers perceived greater levels of social support (mean = 84.7 vs. mean = 71.4, P < 0.05). Disclosure to others and to providers was unrelated to number of friends. Disclosing to providers related to being in a com\u00ad mitted relationship (Fisher's test, p = 0.0151), whereas disclosing to others was unrelated to re\u00ad lationship status. The next set of bivariate analyses related all in\u00ad dependent measures, that is, sexual minority, person, social support, and illness factors, to the two sets of outcome variables, coping and dis\u00ad tress. The results are reported in Table 4. There were no significant associations between any of the demographic factors and any of the different coping styles or distress. Only one of the sexual minority status measures, sexual orienta\u00ad tion, was related to coping and distress. Women who reported a lesbian or bisexual identity used significantly less cognitive avoidance coping. TABLE 3.

Lesbian-identified women's level of distress was significantly less than distress levels in the two other sexual orientation groups. Number of years with sexual minority status and disclosure was unrelated to coping and distress. Being in a com\u00ad mitted relationship was unrelated to coping or distress. However, women's perceived level of social support and number of friends were both positively related to more fighting spirit. Women in support groups reported significantly more cognitive avoidance coping and more distress. The illness factors, time since diagnosis, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and breast recon\u00ad struction were unrelated to coping and level of distress. Women who received breast-conserving surgery used significantly less fatalism coping and had lower distress. Chemotherapy was re\u00ad lated to more fatalism coping. Women's distress was related to the stage of their breast cancer; wo\u00ad men with stage I were significantly less distressed than women with metastatic breast cancer. None of the measures we considered (sexual minority, person, illness, and social support factors) were linked to anxious preoccupation coping. 221 SEXUAL MINORITY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER TABLE 5.

Six\u00ad teen percent of the variance in fighting spirit was explained by perceived social support and the number of friends in the social network, but num\u00ad ber of friends was no longer significant. It is of note that the correlation between social support and number of friends was r = 0.23, P = 0.07, in\u00ad dicating that these two measures of social sup\u00ad port captured different dimensions of social sup\u00ad port. In the model of fatalism coping, 11% of the variance was explained by type of surgery and chemotherapy together, but introducing both variables together diminished both variables' sig\u00ad nificance level. Twenty-three percent of the vari\u00ad ance in cognitive avoidance coping was ex\u00ad plained by having attended a support group and sexual orientation, indicating that women with a lesbian or bisexual identity used less cognitive avoidance coping. In the multivariate equation of mood disturbance (Table 5, Modell), 20% of the variance was explained by sexual orientation, support group, surgery, and cancer stage, yet can\u00ad cer stage was no longer significant, and the effect of sexual orientation was reduced to a trend, in\u00ad dicating lesbian identity was related to less dis\u00ad tress. Our remaining analyses focused on mood dis\u00ad turbance only. We correlated fighting spirit, fa\u00ad talism, and cognitive avoidance with mood dis\u00adturbance to determine the relationship of coping styles and adjustment. Fighting spirit was signif\u00ad icantly correlated (r = 0.27, P < 0.05), whereas talism and cognitive avoidance were not signifi\u00ad cantly correlated with mood disturbance. Adding fighting spirit into the multivariate model of mood disturbance increased the amount of ex\u00ad plained variance by 6%. In this model, surgery re\u00ad mained a significant independent measure, and fighting spirit was Significantly associated with less distress, whereas lesbian identity became nonsignificant. DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to assess coping and adjustment in a sample of sexual minority women. Some of our findings were consistent with the literature on presumed heterosexual samples of breast cancer patients. Social support's positive relationship to fighting spirit, was a di\u00ad rect confirmation of prior studies.P' and the re\u00ad verse association between fighting spirit and dis\u00ad tress, even after other factors were controlled, confirmed prior research. IS Because we deemed identity and partner be\u00ad havior important concepts in a study of adapta\u00ad tion and coping in response to breast cancer, we included women who identified as lesbians or bi\u00ad sexuals and women who reported partnering with women. Although we had only few women 222 who reported a sexual orientation other than les\u00ad bian identity, differences in sexual orientation were linked to cognitive avoidance coping and approached significance with distress. These findings highlight the importance of using dif\u00ad ferent measures of sexual orientation in future studies to continue the evaluation of salient dif\u00ad ferences among these different groups. Our data provided weak support for Morris et al.'s modeI23 of predictors and outcomes of dis\u00ad closure among lesbian and bisexual women, in that in our sample, lesbian-identified women were more likely to disclose to providers. How\u00ad ever, disclosure did not have the anticipated pos\u00ad itive outcomes suggested by Morris et al. Instead, we confirmed the earlier finding by McGregor et al.24 of disclosure's lack of relationship to lower distress in lesbians with breast cancer. Also of note is our finding that disclosure was unrelated to coping. Other important contributions of our study are our findings of relationships between disclosure and social support. Our study provided evidence that women in relationships more frequently dis\u00ad closed to providers, most likely indicating the need to disclose to providers if women with breast cancer wished to involve their partner in their care. Finally, the association of greater per\u00ad ception of social support among women who dis\u00ad closed to providers was a hopeful sign, which might mean that women who disclosed to their physicians received their support. This interpre\u00ad tation is consistent with the literature that linked disclosure to providers with satisfaction with care and greater use of routine care.39-41 Our study had several noteworthy negative re\u00ad sults. None of the demographic factors, including younger age, that studies often linked to poorer adjustment42-44 were related to coping or adjust\u00ad ment in our study. In previous studies, there is some recognition that unmarried women are fair\u00ad ing poorer or are at least at risk for poor adjust\u00ad ment.45 In our study, however, being in a com\u00ad mitted relationship, the equivalent of being married except for the absence of legal same-sex marriage at the time of the study, had no positive influence on coping or adjustment. Fatalism and cognitive avoidance coping, linked by prior stud\u00ad ies to distress, were unrelated to the distress level in our sampls.l\" Overall, the sexual minority wo\u00ad men in this sample experienced low levels of emotional distress, lower than the mean (10.18) mood disturbance score of the scale construction sample.P? BOEHMER ET AL. Previous research found little or inconsistent impact of illness factors, such as time since diag\u00ad nosis or type of medical treatment, on coping and adjustment.46-49 Our data revealed an association of chemotherapy and mastectomy with fatalism and an association of mastectomy with distress. In our data, time since diagnosis was consistently unrelated to any of our coping and mood mea\u00ad sures. The lack of influence of time raises ques\u00ad tions if coping and distress responses in this pop\u00ad ulation are stable and linked to the diagnosis. Findings that membership in a cancer-related support group related to higher distress and more cognitive avoidance coping can be understood to indicate emotionally distressed women and those who use more cognitive avoidance coping seek out support groups more frequently. We hope studies will include support group membership as a variable in the future and evaluate its influ\u00ad ence more thoroughly. A number of limitations have to be considered when interpreting the results of this study. Our cross-sectional design allowed us to determine re\u00ad lationships without, however, understanding the causality of these relationships or change over time. We neglected to collect information about long-term side effects, which might also affect coping and adjustment to the disease. Our find\u00ad ings were further limited by the use of a conve\u00ad nience sample, thereby preventing us from gen\u00ad eralizing to the population of lesbians with breast cancer or being confident about the replication of our findings in a larger study. Although this is a valid criticism of our methodology, in other ar\u00ad eas of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health research, the findings of smaller studies that used this sampling strategy were later repli\u00ad cated by methodologically sound population\u00ad based research studies.F thereby underlining the importance of targeted studies, such as ours. CONCLUSIONS This study indicated that in sexual minority women with breast cancer, factors directly related to this sexual minority status influenced coping and adjustment, even after illness and social sup\u00ad port factors were controlled. Lesbian or bisexual identity related to less cognitive avoidance cop\u00ad ing, and lesbian identity related to lower distress. Contrary to expectations, disclosure of sexual ori\u00ad entation did not relate to coping and lower dis\u00ad tress. 223 SEXUAL MINORITY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to the participants who took the time to talk to us and share their thoughts and feel\u00ad ings.

BACKGROUND: Although vaginitis is a common outpatient problem, only 60% of patients can be diagnosed at the initial office visit of a pri-mary care provider using the office procedures of pH testing, whiff tests, normal saline, and potassium hydroxide preps. OBJECTIVE: To determine the most cost-effective diagnostic and treatment approach for the medical management of vaginitis. DESIGN: Decision and cost-effectiveness analyses. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy women with symptoms of vaginitis undiag- nosed after an initial pelvic exam, wet mount preparations, pH, and thefour criteria to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. SETTING: General office practice. METHODS: We evaluated 28 diagnostic strategies comprised of com- binations of pH testing, vaginal cultures for yeast and Trichomonas vaginalis , Gram's stain for bacterial vaginosis, and DNA probes for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia. Data sources for the study were confined to English language literature. MEASUREMENT: The outcome measures were symptom-days and costs. RESULTS: The least expensive strategy was to perform yeast culture, gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia probes at the initial visit, and Gram's stain and Trichomonas culture only when the vaginal pH exceeded 4.9 ($330,7.30 symptom days). Other strategies cost $8 to $76 more and in- creased duration of symptoms by up to 1.3 days. In probabilistic sen- sitivity analysis, this strategy was always the most effective strategyand was also least expensive 58% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with vaginitis symptoms undiagnosed by pelvic examination, wet mount preparations and related office tests, a comprehensive, pH-guided testing strategy at the initial office visit is less expensive and more effective than ordering tests 20:793-799. Vaginitis is one of the 25 most common medical reasons for consulting a physician in the United States,1resulting in 5 to 10 million office visits per year.2Although they encoun- ter vaginitis frequently, primary care practitioners have diffi- culty making an etiologic diagnosis in the office setting.3-9Specialized centers report diagnosing 80% to 90% of women from the initial visit,10but primary care providers report only a 50% to 60% chance of reaching a diagnosis despite extensivelaboratory testing, 4because the typical practitioner lacks the office resources and expertise found in specialized centers. The cost of diagnosis in patients presenting with vaginitis symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the amount oftesting conducted at the initial visit. Most experts agree that diagnosis should begin with a complete pelvic examination, determining the source of the discharge (cervical or vaginal),gross evaluation of the discharge for consistency, and adher- ence to the vaginal walls or cervix; followed by wet mount preparations with saline looking for clue cells, white bloodcells, and Trichomonas vaginalis ; potassium hydroxide (KOH) testing for yeast and the whiff test; and pH testing. 11If these are nondiagnostic, however, should the practitioner: 1) per-form extensive testing at the initial visit, or 2) limit initial test-ing to simple, inexpensive bacteriologic tests to reduce costs and burden to the patient, realizing that more patients will re- quire follow-up visits and testing to reach a definitive diagno-sis? We performed decision and cost-effectiveness analyses to compare these strategies for patients who present with symp- toms of vaginitis, but who remain undiagnosed after initial of-fice-based evaluation. METHODS We constructed a decision tree using a standard computerprogram (Decision Maker 7.06, Pratt Medical Group, Boston)and data derived from relevant peer-reviewed articles in the English language. We then analyzed the outcomes of 28 dif- ferent office-based diagnostic strategies for the medical man-agement of vaginitis. We considered a population of healthy women who present with vaginal discharge, pruritus, irritation or odor who could not be diagnosed by initial office evaluationconsisting of pH; wet mount (KOH and vaginosis (thin, homogeneous discharge; pH 44.5; clue cells and a positive whiff test). We assumed that practi- tioners would not perform Gram's stain in the office. Pregnant patients and those who used over-the-counter treatment forvaginitis were excluded.

Herpes infection can present similarly to vaginitis.Other etiologies are less common (Table 1). For simplicity, we assumed that each patient would have only one causative or- ganism. We considered initial diagnostic strategies that incorpo- rated the following tests, either alone or in combination: vag- inal pH, vaginal cultures for Candida and Trichomonas,Gram's stain for bacterial vaginosis (BV), and DNA probes for N.gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia (GC/Chlamydia probes). We assumed that pH test results would be available during theexamination and could be used to guide further testing at thevisit with a normal pH excluding BV, trichomonas, and atroph- ic vaginitis. We estimated that all other test results besides the initial office evaluations would take two days. Specific treat-ments were based on Centers for disease Control and Preven- tion (CDC) guidelines (Table 2). We also considered 2 empirical treatment strategies: 1) treatment guided by vaginal pH (treat-ment with single dose fluconazole for Candida when the pH is less than 4.9, or treatment with 2 g of metronidazole to cover Trichomonas and/or BV when the pH is greater than 4.9) or 2)treatment with both fluconazole and metronidazole.Further Evaluation Patients who responded to initial treatment were considered cured. We assumed that patients who failed the initial therapy would receive the prescription for the second therapy by tele-phone, but those patients who failed empiric therapy or whowere undiagnosed after the initial round of tests would return for an office visit and undergo all previously unordered tests. We estimated that symptoms from causes of vaginitis otherthan those modeled would resolve 20% of the time without treatment before a second visit. Referral to Specialists The model presumed that patients not responding to twocourses of therapy and those who were undiagnosed despite a complete battery of tests would be referred to an infectiousdisease or gynecology specialist, who would repeat all tests and treat all diagnosable patients appropriately. For patients with symptoms due to causes other than those modeled, weestimated that specialists could successfully treat half. Adverse Outcomes The probability of treatment side effects appears in Table 2.For simplicity, we assumed that side effects would last 2 days and be equal in severity to the vaginitis symptoms. Outcome Measures The model summed the costs of all diagnostic tests, office vis-its, and referrals. Effectiveness was expressed as change in symptom days. We assumed that all vaginitis symptoms wouldbe of equal severity regardless of etiology, would persist untilproperly treated, and would disappear on the third day of suc- cessful treatment. 12 Sensitivity Considerations All quantitative assumptions were subject to one-way sensi- tivity analysis to discern their relative impact on the cost-ef-fectiveness of different strategies. We also conducted aprobabilistic analysis in which we varied all inputs simultane- ously to determine confidence intervals for the results. WeTable 1.

Data and Estimates Yeast BV 90% of the time.3,8,10,11Using these data, we calculated the conditional probability of each of these etiologies given a negative initialoffice evaluation, as well as the probability of each diagnosis depending on vaginal pH (Table 4). For simplicity, we assumed all subsequent tests were conditionally independent and 100%specific. Treatment Efficacy and Side Effects. We based our estimates of the efficacy and side effects of treatments on data from ran- domized clinical trials (Table 2). We assumed vaginal creamswould cause contact dermatitis in 10% of patients, and that fluconazole would cause gastrointestinal symptoms in the same proportion. 14-16Metronidazole causes secondary yeastinfection and gastrointestinal symptoms in 7% to 10% of pa- tients, depending on duration of treatment.18 Costs. All costs were in US dollars for the year 2003 and as- sumed the societal perspective (Table 5). We included all direct medical costs combining the costs of diagnostic testing, phy-sician visits and prescription medications, as well as indirectcosts from lost productivity during physician visits. Costs for diagnostic tests and physician visits were based on the 2003 Medicare Fee Schedule. Drug costs reflect average wholesaleprices. Labor costs were based on US average employee com- pensation for 2003. 34 RESULTS Prevalence of Disease Table 1 shows the prevalence of the common causes of vagi- nitis in patients presenting to practitioners. Using the sensi-tivity of office evaluation described above for each of the causes, the model calculated the prevalence of each cause in the subset of patients with non-diagnostic office wet mountpreparations, both overall and based on vaginal pH (Table 4). Regardless of pH, about 45% of these patients have a diagnosis of ''other'' which cannot be determined by common office tests.Table 3.

The least expensive diagnostic strategy was the most comprehensive: begin with pH testing, yeast cultures and DNA probes for gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia for all patients, butperform Gram's stain and Trichomonas cultures only whenvaginal pH exceeded 4.9 ($330, 7.30 symptom days). Otherstrategies increased average costs by $5 to $81 per patient, and increased duration of symptoms by up to 1.3 days. In general, diagnostic strategies which entailed fewer tests during the initial visit, especially those not testing for yeast, resultedin higher costs because of the greater number of follow-up of-fice visits and the high cost of referral. Empiric Treatment Compared to testing strategies, empiric treatment strategiesresulted in fewer referrals (40% vs 41% to but more ad-verse effects (11% to 19% vs 6%). Diagnostic testing followed by pH-guided empirical therapy while awaiting test results was superior to both empirical treatment and testing alone. De-pending on the testing strategy, the savings associated with adding empirical treatment while awaiting test results ranged from $8 to $63 (mean savings $39), and decreased symptomduration by 0.6 and 1.3 days, even after accounting for addi-tional side effects and costs related to empirical treatment. Empirical treatment while awaiting test results was beneficial even if the side effects of the medications were three times assevere as the vaginitis itself. Sensitivity Analyses Strategies including empiric treatment and those without wereanalyzed separately. Results were similar. Despite the smallTable 5.

Under most circumstances, comprehensive testing guided by pH at the initial visit wasleast expensive. Under certain circumstances, however, order-ing GC/Chlamydia probes at the initial visit was expensive (Fig. 1). Initial GC/Chlamydia testing was least cost-effective when the sensitivities of the initial office evaluations to detect Yeast, BV or Trichomonas were low. As a result, these entities would be relatively more prevalent and GC and Chlamydia lessprevalent. One benefit of GC/Chlamydia testing at the initial visit is avoidance of future visits. However, if the cost of an of- fice visit is low, or undiagnosable patients get better withouttreatment, initial GC/Chlamydia probes are less cost-effective. Under some circumstances checking pH resulted in a worse outcome. The cost-effectiveness of pH testing relies on the ability of low pH to rule out BV and Trichomonas. BV bydefinition has a high pH and studies of Trichomonas show that it uniformly causes a high pH. However, if the sensitivity of pH testing for Trichomonas is less than 85%, pH testing shouldnot be done, because false negative tests will lead to unaccept- able delay in the diagnosis of Trichomonas. Results of Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis In 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, only two diagnostic strate- gies were ever cost-effective. Testing for yeast, BV and Tricho-monas without GC/Chlamydia probes was the least expensive strategy 42% of the time. Comprehensive testing including GC/Chlamydia probes was always the most effective strategy,and was also the least expensive strategy in 58% of the itera-tions.DISCUSSION Understanding the monetary costs and clinical outcomes ofmanaging common medical problems is increasingly neces- sary for health care providers and to society. 35-37Unfortunate- ly, the costs and benefits of alternative diagnostic approachesare not always apparent. In medicine, the traditional approachto diagnosis includes a history and physical examination, fol- lowed by the development of a differential diagnosis and the performance of serial testing to arrive at the most likely diag-nosis. This approach is particularly appealing when tests are potentially harmful, have a high false positive rate, or are ex- pensive. 38The ''shotgun'' approach, where the clinician orders every possible test during the initial contact, is considered wasteful at best, and potentially harmful, in that it can in- crease the likelihood of test complications and diagnostic con-fusion. 39However, in the current healthcare environment, the cost of tests may be small in comparison to the costs of addi- tional office visits, referrals, or emergency department visits resulting from delayed diagnosis. Symptoms of vaginitis are common in medical practice. The history and physical findings are seldom helpful in diag- nosing the etiology of vaginitis symptoms, including the char-acter of the discharge or the presence of an odor. 4While a majority of patients can be diagnosed with simple wet mount preparations and related initial office tests, a substantialnumber remain undiagnosed. The cost of obtaining a diagno- sis for these patients is high, at least $330 (Table 6), more than 6 times the average cost of the office visit ($50.32) itself. The task of choosing a diagnostic strategy is daunting. The clinician must choose from among five tests, each with a different sensitivity, specificity, and cost, then consider em- pirical treatment while awaiting test results. The clinicianmust consider the three common causes of vaginitis, each FIGURE 1 .One-way sensitivity analysis.

Right-hand numbers represent the upper bound in sensitivity analysis.JGIM 797 Carr et al., Cost-effective Diagnosis of Vaginitiswith a different prevalence, as well as a number of less com- mon causes of these symptoms, such as gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia. Ordering every potentially useful test at the initial visit may result in the quickest diagnosis, but is it a reasonableuse of resources? Our analysis suggests that immediate test-ing for all diagnostic possibilities\u2014except BV and trichomonas when vaginal pH is normal\u2014is not only reasonable, but the least expensive clinical strategy, considering the cost of follow-up visits and referrals. Empirical treatment with fluconazole, metronidazole or both in place of testing was not cost-effective, because the ma-jority of patients would not be cured and many would incur unnecessary treatment with attendant side effects, delayed di- agnosis and associated costs. By contrast, adding pH-guidedempiric therapy to any testing strategy while waiting for cul-ture results both shortened symptom duration and decreased cost. Patients treated empirically by pH had immediate relief, without having to wait for culture results, and if cured, did nothave to return for further office visits. Patients who are at high risk of developing complications from vaginal infections, such as pregnant women or womenwho are scheduled for an abdominal or vaginal procedure re- quire accurate, diagnostically guided treatment. Empiric treat- ment would be inappropriate for these women since partialtreatment may interfere with interpretation of subsequent tests. There are a number of limitations to our study. Some re- sults may not be generalizable to all medical practices. For ex-ample, the prevalence of disease among patients with negativeinitial office tests is unknown. For our model, we calculated this probability using the prevalence of each of these etiologies of vaginitis symptoms and the known sensitivity of the initialoffice tests. In individual practices, however, these results will vary depending upon the prevalence of these etiologies in the specific community and the clinician's skill in interpretingthe initial office tests. For example, if a clinician does not easily identify clue cells, undiagnosed patients will have a higher prevalence of BV, and a lower prevalence of GC andChlamydia, making GC/Chlamydia probes less cost-effective for that clinician. Alternatively, if the patient is at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, or if the practitioner has diffi-culty distinguishing between the discharge of cervicitis andthat of vaginitis, GC and Chlamydia probes will invariably be cost-saving. Our study was also limited by available data. Although 45% of the patients in our model could not be diagnosed by simple tests available to the average clinician in office practice, it is unclear how much medical intervention helps these wom-en. We tested these variables in the sensitivity analysis and found that if symptoms resolved in more than one-third of these women without treatment, then testing should be de-ferred to the follow-up visit, as many women would improvebefore a follow-up appointment. Because these women consti- tute such a large percentage of vaginitis patients, more studies are needed to characterize the etiology and prognosis of thiscondition. For simplicity, we also assumed that each case of vaginitis was caused by a single organism. In reality, concurrent diagnoses in genital tract infections are frequent. This fact onlystrengthens the argument for broad testing on the initial visit rather than testing for, and then treating, one entity at a time. There are a number of strengths to our study. A decision analysis allowed us to study this complex problem when doing so in a randomized clinical trial would have been impractical.A second strength is the inclusive nature of our study, which makes the results broadly applicable. While the cost differences among the diagnostic strategies are modest (no more than $81 per case, on average), the highprevalence of vaginitis makes these differences expensive inaggregate. Choosing one diagnostic strategy over another could result in savings of tens of millions of dollars annually on a national basis. Similarly, 1.3 symptom-days may seemtrivial, but when multiplied by one million patients it repre- sents 3,600 patient-years of vaginitis. CONCLUSION Vaginitis is common, yet often difficult for primary care prac- titioners to diagnose effectively in the office setting. Our study suggests that considerable savings and decreased symptoms can be achieved by using vaginal pH to guide testing and treat-ment at the initial office visit for those patients who are undi- agnosed after a complete pelvic examination, evaluation of the discharge, whiff test, pH and wet mount preparations. Undermost circumstances, testing for GC and Chlamydia will also improve outcomes and save money. REFERENCES 1.Paavonen J, Stamm WE. Lower genital tract infections in women.

A written survey was distributed to women aged 18-44 years in the Boston neighborhood of Jamaica Plain. Of the 188 participants, 82% have heard of EC. Knowledge disparities by race/ethnicity groups were seen, with only 51% of Latina women and 75% of Black women having heard of EC compared with99% of White women (p b.0001 and p=.002, respectively). Of the entire cohort, 39% knew that EC works by preventing pregnancy, 48% knew that it should be taken within 72-120 h of unprotected intercourse and 44% knew that it is only available by prescription in Massachusetts. Only 25% of women have ever discussed EC with a health care provider, and only 12% have ever received an advanceprescription. A community education campaign aimed at reproductive-age women, health care providers and pharmacists has been tailored toaddress these knowledge deficits. D2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Keywords: Contraception; Emergency contraception; Family planning 1. Introduction Emergency contraception (EC) has great potential for reducing the number of unintended pregnancies andabortions in the United States [1]. Although only 1% of women have ever used EC [2], as many as 51,000 abortions were likely averted by its use in 2000 [3]. Barriers that have been associated with nonuse of EC are limited knowledge,shame associated with asking for EC and problems ingaining access to EC [4]. Educating reproductive-age women, health care providers and pharmacists about EC isthe first step in reducing these barriers to ensure promptavailability of this method when needed. The Massachusetts EC Network is a coalition of community organizations, medical providers and govern-ment agencies who share a common goal of reducingunintended pregnancies by improving knowledge of andaccess to EC in Massachusetts. The network has launchedan educational campaign in the community of Jamaica Plain in Boston, MA, which began in the fall of 2003.The goal of the campaign is to increase awareness aboutEC through outreach to the public, health care providers and pharmacists. This survey assessed baseline knowledge about EC among reproductive-age women living in thecommunity before the campaign for the purpose ofguiding the design and content of the educationalintervention. 2. Methods This survey project was conducted in May 2003 before the start of the Massachusetts EC Network's educationalcampaign in the community of Jamaica Plain in Boston,MA. This community was chosen because of its socioeco- nomic and ethnic heterogeneity. Additionally, local com- munity groups and health centers had indicated willingnessto participate in the community-based intervention. TheInstitutional Review Board of the Boston Medical Centerapproved this study. 0010-7824/$ - see front matter D2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights 157-160 2.1. Study participants Participants were recruited at public street locations frequented by local residents (near a grocery, retail stores,a neighborhood street fair). We intentionally did not recruitnear any health center to avoid oversampling womenroutinely accessing health care services. Research assistantsapproached women and asked them if they were Jamaica Plain residents. If so, they were asked to participate in the study. Subjects were informed that the anonymous surveywas for the purpose of medical research and that theirparticipation was voluntary. Women who agreed to partic-ipate were given the survey. After completing the survey,women were offered a small bag containing chocolates,condoms and a pamphlet with basic facts about EC. 2.2. Survey instrument The survey was a single-sided, 11-item written question- naire designed for this study. Demographics on age, race/ethnicity and community residence were collected. Womenwho were not aged 18-44 years nor were communityresidents of Jamaica Plain were excluded from the study.Questions about EC are shown in Appendix A. The surveywas designed at a 5th-grade literacy level and was availablein both English and Spanish. The Spanish questionnaire was produced by translating the English questionnaire toSpanish and was then translated back to check for accuracy. The survey was pilot tested, in both English and Spanish, toa representative sample of women. The main outcome was determined by the question, bHave you ever heard of emergency contraception (also called the dmorning-after pill T)?QIf a participant answered bno,Qshe was finished with the survey. If she answered byes,Qshe continued answering the remaining questions about EC. We assumed that if a woman has never heard ofEC or the morning-after pill, that she has no further detailedknowledge about it. 2.3. Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed using SAS for Windows Version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Frequencies of demographic characteristics were determined. To assesswhether our sampling method recruited a cohort represen-tative of the community, demographic characteristics of thestudy participants were compared with the 2000 U.S.Census data for demographic characteristics of women,aged 18-44 years, residing in Jamaica Plain, MA, using v 2 tests for homogeneity. Responses to EC questions were compared by race/ethnicity using pairwise v2analysis. All analyses were two-tailed, using a p value of .05 as criterionfor statistical significance. 3. Results Of the 238 surveys collected, 46 women were ineligible because they were not between the ages of 18 and 44 years,and 4 women were ineligible because they were not residents of the Jamaica Plain community. The remaining 188 surveys were analyzed. The age and race/ethnicitycharacteristics are shown in Table 1 . The race/ethnicity distribution of the women in the sample was representativeof women living in Jamaica Plain according to the 2000U.S. Census data [5]; however, the age distribution did differ significantly (p=.003), with our study populationoverrepresenting the youngest age group.Table 1 Age and race/ethnicity characteristics ( N=188) Characteristic n 20 (11%) Other 6 (3%) Table 2 Responses (%) to EC questions by race/ethnicity ( N=188) Question n= 6) All women ( n=188) Has heard of EC 99 51* 75** 100 82 Has heard of EC and knows that it works by preventing pregnancy44 31 35 33 39 Has heard of EC and knows of the 72 to 120h time window64 24* 35** 50 48 Has heard of EC and knows that it is available only by prescription in Massachusetts57 29** 25** 33 44 Has heard of EC and has discussed it with a health care provider27 22 25 17 25 Has heard of EC and has received an advance prescription13 11 10 0 12 *pb.0001 compared with White women. ** p b.02 compared with White women.C.H. Chuang, K.M. Freund / Contraception 71 (2005) 157-160 158Responses to the EC questions are shown in Table 2 . Overall, 82% of women have heard of EC or the morning-after pill. Only 39% of women knew that EC works bypreventing pregnancy. About half of the women (48%)knew that EC should be taken within 72-120 h ofunprotected intercourse (18% never heard of EC, 23% believed it had to be taken sooner, 1% believed it could be taken up to a week and 9% didn't know). When asked howto get EC in Massachusetts, 44% knew that it was availableonly by prescription in Massachusetts (18% never heard ofEC, 2% thought it was not available at all, 4% thought itwas sold over the counter and 31% didn't know). Still fewerwomen have ever discussed EC with a health care provider(25%) or received an advance prescription for it (12%). Responses to the EC questions differed by race/ethnicity, as seen in Table 2 . Only 51% of Latina women and 75% of Black women had heard of EC compared with 99% ofWhite women (p b.0001 and p=.002, respectively). Fewer Latina women than White women knew that EC should betaken within 72-120 h of unprotected intercourse (24% vs.64%; p b.0001) and that it is available only by prescription in Massachusetts (29% vs. 57%; p=.001). Similarly, Black women were also significantly less likely than White women to know that EC should be taken within 72-120h of unprotected intercourse (35% vs. 64%; p=.02) and thatEC is only available by prescription in Massachusetts (25%vs. 57%; p=.01). 4. Discussion Our finding that 82% of women in our sample have heard of EC is higher than that reported in earlier national surveys.In 1994, only 55% of women in a nationally representativesample have heard of EC [2], and, in 1996, only 28% of American teenagers have heard of it [6]. This increase in awareness likely represents time trends as well as differencesin the populations sampled. Although recognition of EC inthis study was higher than in previous reports, specific knowledge about how and when EC works and how to get it is still poor. Latina and Black women in this sample weresignificantly less likely to have heard of EC and to havespecific knowledge about it as compared with White women. Few women have discussed EC with a health care provider or received an advance prescription for it. Severalmedical organizations have incorporated guidelines onroutine counseling and advance prescriptions for EC [7-9] . Although this effective form of postcoital contraception was first described more than 30 years ago, physicians still havelittle experience with prescribing it [10-16] . Our findings inform the specialties of internal medicine, family medicine,obstetrics and gynecology and adolescent health of the needto increase EC education and provision into routine care. Limitations of this study include the sampling framework that may not include a representative group of women from the community. Sampling street pedestrians in shopping areas may underrepresent low-income women or those withphysical limitations. Despite these potential limitations, the study sample did approximate the ethnic demographicdistribution of the reproductive-age women in the commu-nity according to most recent census information. The purpose of this survey project was to inform the Massachusetts EC Network of the baseline knowledge of EC to aid in the design of a community education campaign. The survey provided the planning process with theknowledge that although most women have already heardof EC, detailed knowledge that women need about how toget and how to take EC needs to be improved. Therefore,educational programs that target local health care providersand pharmacists are being focused on methods of deliveringeffective and accurate information about EC to patients and clients. Furthermore, the survey results pointed to the need for specific interventions targeting minority women toreduce the disparity of knowledge in these groups. TheMassachusetts EC Network has been in collaboration withLatina community leaders and community groups servingthe Latina community in an effort to reach this group ofwomen. A second survey project is planned after thiscommunity education campaign is completed to evaluate the effectiveness of this undertaking.

Materials and Methods: Primary care providers completed a preintervention survey prior to attending a lecture on EC, and again 6 months later. There were 50 physicians. 4 advanced practice nurses and 2 physician assistants in the final sample (internal medicine 48%, family medicine 34%, obstetrics-gynecology 9%, and pediatrics/adolescent medicine 9%). Results: Following the intervention. providers were more likely to agree that advance prescriptions should be given, disagree that the number of times EC is dispensed should be restricted and disagree that repeated EC use poses health risks. The proportion of providers who had ever given an advance prescription increased from 18% to 41% (p= .007), and there was a trend toward a greater proportion of providers initiating counseling about EC from 36% to 54')1. (p= .057). Conclusions: A simple educational intervention was associated with a change in primary care provider attitudes and practice patterns regarding EC. (~, 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Emergency contraceptive (EC) pills are combined estrogen-progestin pills or progestin-only pills that reduce the risk of pregnancy when taken after unprotected intercourse [1,2]. In May 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected a levonorgestrel EC product for over-the-counter status. As a prescription-only medica\u00ad tion, access to EC will continue to be limited until health care providers are knowledgeable and comfortable with prescribing this method of contraception. Since EC is more effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse [2,3], barriers that impede the timely administration of this method need to be minimized. The health care provider should be able to determine whether the patient is eligible for EC and prescribe it without delay. Since the primary care provider is often a patient's first access to the health care system, all primary care providers should be well informed about EC. Unfortunately, surveys of primary care providers in Corresponding author. Tel.: +17175318161; fax: +17175317726. E-mail address: cchuang@psu.edu (C.H.

All rights reserved. doi:10.10 16/j .contraception.2005 .04.012 internal medicine, family medicine and adolescent medicine show that they are not prescribing this form of contracep\u00ad tion often [4-10]. In addition to prescribing at the time of need, health care providers can give advance prescriptions for EC. This is the practice of providing prescriptions for EC to women of reproductive age in advance of need. By having a prescription on hand, a woman has more timely access to EC. Several studies have shown that advance provision of EC is effective in increasing the likelihood of its use in the event of unprotected intercourse without compromising regular contraceptive use [11-16]. In an effort to increase the practice of providing advance prescriptions, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has encouraged its members to routinely provide advance prescriptions for EC during health maintenance visits [17]. However, it is not known how often advance prescribing is currently being practiced. A qualitative study of primary care providers suggests that physician miscon\u00ad ceptions about EC lead to reluctance to provide advance prescriptions [18]. This study tests the effect of a very simple intervention that could be easily implemented and reach many health 183 C.H Chuang, K.M. Freund I Contraception 72 (l005) 182-186 care providers. Health care providers frequently attend lectures for continuing medical education. Although passive group education has had mixed results in changing physician behavior [19,20], we hypothesized that EC may be amenable to such an intervention since providing EC is simple and requires minimal training. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of a single educational intervention about EC on primary care providers. 2. Methods The Boston Medical Center's Women's Health Unit sent letters to directors of continuing education programs at hospitals and health centers throughout Massachusetts offering a lecture program on EC designed for an audience of primary care providers. A brief description of the study was included in the letter. The lecture program was then scheduled at responding institutions between August and December 2002. The institutional review board at the Boston Medical Center approved this study. Attendees to the lectures were invited to participate in this study. Primary care providers with prescribing authority (physicians, advance practice nurses and physician assis\u00ad tants) were eligible to participate. A cover letter distributed with the survey described the purpose of the study and stated that informed consent for participating in the study was implied with return of the survey. Surveys were filled out and returned prior to the start of the lecture, Each participant was asked to provide his/her name and mailing address for the follow-up survey, which he/she would receive in 6 months. Respondents who did not describe themselves as primary care providers or who do not have women patients were excluded from the study. 2.1. Preintervention survey The survey was a 38-item self-administered written questionnaire designed for this study to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice patterns regarding EC. Some ques\u00ad tions were adapted from previous studies [5,9]. Personal demographic items assessed age, sex, race/ethnicity and religion. Professional demographics items described type of medical degree (physician, advance practice nurse or physician assistant), year of graduation, specialty and practice location (urban, suburban, rural). Knowledge of EC was assessed with seven multiple-choice items regarding awareness of FDA approval, availability of dedicated products, teratogenicity, mechanism of action, timing of administration and efficacy. Attitudes about EC were measured with five items using a S-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). Emergency contraception practice patterns were assessed with 13 items describing frequency ofrequests, frequency of prescribing and advance prescribing, and frequency of counseling about EC during routine health maintenance visits. Frequency of counseling was described as always, often, sometimes, seldom or never. 2.2. Intervention The 45-min presentation on EC was designed for this study. The lecture content included description of EC, recommendations from professional medical organizations, history of EC, review of EC regimens and products, safety and efficacy data, mechanism of action, patient screening and management information, side effects, and studies on advance provision of EC. A pocket-sized card with EC prescribing information, a patient information handout on EC and \"Ask me about EC' buttons were distributed at the time of the lecture. 2.3. Postintervention survey The postintervention survey was mailed to the partic\u00ad ipants 6 months following the lecture they attended. The postintervention survey was identical to the preintervention survey, excluding the demographic items.

Subsequent analyses were restricted to those providers who completed both surveys, in order to assess the effect of the intervention. The proportion of providers who correctly answered each knowledge item was compared pre- and postinterven\u00ad tion using -/ analysis. The overall number of correct responses (out of seven items) was compared pre- and postintervention using the paired t test. Attitudes are presented as the proportion of respondents who agree (strongly agree and agree) with positive statements or disagree (strongly disagree or disagree) with negative statements about EC. The mean response on the 5-point Likert scale is also presented. Significance testing for changes in attitude scores was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The proportion of providers who have ever prescribed EC, who initiate counseling about EC during routine health maintenance visits at least sometimes and who have ever written an advance prescrip\u00ad tion for EC was compared using X2 tests. The number of prescriptions and advance prescriptions given in the past 6 months was analyzed pre- and postintervention using paired t tests. All statistical tests were two-tailed using an alpha of .05 as criterion for statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS, version 8.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 3. Results Lectures were conducted for this study between August and December 2002 at seven hospital grand rounds. Of the 86 preintervention surveys collected, 5 respondents were not primary care providers (1 hospitalist and 4 subspecialists) and 1 respondent did not have women patients in his/her practice, leaving 80 surveys eligible for the preintervention analysis. Four providers did not give contact information, 3 had incorrect addresses and I person stated on the survey they were unable to stay for the lecture, leaving 72 providers eligible for the 6-month follow-up mail survey. Of these 72 eligible participants, 56 follow-up surveys were received for a response rate of 78%. 3.1. Characteristics ofrespondents There were 50 physicians, 4 advanced practice nurses and 2 physician assistants in the postintervention analysis (Table 1). They described their specialties as primary care internal medicine (48%), family medicine (34%), obstetrics\u00ad gynecology (9%), and pediatrics/adolescent medicine (9%). The mean age of respondents was 39 years (S.D. II), 39% were men, 75% White, 18% Asian, 5% Latino and 2% Black. Providers' religious affiliations were divided be\u00ad tween Catholic (27%), Protestant (24%) and Jewish (20%). The majority of providers worked in urban locations (73%). Nonrespondents did not significantly differ from the respondents in these demographic characteristics. 3.2. Emergency contraception knowledge The provider knowledge data are shown in Table 2. Preintervention knowledge about EC was high. Out of the seven knowledge items. the mean number of correct res\u00ad ponses was 5.8\u00b1 1.2. Following the intervention, the mean number of correct responses remained high at 6.0\u00b1 1.5. 3.3. Changes in attitudes The effect of the intervention on attitudes toward EC is shown in Table 3. The proportion of providers agreeing that advance prescriptions should be routinely given increased from 36% before the intervention to 66% after the intervention (p= .0006). Following the intervention, more providers disagreed that the number of times EC should be dispensed to a patient should be restricted (64% ...

Most of the providers, however, did not agree that EC should be available as an over-the-counter medication. The majority disagreed that EC encourages inconsistent contraceptive use, and this was unchanged following the lecture. 3.4. Changes in practice patterns The effect of the intervention on provider practice patterns of EC is shown in Table 4. There was no significant change in the proportion of providers who had ever prescribed EC or in the average number of times EC was prescribed for unprotected intercourse in the past 6 months. However, the number of providers who had ever given an advance prescription for EC increased from 18% to 41% (p= .007). The average number unchanged (1.4\u00b14.4 preintervention vs. 1.8\u00b15.1 postintervention). There was also a trend toward an increasing proportion of providers who reported initiating counseling about EC at least sometimes during routine Table 4 Emergency con traception practice patterns pre- and pos tintervent ion (11=56) Practice pattern Prcintcrvcntion Postintcrvention p value Ever prescribed EC 82 86 .61 Number of EC 2.9+5.6 3.3+7.3 .24\" prescriptions in past 6 months Ever provided advance 18 41 .007 prescription for EC Number of advance 1.4+4.4 1.8+5.1 .53\" prescriptions in past 6 months Counsels about EC at 36 54 .057 least sometimes \" Paired t test. health maintenance VISits (36% preintervention vs. 54% postintervention, p= .057). 4. Discussion We found that a single educational lecture resulted in a greater proportion of providers who give advance prescrip\u00ad tions for EC, and a trend toward an increasing proportion who routinely counsel about EC. Attitudes about EC were also improved following the program. Baseline knowledge scores were high and remained high following the inter\u00ad vention. Adequate knowledge may therefore not be the main barrier to providing EC. Other barriers, such as attitudes and time constraints, may playa larger role. While EC remains available by prescription only, we must rely on medical providers to be accessible, knowl\u00ad edgeable and willing to provide EC without delay. There have been a few interventions aimed at improving health care provider use of EC in the United States. From 1996 to1998, a demonstration project was conducted at San Diego County Kaiser Permanente with the aim of changing EC knowledge, attitudes and practices among health care providers. The intervention involved providing repackaged oral contraceptives for use as EC, development of provider and patient information materials, and training of health care providers and staff. The result of this 2-year project was an increase in the proportion of providers who had prescribed EC in the preceding year from 30% to 49% and improvement in providers' knowledge scores of EC [9]. Other efforts toward improving access have been through programs that allow pharmacist provision of EC in Washington, California, Alaska, New Mexico and Hawaii. In these states, a pharmacist may dispense Ee to a client without a prescription. Several other states are introducing legislation to have similar pharmacy agreements, but such projects may take years to implement. These types of undertakings require large coordinated efforts and resources that are not currently available in all states. 186 c.s. Chuang, K.!vf. Freund / Contraception 71 (2005) 182-186 Our intervention was inexpensive and easy to replicate, Since the American public is largely unaware that there is a contraceptive that can be used after intercourse [6,21,22], efforts by providers to educate their patients are important in an attempt to increase access to this method. Advance provision of prescriptions for EC has been recommended by ACOG [17], and studies suggest that this practice could significantly increase use of EC [11-14], but whether this is being practiced has not been previously described. In our sample of primary care providers, only a minority had ever given an advance prescription for EC, but this increased in the 6 months after the program. This study has several limitations. There was no control group, so it is not possible to ascertain whether influences outside of the study intervention may have contributed to the findings. However, our study occurred prior to recent press publicizing over-the-counter consideration of EC by the FDA. Our sample size is small and limited to providers mostly from urban areas, which limits our ability to estimate the potential effect of our intervention to a more diverse group of primary care providers. Also, providers choosing to attend a lecture on EC are likely to have more positive attitudes about EC than other providers, and perhaps more willing to change their EC prescribing practices. However, by including lectures into existing grand round schedules, and not developing them as freestanding programs, we maximized the potential to reach a broad audience. Medical centers, primary care practices, school/college health centers and other primary care groups should invite similar programs on EC. Such efforts to improve access are the first steps toward prevention of unintended pregnancies with this effective form of contraception. Other interven\u00ad tions aimed at health care providers should also be developed and studied in order to continue to improve awareness of EC among primary care providers.

Previous reports suggest a potential effect of citizenship status on receipt of cancer screening32,33; however. one presents only unadjusted data on citizenship. status and Papsmearuse.33 andtheotheris a preliminary report.32 fur\u00ad thermore. both of these studies are limited to a single urban location and to one racial/ethnic group. Immigrants who are not U.S. citizens constitute an im\u00ad portant and rapidly growing segment of U.S. and California populations. Currently. close to 18 million non-U.S. citizens live in the United States29 and only in the last decade their numbers have increased by over 50%.29 While the number of immigrants who became U.S. citizens has increased by 71% in the last three decades. the number of Immigrants who re\u00ad mained non-U.S. citizens has California hasa higherpercentage andnumber of any in the country; approxt\u00ad mately 5.5 million noncitizens live in the state.29 Therefore. identifying factors than prevent immigrant women from receiv\u00ad ing appropriate cancer screening continues to be an important public health goal. In this report, we analyze data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) to assess the impact of citizenship status on the receipt of Pap smears and ma\u00ad mmograms among immigrant women in California. METHODS Data Source and Study Population We analyzed data from the 2001 CHIS. The CHIS is a telephone survey of the state of California civilian. nontnstttutionaltzed population. The CHIS is a two-stage. geographically stratified random-digit-dial sample conducted for the first time in 2001. Personnel from CHIS interviewed one randomly selected adult in each of the 55.000 households sampled in the state. Major 290 JGIM De Alba et al., U.S. Citizenship Status and Cancer Screening 291 .-;.. I , content areas for the survey included health-related behaviors, health status and conditions, health insurance coverage. and access to health care services. The interviews were conducted in 6 languages: English. Spanish. Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese dialects), Vietnamese, Korean, and Khmer (Cam\u00ad bodian). The overall response rate for the 2001 CHIS adult survey was 37.7%.34 We examined the impact of citizenship status on the re\u00ad ceipt of Pap smears and mammograms among immigrant women living in California. Immigrants were defined as indi\u00ad viduals born outside the United States or its territories who currently live in this country. For our analyses on Pap smear use. we included women age 18 or older without a hysterecto\u00ad my. Women with history of cervical cancer were not excluded because theywouldneedcontinued screening.35 Forouranal\u00ad yses on mammogram use, we included women age 40 or older. Although there were inconsistencies in the guidelines regard\u00ad ing screening mammograms for women age 40 to 49 at the time the data were collected, citizens and noncitizens in this age group should receive mammograms in the same propor\u00ad tion. There are considerable cultural differences between im\u00ad migrant women and those born in the United States. To de\u00ad crease the confounding effect of cultural factors. we limited our analysis of the impact of citizenship status on Pap smear and mammogram use to immigrants. Therefore. we compared use of Pap smears and mammograms between those immigrants who became U.S. citizens. know as naturalized citizens. and those who remained as noncitizens. Noncitizens are a hetero\u00ad geneous group and include legal permanent residents. refu\u00ad gees. asylees, undocumented immigrants. and others. Variables Assessed The outcomes of interest were receiving a Pap smear in the past 3 years. a Pap smear ever. a mammogram in the past 2 years. and a mammogram ever according to generally accepted preventive guidelines.3536 We developed a multivariable logts\u00ad tic regression model for each outcome of interest. Self-reported citizenship status (U.S. citizen or non-Ll.S, citizen) was the main independent variable. We considered the following to be potential confounders in all models: age (continuous variable), race/ethnicity (non-His\u00ad panic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian. and other race). education attainment \u00ab high school, high school, or >high school). annual household income \u00ab200% or 2:200% the federal poverty level), having health insurance (any coverage or no insurance). having a usual source of health care (yes or no). years in the United States \u00ab 10 or 2:10 years). and self-reported health status (excellent, very good. or good vs fair or poor). We also included English language proficiency as a controlling variable and it included 2 categories: high (speak English \"very well\" or \"well\") and low (speak English \"not well\" or \"not at all\"). The Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Irvine approved this research project as exempt of review. because it Involves use of publicly available data without personal identifiers. Statistical Analysis All analyses were performed with SAS Callable SUDAAN (Ver\u00ad sion 7.5.6 for Windows; Research Triangle Park, NC) to ac\u00adcount for the CHIS's complex sampling design and to obtain proper variance estimations. For the data analysis, we first generated descrtpttve statistics for each study variable. To characterize factors associated with the outcomes of interest. we then conducted a btvartable analysis using X2 tests to com\u00ad pare categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. Two-tailed P values less than or equal to .05 were considered statistically significant. To assess collinearity, we estimated Pearson correlation coefficients between all pairs of variables; a coefficient score 2: 0.7 defined collinearity. We also assessed multicollinearity. which we defined as tolerance test scores < 0.1 and variance inflation factors of > 2. We found no collin\u00ad earity among independent variables included in the models. To determine the impact of citizenship status on use of Pap smears and mammograms, we developed the 4 multtvar\u00ad iable logistic regression models described, one for each out\u00ad come of interest, adjusting for all confounders described previously. Because the outcome of interest Is prevalent in our population, the odds ratios may magnify or overstate the risk association. Therefore. in order to produce accurate ap\u00ad proximations of the risk ratios, we transformed odds ratios in\u00ad to prevalence ratios following standard proceduresr'\" we present the results in both odds ratios and prevalence ratios. The adjusted prevalence of receiving a screening test was com\u00ad pared between naturalized citizens and noncitizen immi\u00ad grants. We used the Wald F statistic to compare the levels of explanatory variables. RESULTS A total of 6.320 women were included in our analysis of cer\u00ad vical cancer screening and 3,828 in the analysis of breast can\u00ad cer screening; 47% and 65% were naturalized citizens. respectively. Naturalized citizens in both samples were older and more likely to report having health insurance. a usual source of care, more than high school education. and an an\u00ad nual income of 200% of the federal poverty level or higher as compared to noncitizen immigrants (Table 1). As expected, naturalized citizens were also more likely to report speaking English well and 93% in the cervical cancersample and 97% in the breast cancer sample had been in the United States for 10 years or more as compared to 55% and 75%. respectively. of noncitizens. Most naturalized citizens were Hispanic or Asian. reflect\u00ad ing the large number of parttctpants from these groups. How\u00ad ever. the majority of Hispanics in our sample were noncitizens (Table 1). White women represented only 20% of the natural\u00ad ized citizens and 9% of the noncitizens in the Pap smear use sample and 26% and 14%, respectively, in the mammogram use sample. Overall. 82.7% of trnmtgrants reported a Pap smear in the past 3 years and 88. 1% a Pap smear ever; 55% reported a ma\u00ad mmogram in the past 2 years and 840/0 a mammogram ever. Naturalized citizens were more likely to report having Pap smears and mammograms recently or ever. In the multlvartable logtstic regression models. after ad\u00ad justmg for potential confounders. naturalized citizens were more likely to report receiving a Pap smear in the past 3 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR!, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CII. 1.03 to 1.11) and ever Iaf'R, 1.05; 950/0 CI, 1.01 to 1.08) as compared to noncitizens (Table 2).

Those In the United States for 10 years or more were more likely to report ever having a Pap smear, as were individuals over the age of 30. Compared to the youngest age group (18-29 years), women between 30 and 64 years old were most likely to get a recent Pap smear and women age 65 and older were the least likely [fable 2). AB compared to white women, Hispanics were sig\u00ad nificantly more likely to report having a Pap smear ever or In the past 3 years and Asians were less likely to report any of these outcomes as compared to any other racial/ethnic group. Naturalized citizens were more likely to report a mammo\u00ad gram ever (aPR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.21) or In the past 2 years (aPR, 1.38; 95% CI. 1.26 to 1.49) as compared to non\u00ad citizens (Table 3). Other factors significantly associated With both of these outcomes were having a usual source of care, having health Insurance. being In the United States over 10 years. and women in the 5G-64 years of age group. AB com\u00ad pared to white women. Astans were less likely to report a ma\u00ad mmogram In the past 2 years or ever. There was no difference between white women and Hispanics. Being In the United States for 10 years or more was significantly associated With having a mammogram ever but not with having one In the past 2 years. DISCUSSION We found that not being a U.S. citizen is a barrier to receiving cervical and breast cancer screening among immigrants In California. Even after adjusting for soctodemographtcs, access to health care, English proficiency, and years In the United States. noncitizens were less likely to receive cervical or breast cancer screening as compared to Immigrants who were U.S. citizens. Consideration must be given to explanations for our flnd\u00ad tngs. Noncitizen Immigrants in our study were disproportion\u00ad ately affected by factors that have a negative impact on health care access and utilization. They had lower Income. education, and English proficiency levels as compared to immigrants who had become U.S. citizens.

When they formally become U.S. citizens. they may embrace cancer screening as an expected behavior of citizens of this country. Acquiring U.S. citizenship may change attitudes and behaviors among many Immigrants. Including those related to health such as cancer screening. Noncitizens are a heterogeneous group with diverse soc\u00ad iodemographic characteristics and health services use rates.39-44 In the case of California. groups such as refugees and undocumented Immigrants constitute an Important pro\u00ad portion of noncitizen Immigrants and their cancer screening rates may Influence those of noncitizens in general. 43 Refugees and undocumented immigrants may be disproportionatelyaf\u00ad fected by cultural. knowledge. and attitudinal barriers to can\u00ad cer screening. such as fatalism. fear. and lack of knowledge of preventive health interventions or their beneflts.17 2D-2 4 The legal status of some noncitizens may be an additional barrier. perceived by the patient or imposed by care sites intentionally or unintentionally. to access and use health services.

We also found that having a usual source of care and health insurance were strong predictors of recent or ever screening for cervical and breast cancer among immigrants In California. supporting findings in previous studtes.v'' Un\u00ad expectedly. education and language proficiency were not as\u00ad sociated with the outcomes assessed in our sample of Immigrants. with the exception of those with a high school diploma being more likely to report ever having a mammo\u00ad gram.

This result supports findings of previous studies30 ,33.39,60-62 and high\u00ad lights the need for culturally sensitive interventions targeting this relevant and numerous group. Our study has several limitations. The CHIS data are based on self-report, which involves recall and social desira\u00ad bility biases. Previous research shows that self-report overes\u00ad timates screening rates, in particular among low-income ethnic women such as noncitizens.63-65 In this case, self-re\u00ad port would bias our results toward a null finding; it would de\u00ad crease the cancer screening gap between naturalized citizens and noncitizens. Because of the relatively low response rate in the CHIS, the possiblltty ofnonresponse bias exists. In an at\u00ad tempt to adjust for this, the racial/ethnic and soctoderno\u00ad graphic profiles in our sample are weighted to match those of the 2000 U.S. Census for the state. Furthermore. the un\u00ad weighted racial/ ethnic profiles are very similar to those in the census data, suggesting that the sample is representative of the population of California. Due to the sensitive nature of legal status in the United States, some undocumented immi\u00ad grants may have refused to participate in the survey. The ex\u00ad clusion of a group of noncitizens with presumably lower screening rates, such as undocumented immigrants, would increase the observed noncitizens' overall screening rates and decrease the disparities with citizens. again biasing the find\u00ad ings to the null hypothesis. Additionally, some noncitizens may have provided inaccurate representation of their citizen\u00ad ship or legal status. However, cross-contamination would also bias our results toward the null. Because legal status of CHIS participants is not provided in the publicly available database, we could not estimate the contrfbutlon of undocumented im\u00ad migrants or refugees to the screening rates of noncitizens. Fi\u00ad nally, the magnitude of effects was relatively small: however, a small increase in the prevalence ratio remains important be\u00ad cause it represents large numbers of screening tests done. Understanding the impact of citizenship status on Pap smear use may have public health policy implications at a na\u00ad tionallevel but in particular to states such as California. Tex\u00ad as, New York, New Jersey, and Florida, where almost 70% of non-Ll.S, citizens live.29 The findings of our study may help policy makers design more effective interventions aimed at eliminating barriers to cancer screening and help guide imple\u00ad mentation of community-based educational programs and outreach initiatives among immigrants. Community-based educational interventions should highlight the need for screening among all women regardless of citizenship or legal residency status in a culturally sensitive manner. They should JGIM De Alba et al. U.S. Citizenship Status and Cancer Screening 295 also address potential psychological and attitudinal barrters among noncitizens such as the perception that cancer screen\u00ad tng is a prtvtlege or duty limited to citizens of this country. fu\u00ad ture research should explore the nature of psychological and attitudinal barrters that prevent cancer screening among non\u00ad citizen immigrant women and look at additional cultural and social factors. Future studies should also explore the impact of legal status on use of Pap smears, mammograms, and other health services among subgroups of noncitizens. Not being a U,S. citizen is a barrter to receivtng cervical and breast cancer screening. Additional research is needed to explore causal factors for differences in cancer screening rates between citizens and noncitizens. For the time being, immi\u00ad grants, especially those who are not U.S. citizens, should be targeted for improved health care access and appropriate can\u00ad cer screening.

Methods: Adult male veterans seen between 1997 and 2000 with ESs were compared with those with PNESs with respect to clinical history (head trauma, antiepileptic drug exposure, de\u00ad pression, anxiety, substance abuse, seizure description), mented chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), com\u00ad pensation for diagnosis, neurologic examination, and test results including imaging and EEG data. Results: Men with PNESs were younger and reported more frequent events, and diagnoses of chronic pain, anxiety, and PTSD were significantly greater. Neuroimaging [computed to\u00ad mography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain] and neurologic examination were significantly more likely to be normal or nonspecific in pts with PNESs, although history of ictal urinary incontinence or service-connected compensation for diagnosis did not distinguish the groups. Conclusions: Male veterans with PNESs have characteris\u00ad tics similar to those reported in the literature, even though younger women have dominated previously studied populations. Compared with men with ESs, those with PNESs are more likely to have chronic pain, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as nor\u00ad mal examinations and patients with seizure-like episodes that do not re\u00ad spond to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (1,2). Consequently, patients with PNESs are at risk of receiving inappropriate medications for prolonged treatment periods or invasive intervention such as vagal nerve stimulation (3). These treatments are costly and potentially dangerous. Diagno\u00ad sis is typically delayed until referral for video-EEG mon\u00ad itoring (4,5). Presence of PNESs has been shown to be associated with a lower quality of life and higher level of stress compared with the presence of epileptic seizures (ESs) (6-8). This further highlights the importance of ac\u00ad curate diagnosis. Most of what is understood about PNESs is derived from studies conducted at tertiary epilepsy centers where 10 to 58% of adult patients with intractable spells are ul\u00ad timately diagnosed with PNESs (9,10). In these studies, 65-80% of patients are young and female, which has led Accepted April 24, 2005.

E-mail: bdworetzky@partners.org to the commonly held opinion that PNESs are less impor\u00ad tant in men. Furthermore, a small number of studies have demonstrated that significant gender differences may exist in background and clinical manifestations (11,12). For ex\u00ad ample, compared with women, men with PNESs are more likely to be substance abusers, report minor head injury, have a documented financial gain from having seizures, and worse emotional adjustment by MMPI-ll testing (12\u00ad 14). Having a history of physical or sexual abuse appears to be more common in women with PNES, but is still more likely in men with PNESs than in the general pop\u00ad ulation of men. Abuse is correlated with conversion the primary psychopathologic correlate of PNESs; nonconversion etiologies such as anxiety, psychosis, and impulse-control disorders, interestingly, have shown sim\u00ad ilar frequencies in men and women (15,16) Other studies suggest that PNESs may appear clinically different in men than in women (12,16), with more dramatic-appearing mo\u00ad tor movements and less affective change in men (17). Gen\u00ad der also may be an important prognostic factor, because the probability of a favorable outcome of PNESs is higher in women than in men (18). Gender differences in the use of health care services and the widespread belief that 1418 ,.. 1419 PSYCHOGENICNONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES PNESs is primarily a woman's may impede re\u00ad TABLE 1.

Vascular 7 METHODS Subjects were consecutive adult male veterans evalu\u00ad ated for spells in a VA seizure clinic or admitted to the VA neurology ward for long-term video-EEG monitor\u00ad ing (LTM) between 1997 and 2000. This study was ap\u00ad proved by the Institutional Review Board of the Boston VA Healthcare System. Of 2,443 total patient encounters, 288 unique patients were seen. Female patients were ex\u00ad cluded (n = 37); 140 male patients were excluded on the basis of incomplete data, limited mental status ex\u00ad amination, or lack of evidence for an episodic disorder. Of 111 eligible patients, we excluded those with probable PNESs but definite interictal epileptiform discharges (n = 3), no clinical events captured during the monitored period (n = 45), only subjective events during monitoring (n = 4), or purely physiological spells [vasovagal syncope, parox\u00ad ysmal coughing, hypnic (sleep onset) jerks; n = 3). Of the remaining patients, 22 had PNESs based on a his\u00ad tory of paroxysmal behavioral events to suggest epileptic seizures, and at least one typical event captured on moni\u00ad toring either spontaneously or with suggestion strongly suggesting PNESs without ictal, interictal, or postictal EEG change, no response to AEDs, and no events sug\u00ad gestive of ESs, as defined by Vanderzant et aI. (21). The ESs group totaled 34 and was defined as patients with an unequivocal history of epilepsy, no events to suggest PNESs, and definite epileptiform discharges on EEG, ic\u00ad tally (n = 12) or interictally (n = 22) or both, interpreted by a certified electroencephalographer (B.D.). Duration of disease for this group on average was 18.3 years, with a range from 1 to 56 years. Classification of seizure types and epilepsy syndromes are shown in Table 1. Clinical history and neuroimaging data extracted from the elec\u00ad tronic medical record were used to compare PNES and ES patients. A registered nurse (J.P.) interviewed all patients and recorded on a standardized intake form information re\u00ad garding history of chronic pain, sleep problems, substance abuse, prior head trauma, family history of seizures, his\u00ad tory of childhood epilepsy, febrile convulsions, and phys\u00ad ical or sexual abuse. Neuropsychological assessment was reviewed where available but was too incomplete for for\u00ad mal analysis. AED therapy and service-connected com\u00adpensation was ascertained from the medical record. Psy\u00ad chiatric diagnoses, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, were included if they were documented in the medical record by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. All data were analyzed by using two-tailed t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. RESULTS Compared to male veterans with ESs, those with PNESs were ~ 10 years younger (Table 2). Handedness, educa\u00ad tion level, employment status, and race did not signifi\u00ad cantly differ between groups (see Table 2). PNES patients were more likely to have a normal neurologic examina\u00ad tion and a normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain (see Table 2). PNES patients had more\u00ad frequent events than did ES patients, with the majority complaining of daily episodes (Table 3). The groups re\u00ad ported similar clinical symptoms, with the exception of more staring spells for the ES group (see Table 3). Fur\u00ad thermore, report of incontinence by history was similar in both groups. Both groups had similar reports of substance abuse, sleep-related problems, and depressive symptoms, whereas PNES patients were significantly more likely to report chronic pain, anxiety, and PTSD (Table 4). More than 95% of PNES patients were treated with AEDs be\u00ad fore receiving their diagnosis. Of these, 77% received monotherapy. ES patients were more likely to be receiving polytherapy (see Table 2). PNES and ES groups did not significantly differ with respect to the proportion of pa\u00ad tients who received compensation for their diagnosis or in the number of years that a patient experienced the seizures before entry into this study (see Table 2). DISCUSSION This study offers a unique opportunity to focus on dif\u00ad ferences between individuals with ESs and PNESs in a relatively older male population, a group that has been un\u00ad derrepresented in the epilepsy literature as well as in prac\u00ad tice in epilepsy monitoring units.

(22), publishing retrospective data on PNES in older pop\u00ad ulations, reported that 27% of patients older than 60 years who undergo diagnostic video-EEG monitoring are found to have NES; 13%, PNES; and 14%, of physiologic cause (i.e., cataplexy, This and other recent stud\u00ad ies suggest that PNESs, either psychogenic or physio\u00ad logic, should be strongly considered in older patients with episodic seizure-like events (23,24). Despite reported gender differences, the clinical char\u00ad acteristics of male veterans with NESs are similar to what has been shown in the literature for women. When com\u00ad pared with patients with ESs, male veterans with PNESs in this investigation were, on average, 10 years younger and reported a higher frequency of episodes. However, the groups did not differ with respect to education or employ\u00ad ment history. Incidence of PTSD, a clear risk factor for PNESs in women, has been found in a significantly higher proportion of the male PNES than ES patients as well (25\u00ad 27). The association of chronic pain, painful \"auras,\" es\u00ad pecially headaches, and posttraumatic stress with PNESs Epilepsia, Vol. 46, No.9, 2005 TABLE 3.

This suggests that chronic pain and PTSD may be gen\u00ad eral predictors of PNESs, regardless of patients' gender or age (28). Urinary incontinence, traditionally used as a predictor to support a diagnosis of ESs, was found not to be associated with ESs in our study, because no differ\u00ad ence was found between groups. This is similar to what Peguero etal.(29) found by telephone survey.Asinprevi\u00ad ous studies (16-18,30), we found a similarly elevated rate of occurrence of sleep problems and depression in both groups, We believe that the majority of PNES patients in our study were overtreated, with 77% taking one AED and TABLE 4.

We also found 96% were receiv\u00ad ing compensation, with nearly 42% of the total receiving it specifically for their diagnosis. This compensation rate was similar for both groups, which on first glance may seem surprising, but might imply a similar disability. Un\u00ad necessary treatments are concerning because of potential unwanted side effects from the drugs themselves or from drug-drug interactions, which can cause serious conse\u00ad quences, especially in the elderly (31). These can lead to unnecessary medical costs for visits, blood draws, and treatment of side effects. In a small study of involving 20 patients with diagnostic LTM, an 84% average reduction was found in total seizure-related medical charges within 6 months of making the diagnosis (5). Significantly fewer young female patients with PNESs are treated with AEDs (32,33), perhaps because young women's seizures are per\u00ad ceived as more likely to have a psychological etiology or because of possible risk of the drug should they become pregnant. Additionally, men with PNESs have been shown in the literature to exhibit more tonic--clonic-like events than do women (12), and perhaps this display leads to a higher likelihood of therapy, in that events appear more severe. Our study supports the observations of others that PNES patients are less likely than ES patients to have abnor\u00ad mal neuroimaging or neurologic examinationss, despite the confirmation of a previously reported high incidence of head trauma in PNES (range, 32-70%) (14,34). Addi\u00ad tionally, in individuals with PNESs, head injury has been found to be associated with poor long-term outcome, in\u00ad cluding long-lasting disability (14), despite being rela\u00ad tively mild. Substance abuse was common in both groups. Previous studies have shown this to be more common in men with PNESs (18); however, substance abuse, in particular with alcohol, is elevated in the population of male veterans in general (35). Studies also have suggested that men may use PNESs to avoid responsibilities (16). It is possible that service-connected compensation for illness may increase the likelihood for treatment in patients attending VA clin\u00ad ics. However, in our study, the proportion of patients with possible secondary gain is not different between groups. Compensation may have other effects, such as perpetuat\u00ad ing the misdiagnosis of ongoing seizures. However, it is important to note that reimbursement does not imply con\u00ad scious malingering, and it is likely that PNESs represent a form of conversion disorder in our population, as in most women (36). It is notable that a relatively high percentage of VA PNES patients are categorized as disabled, based on the diagnosis of seizure disorder; as has been reported, an individual can be similarly or even more disabled by PNESs than by ESs (6-8,37). Higher ratings of disability, lower self-reported quality-of-life scores, greater impact on families, and overall misdiagnosis and mistreatment have been reported in patients with PNESs (6,8,38,39). Our study demonstrates that male veterans with PNESs have risk factors similar to those reported in the literature, even though younger females have been the predominant group studied to date. Although this study uses limited neuropsychiatric assessments, it nevertheless introduces data that suggest important distinguishing characteristics for men with PNESs. Thus we believe that screening male patients with frequent uncontrolled seizures should in\u00ad clude questions designed to detect various stressors, in\u00ad cluding a history of PTSD and chronic pain. Further stud\u00ad ies are needed to confirm that our results are generalizable to the population of civilian men and to investigate the in\u00ad fluence of gender and age on the expression, treatment, and outcome ofPNESs.

Fang, MD, MPH; Daniel E. Singer, MD; Yuchiao Chang, PhD; Elaine M. Henault, MPH; Nancy G. Jensvold, MPH; Alan S. Go, MD Background-Previous studies provide conflicting results about whether women are at higher risk than men for thromboembolism in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined data from a large contemporary cohort of AF patients to address this question. Methods and Results-We prospectively studied 13559 adults with AF and recorded data on patients' clinical characteristics and the occurrence of incident hospitalizations for ischemic stroke, peripheral embolism, and major hemorrhagic events through searching validated computerized databases and medical record review. We compared event rates by patient sex using multivariable log-linear regression, adjusting for clinical risk factors for stroke, and stratifying by warfarin use. We identified 394 ischemic stroke and peripheral embolic events during 15494 person-years of follow-up off warfarin. After multivariable analysis, women had higher annual rates of thromboembolism off warfarin than did men (3.5% versus 1.8%; adjusted rate ratio [RR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9). There was no significant difference by sex in 3D-day mortality after thromboembolism (23% for both). Warfarin use was associated with significantly lower adjusted thromboembolism rates for both women and men (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.5; and RR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8, respectively), with similar annual rates of major hemorrhage (1.0% and 1.1 %, respectively). Conclusions-Women are at higher risk than men for AF-related thromboembolism off warfarin. Warfarin therapy appears be as effective in women, if not more so, than in men, with similar rates of major hemorrhage. Female sex is an independent risk factor for thromboembolism and should influence the decision to use anticoagulant therapy in persons with AF. (Circulation. 2005;112:1687-1691.) Key Words: _ factors _ stroke _ women Atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically signifi\u00ad cant cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and peripheral embolism.' Warfarin therapy substantially reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation-related thromboembolism but also increases the risk for hemor\u00ad Optimal administration of warfarin requires appropri\u00ad ate risk stratification. Several prominent schemes are available to facilitate iden\u00ad tification of patients at high-enough risk of thromboembolism to merit anticoagulant therapy.s-' These schemes, however, provide conflicting recommendations as to whether women with atrial fibrillation are at higher risk for stroke indepen\u00ad dently of other known risk factors. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF)' and Framingham risk scores> consider women to be at higher risk for ischemic stroke, whereas other studies do not (eg, Atrial Fibrillation Investi\u00ad gators [AFI]2 and CHADS24 risk indexes). Notably, the SPAF investigators found only the subset of women >75 years to be at higher risk for stroke. Variations in the risk assessment for stroke can lead to significant differences in the use of warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation.s To test the hypothesis of whether women are at higher risk for atrial fibrillation-related thromboembolism, we analyzed data from the large AnTicoagulation and Risk factors In Atrial fibrillation (ATRIA) study cohort, comparing rates of ischemic stroke and peripheral embolism between male and female patients not taking anticoagulants while controlling for other known risk factors for thromboembolism.

Patients with diag\u00ad stenosis, valvular repair or replacement, transient postoperative atrial fibrillation, or concurrent hyperthyroidism were excluded. The cohort was followed up through August 31, 1999, providing a median follow-up of 2.4 years. Follow-up was censored at the time of an outcome event, death, or disenrollment from the health plan. Thromboembolic and Hemorrhagic Events We searched hospitalization and billing claims databases for primary discharge diagnoses of thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke and peripheral embolism) using validated algorithms.\" All potential events were individually validated through medical records review by 2 members of a 3-physician outcomes committee, with discor\u00ad dances resolved by consensus of the 3-member committee, including outside consultant review in selected circumstances. A validated ischemic stroke was defined as the sudden onset of a neurological deficit persisting >24 hours and not explained by other origins. A validated peripheral embolism required confirmation by radiograph\u00ad ic imaging, intraoperative examination, or pathological findings and the absence of underlying atherosclerotic disease in the affected artery. We excluded patients who developed events during inpatient hospitalization or from peri procedural complications. Mortality at 30 days after outcome events was based on review of medical records, health plan databases, and California State death files.? Using previously described and validated methods,\" we identified hemorrhagic events by searching for primary and secondary diag\u00ad noses of intracranial hemorrhage and primary diagnoses of extracra\u00ad nial hemorrhage. We excluded intracranial hemorrhages from major trauma. We defined major hemorrhage as fatal, requiring transfusion of ;:,,2U packed blood cells, or hemorrhage into a critical anatomic site. Clinical Characteristics Data on patient age and sex were obtained from administrative databases. Medical diagnoses related to stroke and hemorrhage risk were obtained by searching hospital discharge and ambulatory visit databases for specific ICD-9-coded diagnoses using previously described and validated methods.\" Warfarin exposure was deter\u00ad mined using a combination of pharmacy, laboratory, and ambulatory visit databases.s Anticoagulation intensity was measured using outpatient assessments of the international normalized ratio (INR) obtained from health plan laboratory databases. For patients receiv\u00ad ing warfarin, we calculated the proportion of person-time at different INR intervals using an adapted linear interpolation rnethod.!? If a person was on warfarin by pharmacy records but the interval between INR measurements was >8 weeks, we did not interpolate INR values for this extended period and categorized these INR periods as \"not available\"; 18% of total person-time fell into this category. Finally, we assessed for longitudinal exposure to oral estrogens (either alone or in combination therapy with progesterone) on the basis of filled prescriptions found in health plan pharmacy databases and a previously validated algorithm. I I Statistical Analyses We compared clinical characteristics of men and women during periods off warfarin using K-tests and compared thromboembolism rates using log-linear models with generalized estimating equations. Multivariable log-linear regression was then used to adjust for previously identified stroke risk factors: age (as a continuous variable by decades), prior ischemic stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and estrogen replacement therapy.P-P with time-dependent covariates as appro\u00ad priate. We also tested whether an interaction existed between patient sex and age in the rate of thromboembolism off warfarin, first testing whether an interaction existed when age was dichotomized at 75 TABLE 1.

To assess whether the effectiveness of warfarin varied by sex, we tested the interaction term of warfarin and patient sex in models of thromboembolism that included patients both on and off warfarin therapy. We also compared rates of major hemorrhage by sex, adjusting for risk factors for extracranial and intracranial hemorrhage (age, prior gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, or other prior hemorrhage, cirrhosis, dementia, mechanical fall during a prior hospitalization, prior stroke, hypertension, and anticoagulation intensity)!\" and tested the interaction term for warfarin and patient sex in models predicting hemorrhagic events. Results The cohort included 5795 women and 7764 men. Women were generally older and more likely to have a history of stroke or hypertension but were less likely to have diagnosed coronary disease or diabetes mellitus than men (Table 1). Most men and women had CHADSz risk scores between 0 and 2; only a small proportion of the cohort was categorized in the highest-risk group (Table 1). Among women not taking warfarin, the proportion of person-time on oral estrogen therapy was 21.4% compared with 22.5% among women taking warfarin. Fang et al TABLE 2.

Risk of Thromboembolism Off Warfarin Therapy During periods off warfarin therapy, we identified 394 valid thromboembolic events (369 ischemic strokes) over 15494 person-years of annual inci\u00ad dence rates of thromboembolism off warfarin than did men (3.5% versus 1.8%), with an unadjusted rate ratio (RR) of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.4). These higher rates of thromboembolism among women were observed across various stroke risk factors and categories of the CHADS 2 Index\" (Table 2). In a multivariable model controlling for stroke risk factors (age, prior stroke, diagnosed hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and estrogen re\u00ad placement therapy), women had a greater independent risk of thromboembolism than men, with an adjusted RR of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9). Results were similar when analyses were restricted to only ischemic strokes (adjusted RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8). Of note, exposure to oral estrogen replacement therapy in multivariable analyses was not associated with a significantly increased risk of thromboembolism in women (adjusted RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.4). Thirty-day mortality after ischemic stroke did not differ significantly by patient sex (23.4% for men and 23.7% for women; P=0.94). Women were at higher risk for incident thromboembolism than men at both younger and older ages (the Figure). The adjusted RR for women versus men was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3) for those 5,75 years of age and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.3) for those >75 years of age. The difference between these 2 rate ratios was not statistically different (P=0.38 for the interaction of sex and age, dichotomized as >75 versus 5,75 years). The interaction between sex and age was also not statistically significant when age was coded as a continuous variable (P=O.ll).

Effect of Warfarin Therapy in Women Compared With Men The distribution of INR intensities was similar between men and women. In men taking warfarin, 26.8% of the person\u00ad time was spent at INR levels <2.0 and 62.7% between 2.0 and 3.0; in women, the proportions were 27.9% and 61.3% (These proportions were calculated excluding the 18% of total person-time for which INR was not available). Among warfarin users, there were 204 thromboembolic and 167 major hemorrhagic events over \"\"15000 person\u00ad years of follow-up. Rates of thromboembolism on warfarin were lower than rates observed in patients off warfarin: annual unadjusted rates of thromboembolism on warfarin were 1.5% in women and 1.2% in men. After multivariable adjustment for other risk factors for stroke, warfarin therapy continued to be associated with a significant reduction in the rate of thromboembolism, with an adjusted RR of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.3 to 0.5) in women and 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8) in men. In multivariable models including patients both on and off warfarin therapy, the reduction in rates of thromboembolism with warfarin was larger in women than in men (P=O.OI for the interaction of sex and warfarin). Rates of Major Hemorrhage on Warfarin Therapy On warfarin, women had similar rates of all major hemorrhage compared with men (1.0% versus 1.1 %; adjusted RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.1). Women were less likely than men to develop intracranial hemorrhage while on warfarin (0.36% versus 0.55%; adjusted RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 0.9). In multivariable models assessing predictors of intracranial hemorrhage that included patients both on and off warfarin therapy, warfarin therapy was associated with an increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.4), but women were not at greater risk for developing intracranial hemorrhage Age> 75 1690 Circulation September 20, 2005 TABLE 3.

Discussion In this large cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation, women had higher rates of ischemic stroke and peripheral embolism while not taking warfarin than did men, even after adjustment for established clinical risk factors for stroke. Higher rates of thromboembolism among women were observed at both younger and older ages and across all stroke risk factor categories. The 3D-day mortality rate following an ischemic stroke did not differ by sex, indicating that the increased risk of stroke faced by women was not due to the occurrence of less severe strokes\" 5 Warfarin appears to be at least as effective for women in reducing the risk of thromboembolism, if not more so, than in men. This observation in our cohort was also reported in the pooled analyses of 5 randomized trials of warfarin for atrial fibrillation.s Warfarin therapy did not pose a greater risk of major hemorrhagic complications in women. This was particu\u00ad larly true for the most important hemorrhagic complication, namely intracranial hemorrhage. Some studies have shown that women, especially older women, are less likely to receive warfarin for atrial fibrilla\u00ad tion,7\u00b716.17 Our findings indicate that women with atrial fibrilla\u00ad tion face a higher absolute risk for thromboembolism indepen\u00ad dently of other risk factors and should gain more from anticoagulant therapy. Available risk stratification schemes differ on whether female sex is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation-related thromboembo\u00ad lism (Table 3). We found that women had consistently higher rates of thromboembolism across all stroke risk factor strata and after multivariable adjustment. Our cohort analysis offers several advantages over prior studies. We had substantially greater numbers of person-years of follow-up and outcome events, providing a more powerful assessment. Our cohort is also more contemporary and based in a usual clinical practice setting, potentially yielding more generalizability. In comparison, the API and SPAF risk schemes were based on participants in randomized trials completed 10 to 15 years ago.2.3 In contrast to the SPAF analysis, we did not find a significant interaction between patient sex and age >75 years. Another advantage of the large size of the cohort is that it allowed us to assess whether women faced an increased risk of warfarin-associated hemor\u00ad rhage, particularly intracranial hemorrhage. Prior studies did not observe sufficient numbers of intracranial hemorrhages to assess warfarin-sex interactions. This is especially important because the health consequences of intracranial hemorrhage are worse than those resulting from the ischemic strokes we seek to prevent through anticoagulation. 18.19 In our A1RIA cohort, warfarin was not more dangerous in women than in men. The mechanism behind the observed difference in atrial fibrillation-related thromboembolism risk between men and women is unclear. Atrial fibrillation is associated with higher levels of prothrombotic factors, endothelial dysfunction, and markers of platelet activation,20-23 but sex-related differences in these factors have not been well characterized. Interestingly, women with atrial fibrillation may have higher levels of pro\u00ad thrombin von Willebrand factor.> and tissue plasminogen activator antigen,> but studies have not clearly linked these factors to an increased risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation. It also remains to be seen whether differences in left atrial structure and function 26.27 contribute to differential throm\u00ad boembolism risk by sex. Although estrogen replacement therapy has been reported to increase risk of ischemic stroke among postmenopausal women.P it was not a significant risk factor in our study. Our study has severallirnitations. We lacked data on potential differences in left ventricular systolic function and blood pres\u00ad sure control between men and women, factors shown to affect stroke risk.528 Although we controlled for the diagnosis of hypertension, we could not adjust for individual patients' blood pressure levels. It is noteworthy, however, that these factors were also not used in the API and CHADS 2 risk schemes. We did not have comprehensive information on the use of aspirin in our pharmacy database because many patients used nonprescrip\u00ad tion forms of aspirin. We addressed this shortcoming in a previous review of the medical charts of 232 randomly sampled patients in our cohort who were not taking warfarin.\" In these nonusers of warfarin, 38% of women and 56% of men were recorded as taking aspirin. Assuming that aspirin reduces throm\u00ad boembolic event rates by 21%,29 differential use of aspirin between men and women would not materially change our original estimate. Thus, it is unlikely that variation in aspirin use between men and women explains their differing rates of thromboembolism. Finally, we note that stroke rates in our cohort were generally lower than those reported in other earlier studies. The reason for these lower rates is not clear but may reflect a somewhat healthier, insured population of patients, Because we lacked information on individual patients' blood pressure measurements, we were unable to determine whether control of hypertension was better in our cohort than in other populations. In addition, we required that each stroke event be validated by chart review. It is possible that our search strategy Fang et al missed some stroke events because searching for cerebrovascu\u00ad lar diseases using ICD-9 codes may not be highly sensitive.P-'! In conclusion, women have a higher risk than men for atrial fibrillation-related thromboembolism at both younger and older ages that is independent of the presence of other risk factors for stroke. Furthermore, warfarin therapy appears to be at least as effective in women as in men in preventing thromboembolism. Finally, women do not have a higher risk than men for intracranial or other major bleeding events associated with warfarin. On balance, the overall net benefit of warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation appears to be greater in women compared with men. Our findings indicate that female sex is an important factor supporting the use of anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Yet reasons for use or non-use of such systems have not been carefully explored. An understand\u00ad ing of factors that influence people to use, not use, or underutilize these automated behavioral change and self-care management systems can help in designing systems that are more effective and acceptable to users. Using qualitative research methods, this study explored the experiences of 45 users of a multiple-contact health promotion application with the goal of understanding the major factors that affect patterns of use (frequencyof and duration of contact). The in-depth exploration of users' perceptions and views made possible by the qualitative research methods revealed a number of important themes. Reported reasons for underutilization or non-use were found to be both user-related and system-related. User-related reasons encompassed personal and individual events that prevented or impeded systemutilization. System-related reasons included those that related to the med\u00ad ium itself as well as the content of the application. The qualitative methods employed in this study created a forum through which users' feedback could be fully explored and then synthesized to assist in the improvement of this and other automated health behavior interventions. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction The use of information technologies in health care is beginning to change the health care industry in impor\u00ad tant and perhaps irreversible ways. By facilitating pa\u00ad tient education, patient lifestyle change, and self-care as well as patient-provider communications, these tech\u00ad nologies promote patients' involvement in their own care, assist in health care delivery, and improve patient outcome [I]. Evidence suggests, however, that a substan\u00ad tial number of programs that use these new technologies do not reach their potential, because of underutilization Corresponding author. Fax: Inc. All rights reserved. doi: 10.IOI6Ij.jbi.2004.11.01I or non-use by providers, patients, and consumers (de\u00ad fined as users who are healthy) [2-4]. The adoption and diffusion of technological innovations, to a great ex\u00ad tent, depend on a critical factor: utilization [5]. In fact, it is believed that the societal value of an innovation is ulti\u00ad mately determined by the repetition and range of \"use\" that the system receives [5]. Even among people who use a program, there are sig\u00ad nificant variations in patterns of use. These differences are an important issue to consider when evaluating health promotion and disease prevention applications, particularly those that involve discretionary use by pa\u00ad tients and consumers over extended periods of time. Many automated behavioral change and self-care man\u00ad agement interventions are designed to be utilized over 221 R. Farzanfar et al. I Journal 0/ Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 time and consequently, it is assumed that to achieve and maintain the targeted effects user adherence to the inter\u00ad vention schedule is necessary. However, reported re\u00ad search on the variations in use patterns of these systems is scant. Thus, an effort to identify and explore the factors that influence people to use, not use, or underutilize these systems would provide an important perspective for evaluation of these systems from the users' viewpoint. This in turn will help in designing sys\u00ad tems that are more acceptable to users, and perhaps more effective. Using qualitative research methods, we explored the experiences of users of a multiple-contact health pro\u00ad motion application with a focus on understanding fac\u00ad tors that affected patterns of use (frequency and duration of contact). We recruited 82 healthy adults to use a physical activity promotion computer tele\u00ad phony program. Subsequently, 45 individuals were se\u00ad lected for in-depth interviews based on their use patterns. The results of the in-depth interviews pro\u00ad vided insights into the factors that contribute to use, non-use, and underutilization with significant implica\u00ad tions for design of the physical activity telephony sys\u00ad tem, in particular, and health technology systems used by patients, in general. 2. Methods 2.1. Telephone-linked care technology Telephone-linked care (TLC) is a computer telephony technology with applications for behavioral change and chronic disease management. Most TLC applications are designed to be used repeatedly over time. Through totally automated telephone conversations, TLC uses digitized human speech to talk with patients; and either through touch tone or speech recognition technologies understands what the patient communicates. TLC asks questions, gives feedback based on the user's response and embedded logic, and provides education and coun\u00ad seling for a targeted health behavior. Either TLC or the user can initiate a conversation. In the TLC behavioral change programs, patients are asked to contact TLC, depending on the application, anywhere from daily to monthly for a period that varies from I to 12 months. TLC stores the user's feedback in a database, based on which current and future TLC conversations are carried out. These responses also provide the information for reports that are sent to users and/or to their providers. TLC behavior change applications have been applied to changing dietary behavior [6], promoting physical activity [7], helping cigarette smokers quit [8], and pro\u00ad moting medication adherence in patients with hyperten\u00ad sion [9] and depression [10,11] as well as promoting regular screening mammography. TLC chronic disease applications have been developed for chronic obstruc\u00ad tive pulmonary disease (COPD) [12], coronary heart and diabetes mellitus [13]. Two other TLC applications have been developed which help clinicians better manage cancer patients who are receiving chemo\u00ad therapy [14,15]. Although pattern of use has varied across these applications, most TLC systems that have been fully evaluated have generally been effective and well-accepted. 2.2. Telephone-linked care for physical activity This study evaluated an interactive health promotion technology application, TLC-physical activity (TLC\u00ad PA), which promotes moderate-intensity physical activity like brisk walking, to a healthy general adult population. The program's goal was the recommenda\u00ad tion set by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) that all adults should engage in at least 30 min of moderate\u00ad intensity physical activity on most days of the week. To promote the regular attainment of physical activity, TLC-PA employed behavior change strategies derived from the transtheoretical model (TIM) of behavior change [16,17]. Stage of change (motivational readiness) is the central organizing construct of the TIM. The fol\u00ad lowing five stages of change are integrated into the de\u00ad sign of TLC-PA: (1) Precontemplation (not thinking of meeting the physical activity goals in the next 6 months); (2) contemplation (thinking about becoming physically active within 6 months); (3) preparation (intention to achieving activity recommendations in the next 30 days); (4) action (being sufficiently physically active for less than 6 months); and (5) maintenance (being physically active at or above recommendations for more than 6 months). During each TLC-PA conversation, the system assesses the user's current stage. The system then selects behavior change strategies for use during the conversa\u00ad tion that are based on the user's stage. The theoretically based tailoring was expected to increase the relevance of the messages to each individual participant and thus contribute to the effectiveness of the system. It is gener\u00ad ally believed that tailoring is an effective strategy when health messages are directed at a diverse population [18]. The duration of the study was 3 months and the study participants were asked to call the system two times per week. All participants met with the study staff prior to using the system. Based on the information users provided during this meeting, they were assigned to an appropriate stage of physical activity readiness. Users initiated all calls to TLC-PA. At the beginning of each telephone conversation, the system begins with a salutation and information about the TTM stages and what it means to be in one stage versus another. The system describes the \"meaning of exercise\" (i.e., the definition of moderate or greater 222 R Farzanfar et al. I Journal of Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 intensity physical activity) at the beginning of each con\u00ad tact by saying: \"just to make sure that we are talking about the same thing, when I talk about exercise I mean structured physical activity that makes you breath hard or break a sweat. This does not include things like housework, golfing using a cart, or walking around the office. This does include brisk walking, bicycling, or playing sports.\" The system then asks about the user's current level of physical activity, defined as the number of days and minutes/day during the previous week the user engaged in \"exercise\" and then stage of change. The user's stage of readiness determined the content of the TLC-PA conversations. For example, those who were in the precontemplation stage were given informa\u00ad tion about the benefits of physical activity. This included such topics as \"impact of physical activity on blood pressure,\" \"prevention of breast cancer,\" \"prevention of diabetes,\" \"lowering stress,\" and more. Similarly, those in the contemplation and preparation stages were provided with information on the benefits of physical activity as wel1 as suggestions for overcoming barriers to physical activity and were encouraged to set weekly exercise goals. Users in the action stage were given an option to hear the information on the barriers if there had been a decline in activity level, and were encouraged to increase their level. 3. Study design We conducted in-depth interviews to evaluate rea\u00ad sons for the participants' use patterns of TLC-PA. The interviews explored: (I) how people felt about the system in general, and (2) why some people did not use or underutilized the system. The context of users' experiences, i.e., their lifestyle and cultural norms, were also queried. 3.1. Study participants Eighty-four volunteers were recruited and found eli\u00ad gible by screening of whom 80 completed the study (two withdrew). Individuals were excluded if they had a serious medical condition or who were in the mainte\u00ad nance stage for physical activity. The study population included 48 women (58%), 29 blacks (35%), 7 Asians (8%), 3 Hispanics (3%), and 6 \"Other\" (7%). Over one-fourth (23%) of the participants were married while 37% were employed and nearly 63% had education be\u00ad yond high school. The participants' age ranged from 21 to 74 with the mean age of 45. 3.2. Qualitative evaluation methods After 4 weeks of using the system, the utilization pat\u00ad tern of each participant was classified into one of five categories. Four of these utilization patterns closely resembled those identified in other TLC studies. A new fifth category was defined based on the utilization pattern observed in this study of the TLC-PA system for a subset of participants who ended each conversa\u00ad tion with the system by hanging up before the call was complete. The final five utilization categories, along with their size and the number interviewed, are as follows: (I) ~ 80% adherence to the call schedule (N = 8, 7 inter\u00ad viewed), (2) Intermittent but continuous use (N = 18, 11 interviewed), (3) Discontinued use (consecutive use of the system for two or more times after which the call\u00ad ing ceased completely) (N = 36, 16 interviewed), (4) Non-use or one-time-use (N = 14, 7 interviewed), and (5) Incomplete calls (one or more) (N = 6, 4 interviewed). The participants were interviewed over time, with data collection (interviews) and analytic work (coding and interpretation of interviews, described below) occur\u00ad ring simultaneously in accordance with standard quali\u00ad tative research methodology [19]. In qualitative research study samples are usually small and the selec\u00ad tion method is purposive rather than random. Further\u00ad more, the sample size is not predetermined, with recruitment for a particular cohort (in our study, each utilization group) ending when there are no longer any substantial new findings from the interviews. After this point there is little \"incremental learning\" as the researchers observe \"phenomena seen tion\" or \"redundancy\" [19]. All members of the smaller utilization groups (groups 1,4, and 5) were invited for in-depth interviews. As dem\u00ad onstrated above, the proportion who accepted the invi\u00ad tation varied considerably with 88% of the high adherence group (group 1) agreeing to be interviewed, whereas only 50% of group 4 agreed to be interviewed. Given the nature of these groups, this variation is to be expected. In each of these groups, however, satura\u00ad tion was fully achieved. In the larger groups (groups 2 and 3) saturation was judged to have occurred after 11 and 16 interviews, respectively. In-depth interviews were conducted by the first and second authors together. Interviews took place at the date and time most convenient for the participants. The interviews followed a \"general interview guide ap\u00ad proach\" in which a set of predefined issues were ex\u00ad plored with the study participants. These issues were written in an interview guide that served as a question check list for the interview, to ensure that all relevant topics were covered. The interviews lasted between 20 and 45 min. The issues that were discussed during the in-depth interviews dealt with the following: (I) specific features and components of the system, such as the TLC-PA's voice, its tone, duration of the conversation, etc.; (2) participants' overall impressions such as their 223 R. Farzanfar et al. I Journal of Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 likes/dislikes, satisfaction with the program, opinions about the program's helpfulness, their initial expecta\u00ad tions, degree to which their expectations were met, pos\u00ad sible behavior change effects, etc.; (3) reasons for participants' patterns of use including questions about why they used the system in a certain way. As we were interested in both negative and positive opinions about the TLC-PA program, addressed reasons for utilization and non-utilization with all participants, including those who were highly adherent to the planned twice a week calling schedule. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, coded, and stored both in a database and in hard copy. A systematic coding of transcripts by two independent coders identified 27 constructs or themes of interest. A secondary analysis of the coded transcripts condensed the constructs to 10. We also conducted a content anal\u00ad ysis of the transcripts in which these constructs or themes were counted for frequency of occurrence (see Table 1). Constructs were defined as those that either shed light on the users' opinions and views about the system or helped reveal the reasons or provide explanations for certain behaviors, including the participants' TLC-PA use patterns and their physical activity behavior. 4. Results 4.1. ~80\"/o Adherence group Individuals in this category (N = 8, 7 interviewed) ad\u00ad hered to the call schedule ~ 80% of the time. Among the four individuals (57%) who reported behavior change, i.e., an increase in physical activity levels, only 2 (29%) reported benefits (i.e., description of outcome benefits such as a decrease in blood pressure, decrease in choles\u00ad terol, weight loss, general well-being, etc.). This group also had the highest ratio (86%) of individuals (6) who complained about too much repetition in the content of TLC-PA. Of the seven individuals interviewed four had positive views about the system (57%) while the Table I Interviewed participants: summary utilization and user response (N = 82) other four felt neither positive nor negative. Two of the individuals in this group said that the program did not enhance their physical activity levels. These individ\u00ad uals, however, used the program to keep physically ac\u00ad tive and one said that using the system kept him aware of the amount of time that he was devoting to exercise. Of the seven individuals, two said that they used the sys\u00ad tem regularly because they had committed themselves to the study. Except one person, these regular users were critical of different aspects of the system. One said that he used the system because he was curious and wanted to learn new information about physical activity and health, how\u00ad ever, he was disappointed about the amount of repeti\u00ad tion and the lack of new information. Others also complained about the repetition, the length of the con\u00ad versations, and problems with being understood. A wo\u00ad man who maintained she benefited moderately from using the system said she was worried that we were going to ask her to use the program forever. 4.2. Intermittent user group The intermittent users (N = 18, 11 interviewed) were those who used TLC-P A throughout the 2-month test period, but who called less then 80% of the time. Their average utilization was 52% (range 31-77%). The rea\u00ad sons provided by these individuals for not fully utilizing the system were identical to those expressed by users in other groups: life crises, being away, being too busy (including working too hard, being too tired), and health problems. Forgetting to use the system as a result of the reasons referred to above was mentioned frequently. Surprisingly, these participants, as a group, were nei\u00ad ther dissatisfied with TLC-PA nor perceived it to be without benefit to them. In fact, individuals in this group had the highest ratio (91%) of satisfied users (10 individuals) and better reported outcomes both in terms of physical activity levels (9 individuals-82%) (Table 1) and perceived benefits (8 individuals-73\u00b0/o). Even ;;'80% N=8 Intermittent N = 18 Block users N = 36 Non-use/one time use N = 14 Partial use N = 6 (7 Interviewed) (II Interviewed) (16 Interviewed) (7 Interviewed) (4 Interviewed) Positive Opinion 4 (57%) 10 (91%) 3 (19%) I (14%) o Behavior Change 4 (57%) 9 (82%) 4 (25%) 2 (29%) 2 (50%) Reported Benefit 2 (29%) 8 (73%) o 2 (29%) 2 (50%) Failure and Avoidance o 2 (18%) 6 (38%) o o Helpful Information 5 (71%) 9 (82%) 5 (31%) o o System as a Monitor 3 (43%) 7 (64%) o o o System as a Motivator 2 (29%) 4 (36%) 3 (19%) o o Too Much Repetition 6 (86%) 6 (55%) 10 (63%) o o Too Long 2 (29%) o 10 (63%) o o Voice Recognition Problems I (14%) 4 (36%) 6 (38%) o o 224 R Farzanfar et al. I Journal of Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 though utilization was irregular, some individuals in the intermittent group continued to use the system after we had conducted our in-depth interviews with them and their participation in the study was effectivelyover. Only one person expressed a negative opinion about TLC-PA in this group. An important aspect of the physical activity behavior of the individuals in this group was the fact that their call pattern mirrored their exercise pattern. These indi\u00ad viduals went for walks, to the gym, or performed other activities and subsequently reported the results to TLC\u00ad PA. As one of the participants described it: \"I usually do it [calling the system] after I exercise, you know, take my walk... After I do it, it is kind of like gratification that I can call in and tell somebody that I did it.\" It is compel\u00ad ling that in some cases when a person had a \"good week\" in terms of physical activity behavior, then that person would make more calls to TLC-PA. One partic\u00ad ipant who exercised a lot during a particular week called the system six times for that week! When asked why he called so many times, he said because he \"was doing so good.\" Similarly, another individual who made addi\u00ad tional calls during a particular week said that the reason was because during that period he exercised more. One important theme generated from the in-depth interviews of intermittent users revolved around the con\u00ad cept of control. They described their use patterns as being determined by themselves, not the designers of TLC-PA. For at least half of the intermittent users tak\u00ad ing control of system utilization also reflected taking control of their exercise regimen. A man in this group in fact used the study's Users' Guide as a symbol to exer\u00ad cise such control. During the day when he planned to exercise and subsequently call the system, he would place his Users' Guide on his desk and at other times the Guide would \"get stuck underneath somewhere.\" Control of both the exercise regimen and call schedule was thus instrumental in impeding or facilitating system utilization as in several cases the two went hand in hand. Another theme that emerged was the central theme of being \"monitored\" as a motivator of behavior. The indi\u00ad viduals in the intermittent group felt that the system was watching them and this perception motivated them to engage in physical activity. One woman described it this way: \"You are more aware and more responsible. I think we need to be accountable. It's like answering to a higher ... [authority]\" And, a man who started going to the YMCA upon his participation said: \"It kept me in check.\" In fact, seven of the individuals (64%) inter\u00ad viewed in this group considered the TLC-PA as an effec\u00ad tive monitor. Monitoring in turn seems to have generated a certain degree of anxiety in a few individuals who said they exercised because they wanted to report that they had done well. For example, a woman who accomplished most of her exercise goals commented: \"The next time I called, I wanted to be able to say I did this.\" This woman subsequently elaborated that the system changed her [physical activity] behavior \"a little bit\" because she wanted to report that she had accomplished her tasks. Another woman also com\u00ad mented, \"I want to report accurately for myself as well. Umm, I felt re-encouraged that I didn't get penalized.\" [Emphasis added.] It is of great interest to us that the system's response might have seemed \"penalizing\" to this woman as the designers had done their utmost to ensure that the sys\u00ad tem's responses to the unaccomplished goals were polite, pleasant, and supportive with a positive tone. For exam\u00ad ple, \"It is great that you are doing some exercise, but you did less than your goal. To receive the maximum benefits from an exercise program you need to gradually work yourself up to exercising at least 4 days per week for at least 30 minutes per day. Don't feel too badly. I will set another goal with you later in the call. Use the rest of this call to increase your commitment to regular exercise.\" The anxiety that these study participants felt about accomplishing their physical activity goals was in fact constructive as it reinforced their resolve and thus helped them achieve their goals. A young woman tried to describe her feelings this way: \"I feel obligated. It's like something- I don't know what it is. Before, I didn't go to gym because I did too much and didn't have time, but now I make the time... I don't know how they [TLC-PA] make me like that, you know.\" Finally, despite the overall positive opinions, six indi\u00ad viduals (55%) in this group complained about too much repetition, while four (36%) had problems being under\u00ad stood by TLC-PA. 4.3. Non-users or one-time-users group Of the 82 participants, 14 did not use the system at all or used it only once. We have put non-users and one\u00ad time users into a single utilization group because their reactions to the system were remarkably similar. Of note, it was difficult to arrange interviews for subjects in this group. We were eventually able to interview seven individuals among the 14, but two had disconnected their telephones and five did not return repeated calls. Of the seven individuals we interviewed, four claimed that they had actually used our system a few times although the system's log files did not show any contacts (three of them called TLC-PA for the first time on the day they were to meet with us for the in-depth inter\u00ad view). Two of the seven interviewees had called TLC\u00ad PA once; and two explained that they had lost the Users' Guide and thus did not have the information necessary (for example, the telephone number or the password) to use the system. The results of the in-depth interviews with individuals in this group demonstrated that the reasons for non-use and one-time use mostly overlapped. They identified 225 R Farzanfar et al. I Journal of Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 personal events or situations in the users' lives such as the death of a loved one, getting robbed, financial dis\u00ad tress (e.g., unemployment), illness (personal or family), being away (on a vacation or a business trip), working too hard, being too busy, and forgetting as the reasons for not calling TLC-PA. During our interviews, the majority of the individuals in this group presented their lives as too hectic, too disorganized, or too eventful for them to use a health promotion and disease prevention program. Most of those affected by \"life events\" were women, some of whom were parents (one a single par\u00ad ent) and all were experiencing financial problems. One woman said that she did not have water and heat in her apartment and that a close friend of hers was in the hospital dying of cancer. Another woman told us that she could not spend time to use the system because it took too long and she had to \"deal with too much lately.\" Devastating life events, however, were not the sole reasons for non-utilization. Among non-users were two participants who were not experiencing life crises. For these individuals using the system was not a prior\u00ad ity. One woman commented: \"this was not as important as other things in my life\" and kept repeating \"I forgot.\" Surprisingly, even though this individual had never used the system, she claimed that the idea of being in the study was a sufficient incentive to bring about behavior change. She said that she was now walking between 5 to 7 miles/day and had lost more than 70 lb. There was no way for us to verify the accuracy of this information. She said that she had pictures that could prove her claim. We gave this young woman a chance to use the system by explicitly asking her to use it and thus evalu\u00ad ate it for us. She enthusiastically accepted but she made no calls. We heard similar comments from another indi\u00ad vidual who had made only one call. Most individuals in this group had difficulty articulating the reasons why they could not reserve 15 minutes a few times a week to a health promotion program considering their per\u00ad ceived and reported need. One person chalked it up to \"laziness.\" 4.4. Discontinued use group A fourth group of TLC-PA users called the system for a period of time (calling from 2 to 14 times) but then stopped and never called back. This group had the high\u00ad est number of participants (36). We interviewed 16 indi\u00ad viduals from this group (nine women). Two important themes emerged from the in-depth interviews with these participants: (I) most of the rea\u00ad sons for discontinuing TLC-PA were system-related, and (2) these individuals had negative opinions of the system as IO (63%) complained of too much repetition, and 10 (63%) felt that the calls were too long, while six (38%) had problems being understood. 4.4.1. Failure and avoidance Some of the interviews with participants in the dis\u00ad continued group suggested an intriguing combination of complex emotional and psychological reactions to the system's content. We learned that six participants (38%), five of whom women, stopped using the system because they were reluctant to report that they had not exercised. These individuals stopped using the sys\u00ad tem once they had failed to accomplish the physical activity goals they had negotiated with TLC-PA during the previous conversation. If they had not exercised, they were reluctant to use the system to report that they had not accomplished their physical activity goal. This reluctance involved wanting to avoid reporting an unac\u00ad complished goal to the system, and concern about the system' response to such as admission. We were told by these individuals that having negoti\u00ad ated goals for physical activity and then having to report to the system that the goals were not met, felt like an admission of failure to an authority figure. One young woman, who attributed the problem to the tone of the TLC-PA's voice, said that it reminded her of her mother's admonishments. Another woman said that reporting unaccomplished physical activity goals to the system was like having to show a \"bad report card\" to her father. The following example is a remarkable testi\u00ad mony that speaks to this experience. \"Cause, in the way you are talking to the system, it expects you to do better each day, you know. So, every day the system wants you to do a little bit better. It was an encouragement. But, when you didn't meet that goal, you are not happy with it. I wasn't too happy because I'd like to meet that goal. .. And, then I didn't-, I stopped. I don't know how to describe it. It's a feeling kind of like you failed; you failed a goal. Psychologically but then it's a study; you are just talking to the computer. .. \" There was one man in this group who said he felt un\u00ad easy about unaccomplished goals to TLC-PA. This indi\u00ad vidual called the system IO times before stopping. It seems that for this individual the unease and anxiety ini\u00ad tially worked in a positive manner, helping to increase his physical activity levels. However, in the long run, he could not keep up with the goals that he had negoti\u00ad ated with the system, and thus he stopped using the sys\u00ad tem altogether: \"I tried to look at it objectively from the very beginning. I tried to walk more you know. Is it encouraging me or is it not? Is this lady on the recording going to embarrass me if I don't? ((laugh)). It's, uh, the recording - the lady on the recording said, 'do you in\u00ad tend to exercise four times a week?' And I said, 'yes.' So, now I had to live up to it. That's what encouraged me to do the exercise. Each time I came back it was like a building pattern. Do you remember what we did last time?' How can a recording be so smart? With the recording, there is no way of reversing what you prom\u00ad ised the week before. And that is the part that kind of 226 R Farzanfar et al. I Journal of Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 frustrated me. The lady said, 'I am sorry to hear that.' (Ilaughj) [He is referring to the system's response when he reported unmet goals.] We have no self-evident explanation as to why there were more women among those who expressed anxiety about reporting unaccomplished tasks. Possible expla\u00ad nations may include gender differences in relation to exercise achievement and to negative judgment by others and/or the women felt more at ease with the two female interviewers than the men did. It is thus possible that the women more openly expressed their feelings, while the male participants were more reserved and reluctant to express a perceived weakness to the two female interviewers. 4.4.2. TLC-PA as a tailored intervention: \"this is not for Me!\" Even though TLC-P A, based on the TIM, provided behavioral feedback tailored to stage of change for physical activity, an interesting and significant point brought up by several individuals across utilization cat\u00ad egories, particularly those in the discontinued group was that TLC-PA was not responsive to their particular needs and personal lifestyles. Probing this issue further revealed that these participants believed the system was not tailored to their personal lifestyle and did not sufficiently address their perceived needs. The TTM cog\u00ad nitive and behavioral processes, as applied to physical activity, addressed such topics as confidence enhance\u00ad ment strategies, information on physical activity bene\u00ad fits, and ways to overcome barriers to physical activity. Some participants pointed out that receiving information about the benefits of physical activity, or overcoming barriers to physical activity, though accept\u00ad able and perhaps useful, was not exactly what they had in mind when they joined the study. Several of the par\u00ad ticipants contrasted TLC-PA with a personal trainer and used this analogy to describe their perceived needs. They maintained that TLC-PA's strategies did not help them engage in physical activity and that only a more personalized and tailored program, structured and planned specifically based on their personal exercise needs and requirement, would be helpful to them. It seems that the duration and length of the conversa\u00ad tion was particularly irritating to those who used cell phones (as the conversation used up their valuable min\u00ad utes) and also those who called from their work, as the calls took 10-15 or sometimes 20 minutes during which they had to keep saying \"yes,\" \"no,\" etc. 4.5. Incomplete use group These were users (N = 6) who made from I to 3 incomplete calls to TLC-PA (calls in which they hung up in the middle of the call); we interviewed four of them. By and large, these individuals disliked the sys\u00adtern. Only one woman, who had used the system incom\u00ad pletely on the day of her interview, expressed some enthusiasm. The other three participants had negative views referring to system-related issues such as repeti\u00ad tion of content and difficulty being understood and that the program did not address their particular concerns with regard to physical activity. One person who had made three incomplete calls said that she used the sys\u00ad tem out of sheer guilt but that she \"could not stand it.\" 5. Discussion Our study demonstrated that both user-related and system-related reasons accounted for non-use or under\u00ad utilization. Among the themes that emerged from the in\u00ad depth interviews, one with the most important design implications was the concept of \"failure and avoid\u00ad ance.\" \"Failure and avoidance\" was a negative response that was articulated by users, particularly in the discon\u00ad tinued group, towards the \"monitoring\" and \"goal-set\u00ad ting\" functions of TLC-PA. As was described, the anxiety associated with reporting unaccomplished goals did not always impede physical activity as our interviews with the individuals in the intermittent group demon\u00ad strated. In fact, in the intermittent use group, such anx\u00ad iety was constructive and helped induce behavior change by motivating participants to increase their physical activity. However, it is the negative responses to \"mon\u00ad itoring\" and \"goal-setting\" that reveal the most about underutilization. One possible explanation for this phenomenon may reside in the social psychological theory of social facili\u00ad tation. Social facilitation occurs when an individual either enhances or diminishes a particular behavior in the presence of another [20]. Many experiments with both humans and animals demonstrate the conse\u00ad quences of such a presence [21]. Zajonc classifies re\u00ad search in social facilitation under two different paradigms: audience effects and co-action effects. Audi\u00ad ence effects refer to the impact of the mere presence of others on behavior while co-action effects refer to the simultaneous involvement in action by all parties in full view of each other [22]. Experiments carried out by Za\u00ad jonc demonstrated that in the audience effects paradigm, the response to the presence of others varied based on the difficulty or simplicity of the task. As a result, in the presence of a spectator if the tasks are easy, the re\u00ad sponse is enhanced. However, the response is diminished if the tasks are difficult. Similarly, through an experi\u00ad ment in which people completed a task alone, in front of two observers, or in the presence of two persons who were blindfolded, Cottrell demonstrated that the presence of others created heightened arousal. Tasks performed in front of the observers were negatively af\u00ad fected [diminished]; being alone or in the presence of 227 R. Farzanfar et al. I Journal of Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 blindfolded individuals had no impact on performance [23]. Studies carried out with animated characters and other computer interfaces demonstrate that social facil\u00ad itation does occur in the presence of automated systems [24,25]. Studies conducted on automated monitoring of work performance also confirm the impact of social facilitation [26]. For example, Rickenberg and Reeves [24] carried out an experiment in which they tested the impact of animated characters on user anxiety and task performance in a Web environment. The authors con\u00ad cluded that when a \"social actor communicates an inten\u00ad tion to monitor someone's work\" there is an enhanced arousal and a diminished performance. In fact, \"When the monitoring is obvious, thoughts and behavior change; there is more anxiety and less accurate perfor\u00ad mance of complex tasks.\" The finding that automated monitoring evokes anxiety in certain tasks and influ\u00ad ences behavior has also been corroborated by other studies [27,28]. Our findings are consistent with these human and computer demonstrations of social facilita\u00ad tion. We observed both positive and negative responses to social facilitation in our study as different individuals responded differently to social facilitation. Positive re\u00ad sponses were observed among individuals who accom\u00ad plished their tasks while negative responses were expressed by those who found the tasks daunting and unachievable. Thus, it seems that social facilitation worked to both enhance and diminish performance as has been demonstrated in the cited studies. This explains both why some individuals in the intermittent group commented that they used the system as a \"monitoring\" agent and how system utilization and physical activity became interconnected among these individuals. For participants such as the man who called the system six times during the week that he had exercised more (see Section 4.2), being monitored by the system helped sus\u00ad tain his physical activity levels. Indeed, we followed up with this man 2 months after the study was completed and learned that he had stopped exercising once he stopped using the system. Rickenberg and Reeves have also distinguished be\u00ad tween the responses of the people who possess strong internal locus of control and those who have a strong external locus of control. Based on conclusions reached by Rickenberg and Reeves, \"being monitored is less worrisome for people who believe that they control their own destiny than for those who think that their destiny is in the hands of others\" [23]. We would have liked to explore this concept in our interviews. However, the theme did not emerge until late when most participants had completed the study. We can only speculate that the individuals who responded well to the \"monitoring\" functions of TLC-PA by increasing their physical activ\u00ad ity levels had a strong \"internal locus of control,\" and, conversely, those who stopped using the system because they felt uncomfortable to report unaceomplished goals, had a strong \"external locus of control.\" This is a topic that we intend to explore in future evaluations. 6. Conclusions The results of this study suggest two important design implications for developers of health information tech\u00ad nology programs that use behavioral change strategies to interact with patients and consumers: Monitoring does have positive impact on some users' health behavior. However, not all users respond sim\u00ad ilarly to monitoring. Monitoring may also generate anxiety that is clearly an unpleasant experience and might impede utilization due to avoidance. Designers should be cognizant of this and thus should formulate precautionary measures. These precautionary mea\u00ad sures may include the following: (I) providing an ini\u00ad tial educational segment delivered by the system itself in which the reasons for the system's goal setting strategies are clearly stated and the likelihood that some goals may not be achieved are discussed. This can prepare the users for possible lapses and thus desensitize them to the resulting anxiety due to unac\u00ad hieved goals. (2) Ensuring that the system's tone and delivery are as supportive and empathetic as possible. The system should be able to provide insight [e.g., \"This happens to many people in the process of behavior change and should not be considered as a failure.\"] and understanding [e.g., \"It is not easy to change your lifestyle. It often takes many tries and extraordinary effort. Don't be disappointmented; just keep at it.\"]. Users should be given significant control over their interaction with a health-promotion system. This may include control over the frequency and the dura\u00ad tion of the interaction as well as over the content. For example, in the TLC-PA study, users were told to call the system two times a week with each call lasting between 15 and 20 min. As we noted, individuals in the intermittent group (group #2), appeared to take control of their utilization pattern and had the high\u00ad est levels of satisfaction. Users also demonstrated a desire to exert more control over the system's content. They felt that they should have been able to select items from various lists of informational topics about exercise benefits and barriers. Even though these par\u00ad ticipants had some choice over which items they heard, they could not choose exactly what they wanted to listen to. For example, one user told us: \"One thing about the call is that it asked you if you wanted to listen to ideas for indoor or outdoor [exer\u00ad cise]. I listened to indoor, but then I would have liked to listen to outdoor but there was no option to go 228 R Farzanfar et al. I Journal of Biomedical Informatics 38 (2005) 220-228 back. And, there was one other time when there was a choice between listening to this or that, and if you lis\u00ad tened to one you couldn't listen to the other. It would be nice to have the option to do both.\" Similarly, there were occasions when users would have liked to have avoided the topics altogether. It irritated many users that they could not since they had to spend additional time interacting with the system. Thus, some individuals hung up in the middle of the conversation and others engaged in other activi\u00ad ties as they used the system such as one woman who said sometimes she \"would can\" when she was \"making dinner.\" Another user, who wanted to avoid hearing the \"definition of exercise\" that was repeated at the beginning of every contact, told us: \"If there was a way to delete just certain parts at the begin\u00ad ning-It's, like, you know what's coming.\" These and other examples indicate that providing users with a choice about what they want to learn from a pro\u00ad gram [29]might positively affect their utilization, thus enhancing the system's impact on their health behavior.

Freiberg, MD, MSc; Jeffrey H. Samet, MD, MPH I n this issue of Circulation, Mukamal and colleagues report that frequent moderate consumption of alcohol is inversely associated with incident myocardial infarctions for both men and women. I This finding is consistent with numerous studies conducted in the course of 3 decades that have documented this inverse relationship. It has been de\u00ad scribed as a \"J-\" or \"U-\" shaped phenomenon, with moderate drinkers having a lower risk of myocardial infarctions as compared with abstainers and heavy drinkers.? A substantial contribution of this study is the results suggesting that the observed \"benefits\" of alcohol on myocardial infarction outcomes, particularly in men, are mediated in large part by only 3 factors: HDL-cholesterol, glucose intolerance (HbA1d, and fibrinogen. See p 1406 Previous studies have examined the potential causes for the observed benefits of moderate alcohol consumption and are consistent with these findings. Serum HDL-cholesterol con\u00ad centrations, for example, increase in a dose-dependent re\u00ad sponse to alcohol consumption.' Prospective studies have reported a reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus- and I randomized controlled trial showed increased insulin sen\u00ad sitivity levels with moderate alcohol consumption.' Heavy drinking and binge drinking have been associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes.\" Similarly, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels of inflammatory and hemostatic markers as compared with never or occasional consumption.t-\" Heavy alcohol drinkers, in contrast, have higher levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, as compared with moderate drinkers,\" Even when risk factors are examined in aggregate, as in the case of the metabolic syndrome, current moderate consumers of alcohol have a lower prevalence of the syndrome than current nondrinkers.\" The opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the editors or of the American Heart Association.

Circulation is available at http://www.circulationaha.org DOl: 10.11611CIRCULA TIONAHA.I05.568030 This abundance of evidence supporting the hypothesis that alcohol itself leads to lower incident coronary heart disease (CHD) events is not, however, definitive. Because the ma\u00ad jority of the data describing the relationship between alcohol and CHD risk comes from observational studies, albeit well-established cohorts, the possibility that confounding may be partially or even entirely responsible for these observed effects remains controversial. Some contend that nondrinkers have a higher burden of CHD risk factors than do moderate drinkers and consequently have higher incidence rates of CHD events. In a recent study examining 30 cardiovascular-associated risk factors, 90% of the risk factors were significantly more prevalent in nondrinkers as compared with moderate drinkers.'? It should be noted, however, that former drinkers and potentially some \"sick quitters\" were included in the abstainer group, thereby potentially increasing the risk burden in nondrinkers. Nevertheless, issues of con\u00ad founding can be critical, as was recently appreciated in the highly publicized examples of hormone replacement, f3-carotene, and vitamin E therapies. In each of these cases, the clinical adoption by some individuals of these potential therapies was proven premature when randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate the beneficial cardiovascular events that were found in observational studies. Even beyond the important potential issue of uncontrolled or residual confounding in this case, the therapeutic cardio\u00ad protective use of alcohol raises serious concerns. Alcohol has considerable toxicities including abuse and dependence. In the United States, 17.6 million adults abuse alcohol or are dependent on alcohol.'! Among current drinkers, 8% exceed weekly consumption criteria for risky drinking, defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as > 14 drinks for men or 7 drinks for women per week.'> Binge drinking, which is associated with substantial morbidity, is common: 32% of current drinkers consumed ~5 drinks on 1 occasion in the past year and 15% reported such behaviors on ~12 days in the past year.'? A recent study comparing the prevalence of alcohol abuse in the US population from 1990 to 1991 and 2000 to 2001 showed that alcohol abuse had significantly increased, from 3.03% to 4.65%.11 Similarly, binge drinking increased from 1.2 billion episodes in 1993 to 1.5 billion episodes in 2001. 13 Although the prevalence of alcohol problems pales when compared with the prevalence of CHD, it is important to note that alcohol consumption was the third leading actual cause of death in the United States in 2000,14 and in 1998 alone it was associated with economic costs totaling $184.6 billion.'> Moreover, other side effects to be considered include the unfavorable associations between alcohol and violent crime, unintentional injuries including death and suicide, and myriad other health conditions includ\u00ad 1379 1380 Circulation September 6, 2005 ing certain forms of cancer.is Of particular importance with respect to the use of alcohol as a cardioprotective strategy, some investigators estimate that 5% to 7% of current abstain\u00ad ers and/or infrequent drinkers could develop diagnosable alcohol problems on beginning regular moderate alcohol\u00ad consumption regimens.'? These estimates, however, are based on the general population and not on a particular subgroup of drinkers (eg, moderate drinkers consuming alcohol within \"safe\" limits). Clinicians considering the use of alcohol as a treatment modality for COO in clinical practice must also carefully consider the issues of dosing and duration of therapy and the needs of individual patients. Past research is not particularly informative about these issues. Observational data has con\u00ad sistently shown that 1 to 2 drinks per day is associated with lower cardiovascular risk, yet most studies did not ascertain and therefore did not consider risky patterns of alcohol consumption (eg, binge drinking) in the study design or subsequent analyses. For example, among people with infre\u00ad quent episodes of heavy drinking, the risk of COO is higher as compared with abstainers even when the overall volume of alcohol consumed is 10w.I S None of the major prospective studies, including the present study, used measurement tools such as the Timeline Followback, the gold standard for ascertaining alcohol consumption in the past 30 days.'? Other measurement tools only allow investigators to average daily patterns of consumption based on weekly, monthly, or annual reports. The Timeline Followback, however, specifically asks subjects to recall the amount of alcohol consumed during each of the past 30 days, thereby quantifying daily volumes and patterns of consumption.t? Another issue of concern is the lack of adjustment for duration of alcohol consumption or the consideration of past quantities of consumption in the predictive models. Also, the alcohol data collected prospec\u00ad tively during the follow-up period in these studies are sparse. Assumptions of stable, unchanging alcohol consumption over time may simply not be accurate. Previous studies clearly show, for example, that younger adults tend to consume higher quantities of alcohol and demonstrate increased risky behavior associated with alcohol (eg, binge drinking) than do older adults.'! Because the alcohol exposure for participants most likely predates their enrollment into established cohorts, not accounting for this past quantity or pattern of alcohol exposure may be problematic. Another concern, as in the case of the present study, is that participants in these established cohorts may not be necessarily generalizable to the overall population. They typically do not represent the minority of the population with risky alcohol consumption behavior patterns, nor are they designed to provide information per\u00ad taining to an individual's metabolic, dietary, or genetic make-up, which may affect alcohol metabolism and subse\u00ad quent CHD risk. Consequently, the available observational data, although important, still do not answer important questions for physicians and patients such as: Is/are 1 to 2 drinks several days a week the appropriate amount of alcohol and pattern of consumption that is required to be cardiopro\u00ad tective? How long should this therapy continue? Does this therapy need to be lifelong? Is there an amount or lifetime quantity of alcohol consumption that needs to be consumed to achieve the \"observed benefit?\" The important limitations of these observational studies do not diminish the significance of these studies for identifying important associations that make the compelling case for pursing clinical trials that can direct clinical care. The abundance of favorable data associated with alcohol con\u00ad sumption in relation to COO juxtaposed with a side effect profile that includes risk of dependence, comorbid medical conditions, or even death compounded by the absence of specific dose or duration for the therapy to achieve a well-defined cardiovascular outcome presents the practicing physician with somewhat of a dilemma. Current recommen\u00ad dations are clear that if high-risk drinking behavior is present, patients should be asked to cut back or seek treatment.w If a patient is currently drinking within \"safe\" limits, then physi\u00ad cians can delineate and discuss the potential benefits of such behavior and the risks of drinking beyond such limits with patients.\" For those who do not drink or only occasionally consume alcohol, recommendations for alcohol use as a protective agent should not be broadly endorsed. It is true that some proponents such as Dr R. Curtis Ellison of the Boston University School of Medicine argue that, \"For appropriate patients without any contraindications (eg, history of abuse, medical conditions, religious or ethical inhibitions, etc) who do not drink or do so only occasionally, and who wish to do so, encouraging a glass of wine or other alcoholic beverage with dinner every evening may be the best advice you can give them.\"22 Others, including the present editorialists, believe that observational studies are not enough to make a prescription. Although no large prospective studies have examined the role of alcohol as a cardioprotective agent for CHD, some randomized controlled trials involving alcohol do show a beneficial effect on insulin and triglyceride concentrations among those who consume 30 g (2 drinksj/day,> and numer\u00ad ous trials have shown beneficial effects of moderate alcohol intake on lipids, clotting factors, and other intermediaries.\" Primary prevention trials have been considered previously but judged doubtful for several important reasons: high costs, difficulty with blinding subjects, the need to find large numbers of people who have no contraindications to alcohol use (eg, medical reasons) and who are willing to forgo or continue alcohol use for an extended period of time, and the possibility of eventual alcohol abuse or dependence.P Others, however, have suggested that large secondary prevention trials among those at highest risk (eg, history of CHD) and on appropriate therapy may not only be possible but are also arguably justifiable.> Consequently, given the importance and prevalence of COO, the potential benefits of alcohol use, the risks of alcohol abuse, and the inherent limits of observational stud\u00ad ies, it is time for serious consideration of the usual next step in the assessment of a prevention intervention: performance of a randomized controlled trial.

KEY WORDS: Editorials alcohol myocardial infarction coronary disease therapy .\\ Warfarin Maintenance Dosing Patterns in Clinical Practice* Implications for Safer Anticoagulation in the Elderly Population David Garcia, MD; Susan Regan, PhD; Mark Crowther, MD, MSc; Robert MD; and M. Hylek, MD, MPHf Background: The use of anticoagulant therapy is expanding among the elderly population, in part because of the increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation. Published data describing the warfarin maintenance dose requirements for this age group are limited. Because warfarin therapy is often initiated in the outpatient setting where significant barriers to daily monitoring exist for this patient population, a better understanding of the factors that predict lower dose requirements may reduce the risk of unanticipated overanticoagulation and hemorrhage. Objective: To define the effects of age and gender on the warfarin maintenance dose among ambulatory adult patients with an international normalized ratio target between 2.0 and 3.0. Design: Prospective cohort study and retrospective cohort secondary data source. Setting: One hundred one community-based physician practices with dedicated warfarin man\u00ad agement systems and an academic medical center anticoagulation clinic. Patients: A total of4,616 patients comprised the prospective cohort, and 7,586 patients comprised the retrospective cohort. Of the 12,202 patients, 2,359 were ~ 80 years of age. Measurements: Median weekly and daily maintenance warfarin dose. Results: The warfarin dose was inversely related to age and was strongly associated with gender. The median weekly dose ranged from 45 mg (6.4 mgld) for men who were < 50 years of age to 22 mg (3.1 mgld) for women ~ 80 years of age. The weekly dose declined by 0.4 mglyr (95% confidence interval [CIl, 0.37 to 0.44; P < 0.001) and women required 4.5 mg less per week than men (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.3; P < 0.001). Among patients who were > 70 years of age, the often-suggested initiation dose of 5 mgld will be excessive for 82% of women and 65% of men. Conclusions: Warfarin dose requirements decrease greatly with age. Older women require the lowest warfarin doses. These observations suggest that, when warfarin is being initiated, the commonly employed empiric starting dose of5mgld willlead to overanticoagulation forthemajority ofpatients in the geriatric age group; lower initiation and maintenance doses should be considered for the elderly.

Garcia, MD, Department a stroke increase with age.3 Warfarin therapy reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation by 68%.4 However, despite evi\u00ad dence that the benefit of anticoagulation therapy is greatest in patients who are > 75 years of age, advanced age independently predicts warfarin non\u00ad use.5-8 Warfarin is likely to remain the only widely available oral anticoagulant agent for the foreseeable future. The fear of hemorrhage and the anticipated diffi\u00ad culty with the control of anticoagulation therapy have been cited as reasons for not prescribing warfarin to elderly patients.? Compared to younger patients, older individuals exhibit an enhanced dose response to warfarin, are more likely to become overantico\u00ad agulated, and take longer to return to safe interna\u00ad tional normalized ratio (INR) levels when they have a supratherapeutic INR.1O-16 Furthermore, increas\u00ad ing age and elevated INR have been shown to be risk factors for bleeding among patients receiving antico\u00ad agulant therapy.17-20 Currently, few data are available to guide clini\u00ad cians in the dosing of warfarin therapy for the very elderly. The largest published data set included patients who were treated to achieve different target INR intensities and included only 143 individuals who were ~ 80 years of age,16 An article from The Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Con\u00ad sensus Conference on Antithrombotic and Throm\u00ad bolytic Therapy-! stated that \"a starting dose of < 5 mg might be appropriate in the elderly,\" but did not make specific recommendations for the geriatric population. Although prediction models22 of the maintenance warfarin dose have been published, it is not clear that octogenarians were well-represented in the derivation cohorts, and these models are not easily applied in all clinical settings. Similarly, war\u00ad farin initiation nomograms are largely based on younger patients.P Two other published nomo\u00ad grams24,25 incorporated adjustments for age, but were derived from study populations that included only 11 patients who were ~ 80 years of age and 30 patients who were > 75 years of age. Warfarin nomograms are limited not only by the paucity of older patients included in the cohorts from which they were derived, but also by their reliance on daily or alternate-day monitoring of the INR. Such fre\u00ad quent laboratory testing represents a Significant bur\u00ad den and may be unrealistic for many elderly patients who are initiating warfarin therapy. Compared to younger patients, older patients are more often dependent on others for transportation and are challenged by physical limitations to mobility, These impediments to frequent testing are especially rele\u00ad vant for those patients who live in less densely populated areas or in less developed countries. An awareness of these common, practical access barriers has prompted the authors of at least one guideline26 to recommend INR testing \"at least weekly during the initiation of oral anticoagulant therapy.\" Because warfarin dose requirements are known to decrease with age, the often-suggested empiric start\u00ad ing dose of 5 mgld will likely result in suprathera\u00ad peutic INR values for many elderly patients. System\u00ad atic overdosing of patients who are ~ 80 years of age may partly explain the observation that the risk for major hemorrhage is highest in older patients and in the early phase of therapy.27,28 Given the practical barriers that may limit the use of initiation nomograms, and the uncertainty about whether prediction models and nomograms can be generalized to patients who are> 80 years of age, we sought to describe warfarin maintenance dosing patterns that were experienced in the clinical care of two large, independent, ambulatory patient popula\u00ad tions. We have provided the distribution of the warfarin maintenance dose by age, gender, and indication. Additional knowledge of warfarin dose requirements for very elderly individuals will help physicians with empiric dosing decisions. A more informed decision about dosing will likely decrease the risk of excessive anticoagulation, particularly among those patients for whom daily testing is not possible. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Populations A prospective cohort was assembled as part of a larger study assessing anticoagulation care in the United States. Sites were invited to participate by letter and through a study web site. All enrolled sites had at least one dedicated provider managing warfarin therapy, usuallywithin the setting of a community-based physician group office practice. Patients were invited to partici\u00ad pate at the time of their routine appointment. Study enrollment began in August 2000 and ended in February 2002. All study participants provided written informed consent. During the study period, 6,761 patients were enrolled into the study from 101 sites in 38 states. We included those patients who were 2: 18 years of age, had a physician-specified INR target range of 2.0 to 3.0, and had achieved a stable warfarin dose during the observation period. Health-care personnel (typically, a nurse or pharmacist dedicated to anticoagulation therapy management) from the participating clinic made these decisions. Encrypted patient-derived data from each site were transmit\u00ad ted weekly to an independent data-coordinating center (McKes\u00ad sonHBOC BioServices; Rockville, MD). Missing data fields and data-entry errors were flagged and resolved prior to data transfer. Study investigators were blinded to the identification and location of the participating practices and patients. Nearly all sites had experience using the deSignated data-entry system (CoumaCare; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Princeton, NJ) before the study began. The designated software program has been used by many anticoagulation therapy management services for clinical pur- Clinical Investigations 2050 poses (eg, patient tracking, data entry, and record keeping). The software does not make dosing or follow-up recommendations. Variables of interest included age, gender, ethnicity, indication for oral anticoagulant therapy, physician-specified INR target range, INR values and dates of testing, warfarin dose at each visit, and the presence of other medical diagnoses, specifically, COPD, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hyper\u00ad tension, hyperlipidemia, active malignancy, and prior stroke. The effect of amiodarone was specifically sought out because of the magnitude of its potentiating effect on warfarin. 29 -\",1 Patient weight was routinely recorded in seven of the participating sites. The relationship between weight and gender was explored within this subset of patients. Retrospective Cohort Secondary Data Source We additionally assessed the effects of age and gender on warfarin dose in an independent cohort of ambulatory patients who were managed at the Anticoagulation Therapy Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital. We included all patients who were ~ 18 years of age, had a specified INR target range of 2.0 to 3.0, were followed up during the period from 1993 to 2003, and had achieved a stable warfarin dose. The available data for this cohort included age. gender, indication for oral anticoagulant therapy. INR values. dates of testing, and warfarin dose pre\u00ad scribed. The retrospective cohort decisions about warfarin dosing and follow-up were made by nurses employed in the Anticoagu\u00ad lation Therapy Unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Statistical Analysts We defined a stable warfarin dose as a dose that was prescribed twice consecutively after two consecutive in-range INR measure\u00ad ments (ie. 2.0 to 3.0). For each patient, we used the first stable dose observed. The median warfarin dose was calculated across gender and decade of age. Univariate comparisons were per\u00ad formed using t tests and rank sum tests. Nonparametric tests for trend were used to assess the change in median dose with age.32 We assessed the independent effects of age and gender for the prospective cohort using multiple linear regression. Variables with the potential to influence the maintenance warfarin dose were included in the model if the p value was < 0.1 in the univariate analysis. A two-sided p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The final model included terms for age, gender, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, amiodarone use. and venous thromboem\u00ad bolic disease. Analyses were performed using a statistical software package STATA software; (STATA Corp; College Station, TX). For the subset of patients with weight available. we present the median dose and age for men and women stratified by weight to better illustrate the relationships among these variables. Human Studies Approval The Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia, WA) pro\u00ad vided approval of the regiStry protocol and the informed consent form. Each participating site director was responsible for obtain\u00ad ing internal human studies approval, if locally required, and to provide evidence that these requirements had been met before the site was enrolled. The study protocol was also approved by the institutional review board at Massachusetts General Hospital. Role of the Funding Source The funding source had no role in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data, or in the decision to submit the study for publication. RESULTS Prospective Cohort A total of 4,616 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The mean age was 72 years, and 58% of patients were men (Table 1). There were 1,127 patients who were ~ 80 years of age. Sixty-two percent of the cohort was receiving warfarin therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. and 15% for venous thromboembolic disease. The mainte\u00ad nance warfarin dose was Significantly greater for men compared to women (30 vs 25 mg/wk, respectively; p < 0.0001). Trends of decreasing dose with increas\u00ad ing age were significant overall and within each gender (all p < 0.01) [Fig 1]. The decrements in the median weekly maintenance warfarin dose between the youngest age group iie, < 50 years) and the oldest age group (ie, ~ 90 years) were 47% for women and 39% for men. Similar relationships between both warfarin dose and age, and warfarin dose and gender were seen in patients with atrial fibrillation and in those with venous thromboembolic disease (Table 2). Within each indication, younger men required the highest doses (median daily dose: for atrial fibrillation, 5.4 mg; for venous thromboembolic disease, 6.4 mg), and women who were ~ 80 years of age required the lowest doses (median daily dose: for atrial fibrilla\u00ad tion, 3.1 mg; for venous thromboembolic disease, 3.6 mg). Based on our study population, the often\u00ad recommended initiation dose of 5 mg/d would ex\u00ad ceed the maintenance warfarin dose requirement for approximately 65% of women 60 to 69 years of age, Table I-Clinical Features of Patients with Target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 in the Prospective Cohort (n = 4,616)* Variables Values Age. yr 72 (22-100) Male gender 58 (2,655) Non-white race 15 (688) Stroke 11 (499) Cardiomyopathy 3 (160) Coronary artery disease 3 (147) Prosthetic heart valve 3 (151) Other 3 (117) Medical illness Hypertension 45 (2,065) Coronary artery disease 30 (1,407) Heart failure 22 (996) Diabetes mellitus 17 (769) Malignancy 7 (334) COPD 6 (298) Amiodarone use 3 (144) \u00b7Values given as mean (range) or No. (%) www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 127 /6/ JUNE, 2005 Male I FIGURE 1.

Patients receiving amiodarone have been excluded from the prospective sample. 79% of women 70 to 79 years of age, and 84% of women ~ 80 years of age (Table 3). The effects of age and gender were independent and did not change in magnitude after controlling for comorbid illness and amiodarone use. For each year of age, the weekly warfarin dose declined by 0.4 mg (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.44 mg; p < 0.001). At any given age, the weekly warfarin dose for women was 4.5 mg lower (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.3 mg; p < 0.001) than that of men. Amiodarone use was associated with a reduction of 7.3 mglwk (95% Cl, 5.2 to 9.5 mglwk; p < 0.001) in warfarin main\u00ad tenance dose. Other less potent factors that were independently associated with warfarin dose in\u00ad cluded heart failure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus (Table 4). Retrospective Cohort The retrospective cohort consisted of 7,586 pa\u00ad tients, 1,232 of whom were ~ 80 years of age. The median daily doses by age and gender for patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolic disease are presented alongside those of the prospec\u00ad tive cohort in Table 2. Similar patterns of change in the median dose by age for women and men were evident in the two cohorts (Fig 1). The proportion of patients requiring a dose of < 35 mglwk approxi\u00ad mates that of the prospective cohort (Table 3). Relationship of Gender and Weight to Maintenance Warfarin Dose We examined the median warfarin dose by gen\u00ad der-stratified deciles of weight in the subset of 369 patients from the seven sites where weight was routinely recorded. The sample size was too small for Significant dose comparisons within each stratum; however, in seven of the nine weight classes women required lower doses. There was no Significant dif\u00ad ference in mean age between genders for these strata (Table 5). The exceptions to this trend were the weight class of 150 to 1591bs, in which the higher dose among women may be explained by the fact that the women were Significantly younger than the men (p = 0.017), and the heaviest weight class iie, those weighing> 234 lbs), DISCUSSION A limited amount of data on the dosing of warfarin in an elderly population has been published. The largest such study included only 143 individuals who were ~ 80 years of age and included patients who had been treated to achieve various target intensities. Existing data that form the basis of the current gUidelines2133 were largely obtained from younger cohorts. In this study, we report on the maintenance warfarin dose of 12,202 ambulatory outpatients with an INR target range of 2.0 to 3.0. We provide the warfarin dosing experience of 2,359 individuals who were ~ 80 years of age. We were able to assess the independent effects of age and gender through multiple linear regression models that controlled for medical conditions that are prevalent in this popula\u00ad tion and the known powerful effect of amiodarone. We found highly significant associations between warfarin dose and age, and warfarin dose and gender in two large cohorts. For each additional year of age, the weekly warfarin dose declined by 0.4 mg. At any given age, the mean weekly warfarin dose for women was 4.5 mg lower than that for men. Among patients with atrial fibrillation as the indication for warfarin therapy, the median daily dose ranged from 5.4 mg, for men aged 50 to 59 years of age, to 3.1 mg. for women ~ 80 years of age. These findings have important implications for patient safety and quality Clinical Investigations 2052 Table 2-Median Daily Warfarin D08e by Age and Patient8 With Atrial Fibrillation or VenOU8 Thromboembolic Dleease Prospective Cohort (n - 2,849) Retrospective Cohort (n = 3,014) Male Female Male Female Age, yr Median Warfarin Dose,\" mg No. Median Warfarin Dose,\" mg No. Median Dose,\" mg No. Dose,s mg No. Atrial fibrillation 50--59 5.4 (4.0, (3.9,6.0) 42 5.0 (3.9,6.8) 233 4.3 (2.6,5.9) 72 60--69 4.6 (3.6, 5.7) 349 (2.9,5.4) 199 (3.6,5.7) 3.9 3.2 (2.5,4.3) 364 3.6 (2.5,4.6) 270 2.9 (2.1,3.9) 353 ~ 90 3.6 (2.6, 4.0) 27 3.0 (2.0,3.6) 41 3.4 (2.1,4.6) 12 3.1 (2.3,3.9) 35 Venous thromboembolic disease < 50 6.4 (5.0, 8.2) 55 6.1 (5.0,7.7) 48 5.7 (4.3, 8.0) 186 5.0 (3.6,7.1) 192 50--59 5.7 (4.3, 7.1) 65 5.2 (3.6,6.8) 50 5.7 (4.3,7.5) 107 5.0 (3.6,6.4) 117 60--69 5.0 (3.6, 6.1) 45 4.2 (2.9,5.7) 84 5.0 (3.2,6.1) 129 4.5 (3.0,6.1) 152 70-79 4.5 (3.4,6.0) 114 3.6 (2.7,5.0) 135 5.0 (3.2,6.1) 135 3.6 (2.5,5.0) 150 80--69 3.9 (3.2, 5.0) 47 3.6 (2.6,4.3) 2.0 18 given as 25th percentile, 75th percentile of daily warfarin dose. of anticoagulation control in the outpatient setting where daily or alternate-day monitoring of the INR is not always possible. Based on the actual warfarin maintenance doses observed in our study popula\u00ad tions, the often-recommended 5 mg daily warfarin starting dose would be too high for up to 82% of women (and 65% of men) who were> 70 years of age. Thus, our data suggest that the higher rates of bleeding and erratic INR values that have been reported17-20 in the early phase of warfarin therapy may in part be explained by overly aggressive dosing in the elderly. The mechanism for increased sensitivity to warfa\u00ad rin with agingis not well-understood. Factors such as hypoalbuminemia (leading to a reduced volume of distribution), decreased dietary vitamin K intake (resulting in a decreased capacity to synthesize func\u00ad tional clotting factors), reduced absorption of vita\u00ad min K, and polypharmacy (producing drug-drug interactions that potentiate warfarin) may lead to increased warfarin sensitivity for an individual pa- Table 3-Percentage ofPatient.

The pharmacokinetics of warfarin do not ex\u00ad plain the lower dose requirements, because the distribution and elimination half-lives of warfarin change very little with advancing age.3435 Pharmacodynamic changes with age have been studied much less. A negative correlation between age and hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes has been observed in rat models in vitro,36,37 and a study38 of hepatic microsomal enzymes in humans showed a 30% decline in hepatic drug metabolism and cytochrome P450 content with age.

One set of experimentsw using an animal model has suggested that the expres\u00ad sion of at least some cytochrome P450 enzymes may be regulated by sex steroids. Our study was based on two large patient popula\u00ad tions, Therefore, we were unable to account for individual genetic variation (eg, polymorphism in P450 CYP2C9), However, differences in the CYP2C9 genotype would not be expected to con\u00ad found our central findings of increased warfarin sensitivity with advancing age and gender. Further\u00ad more, pharmacogenetic testing will not be widely available to assist physicians making time-sensitive treatment decisions in the office setting, and there is currently no evidence describing the specific influ\u00ad ence of CYP2C9 genotype on warfarin dosing in individual patients. The possible effect of weight on warfarin dose could not be completely accounted for in our data set. It is likely that female gender largely subsumes the effect of weight on dose requirement. In our analysis of a small subset of patients, the effect of weight was most evident in the uppermost deciles (ie, > 234Ibs). Overall, our data suggest that gender\u00ad related differences in dose are independent of weight. The data used in our analysis were derived entirely from outpatients who were receiving long-term war\u00ad farin therapy. Although our study did not directly address the initiation doses of warfarin for the immediate treatment of an acute arterial or venous thrombosis, our results support a cautious approach to empiric dose selection, particularly in older women. Care must be taken in extrapolating the results from studies of younger cohorts with male predominance in whom initiation doses of 10 rng/d were shown to be safe.43-47 The median doses listed in Table 2 may be a reasonable empiric choice for some elderly outpatients in whom warfarin therapy is being initiated. It must be remembered, however, that optimal initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin will likely be lower among hospitalized patients, because they are more likely to experience concomitant decreased oral intake, recent surgery, decompensated heart failure, liver impairment, polypharmacy, or other factors associated with re\u00ad duced warfarin dose requirement.P-\" Individuals who are sensitive to warfarin would be expected to manifest an early, exuberant anticoagulant response, usually after the second dose. Finally, for patients whose weight deviates significantly from the norm for their age and gender, body mass should also be considered in any empiric dosing decisions. CONCLUSIONS This study found that mean warfarin doses de\u00ad clined predictably with age and were lower in women than in men. The average maintenance dose for young men was 6.4 mg/d; for women> 80 years of age, the average maintenance dose was only 3.1 mg/d. These observations suggest that the current initiation and maintenance doses should be modified to reduce the risk of inadequate therapy in young patients, and excessive anticoagulation in elderly patients.

FREUND, MD, MPH' MICHAEL A. POSNER, MS' MICHELE M. DAVID, MD, MPH, MBA\" SYNOPSIS Objective. Given limited prior evidence of high rates of cervical cancer in Haitian immigrant women in the U.S., this study was designed to examine self-reported Pap smear screening rates for Haitian immigrant women and compare them to rates for women of other ethnicities. Methods. Multi-ethnic women at least 40 years of age living in neighborhoods with large Haitian immigrant populations in eastern Massachusetts were surveyed in 2000-2002. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the effect of demographic and health care characteristics on Pap smear rates. Results. Overall, 81% (95% confidence interval 79%, 84%) of women in the study sample reported having had a Pap smear within three years. In unadjusted analyses, Pap smear rates differed by ethnicity (p=0.003), with women identified as Haitian having a lower crude Pap smear rate (78%) than women identified as African American (87%), English-speaking Caribbean (88%), or Latina (92%). Women identified as Haitian had a higher rate than women identified as non-Hispanic white (74%). Adjustment for differences in demographic factors known to predict Pap smear acquisition (age, marital status, education level, and household income) only partially accounted for the observed difference in Pap smear rates. However, adjustment for these variables as well as those related to health care access (single site for primary care, health insurance status, and physician gender) eliminated the ethnic difference in Pap smear rates. Conclusions. The lower crude Pap smear rate for Haitian immigrants relative to other women of color was in part due to differences in (1) utilization of a single source for primary care, (2) health insurance, and (3) care provided by female physicians. Public health programs, such as the cancer prevention programs currently utilized in eastern Massachusetts, may influence these factors. Thus, the relatively high Pap rate among women in this study may reflect the success of these programs.

A retrospective review ofdata from a tumor registry' and data from a case series\" suggest that the burden of cervical cancer is higher in the Haitian immigrant commu\u00ad nity than in other communities of color. There is some evidence of lower Pap smear rates among women who self\u00ad identified as Haitian than among other women of color in New York City:\" however, little direct research has been done on cervical cancer in the Haitian immigrant community. This reflects the difficulty in studying this community. Hai\u00ad tian immigrants are poorly sampled by large national sur\u00ad veys because of their small numbers and geographical con\u00ad centration in a few metropolitan areas.v\" as well as their inclusion in groups labeled \"black\" or \"African American\" in some large databases. to Further, many Haitians in the U.S. speak primarily Haitian Creole, requiring additional efforts on the part ofsurvey organizers to make their surveys acces\u00ad sible to this population. For the present study, we examined Pap smear rates for women living in neighborhoods with substantial Haitian immigrant populations in four cities in eastern Massachusetts. We determined whether Haitian immigrant women had lower screening rates than other women residing in the same neigh\u00ad borhoods and identified the demographic and health care characteristics associated with receipt of screening. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional, community-based survey of women living in four cities in eastern Massachusetts who were 40 years of age or older and spoke English, Haitian Creole, or Spanish. The survey used an area probability sample to identify subjects. We first generated canvass maps of potential survey areas in four eastern Massachusetts cities (Boston, Cambridge, Brockton, and Somerville) using infor\u00ad mation from community-based agencies, businesses, the city of Boston Assessing Department's Property Parcel Data for fiscal year 1997, and Property Parcel Data for fiscal year 1999 from the Assessing Departments of the cities of Brockton, Cambridge, and Somerville. After consultation with Haitian community leaders, we used these maps to generate, for each of the four cities, an initial list of city blocks where the community leaders believed at least 20% of households in\u00ad cluded Haitian immigrants. We supplemented this list with city blocks where at least two study participants believed that 20% of households included Haitian immigrants. Trained multilingual interviewers visited randomly se\u00ad lected households from 2000-2002. In households with multiple eligible women, the youngest woman meeting the eligibility criteria completed the survey. Interviewers visited each household up to four times before it was eliminated from consideration for inclusion in the study and a new household was selected. No more than 12 women were sur\u00ad veyed from any individual city block. Each participant completed a 30-to 45-minute interviewer\u00ad administered survey using a standardized instrument in En\u00adglish, Haitian Creole, or Spanish, according to her prefer\u00ad ence. The survey included questions on demographics, health care access, and preventive health practices. We adapted questions from the Cancer Control Needs in Multi-Ethnic Communities study,\" the National Health Interview Survey 1992 epidemiological and cancer control supplements,\" and a prior survey administered to 332 similar women.\" We translated all questions from English into Haitian Creole and Spanish and independently back-translated them to English to ensure the accuracy of the initial translation. We piloted the survey with women from diverse cultural back\u00ad grounds and revised the questionnaire based on these ses\u00ad sions. The Boston University School of Medicine Institu\u00ad tional Review Board approved all aspects of this study. Women were asked to self-identify their ethnicity and race. The interviewer first asked, \"How would you describe your ethnic group?\" Respondents were offered 19 specific response choices as well as \"other,\" \"don't know,\" and \"re\u00ad fused.\" Respondents who indicated \"other\" were asked for a further description of their ethnicity. A separate question asked about race: \"How do you define your race? Would you say you're black; American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander; white; other race [specify]; don't know; refused.\" Women were also asked to specify their country of birth, their mother's and father's countries of birth, their first language, and the country that they \"most identif[ied] with.\" We grouped women self-report. We attempted to classify the 114 (16%) women who reported their ethnicity as \"other\" or who listed multiple ethnicities into these categories and were able to do so for 76 ofthe 114 women. We based this categorization on the women's self\u00ad reported race and country oforigin, with secondary reliance on their parents' countries of origin. For example, one women who self-identified as \"black\" reported that she had been born in Haiti to Haitian parents and had grown up there speaking Haitian Creole; we classified her as Haitian for the present study. We grouped annual household income into four catego\u00ad ries \u00ab$20,000, $20,000-$40,000, >$40,000, and unknown) and analyzed age by decades (40-49 years, 50-59 years, ... , ~80 years.). We considered women who reported having had a Pap smear within three years prior to the interview to have had a recent Pap smear. We performed bivariate analyses using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, as required, for categorical variables. We used analysis of variance to analyze the relationship of race with age to determine the statistical significance of any age differences between racial/ethnic groups. We constructed two multiple logistic regression models to assess Pap smear rates, controlling for other factors. Our first model adjusted for age and demographic factors known to affect Pap smear rates in other populations (age, marital status, education level, and household incomei.!\":\" Our second model in\u00ad cluded all variables in the first study, as well as elements of health care delivery known to influence Pap smear rates (insurance status, physician gender, and single site for pri\u00ad mary care) .7.14.15,21 We performed extensive sensitivity analy\u00ad ses to confirm that our findings were not overly dependent PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS / MARCH-AI'RIL 2005 / VOLUME 120 PAP SMEAR RATES AMONG HAITIAN IMMIGRANT WOMEN 0 135 on assumptions in variable definition. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS,22 and all p-values are two-sided. We defined statistical significance as p<0.05. RESULTS We identified 2,304 potentially eligible addresses. We ex\u00ad cluded 161 (7%) because of vacancy, safety concerns, or because no housing unit existed at that address. At an addi\u00ad tional 369 (16%) addresses, no one was available on four separate visits. At 792 (34%) ofthe households visited, there were no eligible women. A total of 982 eligible women were identified (43% of visited households); of these women, 753 (77%) participated. Among the 753 participants, 38 (5.0%) could not be classified into one of the five pre-defined ethnic groups, and 15 (2.0%) said they did not know when they had last re\u00ad ceived a Pap smear or did not answer this question. The remaining 700 women formed our study sample. The characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1. Of the 700 women, 278 (40%) were categorized as Haitian, 156 (22%) as African American, 52 (7%) as English-speak\u00ad ing Caribbean, 72 (10%) as Latina, and 142 (20%) as white, not Hispanic. The Haitian group included 275 women who reported having been born in Haiti and who self-identified as \"Hai\u00ad tian\" or \"Haitian American\"; two women who self-identified as Haitian or Haitian American but reported having been born in other Caribbean countries (Dominican Republic, Cuba); and one women (as described above) who did not identify an ethnicity but reported having been born in Haiti to Haitian parents. Seventy-five percent of the women in the study sample lived in Boston, and 87% reported having some form of health insurance. Most surveyed women had reportedly en\u00ad gaged in preventive health behaviors: 90% reported having had a \"check-up visit\" within two years, and 68% reported having had a mammogram within one year. Also, 87% re\u00ad ported that someone at their doctor's office, i.e., their health care provider, a member of the support staff, or an inter\u00ad preter, was available to communicate with them in their first or preferred language. We found differences in demographic and health care access variables across ethnicities (see Table 2). The Haitian immigrant women were less likely to have graduated from high school than African American, Latina, non-Hispanic white, or English-speaking Caribbean women (p<O.OI for each comparison) and were least likely to have health insur\u00ad ance or a female physician. They were also least likely to report that they had access to someone who spoke their language when they saw a physician. Haitian, Latina, and English-speaking Caribbean women were less likely to re\u00ad port their incomes than African American or non-Hispanic white women, thus justifying use of a four-level variable for income. White women were oldest and least likely to be married. We found that 570 women reported having had a Pap smear within three years (81%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 79%, 84%). Pap smear rates differed by ethnicity (p=0.003). Women who identified as Latina, African Ameri\u00ad can, and English-speaking Caribbean women had the high-Table 1.

Characteristics that made Pap smear acquisition more likely included being married or living with a domestic partner, having some form of health insurance, utilizing a single site of health care, and having a female physician (Table 3). Pap smear rates also differed by income and age. Logistic regression models that adjusted for confounding accounted for much of the difference in Pap smear rates between women of different ethnicities (Table 4). In our models, which sequentially adjusted for demographics and health care delivery variables, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for having a recent Pap smear for Haitian women compared to African American women approached 1.0 and had pro\u00ad gressively wider CIs.

Our second model produced a C-statistic (a measure of predictive validity) of 0.74, indicating that it discriminated well between women with and without Pap smears. Age, physician gender, and insurance were statistically significant predictors of Pap smear acquisition in our final model. In sensitivity analyses, we found no statistically signifi\u00ad cant interactions between any of these factors and ethnicity. During further sensitivity analyses in which we varied variable definitions, we found that the adjusted ORs varied by less than 10% from those in the base model and the p-values for ethnicity were similar to those calculated in the base model. DISCUSSION In our population-based sample ofmulti-ethnic urban women at least 40 years old, self-reported Pap smear rates among all women were relatively high. In the study sample, women identified as Haitian had a lower Pap smear rate than women identified as African American, English-speaking Caribbean, or Latina. Of note, non-Hispanic white women who lived in the same neighborhoods in eastern Massachusetts as Hai\u00ad tian immigrants had a lower crude Pap smear rate than women of color. However, adjustment for differences in demographics and health delivery eliminated the associa\u00ad tion between ethnicity and Pap smears. Ethnicity has been reported to be an important predictor of Pap smear acquisition. Multiple data sources suggest that African American women have slightly higher Pap smear 19rates than non-Hispanic white women.15,2' .\" Data from the National Health Interview Survey!\" and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey\" suggest that Latina, Native American, and women classified as \"other\" have lower Pap smear screening rates than either African American or white women. However, there is little evidence directly comparing Pap smear rates of Haitian immigrant women to those of other black women. Fruchter et al. found the rate of in situ cervical carcinoma, which is almost always detected via Pap smears, to be lower in Haitian immigrant women than in other minority women;\" In a telephone survey of minority and immigrant women completed in 1992 in New York, Mandelblatt and colleagues found that women identified as Haitian had the lowest Pap smear rate (69%) of any group sampled. II These data, along with the results of the present study, highlight differences among black popu\u00ad lations, and reinforce the need for detailed reporting of race and ethnicity in monitoring the health of minority communities.\" Although the 81%Pap smear rate for a three-year period in the present study does not meet the Healthy People 2010 goal for 90% of women at least 18 years old to receive triennial Pap smears.t\" the Pap smear rate is higher than that seen in a recent study of similar low-income minority women. II Our data, along with state and local BRFSS data,\":\" reveal higher Pap rates in Massachusetts and Boston than nationally. These higher rates may be attributed to expanded health care access in this region.\" The services available in eastern Massachusetts during the study period included both government and non-government programs\" such as broad Medicaid eligibility requirements, a general insurance \"safety net\" (the Massachusetts Uncompensated Care Pool),'1 a spe\u00ad cial program designed to increase cancer screening access (the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Women's Health Network) ,32 and a statutory requirement for transla\u00ad tion services at hospital-based medical practices.\" In addi\u00ad tion, the relatively large number of teaching hospitals and community health centers in Boston and Cambridge may increase low-income women of color's access to medical care. The health care environment in eastern Massachusetts accounts for the many women in this study with insurance PUBLIC HEAl.TH Rt:PORTS / MARCH-ApRIl. 2005 / VOl.UMt: 120 PAP SMEAR RATES AMONG HAITIAN IMMIGRANT WOMEN 0 137 Table 3.

Many studies have found that women are more likely to have had a Pap smear if they are younger, have more education, have higher incomes, or are rnarried.t\"?\" Others have found that higher Pap smear rates are associated with health insurance.v-\" a usual site of care,' and a female physician.\" In our data, the ethnic dis\u00ad parities observed in unadjusted analyses can be explained by ethnic differences in demographic and health delivery vari\u00ad ables. Demographic variables such as age, income, educa\u00ad tion, and marital status are either unmodifiable or unlikely to be affected by public health programs. However, differ\u00ad ences in Pap smear acquisition between women ofdifferent ethnicities were not eliminated by adjustment for age, in\u00ad come, and education. It was only after adjustment for differ\u00ad ential insurance rates, care by a female physician, and use of a single site for primary care that the differences in Pap smear rates were fully explained. This implies that if these factors could be equalized across ethnicities, women of all ethnicities would have Pap rates similar to those seen in the African American, English-speaking, and Latina women in this study. Thus, if disparities in health care delivery could be minimized, Pap smear acquisition can approach the Healthy People 2010 goal of 90%.26 This study had several strengths. We achieved a high response rate in sampling a community-based population of multi-ethnic women. The interviewer-administered format in three languages allowed us to collect detailed data regard\u00ad ing ethnicity and cancer screening practices. Our use of an area-probability sampling strategy increased the likelihood that women of different ethnicities would be comparable in terms of unmeasured confounders such as access to public transit and exposure to public service announcements in the mass media. This study also had several limitations. Ascertainment of Pap smear status was based on self-report.

We also included women older than 65. Cervical cancer screening in this age group is controver\u00ad sial;\" however, older minority women have a relatively high rate of abnormal Pap smears'?\" and are at higher risk for invasive cervical cancer than younger or white women.\" We also stratified by age, creating separate models for women older or younger than 65 (not shown). Although our power for this analysis was limited, it suggests that ethnic differ\u00ad ences in Pap smear rates are more pronounced among older women. Further research will be needed to better character\u00ad ize any possible interaction of age and ethnicity with respect to Pap smear acquisition. The higher incidence of invasive cervical cancer in Hai\u00ad tian immigrant women5,6,25,4' has been attributed to lower rates of Pap smear acquisition in this community. However, in the present study, the initially observed relationship of ethnicity to receipt of Pap smears was explained by health care delivery variables and specific demographic character\u00ad istics. Many of the health care delivery variables are poten\u00ad tially modifiable by public health programs, and such pro\u00ad grams may account for the relatively high Pap smear rates seen in this study population. Thus, our data suggest that a health care system with government mandate and funding to serve the needs of limited-English-speaking immigrants can succeed. Other regions with lower Pap smear rates may be able to use this model to improve preventive health deliv\u00ad ery to immigrant women. At the same time, however, these programs will be challenged to continue operation in a more fiscally restricted era. Public health and elected offi\u00ad cials will need to consider closely how implementing or withdrawing these programs may impact immigrant and minority communities.

T he structure. process. and outcomes of Internal medicine residency training have concerned the profession for over 20 years. r-a Over the last decade the Initiative to move to out\u00ad comes-based education redefined the competencies physi\u00ad cians should obtain during tralnlng. IO1 1 The core principle of outcomes-based education Is the objective demonstration that a graduating trainee. whether from medical school or a residency, possesses the knowledge. skills, and attitudes nec\u00ad essary to progress to the next stage of his or her professional career. 12.13 The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the Institute of Medicine (lOM) have defined core competencies for physicians shown In Table 1. 10, 14 While both the ACGME and 10M provide a framework for the desired outcomes, medical educators bear the burden of designing the structures and processes to achieve them. 15 Educators face several key challenges In redesigning res\u00ad Idency programs. First, residency programs must prepare trainees for a variety of general Internal medicine and subs\u00ad pecialty careers. Second. the settings and resources for resi\u00ad dency training are highly heterogeneous. Third, an aging and increasingly diverse population. combined with rapidly ex\u00ad panding medical Information and procedural technology, chal\u00ad lenges all internists to acquire and maintain the knowledge, skills, attitudes. and performance necessary to provide high\u00ad quality care within their chosen discipline. 16.17 Finally, grow\u00ad Ing public dissatisfaction, substantial health care disparities. Increased acuity but shorter lengths of stay for hospitalized patients. new work hour requirements. Increasing medical student debt, and changing student demographics and life\u00ad style concerns further complicate residency reform. 1&-25 To provide recommendations for residency reform. The Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) convened a task force consisting of physicians representing a broad range of views within general medicine. expertise and experience In clinical education. and who represented internal medicine or\u00ad ganizations outside of SGIM (Appendix 1). The task force fo\u00ad cused on reform in 5 specific areas; ambulatory education, inpatient education. residency curriculum. health disparities. and life-long learning skills.

We acknowledge this report cannot cover all important aspects of residency training. The task force enthusiastically welcomes comments from other educators and internal medicine spe\u00ad cialty organizations. Only through active collaboration and se\u00ad rious dialogue can we improve residency training. TRAINING IN THE AMBULATORY SETrlNG Recognizing the need for greater emphasis In outpatient train\u00ad Ing is not new. 1.5,26-29 The outpatient setting is where patients now receive most of their acute. chronic disease, and preven\u00ad tive care. Hospitalized patients are often discharged before many conditions have been fully evaluated or treated. Ambu\u00ad latory settings, particularly continuity clinic settings, provide the Ideal location for training In several key 10M competencies: learning to provide care based on continuous healing relation\u00ad ships, patient-centered care based on patient needs and val\u00ad ues with the patient as the source of control. learning and designing systems of care that anticipate patients' needs. and learning to work In teams that model cooperation among cli\u00ad nicians (and noncllnlclan team members). including collabo\u00ad ration, coordination. and exemplary communication. 14 Although they are the essence of General Internal Medicine, these competencies apply equally for all Internists. 14,17 Two different types of ambulatory training occur In Inter\u00ad nal medicine residency programs: continuity clinic, where res\u00ad Idents care for a panel of patients over time. and concentrated ambulatory block rotations. The learning In continuity clinic Is experiential and Is often augmented by case-based teaching conferences before or after clinlcs.3D ,3 1 The ambulatory block rotations provide a venue for developing competence in man\u00ad aging the transitions and coordination of care within internal medicine, and experience with nonmedtctne specialty care such as office orthopedics, gynecology. urology. ophthalmolo\u00ad gy. dermatology, and otolaryngology. Teaching strategies used In ambulatory blocks include didactic seminars teaching the principles of ambulatory medicine, case-based teaching ses\u00ad sions, and experiential learning with patients In other special\u00ad ty clinics such as rheumatology, adolescent medicine. geriatrics, and women's health.3 2-34 Research has shown that graduating residents feel un\u00ad comfortable In managing common chronic conditions such as diabetes In the ambulatory setting, suggesting that the quality Recetvedjor publicatlan May 23, 2005 and in. revised form July 26, 2005 Acceptedjor publicatlan July 26. 2005 2 Holmboe et al..

FIrst, there Is often Inadequate Infrastruc\u00ad ture to allow residents to provtde high-quality. longitudinal care for complicated patlents.37-39 Residency cltntcs frequent\u00ad ly lack the team structures needed to provtde patient care when the primary resident Is unavallable.4Q-42 Also lacking are systems to monitor the quality of care provtded to the resi\u00ad dents' patients. The current approach to training In continuity care attenuates residents' growth toward Independent practice and their abl1lty to work In teams.43-46 Second. the residency clinics of academic medical centers typically attract a patient population wtth a disproportIonate share of complex medical and psychosocial Issues. The patient wtth multiple serious medical problems complicated by pov\u00ad erty, illiteracy. and substance abuse may overwhelm the clin\u00ad Ical abilities of an Internist In training. particularly In the absence of multidisciplinary resources. This Is particularly true for Interns. Too often they are assigned to care for a grad\u00ad uating senior's patient panel, containing patients whose con\u00ad ditions may be too complex for a novtce to manage proper\u00ad ly while they are learning the fundamentals of outpatient medicine. Third. It Is difficult for residents to develop expertise In continuity of care because they spend an Insufficient amount of time In the outpatient arena. In most residency programs, residents attend their conttnutty clinic for only one half-day per week. Contmutty c1tnlc sessions are frequently cancelled when the resident Is assigned to Intensive care and night float rotations, limiting total conttnutty clinic exposure during training. To highlight the point. graduating residents starting a new outpatient practice wtll spend more time In the ambu\u00ad latory setting In their first 3 months of practice than they do during an entire 3-year residency. Finally. the quality and quantity of learning In ambulatory block rotations can be variable. Restdents are often relegated to the role of observers during brief assignments In nonmed\u00ad Iclne clinics, where programs rely on nonlnternal medicine specialists to donate teaching time. Residency programs also tend to use residents assigned to ambulatory block rotations as a workforce reservoir when unexpected vacancies on hos\u00ad pital services (e.g., the assigned resident Is sick) require cov\u00ad erage. Vacations are frequently assigned during these rotations. Both factors contribute to a lack of consolidation of Important skills. We found little Information about ambulatory training during specialty consult rotations. that may be an tm\u00ad portant untapped resource for ambulatory skill development. TRAINING IN 'rHE INPATIENT SETTING The Inpatient setting Is essential for educating residents about the care of acutely and critically 111 patients. The hospltal Inpa\u00adtlent service has been the predominant setting ofInternal med\u00ad Icine education for over 100 years.47 It Is not surpnstng, therefore, that graduates of Internal medicine residency pro\u00ad grams report feeling most prepared to care for the acutely ill hospitalized pattent.F\" Multiple changes In the health care sys\u00ad tem are significantly affecting the Inpatient training experience. FIrst, hospitalized patients are sicker yet spend tncreas\u00ad Ingly shorter periods of time In the hospital. 19.48 Residents have little time to establish a healing relationship wtth their patients and only tnfrequently learn about patient outcomes such as final diagnoses, symptom resolution. functional sta\u00ad tus. and satisfaction with care after dlscharge.49-52 Even more problematic Is the observation that much of residents' time Is spent In noncllnlcal or noneducational tasks.53.54Second, al\u00ad though the traditional physician-centric teaching model (at\u00ad tending, resident, Intern, and student teams) predominates. the care model of hospitalized patients Is now Interdisciplinary wtth patients recelvtng care from teams consisting of physi\u00ad cians, nurses, dieticians, case managers, and others.46.55,56 Third, new work hour rules. while approprtate given the large body of evtdence of the pernicious effects of fatigue, have greatly challenged the ability of residency programs to meet expected service needs.57-64 Programs have coped wtth the need to provtde continuous patient coverage (In most teaching hospitals the residents are the only Internists In house over\u00ad night) In the setting of work hours restrtctlons by Instituting night and/or day float services. The handoffs necessitated by these float services may be associated wtth higher rates of pre\u00ad ventable adverse events.65.66 Other solutions Include the hir\u00ad Ing of hospltalists and physician extenders. 67-70Weknow little about the effects of these changes on patient care and resident educatlon,70-72 although early reports regarding teaching by hospltalists are encouraglng.68-71.73.74 Finally, recent re\u00ad search on medical errors suggests that there Is a need for new approaches to supervision, evaluation, and teaching In the Inpatient setting. Studies have documented substantial rates of clinical errors, many of which have Immediate Impli\u00ad cations for patient care, committed by trainees In teaching hospitals for over 30 years.75-64 Data have shown that resident findings and presentations are often at odds wtth the findings of more experienced attendlngs.85.86 A recent systematic re\u00ad vtew suggested that better supervision was associated wtth better quality of care.86 Despite this knowledge, the type and quality of supervision and evaluation by faculty has changed little. Research has shown that learners value direct observa\u00ad tion, bedside teaching, and role modeling of clinical skills by faculty.87-93 These actlvttles are also well received by patients. THE RESIDENCY CURRICULUM The Federated Council on Internal Medicine curriculum helped to define the breadth of Internal medtcme.P\" but the 3 JGIM Holmboe ei al., Reforming Internal Medicine Residency Training Task Force currtculum has not achieved widespread adoption and pro\u00ad grams may not be able to provide enough experiences to cover 1t.95 Furthermore, as the body of biomedical knowledge ex\u00ad pands. curricula will need to adapt. Internal Medicine needs to more clearly define the core content of the knowledge, sktlls, and attitudes that Is required for all Internists, regardless of their eventual career tracks. Programs must then Identlfy how best to teach this content In the context of their Instltutlonal settlng. Surprisingly little study has been performed on what aspects of the Inpatient experience are most Important for Im\u00ad plementatlon of a successful residency curriculum and opti\u00ad mal patlent care.72 Finally. Internal Medicine must define the level of competency expected for each content area. It may no longer be feasible for residents to acquire \"mastery\" In all as\u00ad pects oflntemal medicine. IfIndeed that ever was achleved.96-99 TRAINING TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES The 2000 census confirms the Increasing ethnic diversity of Inhabitants living In the United States. and ethnic mlnorltles lag behind white Americans on nearly every health care indi\u00ad cator. 18 Residency programs care for a large proportlon of pa\u00ad tlents from socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Academic Health Centers (AHC) have assumed increasing re\u00ad sponslbl1lty for care of the underserved-between 1991 and 1996. AHC expenditures on uninsured patlents rose 40%, and at a cost of nearly 4 bl1llon dollars In 1999.7 Given that one of the core reasons for public funding of graduate medical edu\u00ad cation [GME) Is the social contract between residency pro\u00ad grams and the care of underserved patients, a core tenet of patlent-centered training should be to educate residents on how to address health disparities In order to reduce or elimi\u00ad nate these gaps.47.100 All Internists. regardless of their ulti\u00ad mate specialty. will encounter health dtspartttes throughout their careers. In addition. lessons learned In addressing health disparities. such as skl1ls from the social sciences, apply across all patient groups. 100-104 Unfortunately, little data exist regarding the evaluation of curriculum In cultural competency and health disparities. 103,104 A recent systematic review concluded that educational Inter\u00ad ventions In cultural competence do produce changes In learner knowledge and perhaps some skills. but no study has exam\u00ad Ined Important patient outcomes. 104 Some critics argue that training solely focused on cultural competency training may actually have a deleterious Impact on patient care. 105 Howev\u00ad er. training In health disparities and the specific social science domalns of physician roles and behavior, social and cultural Issues In health care, and health polley and economics should be Incorporated In residency training and Involve actual pa\u00ad tient care. 100 Compounding the problem Is the Insufficient number of minority faculty and medical students at academ\u00ad Ic medical centers and residency programs. 106 TRAINING FOR LIFE-LONG LEARNING With the rapid production of new medical Information. few would challenge Osler's assertlon that medical education Is \"a life course. for which the work of a few years under teachers Is but a preparation.\" Yet many physicians fall to meet their emerging Information needs. 107 witness their up-to-date med\u00ad Ical knowledge deteriorate over the years after their train\u00adtng, 108 and, ultlmately. demonstrate wide practice variations for procedures with established efficacy. 109 Self-directed learning (SDL) represents any study form In which Individuals have primary responslblllty for planning. Implementing, and evaluating the effort. 11 0 Self-directed learners perform a sequence of tasks, Including recognizing Intrinsic Information needs, seeking appropriate Information. appraising the Informatlon, and applying the information to the triggering scenario. However. they will not engage In the process without sufficient motivation and will not construct personal meaning or sustain the process without reflecting on the learning process Itself (metacognltlon).ll1,112 In medicine. empiric studies demonstrate that physicians engage In SDL episodes In response to problems, which may be specific (an uncertainty arising from an encounter with a particular pa\u00ad tient) or general (a need for an update In a skl1l or body of knowledge). 113 Residency programs currently dedicate relatively little ex\u00ad plicit curricular time to SOL, often In the forms of journal clubs. evidence-based medicine (EBM) currtcula, and prob\u00ad lem-based learning [PBL) conferences, all of which Include training In some or all of SDL skills. 114,115 Studies Involving journal clubs suffer from weak designs and outcome measures and have shown limited effectiveness. 116 Taking a lesson from undergraduate medical currtcula, some programs replaced some of their didactic conferences with PBL sessions. In a controlled trial. pediatrics residents partlclpatlng In PBL con\u00ad ferences exhibited more frequent SDL behaviors than controls. but the differences did not persist after the Intervention end\u00ad ed. 117 In a surgery program, attendance at a basic science PBL conference correlated posltlvely with tn-tratntng-examtnation scores. 118 Notably. this stands In contrast with an Internal medicine program study that found no relationship between attendance at a traditional \"noon conference\" and ABIM cer\u00ad tifying examination scores. 119 the number of programs offer\u00ad curricula Increased from 37% to 71%. Several pre\u00ad post controlled studies with objective outcomes have demon\u00ad strated the effectiveness of these curricula In Improving EBM knowledge and skI1lS.122-124 Studies of the Impact on be\u00ad haviors suffer from outcome measures lacking validation. such as retrospective self-reports or the frequency of their EBM \"utterances\" In audlotaped teaching interactions. In addltlon to specific courses. we should consider resi\u00ad dents' day-to-day experience with SDL on their clinical rota\u00ad tlons. Too often programs and faculty fall to utilize the experiential learning through the integration and application of clinical skills, judgment, and EBM. Residents fall to take advan\u00ad tage of SOL opportunities due In part to barriers such as Insuf\u00ad ficient tlrne, underdeveloped skills. limited access to resources. dysfunctional team dynamics, and an unsupportlve tnstftutlon\u00ad al culture.121-125 More recently. educators are exemplifying EBM In \"real time\" as part of the flow of clinical work, which confronts the logtstical constraints faced by busy practitioners and leverages the Imperative oflmmedlate learning needs. 126-129 Reform measures should help residents to capitalize on the clinical questions that arise In the care of their patients. GME FINANCING The biggest contributor to GME financing Is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). States, the Veterans 4 Holmboe et al., Reforming Internal Medicine Residency Training Task Force JGIM Adrntntstratton, and the Department of Defense provtde the bulk of the rest of GME funding that totals nearly 15 bl\\llon dollars, Center for MedIcare and MedIcaId Services uses a complicated formula Inltlal1y developed In 1982 to determIne support for teaching hospitals based on the hospital's MedI\u00ad care burden. However, payments go to the hospItal and not dIrectly to the residency program. Private Insurances do not contribute dIrect financIal support to GME and no longer sup\u00ad port reImbursement at a htgher rate for teaching hospItals. There Is consensus that the current system Is flawed and that reform Is needed. MultIple organlzattons or groups have proposed financing reform. IO I.13D-135 However, there Is no con\u00ad sensus on what reforms should be enacted and the result Is policy inertia. Policy experts argue that financing GME Is a collateral duty of CMS, and If CMS Is to continue to fund at least some portIon of GME. then resIdency programs need to demonstrate theIr public good function more effectlve\u00ad ly.IOI.136-138 The majority of recommendatIons Include chang\u00ad Ing to an all payer system, dtstrtbuttng GME funds dIrectly to the resIdency programs, and reducing the variation In GME payments among geographic regtons, Future reform efforts will requIre the Involvement of a broader cross-section of all specIalties. We concur with the recommendations to move to an all payer system and to dis\u00ad tribute GME funds more dIrectly to programs, but hold the programs accountable for how the funds are uttllzed. Dedlcat\u00ad ed funds for educational research are also desperately needed. SUMMARY OF TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS The task force offers the following recommendations for re\u00ad formIng Internal medIcIne resIdency traInIng. In sum, the task force believes we can no longer make changes at the margins of current program structures and that we should embrace bold and InnovatIve reforms for the good of our patients and all traInees. ThIs will requIre a combtnatton of courage and Inno\u00ad vation from all stakeholders. 1. Residency programs must teach patient-centered care by providing the highest quality of care possible during the training process. Broadly defined, patient-centered resIdency educatIon means provtdlng developmentally appropriate traInIng experiences Integrated with InterdIscIplinary teams to provtde coordInat\u00ad ed, comprehensIve, safe, and htgh-quallty care that sImulta\u00ad neously meets the needs of resIdents and patients. 2. There must be better balance between educational experi\u00ad ences in the ambulatory and hospital settings. Regardless of theIr ultimate career choice, all resIdents need a mInImal level of competence In conttnutng care that focuses on relatlonshtps with patients and the communIty. ResIdents pursuing careers In specIaltIes that are predomInantly outpa\u00ad tIent based will requIre greater time spent In ambulatory edu\u00ad cation settmgs, 3. To honor the social contract and embrace our professional obligations, programs should explicitly address health dis\u00ad parities and incorporate teaching in the SOcial sciences. To solve the problems of disadvantaged patients, Institutions that sponsor resIdency programs will need to develop pro\u00ad grams to address health dtspartttes and resIdency programs will need to develop curricula so that resIdents can effectIvely partIcIpate In these programs. Attention to health dIsparities will strengthen the bond between the public and resIdency ed\u00ad ucation. 4. All stakeholders should work together to better dejlne the \"core\" knowledge, skills, and attitudes ofinternal medicine training. This core curriculum should prepare all Internal medIcIne res\u00ad Idents for any career pathway they choose and Include more attention to clInIcal skl\\ls. Thts work should be a collaborative effort among the programs, medIcal specialty socIeties, and the certification boards. 5. SGIM and other stake-holders should work with regulatory organizations to permit greater flexibility to promote innova\u00ad tive approaches to training. ResIdents now have a broad array of career choIces, IncludIng urban and rural primary care practice, hospltallst practice. subspecIalty traInIng for practice or academics. public health. academIc general Internal medIcine, and others. A \"one sIze fits all\" approach to Internal medIcIne tratntng Is no longer logical In thIs new envtronment. 139-144 The RRC's educational Innovations project provides one opportunIty to create more flexible. state-of-the-art programs.P'' SGIM should partner with other Internal medIcIne organlzatlons to dIscuss dIffer\u00ad ent approaches to certIfication, pathways to subspectaltzatton, and new pathways to certlflcatton In hospitalism. geriatrics, and other areas of specIal concentration. 6. Medical educators must improve the substantial and Wide\u00ad spread inadequacies in the current evaluation practices by faculty and programs. TraInees must not be advanced to the next level of traInIng without clear evtdence they are ready.145-149 A substantIal number of tools and methods currently exist for effective eval\u00ad uation. ThIs Is not an unfunded mandate: the public contrib\u00ad utes billions of dollars a year to GME and educators have a moral and ethIcal responstbtltty to ensure the competence of graduatIng traInees. 7. Clinical work and educational processes in teaching hospi\u00ad tals and clinics need substantial redesign. ResIdents should become learnIng members of hIgh-functIon\u00ad Ing interdIscIplinary teams without absolute reliance on the resIdent workforce to compensate for fatlures In the lnstitu\u00ad tIon's Infrastructure. Furthermore, evidence Is accumulating quickly that team-based care leads to better patient outcomes. A growing number of programs have successfully Incorporated resIdents In both Inpatient and outpatient InterdIscIplinary teams. 8. Internal medicine resident education must develop a more robustfaculty supervision system Patients have the right to expect safe and effectIve care In a traInIng setting. Graduated responslbtltty and autonomy for clinIcal decIsIon makIng will remaIn central to the educational experience. ResIdents must learn cltntcal reasonIng skills through the actual care of patients and appropriate faculty supervlston must be assured to avoId clinIcal errors too com\u00ad mon In the current educational process. Faculty supervising resIdents In the Inpatient arena need to have protected time to supervise to ensure quality of care. In the outpatient setting, patIents should have a \"prima\u00ad ry\" ambulatory attendIng and health care team to Improve 5 JGIM Holmboe et al. Reforming Internal Medicine Residency Training Task Force continuity and create a long-term healing relationship. New faculty-resident co-management strategies will be needed to ensure quality of care, patient safety, and resident learning. To accomplish these goals, faculty development will be needed In new supervision and observation skl1ls, principles of mtcro\u00ad systems and safety, chronic disease management, and quality Improvement. 9. SGIM should partner with others to approach CMS and pol\u00ad icy makers to change how GME funds are allocated Without reform of the financial support for GME any large\u00ad scale reform In residency training will be more difficult. The push by CMS for quality and accountability among practition\u00ad ers Is an opportunity for residency programs to step up to the plate. Programs can leverage residency reform as part of a genuine effort to Improve patient care to support a change In how funds are allocated. This will require a cohesive effort among organizations to work with CMS and policy makers. 10. Residency programs must explicitly prepare residents for life-long learning. Training In life-long SDL deserves much more explicit empha\u00ad sis In Internal medicine residency training. Residents should be actively Involved In answering clinical questions In \"real time\" and should work with clinical performance data to Improve the systems of care In which they work. These skl1ls will lay the groundwork for life-long SDL and Improvement. Regardless of the length of training, no resident will attain mastery In all areas of Internal medicine, and substantial learning will and must occur throughout a career. In terms of leaming Infrastructure, residents should have rapid, relia\u00ad ble, and continuously available access to electronic medical Infonnatlon resources at the point of care In every clinical setting. Internet-based portfolios, validated Instruments for SDL knowledge and skl1ls, and a SDL readiness scale all show promise as effective tools to Improve SDL behaviors and evaluation. 150-152 II. Residency reform must also occur In the context of reforms In undergraduate and continuing medical education. Residency educators should work with medical student and fellowship educators, and continuing medical education orga\u00ad nizations to define benchmarks of competence and coordinate training from undergraduate through graduate and post-GME. The current state of fragmentation among Internal medicine educational organizations Is counterproductive to effective reform. 12. Redesign of Internal medicine training must promote col\u00ad laboration among residency programs for better education research and sharing of best educational practices. Many Important questions about the Interface of education and patient care need urgent answers. Questions for research Include: how should we address health disparities In the con\u00ad text of a residency program? What Is the Ideal ambulatory tralnlng system? How do new models of continuity affect edu\u00ad cation and patient care? What are the optimal models of team learning In both the inpatient and outpatient settings? What are the actual costs of training a resident? How will new ap\u00ad proaches to supervision affect learning? Finally, better re\u00ad search methodology Is needed to address past limitations In residency education research, Including cluster designs and combined qualltative-quantltative approaches. 153-156 Theopinions reflected within this manuscript are solelythose of the authors and do not represent the views of the Department of Defense.

Finally, it is important to realize that pa\u00ad tients may be denied appropriate use of a controlled substance for a variety of reasons and be mislabeled as having a drug problem when they do not. Epidemiologic factors of drug abuse The lack of a universally agreed-upon definition of prescription drug abuse has led to limitations in epi\u00addemiologic research. Although many classes of drugs are subject to misuse, physicians are most often con\u00ad cerned with intentional abuse of prescription controlled substances. Prescription stimulants, sedatives, tran\u00ad quilizers, and analgesics can all be misused. Prescription analgesics are the most widely abused of the prescription psychoactive medications, followed by tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The Na\u00ad tional Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) provides insight into the scope of psychoactive PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE AND ABUSE / VOL 118/ NO 1/ JULY2005/ POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE 20 _ Px DRUG USE AND ABUSE, continued _ medication misuse in the United States. Accord\u00ad ing to data from 2003, an estimated 6.3 million per\u00ad sons aged 12 or older (2.7% of the population) had used prescription psychotherapeutic medications nonmedically in the month before being surveyed. Pain relievers were most commonly used (4.7 mil\u00ad lion), followed by tranquilizers (1.8 million), stimu\u00ad lants (1.2 million), and sedatives (0.3 million). More than 9% of high school seniors reported using OxyContin, Vicodin, or Percocet in the past year, In the United States, women are nearly 50% more likely than men to be prescribed a controlled drug (primarily opiates and anxiolvtics).' Despite the greater exposure of women to medications of abuse, rates of prescription drug misuse are similar for women and men.' Patients with psychiatric disordersare more likely than the general population to have comorbid sub\u00ad stance use disorders.' From 1990 to 1998, the number of new nonmed\u00ad ical users of opioid.analgesics increased by 181%, or about 1.5 million people, according to the NHSDA.5 Emergency department visits related to the use of oxy\u00ad codone hydrochloride increased 452%, from 4,069 reports in 1994 in 2001.6 Nonmedical use increased 132% for tranquilizers, 90% sedatives, and 165% for stimulants during this same time.' This rise has led the National Institute on Drug Abuse to launch a campaign against prescription drug abuse.' A recent study of patients using opioid medications for noncancer pain in primary care settings found pre\u00ad scription drug abuse in up to 31% of patients. A life\u00ad time history of substance use and younger age were significantly associated with prescription drug abuse.\" legal issues Physicians are legally responsible when prescribing controlled drugs and need to be familiar with federal and state prescribing laws and regulations. In all cases, the most stringent law-whether it is federal or state -takes precedence. Controlled substances are con\u00adsidered drugs with potential for physical dependence, psychologic dependence, or both. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, theUS Food and Drug Ad\u00ad ministration (FDA) approves drugs established to be safe and effective. Physicians may choose to pre\u00ad scribe drugs for indications other than their approved labeling if it is done on the basis of acceptable med\u00ad ical practice. The FDA's role does not include regu\u00ad lating medical practice.\" The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 is the le\u00ad gal foundation by which the federal government reg\u00ad ulates the use and availability of controlled drugs. It places all controlled drugs into one of five scheduled classes (table 2). The schedules are based on the de\u00ad gree of medicinal value, potential for abuse, and rela\u00ad tive safety of the drug.\" Each schedule carries differ\u00ad ent penalties for unlawful use. Schedule I contains drugs that have no acceptable medical use and are illegal except for approved research use. Schedules II, III, IV, and V have accepted medical uses and de\u00ad creasing potential for abuse. Schedule II drugs must be prescribed with a writ\u00ad ten prescription for no more than 30 days, and refills are prohibited unless the patient contacts his or her physician and obtains a new prescription. However, in cases of medical emergencies, written prescrip\u00ad tions for limited amounts of Schedule II medications may be telephoned or faxed to a pharmacy, with the written prescriptions delivered within 72 hours. As many as five refills are allowed with Schedule III, IV, and V medications. The US Department ofJustice's Drug Enforcement Agency was established in 1973 to enforce controlled\u00ad substance laws and regulations, including the inves\u00ad tigation of cases of diversion. Physicians need to reg\u00ad ister with the Department of Justice before they can prescribe controlled substances. The Federation of State Medical Boards develops guidelines for state boards. One such guideline is the Model Guidelines for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain,\" which was developed in continued VOL118/NO1/ JULY20051 POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE /PRESCRIPTION DRUG USEANDABUSE 21 _ fax DRUG USE AND ABUSE, continued _ 1998 and serves as a framework for the use of opioids in the management of chronic pain. These guide\u00ad lines improve physician practice and protect legiti\u00ad mate medical use of controlled drugs. Influence of type of drug Because prescription medications are approved by the FDA, patients often consider abuse of these sub\u00ad stances safer than abuse of illicit, or \"street,\" drugs. The most commonly abused medications, which include opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and stimulants, have mood-altering effects. The drugs within these classes that are the most abused and have the greatest value for diversion (eg, hydrocodone bitartrate, and an intense effect. Long-acting or sustained-release preparations have historically been less often abused because of their slow onset of action. However, when a sustained\u00ad release preparation is crushed, dissolved, and injected, its onset of action becomes rapid and intense. Brand\u00ad name medications are more desirable among pre\u00ad scription drug abusers because they are more easily recognized as the \"real thing.\" Influence of the patient A number of factors may put a patient at risk or be clues to an increased chance of prescription drug abuse. Patients with a history of alcohol or drug prob\u00ad lems are clearly at risk when they are exposed to con\u00ad trolled substances.\" As patients become desperate to obtain medica- Table 2.

They often present with such complaints to new physicians or emergency departments, or they call their clinic after hours, when they know their primary physician is unavailable. Patients may seek out multiple physicians, claiming to be new to the area. Additional red flags are noted in table 3. Influence ofthe physician We live in a culture of \"a pill forevery ill,\" which in\u00ad cludes the expectation by both patients and physi\u00ad cians that a medication will be-prescribedat each visit. As a result, physicians may experience a conflict be\u00ad tween wanting to provide symptom relief and need\u00ad ing to set limits. Smith and Seymore\" call the physician factors as\u00ad sociated with prescription drug abuse the \"Four Ds.\" Dated refers to physicians who have not kept up with new medical knowledge and prescribe older medica\u00ad tions with higher abuse potential without regard to safe prescribing practices. Duped refers to physicians who fall for patient scams. Dishonest refers to the small number of physicians who divert controlled substances for their own proprietary gain. Disabled physicians include those who prescribe substances for themselves because of their own abuse problems and those who prescribe for family members with similar problems. Other physician characteristics include holding the view that prescribing a medication is the best response to all patient complaints (ie, \"medication mania\"), having the urge to help patients with all problems (ie, \"hypertrophied enabling\"), and lacking the ability to say no to patients (ie, \"confrontation phobia\").\" These issues increase the tendency to prescribe, the frequency of prescribing for vague Table 3.

Prevention A number of strategies can help prevent prescription drug abuse (table 4). First, physicians need to screen patients for substance use disorders before prescribing controlled substances. A full discussion of screening strategies is beyond the scope of this article, and there are excellent reviews on this topic.\":\" The CAGE questionnaire is useful in screening for alcohol prob\u00ad continued VOL 1181 NO 1 1JULY 20051 POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE 1 PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE AND ABUSE 23 _ Px DRUG USE AND ABUSE, continued tried to cutdown on your s~ould.prompt.a morethClrollgh/S assessment. ,:1 lems and can be adapted to screening for drug problems as well (see box on this page). Physicians should in\u00ad quire about problems with substances and review records of prior treating physicians, if available. When initiating a controlled prescription, physi\u00ad cians should carefully document the diagnosis, ratio\u00ad nale, and anticipated time course and symptom end point. Controlled substances should not be prescribed Table 5. Safe prescribing practices for controlled surstances Ensure thatthere isclear clinical indication forthe drug Define the therapeutic end point State your refill policy upfront Avoid prescribing multiple substances Avoid giVing rnulnple refills without office visits before the patient isexamined and a diagnosis reached, and the refill policy should be stated up front. Physi\u00ad cians need to feel empowered to say no when a re\u00ad quest for medications is inappropriate--even if it con\u00ad flicts with the natural desire to relieve the patient's suffering. Finally, prescribing any psychotropic med\u00ad ication for the physician or for the physician's family members must be avoided. Recommended prescribing practices Several guidelines for office practice can limit pre\u00ad scription drug abuse (table 5). Prescription pads should be locked away to limit patient access, and a group practice policy should 'be formulated about after\u00ad hours prescriptions of controlled substances. Telling patients about such practice rules at the time con\u00ad trolled substances are prescribed can help avoid conflicts in the future. Meticulous records need to be kept of all controlled substances that are prescribed, both during routine office hours and after hours. Use of a controlled-drug refill chart can be helpful. The advent of computer\u00ad ized medical records may make documentation of re\u00ad fills easier, especially for physicians who work at mul\u00ad tiple practice sites. Many pain management programs routinely use \"pain contracts,\" although their efficacy for limiting prescription drug abuse is not well established. To our knowledge, there are no standard or validated contracts for patients using controlled substances. Fishman and colleagues IS reviewed opioid contracts from 39 academic pain centers and found substantial diversity. If used, the contract should include clear expectations of proper medication use, methods for monitoring appropriate use (eg, pill counts, toxicol\u00ad ogy screens), and the consequences of improper use (eg, the medication may be discontinued). Because the contract is intended to improve the therapeutic alliance between patients and physicians, a less pejorative term (eg, patient agreement form) is PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE AND ABUSE I VOL 118 I NO1 I JULY2005 I POSTGRAOUATE MEDICINE 24 _ Px DRUG USE AND ABUSE, continued _ recommended. Other physicians may prefer to use an informed consent form, which educates the patient about the controlled substance and the risk of physi\u00ad cal and psychologic dependence. Examples of con\u00ad sent forms for ongoing opioid therapy can be obtained from professional organizations.\" Interventions Patients who meet the criteria for prescription drug misuseor inappropriate useneed to beeducated, ~ich includes explicit instructions about how to take med\u00ad.) ,I ~\" _ ' t . icine and dear expectations that.the medicauenwill be only for the condition for/whicH'it waspte~ :, -~_\"1 ~':.!

If abuse is detected, it is im'p_o~~~t'~p remairfpro\u00ad fessional, empathetic, and nonjudgmental. The pa\u00ad tient's be the' fOciis (eg, \"I know you have ,been: suf\u00ad fering with your back pain and I want to help you, but I am concerned that your.use of narcoticshasbe\u00ad come a problem\"). Clinical behaviors related-to the catastrophic use of controlled prescription drugs are rare but should precipitate immediate ce'ssation of prescribing (see table 1). These include commission offelonies (eg, altering a prescription, selling con\u00ad trolled drugs), intentional or unintentional over\u00ad doses, and threatening of the physician ~r staff. Use ofconsultants Experts in prescribing controlled substances and in the treatment of substance use disorders can be in\u00ad valuable when abuse is suspected: Patien~ at risk for, abuse may benefit from consultation With a pain management expert, who may be'ab1~:f~ develop an opioid-sparing strategy. Direct communication with a consultant can allow a physician to maintain his or her role as the patient's primary physician while ob\u00ad taining help from an expert. If controlled substances are to be continued, the primary care physician and consultant need to decide which one of them will be responsible for prescribing. Controlled drugs fornoncancer pain syndromes Use of controlled substances for chronic noncancer pain syndromes is controversial. A full discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this article; however, physicianswhoengageinsuchpracticesneed toclosely follow guidelines from their state medical board and keep meticulous records. Some states have strict man\u00ad dates that must be met before controlled substances can be prescribed on an ongoing basis. More extensive initialscreeningforchemicaldependency disordersand monitoring efforts are indicated. Portenov\" has outlined the issues relevant to this topic in a recent review. Conclusion Prescription drug abuse occurs in a small but signifi\u00ad cant number of patients for whom controlled sub\u00ad stances are prescribed.

Few data exist,however, to substantiate the implicationsofchronichomeless\u00ad ness for major health outcomes. Objectives: Usingdatafroma2-yearcohortofaddictedpersons,we tested whether changes in mental andphysicalhealth-relatedquality of life (HRQOL) differed according to homeless chronicity. Methods: Using self-reported homelessness, we classified subjects as chronically homeless (CH; n = 60), transitionally homeless (TRANS; n = 108), or as housed comparison subjects (HSD; n = 106). The Short Form-36 Health Survey, administered at baseline and 2 follow-ups over a period of 2 years, provided a Mental Component Summary (MCS) and a Physical Component Summary From the \"Department of Medicine, Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama and the Deep South Center on Effectiveness, Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama; the tInstitute for Health Services Research & Policy, New England Research Institutes, Watertown, Massachusetts; the tDepartment of Mathematics, Smith College, Northampton, Masschusetts; the \u00a7Data Coordinating Center, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts; the 'Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of MedicinelBoston Medical Center, and Department of Epidemiology and the Youth Alcohol Prevention Center, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts; and the [Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of MedicinelBoston Med\u00ad ical Center, and Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.

Mixed model linear regression was used to test the association between housing status, MCS, and PCS. Additional models assessed whether medical, psychiatric, addiction, and social support measures could account for HRQOL differences. Results: All subjects had low MCS scores at study entry (mean, 31.2; SD, 12.6). However, there was a significant housing status\u00ad by-time interaction (P = 0.01). At final follow-up, CH and TRANS subjects had lower adjusted MCS scores than HSD subjects (33.4, 38.8, and 43.7 for the 3 groups, respectively; all P ::;; 0.01). By contrast, housing status and PCS were not significantly associated (P = 0.19). Medical, psychiatric, addiction, and social support variables had significant associations with MCS, and their inclusion in the regression reduced the apparent effect of housing status on MCS. Conclusions: Chronic homelessness was associated with especially poor mental but not physical HRQOL over time. These findings reinforce a new typology of homelessness. Key Words: homelessness, quality of life, substance abuse, longitudinal models (Med Care 2005;43: 574-585) Contemporary policy concerning the homeless has em\u00ad braced a new typology for this population, based on the chronicity of homelessness. A statistical analysis of nightly shelter use in 2 cities identified persons with prolonged or recurrent episodes of homelessness as \"chronically\" or \"epi\u00ad sodically\" homeless, respectively, and distinguished these persons from \"transitionally homeless\" persons with infre\u00ad quent episodes. 1 Because the chronically and episodically homeless are more likely to have mental illness and addic\u00ad tion, and to account for a greater proportion of service use, some have proposed that interventions target these groups. 1,2 Recent federal, state, and metropolitan initiatives to end homelessness embrace this typOlogy.l,3-S The United States Congress appropriated $35 million to assist chronically homeless adults in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 and proposed double that amount for FY2005.6,7 Additionally, funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development prioritizes housing the chronically homeless.\" Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 Copyriqht @o Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. 574 Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 Homeless Health-Related Quality of Life The federal definition for \"chronically homeless\" (which combines Kuhn and Culhane's research categories of chronically and episodically homeless) is an unaccompanied single adult with a disabling condition, which may include addiction, who has experienced homelessness continuously for a year or more, or 4 times during a period of 3 years.\" Current understandings of chronic homelessness rely principally on an analysis of shelter and service utilization from 2 cities, where chronically homeless persons repre\u00ad sented 10% of persons experiencing homelessness but ac\u00ad counted for 50% of shelter use. I Comparative data character\u00ad izinghealthdifferencesbetween chronicallyandnonchronically homeless persons, however, are sparse. Kuhn et al used records and limited self-report data to show higher levels of mental, medical, and substance use problems among the chronically homeless compared with other homeless per\u00ad sons.1 Their study did not profile health status prospectively and did not apply standard measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). One study showed that a HRQOL measure (Short Form-12) can be applied to homeless persons, but it did not include longitudinal follow-up or consider homeless chronicity.9 If homeless chronicity does signal differences in HRQOL over time, then additional attention to the subgroup of chronically homeless adults could be important to future services research and may support targeting interventions according to homeless chronicity. To study the relationship between homeless chronicity and health status over time, we used data from a longitudinal cohort of persons with addictions to test the hypothesis that chronically homeless persons have persistently worse mental and physical HRQOL than transitionally homeless or housed persons. We also attempted to clarify the factors that might account for HRQOL in this cohort. METHODS We analyzed prospectively collected data from the Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary Care trial (HELP), which was conducted among urban alcohol- and drug-depen\u00ad dent persons. The trial intervention, a facilitated referral to primary care, resulted in 69% of the intervention group obtaining a primary care visit, versus 53% of controls (P = 0.0003).10 Study Sample The trial from which these data are drawn commenced in an urban, short-term (4-to 6-day) inpatient detoxification unit. Trial eligibility criteria included being older than 17 years of age and having an indication of alcohol, heroin, or cocaine as the substance of first or second choice. Exclusions were having a primary care provider and seeing that provider on at least 1 occasion in the preceding 2 years; being preg\u00ad nant; having a Mini-Mental State Examination'! \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins than 21; lacking fluency in either English or Spanish; having fewer than 3 contacts available to facilitate follow-up; or having plans to leave the Boston area within 24 months. Of 642 eligible subjects, 470 (73%) consented to participate. Subjects randomly assigned to the HELP intervention received a 90-minute clinical session with a physician, nurse, and social worker before leaving the detoxification unit, along with an individualized future appointment for primary medical care. Control subjects did not receive this interven\u00ad tion. Baseline interviews occurred from June 1997 to March 1999. Subjects provided information regarding demographic, social and health status, and they were sought for additional interviews at 6-month intervals over the ensuing 2 years. Subjects eligible for this prospective cohort analysis of homeless chronicity and HRQOL had completed at least 2 of 4 follow-up assessments (6, 12, 18, and/or 24 months) rep\u00ad resenting 301 of 470 (64%) subjects. From this group we excluded subjects who did not respond to questions regarding residential status or HRQOL at baseline (n = 8), did not indicate residential status at a follow-up interview (n = 4), or who did not offer complete responses for other variables in our regression analyses (n = 15), leaving 274 (58%) of the total cohort for analysis. We compared these 274 subjects to those not included (n = 196) to assess potential for selection bias. Housing Status The main predictor variable, \"housing status,\" was devised as 3 categories: chronically homeless, transitionally homeless, and housed. We used baseline and follow-up ob\u00ad servations to identify a subgroup whose residential history approximated the federal definition for chronic homeless\u00ad ness.\" The federal requirement for a \"disabling condition\" was met by addiction sufficiently severe that subjects had sought detoxification (an entry criterion to the original trial). The federal definition for chronic homelessness incorporates persons with recurrent episodes of homelessness over a period of years. At baseline and follow-up, subjects reported the number of nights in \"an overnight shelter\" and \"on the street, without shelter\" in the previous 6 months or since the last interview. The sum of street/shelter nights, adjusted to a 6-month equivalent (eg, 30 nights over the course of 12 months equaled 15 nights over 6 months), represented nights \"literally homeless'v\" per 6 months. A subject approximated the federal definition by reporting 1 or more homeless nights at all 3 assessments (most had more than 1 night homeless; see Results section). Subjects reporting no homeless nights at any interval were considered \"housed,\" whereas subjects reporting home\u00ad less nights during 1 or 2 assessments only were considered \"transitionally homeless.\" To assure that housing status was based on the same number of observations per subject, we Copyriqht (1:\\ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Successful and clinically meaningful applications of the SF-36 (or shorter variants like the MOS-SF-20 or the SF-12) to sub\u00ad stance abusers and the homeless? support its validity in this population.l'\" \" Main analytic outcomes were mental and physical HRQOL over the course of 3 assessments, as reflected in the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and the Physical Com\u00ad ponent Summary (PCS) of the SF-36. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with 50 being the norm for the US population, 10 the standard deviation, and differences of 5 considered clinically and socially meaningful.!\" We also . investigated 8 summary scales derived from the SF-36 (phys\u00ad ical function, role physical, pain, general health, vitality, social function, role-emotional, and mental health); these scales also range from 0 to 100 but have larger standard deviations and were not normed to a US population sample. This study's interest in modeling HRQOL longitudinally meant that each subject contributed 3 time-separated values for MCS, for PCS and for the 8 scales. Explanatory Variables We compared housing status groups according to a range of demographic, behavioral, and health variables mea\u00ad sured throughout the study. These variables derived from review of the health outcomes and homeless literature,2o-22 consultation with experts in health-related quality of life data, and clinical experience caring for homeless and housed per\u00ad sons with addictions. Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, racel ethnicity, marital status, and employment and were assessed at baseline. Two self-report baseline measures represented psychiatric status: ever been prescribed psychiatric medica\u00ad tion for mental illness and ever considered or attempted suicide. Medical status was specified as 2 time-varying scores: (1) count of episodic medical conditions from a list of 23 conditions (eg, pneumonia, a gunshot wound) and (2) cumulative count of chronic conditions from a list of 13 conditions\" (eg, diabetes, asthma; the full list is shown in Appendix A). Substance use severity was specified as 3 time-varying measures, the drug and alcohol composite scores of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI/drug and ASI/alcohol),24 and a validated score for addictive conse\u00ad quences.\" Social support was from validated measures of perceived support from family (PSS-Fa) and friends (pSS-Fr).26 Analysis The 3 housing status groups were compared with re\u00ad spect to the range of the aforementioned demographic, health, and social parameters. To assess the relationship between housing status and HRQOL over time, we prepared core and fully adjusted multivariable models with the HRQOL mea\u00ad sures (MCS or PCS) as outcomes. For both models, we used a general linear model for correlated data,27.28 which permits multiple observations on each subject over time while adjust\u00ad ing for the correlated nature of these data. In this approach, we modeled the outcome (eg, MCS or peS) on the basis of3 observations per subject provided by 274 subjects. For ex\u00ad ample, a subject \"observation\" at time 0 (baseline) includes both fixed (eg, age, gender, race/ethnicity) and time-varying (eg, addiction severity) characteristics as well as an indication of time (eg, time = 0 for data from the baseline interview). Subsequent observations of the same subject (at time 1 and time 2) retain the same values for fixed characteristics (eg, sex) while permitting variation in others (eg, addiction severity). The core model offered the most direct contrast of the 3 housing status groups over time, with statistical adjustment only for age, gender, race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other), time and randomization group. To further demonstrate how residential status related to HRQOL, we separately modeled each of the 8 SF-36 scales in relation to the predic\u00ad tors included in the core model. The fully adjusted model was developed to explore whether putative explanatory variables would attenuate any HRQOL differences between housing status groups in the core model. For these fully adjusted models, we added the following covariates to the care model: lifetime history of receipt of psychiatric medication for a mental condition, lifetime history of suicidal ideation or attempt, number of episodic medical conditions in the previous 6 months, cumu\u00ad lative number of chronic medical conditions, ASI/drug, ASI/ alcohol, PSS-Fa, and PSS-Fr. Because data came from a trial of facilitated referral to primary care, sensitivity analyses included repetition of the care model with terms for the interaction ofhousing status by trial arm and the care and fully adjusted models with terms for actual receipt of primary care (categorized as 0, 1, or 2 + visits) and any substance abuse treatment (from administra\u00ad tive records). The Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare the 3 groups at baseline and to compare those cohort subjects included (n = 274) and excluded (n = 196) from analysis. We used PROC MIXED for longitudinal regression models, generating model-adjusted MCS and PCS scores for each of the 3 housing status groups at baseline \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copyright @ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

We fitted all models with terms for the interaction of time-by-housing status. Contrast tests permitted post-hoc pairwise compari\u00ad sons. We used SAS statistical software version 8.2.29 RESULTS Subject Characteristics Among the 274 subjects in this analysis, 60 (22%) were chronically homeless (ie, reported homeless episodes before all research interviews, including baseline and 2 follow-ups), 106 (39%) were stably housed, and 108 (39%) were transi\u00ad tionally homeless (ie, reported homelessness before I or 2 but not all 3 interviews) during the 2-year study time frame. Among subjects who reported any homeless nights in an interval, the median number of nights in the previous 6 months was 24 (interquartile range, 6-95). As shown in Table I, chronically homeless subjects were older, less likely to be black, and less likely to be married. They had nonsig\u00ad nificantly greater numbers of acute and chronic medical conditions. They were more likely to report alcohol as sub\u00ad stance of choice, had higher alcohol but not drug severity scores, and more drug and alcohol use consequences. They also had greater psychiatric morbidity and scored lower on social support. The 3 groups did not differ with respect to the proportion randomly assigned to the trial intervention (P = 0.66). The 3 prospectively defined housing status groups dif\u00ad fered with respect to homeless experience before study entry (Table I). Chronically homeless subjects experienced a mean of 15 months homeless during the 5 years before study entry, compared with 8 months and 0.2 months for transitionally homeless and housed subjects, respectively (P < 0.001). Characteristics of Subjects Included Versus Those Excluded From Analytic Cohort To assess for selection bias, we compared the 274 subjects who formed the basis for this analysis to the 196 subjects who were not included primarily because of lack of follow-up for at least 2 follow-up interviews. The 2 groups did not differ for most comparisons and notably did not differ regarding history of homelessness at baseline or baseline SF-36 MCS or PCS scores. Of 22 other characteristics, included subjects differed by race/ethnicity (df= 3, P = om for comparison across 4 race/ethnicity groups); included subjects were somewhat more likely to be black (53% versus 37%) and less likely to be white (32% versus 43%) compared with excluded subjects. Included subjects were somewhat more likely to identify cocaine (38% versus 27%) and some\u00ad what less likely to identify alcohol (36% versus 44%) as their substance of choice (df = 2, P = 0.05). Similarly, included subjects had higher drug severity scores (mean ASI/drug 0.3 versus 0.2, P = 0.01). \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Health-Related Quality of Life At study entry, subjects had low MCS scores (unad\u00ad justed mean, 31.2; SD 12.6), regardless of housing status, and PCS scores (unadjusted mean, 47.7; SD 10.5) that were slightly lower than the US norm of 50. Baseline unadjusted MCS scores were 30.7, 30.5, and 32.3, and PCS scores were 45.8, 47.2, and 49.4 for chronically homeless, transitionally homeless and housed individuals, respectively. The core longitudinal regression models, which in\u00ad cluded only age, sex, race/ethnicity, randomization group, and time as covariates, identified a clinically and statistically significant relationship between housing status and mental but not physical HRQOL over time (Figs. I and 2). For MCS, we observed an interaction of housing status with time (F[4,265] = 3.3, P = 0.01), along with a significant main effect of housing status (df= 2, P < 0.0001). MCS scores at baseline, adjusting for other model variables, were similarly low for chronically homeless, transitionally homeless, and housed subjects (adjusted scores 27.7, 27.7, and 29.8, respec\u00ad tively, P > 0.15 for all pairwise contrasts) However, at final follow-up, the chronically homeless and transitionallyhome\u00ad less had lower adjusted scores than housed subjects (adjusted means 33.4, 38.8, and 43.7, respectively; pairwise contrasts: P < 0.0001 for chronically homeless and P = 0.005 for transitionally homeless subjects versus housed). In the core model for physical HRQOL, the main effect of housing status was not significant (df = 2, P = 0.19), and there was no interaction of housing status with time (F [4,265] = 0.41, P = 0.80; Fig. 2). Core longitudinal regression models designed to assess the relationship between housing status and the 8 individual scales from the SF-36 were broadly consistent with the results for the MCS and PCS (shown in Appendix B). Significant main effects of housing status were noted for the following scales: Role-Physical (P = 0.001), Bodily Pain (P = 0.002), General Health (P = 0.009), Vitality (P = 0.01), Social Function (P < 0.0001), Role-Emotional (P < 0.0001), and Mental Health (P < 0.0001). Chronically homeless subjects obtained poorer scores than the other groups over time on all but 1 subscale. Significant or near-significant interactions of housing status with time were observed for Physical Function (P = 0.08), Social Function (P = 0.07), Role-Emotional (P = 0.08), and Mental Health scales (P = 0.02). As reviewed above and in Table 1, the housing status groups differed in many ways. Our fully adjusted statistical model added 8 potential explanatory variables in a longitu\u00ad dinal analysis for the outcome of MCS. All 8 variables were significantly associated with MCS over time (ie, receipt of psychiatric medication, lifetime history of suicidal attempt! ideation, ASI/drug and ASI/alcohol composite scores, num\u00ad bers of episodic and chronic medical conditions, and per\u00ad ceived social support from family and friends, see Table 2).

DISCUSSION This study showed that poor mental HRQOL is the norm for individuals entering a publicly funded, inner-city detoxification unit, and that the chronically homeless (22% of this sample) had markedly worse mental HRQOL over 2 years after detoxification compared with transitionally home\u00ad less and housed subjects.

Improvement of scores after detoxification, noted in another published re\u00ad port,\" mayor may not reflect treatment effects and could be expected for any disorder marked by cyclic exacerbations. Although this study found post-treatment improvement in mental HRQOL scores, the chronically and transitionally homeless subjects failed to match the improvement observed among housed subjects and, in fact, all 3 groups differed in post-hoc contrast tests. Thus, detoxification alone did not improve the mental health problems of these homeless and addicted adults. Other published studies have demonstrated poor mental HRQOL among addicted persons/7,40,41 but these studies have not focused on the implications of homelessness and, with one exception, 16 the studies did not address change over time. Previous studies applying variants of the Short Form Health Survey to the homeless reported cross-sectional re\u00ad sults and were less able to characterize the associations between homeless chronicity and mental HRQOL,9,42 Gel\u00ad berg and Linn42 found associations between mental distress and numerous health indicators, but duration of homelessness was not statistically related to psychological distress, The discrepancy with the present report probably relates to their use of a cross-sectional sample. Cross-sectional samples may \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins overrepresent the long-term homelessf and cannot consis\u00ad tently include meaningful numbers of transitionally homeless or housed individuals. Our fully adjusted statistical model showed that several distinct vulnerabilities helped to account for inferior mental HRQOL among chronically homeless subjects. These vulner\u00ad abilities included psychiatric illness, medical problems, ad\u00ad diction severity, and poor social support. Residual confound\u00ad ing is possible because this study was neither designed nor powered to test the universe ofpotential vulnerabilities. None of the identified vulnerabilities is unexpected in the home\u00ad less31,34,42-44 and all have previously been shown to be associated with decrements in HRQOL in studies of housed persons. 14, 17,20,45 Our study underscores the complex deter\u00ad minants of HRQOL, particularly the mental component, among chronically homeless substance abusers and highlights the insufficiency of any attempt to construe the vulnerability of this population as resulting from addiction alone. The question of whether homelessness itself causes poor health is unlikely to be resolved by observational data.46 Because homelessness impedes self-care.?? a degree of cau\u00ad sality is somewhat plausible in light of reports that housing the homeless was associated with reduced subsequent health service use.\" Some limitations merit acknowledgment. This study's definition for \"chronic homelessness,\" like the federal Kuhn and of long spells) and \"episodic homelessness\" (recurrent spells).1 Future policy and research may \"lump\" categories similarly, as a reliable distinction between Kuhn's definitions for chronic and episodic home\u00ad lessness may require nightly observational data from multiple shelters for several years coupled with the assumption that a person is not homeless when he or she is not in a shelter. We suspect that differentiation of subjects with long, continuous homeless episodes could demonstrate differences even more extreme than reported here. Additionally, although paralleling the federal defini\u00ad tion, this study could incur misclassification in that home\u00ad lessness occurring 3 times during a 2-year period qualified as \"chronically homeless,\" a reflection of our sample size and study duration, whereas the federal method references 4 episodes in 3 years. On this basis, we acknowledge a degree of arbitrariness to this study's \"transitionally homeless\" des\u00ad ignation. Robust differences in homeless experience over the 5 years prior to baseline (Table I) suggest, however, that our housing status groups were quite distinct. To characterize implications of housing status, we re\u00ad lied on a sample of addicted persons without primary care. Although this could affect generalizability, 48% of currently homeless persons have experienced problems of substance abuse in the past year,32 and federally funded programs of supportive housing typically recruit clients from addiction 581 Copyright @ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited Kertesz et at Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 treatment, suggesting that these findings do speak to the chronically homeless population currently targeted for inter\u00ad vention. Our finding that homeless chronicity had a strong association with mental HRQOL, even within a population of substance abusers and after statistical adjustment for addic\u00ad tion severity, mitigates against the notion that substance abuse alone accounts for the mental health status of chroni\u00ad cally homeless individuals. Any study attempting to prospectively follow inner-city homeless and housed substance abusers is susceptible to irregular follow-up, with the resulting potential for selection bias. We believe selection bias is unlikely to account for the finding of poor HRQOL in this sample, in part because the baseline findings are consistent with a cross-sectional assess\u00ad ment from the same treatment system/\" and because included subjects did not differ significantly from excluded subjects in regard to homelessness, the outcome variables (ie, MCS and PCS), and most other characteristics, and the study retained a cohort of 60 chronically homeless persons. Thisstudy's strengthsinclude the size of its cohortand the availability of valid measures for HRQOL, as well as social support,physicalhealth, psychiatric status and addiction sever\u00ad ity. Use of longitudinal observations permitted us to take into account the reality that medical and addiction severity are not stable characteristics. Inclusion of a measure of social support incorporates the impact ofsocial issues on personalhealth,a fact emphasized in the social epidemiology Iiterature.t'' This study has implications for policymakers, clini\u00ad cians, and researchers. For policymakers, these findings high\u00ad light the extreme vulnerability of the chronically homeless when compared with other addicted persons who are transi\u00ad tionally homeless or housed, and in that way support the new federal policy distinction as meaningful. For clinicians meeting new clients in detoxification or comparable settings, a multidimensional sociomedical eval\u00ad uation of all clients may be impractical. Questions about the number and frequency of homeless episodes, however, may suggest therange ofpotential vulnerabilities. Plans for care of chronically homeless persons entering treatment facilities likely require attention to medical conditions, psychiatric comorbidity, addictive behavior, social support, and housing. The robust difference in mental health prognosis be\u00ad tween chronically as opposed to transitionally homeless in\u00ad dividuals may be relevant to health services research. Should future studies of health care access and utilization consis\u00ad tently take homeless chronicity into account? Our findings suggest an affirmative answer to this empiric question that awaits confirmation from future studies.

Roberts, MD, MPP, *tl Nicholas ScD,\u00a7 Tibor Palfai, PhD, II H. Samet, MD, MA, MPH, 1/ Naomi Freedner, MPH,1/ Nicole ** and Richard Saitz, MD, MPH1/tt Background: Preference-based utility ratings for health conditions are important components of cost-utility analyses and population burden of disease estimates. However, utility ratings for alcohol problems have not been determined. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to directly measure utility ratings for a spectrum of alcohol-related health states and to compare different methods of utility measurement. Design, Setting, and Subjects: The authors conducted a cross\u00ad sectional interview of 200 adults from a clinic and community sample. Methods: Subjects completed computerized visual analog scale (VAS), time tradeoff (TIO), and standard gamble (SG) utility measurement exercises for their current health, a blindness scenario, and for 6 alcohol-related health state scenarios presented in random order. The main outcome measures were the utility ratings, scaled from 0 to 1, and anchored by death (0) and perfect health (1).

Copyright \u00a9 2005 by Lippincott Williams ISSN: 0025-7079/05/4306\u00b70541 Results: 200 subjects were middle-aged (mean, 41 14years), 61% women, and racially diverse (48% black, 43% white). Utility ratings decreased as the severity of the alcohol-related health state increased, but differed significantly among the VAS, TTO, and SG methods within each health state. Adjusted mean (95% confidence interval) utility ratings for alcohol dependence (VAS, 0.38 [0.34\u00ad 0.41]; TIO, 0.54 [0.48-0.60]; SG, 0.68 0.53 [0.49-0.56]; TIO, 0.71 [0.65-77]; SG, 0.76 [0.71-0.81]) were significantly lower than utility ratings for non\u00ad drinking, moderate drinking, at-risk drinking, current health, and blindness. Conclusions: Utility ratings for alcohol-related health states de\u00ad creaseastheseverityofalcohol use increases. Thelowutilityratings for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are similar to those reported for other severe chronic medical conditions. Key Words: alcohol, drinking, preferences, utilities, utility assessment (Med Care 2005;43: 541-550) Cost- utility analysis (eUA) is a useful methodologic tool for comparing alternative health programs and for in\u00ad forming resource allocation decisions.\"? However, CUA has not been widely applied to alcohol prevention and treatment servicesv\" despite the large societal and healthcare burden from alcohol problems in the United States and internation\u00ad ally.6-8 This shortcoming limits decision-makers' ability to choose among multiple effective alternatives for addressing alcohol-related illness. In addition, the funding of effective alcohol-targeted programs could suffer because public-and private-sector decision-making agencies increasingly use CUA to allocate resources for new pharmaceutical agents and other services,\" One barrier to the application ofCUA to alcohol studies is the absence of data regarding societal and patient prefer\u00ad ence-based utility ratings for alcohol-related health states and outcomes. Preference-based utility ratings give a quantitative estimate of how much an individual values a health state relative to reference health states, typically death and full Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 Copyright (s., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Unauthorized reproduction of this art ide is prohibited. 541 Kraemer et al Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 health.l'' Importantly, utility ratings provide the quality-of\u00ad life adjustment weight needed to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs),II,12 the effectiveness measure recom\u00ad mended for CUA studies by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.' To date, utility ratings and QALY estimates are largely unknown for alcohol-related health states. Major \"societal cost of alcohol\" studies,6-8 interna\u00ad tional methodologic guidelines for measuring alcohol costs, 13 and the World Health Organization (WHO) Burden of Dis\u00ad ease project l4,15 either do not include utilities and preferences for alcohol-related health states or estimate them for alcohol\u00ad attributable disease (eg, cirrhosis) but not for specific alcohol use patterns or diagnoses.P\"!\" As a consequence, prior eco\u00ad nomic studies of alcohol programs have not adjusted for quality of lifel9-22 or have limited the utility assessment to loss from alcohol-related injury,23 Better estimates of utility ratings for alcohol problems could improve QALY estimates and increase the rigor of CUA for alcohol prevention and intervention services. Our specific objectives in this study were to directly measure utility ratings for a spectrum of alcohol-related health states and to compare standard methods for measuring utility ratings. We hypothesized that: 1) utility ratings would decrease as the severity of the alcohol-related health state increased; and 2) utility ratings for specific health states would differ by measurement method. METHODS Study Design, Setting, and Subjects The study was a cross-sectional, single interview of 100 primary care clinic attendees in Boston, Massachusetts, and 100 individuals from a community sample in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Subjects were 18 years or older and English\u00ad speaking. There was no alcohol use or alcohol problem requirement for inclusion in the study. In Boston, potential subjects were approached in the waiting room of the Primary Care Clinic at Boston Medical Center, an urban academic medical center. Any adult in the waiting area was eligible, including patients or individuals accompanying them. In Pittsburgh, subjects were recruited through electronic and print advertisements within the University of Pittsburgh com\u00ad munity and through advertisements in a major Pittsburgh newspaper. Research assistants conducted interviews with participating subjects in private areas of the clinic in Boston or in a private interview room in Pittsburgh. Subjects were paid for completing the 30- to 60-minute interview. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Boston Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh. Utility Rating Exercises We sequentially presented 1 actual health state and 7 hypothetical health state scenarios to subjects and asked them to imagine themselves with that health state. The actual health state was the subject's own current health. The hypo\u00ad thetical states were blindness and 6 alcohol-related health states (Figure 1): nondrinking, moderate drinking, at-risk drinking, alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, and alcohol dependence in recovery. The health state of blindness was included to introduce subjects to the utility elicitation exer\u00ad cises with a chronic disability they could comprehend and evaluate and for which published utility ratings exist,24-27 The 6 alcohol-related health states covered a broad spectrum of alcohol use behaviors and problems and were designed through a group process of drafting and revision with refer\u00ad ence to standard definitions.\" The utility rating exercises were conducted with a laptop computer using Impact 3.0, a web-based, graphic interface, utility measurement software program.29.30 Study subjects completed visual analog scale (VAS), time tradeoff (TTO), and standard gamble (Sa) exercises31-33 for each of the 8 health state scenarios. We presented the alcohol-related health state scenarios in random order to assess for potential bias from order effects. The 3 measurement methods were always performed in the same order (VAS first, TTO second, and sa third) for each health state before moving to the next health state. The VAS was a vertically oriented scale anchored by perfect health (100) at the top and death (0) at the bottom. Subjects indicated their preference for a given health state by choosing a point on the scale between perfect health and death. Subjects rated just 1 health state at a time on the VAS rather than plotting all health states simultaneously. The utility was calculated as the subject's choice divided by 100. For example, the utility was 0.75 if the subject placed a mark at 75 on the 100-unit scale. For the TTO, we asked subjects to choose between 20 years of life with the health state in question (eg, alcohol dependence) and the same or lesser amount of time in perfect health. The length of time in perfect health was alternated until the subject was indifferent (unwilling to give up addi\u00ad tional time) between X years in perfect health and 20 years with the described health state. The utility was then calcu\u00ad lated as X years divided by 20 years. For example, the utility was 0.75 if the subject was willing to give up 5 of 20 years in the described health state to have 15 years of perfect health (utility = 15 of 20 = 0.75). For sa, we asked subjects to choose between a \"sure thing\" of living with the health state in question and a \"gamble\" in which there was some chance for perfect health but also a chance of death. The relative probability of perfect health (P) and death (l-P) was alternated until the rater was indifferent between the \"sure thing\" and the \"gamble.\" The utility was calculated as the lowest probability of perfect health that the rater was willing to gamble for. For example, the utility for a healthstatewas 0.75 ifthesubject accepted thegamblewhenthe \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Lippincott Wiiliams & Wilkins. unautnonzed reproduction of tnis art ide is prohibited. 542 Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 Utility Ratings for Alcohol-Related Health States AlcohoJ-Rehated Health States for Utility Measurement I.

Other Assessments We collected demographic data on age, gender, ethnic\u00ad ity, race, education, employment, health insurance, living situation, and marital status. Medical comorbidity was as\u00ad sessed by a validated self-report instrument. 34 Health-related quality of life of the subjects over the prior 4 weeks was assessed by the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and then summarized as Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) and Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) scores.\" Health status was also measured by the EuroQoL instrument(EQ-5D), a prescored, generic health classification measure.36,37 Numeracy (numerical ability) was measured with a validated 3-item questionnaire.\" which uses word problems to: 1) estimate the number of times \"heads\" will come up from 1000 tosses of a fair coin; 2) estimate a percentage when given the denominator and numerator; and \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins FIGURE 1. Text of health state sce\u00ad narios for utility measurement exer\u00ad cises. 3) estimate the numerator when given a percentage and denominator. We asked subjects about family history of alcohol problems and assessed personal alcohol use with the IO-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIn39 and alcohol quantity-frequency questions. Subjects with an AUDIT score greater than or equal to 8 were considered to have \"at-risk drinking\" and indicated their readiness to change their alcohol use by completing the \"Readiness Lad\u00adder,\" a vertical scale anchored by \"no thought of changing\" at o and \"taking action to change\" at 10. A full diagnostic assessment to assess alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence in our subjects was beyond the scope of this study and would have added to the interview burden. Analysis The main outcomes for analysis were the measured utility ratings, scaled continuously from 0 to I, and anchored by death at 0 and perfect health at I. Because the utility ratings were not normally distributed either before or after logarithmic transformation, we used both parametric (t tests) Copvriqht Uppincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. 543 Kraemer et at Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 and nonparametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis tests) to test for statistically significant differences in utility ratings between health states and between utility measurement methods. We report both medians and means for the utility ratings to give the reader an appreciation for the distribution of the data. Because tests of significance for differences between utility ratings were similar regardless of whether t tests or nonpara\u00ad metric tests were used, we report P values for the means only and assumed normality for the modeling strategy. We used the general linear model for correlated da\u00ad ta40,41 to test for the effects of health state scenario on the utility rating. This type of regression analysis was necessary because the utility ratings were not independent observations but instead were correlated data with multiple observations per subject. The general linear model accommodated the correlated outcomes, allowed us to explore and control for other factors related to utility ratings, and provided flexibility in examining within and between health state effects, within and between subject group effects, and within and between utility measurement method effects. In the general linear models, the utility ratings for the alcohol-related health states of each subject were treated as repeated-measures dependent variables. Because preliminary analyses indicated a significant interaction between the health state scenarios and utility measurement method, models were fit separately for each utility measurement method and ad\u00ad justed for study site, gender, race, age, education, numeracy, health status, alcohol use, and the order in which the scenario was presented to the subject. Model covariates included variables that differed significantly between the 2 study sites. We used the general linear models for correlated data to generate parameter estimates and significance levels for the difference in utility rating between the reference state (non\u00ad drinking) and each of the 5 remaining alcohol-related health states. We generated predicted mean utility values and 95% confidence intervals for each of the 6 alcohol-related health states by substituting the mean value for each covariate into the regression equations and predicting the mean outcomes. This was done with the LSMEANS procedure in SAS. All analyses were performed with SAS software. All P values were 2-tailed and considered significant at P < 0.05. RESULTS Subject Characteristics The 200 subjects were middle-aged (mean, 41 \u00b1 14 years; range, 18- 87 years), 61% women, racially diverse (48% black, 43% white), and a majority (63%) had at least a high school education (see Table I). Only 4% had an annual income greater than $40,000 per year. Subjects reported an average alcohol intake of 5.9 standard drinks per week, but the standard deviation was large (25 drinks) and 30% re\u00ad ported at least I binge (5 or more drinks on I occasion for men; 4 or more drinks on I occasion for women) in the 4 weeks before the interview. Forty-six (23%) subjects met criteria for at-risk drinking (defined as an AUDIT score 2':8) and 131 (66%) subjects had a family history of alcohol problems. Subjects from the primary care clinic sample were significantly older, more often a racial minority, and oflower socioeconomic status, health status, and numeracy than the community sample. The numeracy of the overall sample was poor: 58 (29%) answered 0 on questions correctly, 66 (33%) answered I correctly, 47 (24%) answered 2 correctly, and only 28 (14%) answered all 3 correctly. Clinic sample sub\u00ad jects reported significantly less binge alcohol behavior and more readiness to change alcohol use than the community sample subjects. Utility Ratings Mean and median utility ratings for all 8 health state scenarios are shown in Table 2. For each measurement method, utility ratings decreased as the severity of the alcohol problem progressed from nondrinking to alcohol depen\u00ad dence. Mean and median VAS and mean TTO and SG utility ratings dropped immediately after the nondrinking health state, whereas TTO and SG median utility ratings were similar for nondrinking, moderate drinking, and at-risk drink\u00ad ing before decreasing for alcohol abuse and alcohol depen\u00ad dence. The utility ratings for the alcohol dependence in recovery health state tended to be similar to the ratings for at-risk drinking. In addition, the utility ratings for the blind\u00ad ness health state scenario were similar to published utilities for blindness (ranges: VAS 0.34-0.85, TTO 0.37-0.68, SG 0.41_0.80)24-27 but were significantly higher than the utility ratings for alcohol dependence (P < 0.0001for each ofVAS, TTO, and SG) and similar to those for alcohol abuse (P > 0.05 for each of VAS, TTO, and SG). Utility ratings for the alcohol-related health states did not differ significantly be\u00ad tween subjects with and without at-risk drinking (AUDIT 2':8)behavior or between subjects with and without a family history of alcohol problems. The 3 utility measurement meth\u00ad ods yielded different utility ratings. Nearly all pairwise com\u00ad parisons of means and medians between VAS, TTO, and SG utility ratings were significant at the P < 0.05 level for each health state (Table 2). To explore the relationship of numeracy to utility rat\u00ad ings, we calculated the mean VAS, TTO, and SG utility estimates for each strata of numeracy (0 correct, I correct, 2 correct, or 3 correct) for 2 of the health states (moderate drinking and alcohol dependence). Utilities tended to be lower for those with poor numeracy, but this trend was not consistent across utility elicitation methods and the 2 health states. In addition, we assessed how respondents in 2 drinking groups, moderate drinkers (classified as drinks per week >0 and AUDIT <8; n = 80) and alcohol dependence (classified as AUDIT 2':20; n = 10), compared his or her own health \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Gopyriqllt lippincott Williams &: Wilkins Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. 544 Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 Utility Ratings for Alcohol-Related Health States TABLE 1.

In general, no significant differences between subjects' actual health state and the corresponding hypothetical state were observed. The exceptions were moderate drinkers who rated their own health as lower (mean utility difference of -0.07, P = 0.006 on paired t test) on VAS and subjects with alcohol depen\u00ad dence who rated their own health as higher (mean utility difference +0.175, P = 0.044) on SG. General Linear Models Results of the 3 general linear models, I for each utility measurement method, are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3. Figure 2 depicts estimated means and 95% confidence inter\u00ad vals of utility ratings for the 6 alcohol-related health states derived from the models and adjusted for multiple covariates. The alcohol-related health state scenario was independently associated (P < 0.001) with utility ratings for each measure\u00ad ment method. For each utility measurement method, contrasts in estimated utility ratings between adjacent alcohol-related health states (eg, nondrinking versus moderate drinking, moderate drinking versus at-risk drinking, at-risk drinking versus alcohol abuse, and alcohol abuse versus alcohol de\u00ad pendence) were significant at P < 0.001 except for the contrasts of moderate drinking versus at-risk drinking (VAS, P = 0.49; TTO, P = 0.56; SG, P = 0.69). For each utility measurement method, mean utility ratings were slightly, but significantly, lower for any given alcohol\u00ad related scenario if the scenario was presented first (estimated mean utility difference compared with presentation in the sixth [last] position: VAS, -0.051, P < 0.001; ITO, -0.048, P = 0.02; SG, -0.034, P = 0.026). The clinic sample subjects provided minimally, but significantly, lower utility ratings (es\u00ad timated utility difference compared with Pittsburgh site: -0.06, P = 0.009) for the SG method only. Subjects' mental and physical health status, as summarized by the MCS-12 and PCS-12, were positively correlated with utility ratings for the VAS (0.01 utility increase per lO-unit increase in MCS-12, P = 0.047; 0.02 utility increase per 10-unit increase in PCS-12, P = 0.003) but not for ITO or SG. Subjects' current drinking habits, age, gender, race, education, and numeracy were not indepen\u00ad dent correlates of the utility ratings for alcohol-related health states (all P values> 0.05). \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Cocvrlcnt LIppincott Williams & Wilkins.

However, the utility rating differences between numeracy categories were significantly different for VAS but not for ITO and SG. In general linear models stratified by study site, subjects from Boston tended to rate the health states lower for each utility elicitation method. However, the only significant differences between sites were for at-risk drinking in the VAS and ITO models and for moderate drinking, at-risk drinking, and alcohol abuse in the SG model. \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins DISCUSSION Our findings suggest utility ratings for a spectrum of alcohol-related health states can be estimated with standard utility measurement methods. The observed utility ratings ap\u00ad propriately decreased as the severity ofthe alcohol-related health states increased. In fact, utility ratings for the 2 most severe alcohol-related scenarios, alcohol abuse and alcohol depen\u00ad dence, were similar or lower than the utility ratings for the blindness scenario and similar to reported utility ratings for other severe chronic diseases such as major depression (utility = 0.44, by SG), congestive heart failure (utility = 0.46, by Health Utility Index), and moderate-severe osteoarthritis of the hip (utility = 0.50, by SG).24 We found no consistent modifiers of utility ratings other than severity of the health state and the order of scenario presentation. Surprisingly, subjects' sociodemographic characteristics, personal alcohol use, and family history of alco\u00ad hol problems did not independently correlate with the utility ratings. As expected, the VAS, ITO, and SG methods of measurement yielded different utility ratings for the alcohol\u00ad related health states.32,42.43 Few prior studies have attempted to estimate or directly measure utility ratings for alcohol disorders. The World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease Project44,45 used sec\u00ad ondary data and expert opinion to assign disability weights to 22 indicator conditions through person tradeoff valuation and then extrapolated to other conditions. By extrapolation, \"alcohol use disorders\" received a disability weight of 0.180 (in which 0 = perfect health and I = death), equivalent to a utility of 0.82 (1-0.18 = 0.82). In recent work describing a societal utility index for substance abuse,\" health state descriptions for alcohol and drug use states were presented to 143 respondents (primarily white, college-educated women who worked in substance abuse clinics) for ITO exercises. On average, respondents were will\u00ad ing to trade 2.34 years out of 10 years of life left (equivalent to autility of0.766) to avoid alcohol problems. Although the utility ratings for \"alcohol use disorders\" from these prior studies were higher than our observed values for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, the utility raters and breadth of alcohol-related health states in both prior studies were quite different from our study. To our knowledge, no prior studies have reported estimates of utility ratings for moderate drinking behaviors and at-risk drinking. One surprising result from our study is the relatively low utility assessed to at-risk drinking, a sce\u00ad nario in which no significant adverse consequences have occurred. It is possible some subjects were imagining the potential future consequences (eg, car crash, missed work, hangover, medical problem) of the at-risk drinking scenario. In addition, stigma, negative perceptions, and religious be\u00ad liefs about alcohol consumption may play a role in the low utility values for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence and explain why some participants gave low utility ratings to Copyriqht LippincottV'/illiams & Wflkins, Unauthorized reproduction of tnis article is prohibited. 547 Kraemer et al Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 TABLE 3.

This will be an important area for future research. As expected, utility ratings for the alcohol-related health states differed significantly among the VAS, TTO, and SG measurement methods. Because the cognitive tasks re\u00ad quired for each measurement method are different and the VAS requires no tradeoff, VAS values tend to be lower than TTO or SG valuations.\"? Although we cannot state defini\u00ad tively which utility value (VAS versus TTO versus SG) is the most appropriate for a specific alcohol-related health state, a reasonable and conservative approach is to use our SG estimates for current modeling efforts. The SG estimates are reasonable because SG is based directly on the fundamental axioms of utility theory,48 and they have the least risk of overstating the disutility of alcohol problems. For alcohol dependence, an alternative approach is to use the utility difference between our alcohol dependence and alcohol de\u00ad pendence in recovery health states and to model this as the \"utility loss\" to the condition. Our study has several limitations. First, the subjects did not represent a true random societal sample. Half of the subjects were a convenience sample recruited from the pri\u00ad mary care clinic waiting room at an urban academic hospital and the other half were self-selected individuals from the community responding to an advertisement. We pooled the clinic and community samples because neither sample was a random sample, which needed to be kept pure. The diversity of the pooled sample ensured a wide range of preferences and perspectives, which we felt was important for this initial work. Future research should focus on repeating our mea\u00ad sures in a random societal sample. Second, the poor numeric ability of our sample is a potential threat to the validity of the measured utility ratings. However, numeracy was not a significant influence on utility rating in our general linear models. Further analyses indicated a tendency for lower utility ratings from those with low numeracy but, interestingly, this was most pronounced for VAS, the technique thought to require the least amount of numeric ability. Third, all alcohol-related health states were presented as hypothetical scenarios to approximate \"societal\" values. We chose this approach because CVA models using a societal perspective are our first planned applications for the utility estimates. In general, the societal perspective is the proper perspective to take when societal resources must be allocated within budget constraints to maximize utility.' Fourth, we did not assess subsets of disease severity within the diagnoses of alcohol abuse and alcohol depen\u00ad dence. Certainly, scenarios depicting a different level of severity for each of these may have yielded different utility ratings. In addition, the health state scenarios for alcohol abuse and dependence did not include text lauding the posi\u00ad tive or enjoyable aspects of alcohol use.49 We do not know if \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins inclusion of positive language would have yielded higher utility ratings. Lastly, we did not have subjects perform a simple rank ordering, by preference, of the health states before the utility exercises began. This prevented consistency checks of the rank ordering of health states by each utility measurement method'? and prevented exploration of whether the graduated nature of the alcohol-related health states forced subjects to rate some health states (eg, nondrinking and moderate drink\u00ad ing) farther apart than their true preferences. We believe the random presentation order of the alcohol-related health states made this latter possibility less likely. Despite these limitations, we believe our results repre\u00ad sent an important step in developing utility weights for a broad spectrum of alcohol use behaviors and consequences and have practical implications for future alcohol treatment and policy changes. Such utility weights will be useful for CVA models that address alcohol prevention and treatment services and for population burden of disease calculations. For example, the low ratings we observed for at-risk drinking, alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependence suggest that failure to adjust for these \"disutilities\" in CVA models may underesti\u00ad mate the benefit of alcohol prevention and treatment pro\u00ad grams, and potentially result in the underutilization and/or under-funding of such programs. In addition, our observed low utilities for the alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence health states suggest the true global burden of alcohol use disorders may be higher than the previously derived 58.3 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the WHO Global Burden of Disease project \" and support argu\u00ad ments for greater resource allocation to alcohol-related pro\u00ad grams. In summary, alcohol-related health state utility rat\u00ad ings reflect the severity of alcohol use disorders and should be used in the future to estimate the effectiveness of alcohol treatment and prevention services. Future research in this area should focus on the utility rating differences among individuals with and without specific alcohol diag\u00ad noses, the impact of individuals' alcohol problems on the utility of their significant others (eg, spouse, partner, or close family member, coworkers), and the role of negative perceptions and stigma.

USA Received 14 May 2004; received in revised form 3 January 2005; accepted 3 January 2005 Abstract Purpose: Russia has high per capita alcohol consumption and an injection-drug-use-driven HIY epidemic. However, the role of alcohol in the spread of HIY infection in Russia is largely unexplored. Thus, we assessed recent alcohol use and associated my risk behaviors among Hlv-infected persons in St. Petersburg, Russia. Methods: We recruited Hlv-infected hospitalized patients from the Botkin Infectious Disease Hospital between June 2001 and March 2002. Interviewers assessed alcohol and drug use with the addiction severity index (ASI) and sex- and drug-risk behaviors with the risk assessment battery (RAB).Lifetime abuseor dependence diagnosesfor alcohol anddrugs wereestablished by a physicianwith addiction medicine training. Results: Among 201 subjects, diagnoses of abuse or dependence (AB/DEP) were common: 9% (191201) had drug ABIDEP;and 4% (91201) had no diagnosis of alcohol or drug ABIDEP. Sex- and drug-risk behaviors varied significantly by substance use diagnosis. Subjects with any alcohol ABIDEP had higher sex-risk RAB scores than those with drug only ABIDEP (6.1 versus 3.9, p <.0001). Among subjects with any diagnosis of drug AB/DEP,having in addition an alcohol diagnosis was associated with unclean needle use in the last six months (33% (26nS) versus 21% (20/95), p =O.OS). Conclusions: Lifetime alcohol diagnoses of abuse or dependence were present in nearly one-half of hospitalized HIY-infectedpatients in St. Petersburg, Russia and were associated with significantly higher sex-risk behaviors and borderline significantly higher drug-risk behaviors. As my infection spreads rapidly in Russia and Eastern Europe, these data support the need for my risk-reduction interventions in alcohol abusing populations and raise the potential of benefit by addressing alcohol use in Hlv-infected populations. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction Over the past fiveyears, reports of HIV infection in Russia have increased dramatically, with an estimated one million Corresponding author. Ltd. All rights reserved. doi: 1O. IOI6/j.drugalcdep.2005.01.015 people already infected (Hamers and Downs, 2003). This represents an approximate lO-fold increase from 130,000 infections reported in 1999 (Grisin and Wallander, 2002; Stephenson, 2000). According to forecasts, there may be approximately five million HIV-infected individuals in the Russian Federation by 2007 (Anonymous, 2002). The ma\u00ad jority of HIV infection in Russia is currently among injec\u00ad252 E.M. Krupitsky et al.1 Drug and Alcohol Dependence 79 (2005) 251-256 tion drug users (lDUs) (Dehne et aI., 2000; Krupitsky et aI., 2004). Injection drug use is increasingly common in Russia. The number of drug-dependent persons rose IO-fold from 1986 to 1998 and exceeded two million people (Koshkina, 2000). However, even more common than drug use in Russia is alco\u00ad hol consumption. In fact, in Russia, alcohol consumption per capita is among the highest in the world, particularly for men (Nemtsov, 2000). Average alcohol consumption for Russian men has increased from 29 g per day in 1992 to 45 g per day in 2002 (Zohoori et aI., 2003). Estimates of lifetime preva\u00ad lence of alcohol dependence in the former Soviet Union may be as high as 69% in men (Pakriev et aI., 1998) versus 18% (Grant, 1997) in US men. Alcohol use has been shown to impact HN infection with increased transmission risk and possible disease progression. Several studies have demonstrated that people with heavy al\u00ad cohol use tend to engage in riskier behaviors, such as sex with multiple partners, unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse, and injection drug use (Bagnall et aI., 1990; Fenaughty and Fisher, 1998; Halpern-Felsher et al., 1996). In Asia, drink\u00ad ing alcohol is often associated with the high-risk behavior of engaging in sex, usually unprotected, with a commercial sex worker (Fordham, 1995; Gibney et al., 2003; Kim et al., 1998; MacQueen et al., 1996; Poudel et al., 2004; Wee et al., 2004). In the United States, my infection has been examined in substance abuse treatment settings where its prevalence is increased among alcohol-dependent persons (Avins et al., 1994;Mahleretal., 1994).Alcoholabusein combination with other drug use may lead to even more frequent occurrences of risky sex- and drug-use behaviors. Increased alcohol con\u00ad sumption is associated with sexual myrisk-taking behavior among female drug users (Rees et al., 2001). Among IDUs, alcohol use is associated with increased sex-risk behavior (Steinetal.,2001).Specifically,among HN-infected individ\u00ad uals with a history of alcohol problems, at-risk drinking was associated with inconsistent condom use among active IDUs (Ehrenstein et aI., 2004). There are mixed results concerning the impact of alcohol use on risky injection drug behavior (Rees et aI., 200 1; Stein et aI., 2000). Reasons underlying the association between alcohol use and high-risk behaviors for my have been described and include decreased inhibitions and risk perception (Cooper, 2002; Fromme et aI., 1999), belief that alcohol enhances sexual arousal (George et aI., 2000), deliberate use of alcohol to excuse high-risk behavior (Dermen et aI., 1998), and the indirect association that bars are common places to meet potential sexual partners (Purcell et aI., 2001). Further, recent reports in animals raise the possibility that alcohol consumption plays a permissive role for HIY repli\u00ad cation, possibly resulting in higher HIY viral loads which would be associated with higher transmission risk (Stoltz et al., 2002). Finally, among Hlv-infected patients with a history of alcohol problems who are receiving antiretroviral treatment, alcohol consumption was associated with higher HIY viral loads and lower CD4 cell counts, markers of HIV disease progression (Samet et aI., 2003). In light of Russia's epidemic spread of HIY, high alcohol consumption, and ongoing injection drug use, we sought to clarify if alcohol use among HIY-infected Russians exacer\u00ad bated unsafe sex-and drug-use behaviors. Thus, we examined HIY risk behaviors and alcohol and drug use among hospi\u00ad talized HIY-infected persons in St. Petersburg, Russia. 2. Methods 2.J. Study design .. For 201 HlV-infected inpatients at an infectious disease hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, researchers administered a survey and abstracted data from medical records in order to assess drug and alcohol use and severity, HIY risk behav\u00ad iors, lifetime substance abuse, and dependence diagnoses. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Boston Medical Center and St. Petersburg Pavlov State Medical University. 2.2. Data collection Data were collected between June 2001 and March 2002 at the Botkin Infectious Disease (ID) Hospital, an inpatient facility founded in 1882 for adult patients with infectious dis\u00ad eases in St. Petersburg, Russia. The 1200-bed hospital, staffed primarily by ID specialists, is the largest inpatient facility of its kind in Northwest Russia and is divided into departments (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and food-borne diseases) consist\u00ad ing of 40-50 beds each. It also has a surgery and maternity ward serving infected persons. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Botkin Hospital was the only inpatient site for HN-infected individuals in St. Petersburg. All individuals admitted to the three departments that care for HN-infected patients were eligible and asked to join the study. Most of the patients from these departments were admitted for initial presentation or exacerbations of viral hepatitis; 84% (201/240) of the ap\u00ad proached patients agreed to participate. Study participants provided written informed consent prior to data collection. An interviewer assessed subjects in person using a standard\u00ad ized instrument to ascertain information including the follow\u00ad ing: demographics, my risk behaviors, alcohol consump\u00ad tion, and addiction severity. Diagnoses of lifetime alcohol or drug abuse or dependence were made through clinical assess\u00ad ment. Laboratory tests performed as part of clinical care were recorded. We obtained available serology results, liver func\u00ad tion tests, and history of disease from medical records. All other data collected on subjects were obtained specifically for research purposes. 2.3. Measures ofsubstance use and substance abuse and dependence Within th~ ~~~}'Neek<:>finpati~lltstay, subjects were eval\u00ad uated forlifetiIIlealcohol\u00b7 ga1:>Use or dependence. Clin\u00ad253 E.M. Krupitsky et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 79 (2005) 251-256 ical diagnoses were made via assessment by an infectious disease specialist with training in addiction medicine (Maria Kuznetsova, MD) using criteria from the diagnostic and sta\u00ad tistical manual of mental disorders-fourth edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Additionally, in\u00ad terviewer assessment included standardized questions on al\u00ad cohol and heroin use including the Michigan alcohol screen\u00ad ing test (MAST)(Selzer, 1971), the time line follow back (TI.FB) assessment (Sobell and Sobell, 1992), the addiction severity index (ASI) (McLellan et al., 1992), and the risk as\u00ad sessment battery (RAB) (Navaline et aI., 1994), instruments .. with well-documented reliability and validity. For purposes of analysis, substance use diagnoses ofabuse and dependence were combined resulting in four groups: alcohol only, alcohol and drug, drug only, and no diagnosis. 2.4. Primary outcome measure: HIV sex-and drug-risk behaviors Estimates of sex- and drug-risk behaviors were derived from the risk assessment battery (RAB) (Navaline et aI., 1994). This instrument sums the scores for individual items, for totals of 35 (sex-risk) and 25 (drug-risk). Scores are de\u00ad rived for both sex- and drug-risk behaviors via a series of questions including inquiries about numbers of sexual part\u00ad ners, usage of condoms, and sharing of needles. Interviews were conducted in Russian. Standard survey elements already translated into Russian were used (i.e., MAST, ASI, TI.FB, RAB). Other questions were translated from English to Russian, back-translated into English to check for accuracy, and then corrected. 2.5. Analysis Fisher's exact (for categorical outcomes) and Kruskal\u00ad Wallis tests (for continuous outcomes) were used to com\u00ad pare subject substance use diagnosis with subject character\u00ad istics including risk behaviors for HIV infection. Reported p-values are two-tailed, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A multivariable linear re\u00ad gression was fit to predict RAB sex-risk subscale scores, as a function of diagnosis group, gender, and age. A logistic re\u00ad gression model, also controlling for gender and age, was fit to predict any needle sharing, for subjects with any drug di\u00ad agnosis and injection use in the past six months. All analyses were carried out using SAS/STATversion 8.2 (SAS Institute, 2001). 3. Results 3.1. Subject characteristics The characteristics of the 201 HIV-infected subjects are outlined in Table 1. Three-fifths (62%) were male, with a mean age of 27 years. The most common lifetime substance use diagnosis of abuse or dependence was drug only (47%), alcohol and drug (39%), and alcohol only (9%). Nine sub\u00ad jects (4%) had no substance use diagnosis. Assessments of past 30-day use of alcohol among those with any alcohol di\u00ad agnosis (n = 97) revealed a mean of 28 g/day, the equivalent of approximately 2.5 standard drinks/day. 3.2. Risk behaviors Risk assessments yielded a sex-risk subscale mean score of 5.0 and a drug-risk subscale score of 4.3. More than half (103/201) of all subjects reported greater than two sex\u00ad ual partners in the past six months, and 66% (1321201) re\u00ad ported inconsistent condom use, with 23% (471201) of all subjects reporting condom use none of the time. Forty-seven percent (941201) of all subjects reported injecting drugs in the last six months with 23% (461201) reporting using oth\u00ad ers' needles and 35% (71/201) reporting sharing their own needles. Results from data stratified by lifetime substance use di\u00ad agnosis are displayed in Table 2. Notable among the results are significant differences among substance abuse diagnos\u00ad tic groups for age (p <0.0001), current work (p = 0.002) and antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (p <0.000 1). An unadjusted comparison between subjects with any di\u00ad agnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence (i.e., alcohol only combined with alcohol and drug subjects) and those with only drug diagnoses reveals significantly higher sex-risk subscale scores (6.1 versus 3.9,p<0.0001).

Diagnosis group was a signif\u00ad icant predictor of RAB sex-risk scores (F(3,195) = 11.36, p<O.OOOI). There was a significant difference between the predicted RAB sex-risk subscale score for subjects with any alcohol diagnosis compared to those with drug-only diag\u00ad noses (F (1,195) =22.1, p< .0001). Additionally, in an assessment of use of unclean needles, a comparison between drug users with alcohol diagnoses (26n8, 33%) and drug users without (20/95, 21%) indicated that more subjects with alcohol diagnoses used unclean nee\u00ad dles in the last six months (p = 0.08). While controlling for sex, age, and diagnosis (drug and alcohol diagnosis versus drug-only diagnosis, 1 df), multivariate logistic regression in\u00ad dicated that younger age was a significant predictor of needle sharing (OR= 1.07,95% CI= 1.01-1.15 per year, p=0.03); gender was not a significant predictor (OR for females rel\u00ad ative to males = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.4-1.9). Diagnosis of drug and alcohol versus drug-only diagnosis was associated with increased odds of any sharing (OR= 2.5,95% CI= 1.2-5.1, p=0.02). 3.3. Laboratory data Among 123 subjects with recorded serology test results, 47% (58) were hepatitis B surface antigen positive. When stratified by lifetime substance use diagnoses of abuse or de\u00ad pendence, positive results for hepatitis only, alcohol and drug, drug-only and no-diagnosis groups, respectively. Among 200 subjects with available data, hepatitis C anti\u00ad bodies were detected in 93% (186). When stratified by sub\u00ad stance use diagnoses, hepatitis C antibodies were detected in 74% (14119),95% (73n7), 97% (92/95) and drug, drug-only and no-diagnosis groups, respectively. 4, Discussion Among hospitalized HIV-infected patients in Russia, re\u00ad ports of alcohol use and high-risk behaviors for HIV trans\u00ad mission are common. While a majority of subjects were di\u00ad agnosed with drug abuse or dependence, almost half (48%) of all subjects had lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse or dependence. Further, a majority of the total population re\u00ad ported inconsistent condom use and/or having two or more sexual partners in the last six months. This extent of risky sex is particularly disturbing in that for women, sex-risk be\u00ad havior may be more significant to HIV seroconversion than drug-risk behavior (Strathdee et al., 2001). Strathdee et al. (2001) also found that among female IDUs sex risks (e.g., recent SID and sex trade) were more commonly associated 255 E.M. Krupitsky et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 79 (2005) 251-256 with HIV seroconversion than drug-related risk behaviors. Forty-seven percent of all subjects reported injecting drugs in the last six months, and almost half of these reported us\u00ad ing others' needles. The marked substance abuse and risk behaviors in this population of HIV-infected individuals are alarming. The finding of an association between HIV risk behav\u00ad iors and an alcohol abuse or dependence diagnosis is no\u00ad table in that Russia's HIV epidemic has been nearly to\u00ad tally attributed to injection drug use (Dehne et aI., 2000). We found that sex-risk was greater, as reflected in the RAB sex-risk subscores, with diagnoses of alcohol abuse or de\u00ad pendence. Also, an alcohol diagnosis was associated with increased odds of needle sharing. These findings are of par\u00ad ticular importance given the fact that in Russia alcohol use is widespread, alcohol dependence is common, and HIV in\u00ad fection is epidemic. The small number of subjects diagnosed with \"alcohol only\" lifetime abuse or dependence is unique in two ways. First, these subjects were significantly older than the subjects with other substance use diagnoses. Sec\u00ad ond, co-infection with hepatitis C was common among a surprising number (74%) of alcohol-only subjects. In fact, co-infection with hepatitis B and, particularly C, was com\u00ad mon in the entire cohort. This abnormal prevalence is likely a result of selection bias as reasons for hospitalization in\u00ad cluded acute hepatitis. Because the interview did not assess whether or not subjects ever used injection drugs, we can\u00ad not speculate on the means of transmission of hepatitis C to those with alcohol-only diagnoses. This may be a limitation of these data and implicate the need for further study of this population. Our study has other noteworthy limitations. These data represent a cross-sectional perspective of the substance abuse and risk behaviors of a population of HIV-infected inpatients with substantial co-morbidity. Thus, inferences that may be drawn regarding the influence of alcohol on HIV risk be\u00ad haviors in general populations are limited. However, as ill\u00ad ness severity is typically greater in hospitalized patients, and sicker patients have been shown to have less drug- and sex\u00ad risk behaviors (Collins et aI., 2001) use of such patients is likely to provide a conservative estimate of HIV risk. Additionally, because our population has already been in\u00ad fected with mv, our data cannot address the relationship between HIV infection and use of alcohol or drugs. Fur\u00ad ther, the risk behaviors of those already infected with HIV may differ from those among non-infected individuals in Russia. Despite these limitations, our data show that lifetime diag\u00ad noses of alcohol abuse or dependence were present in nearly one-half of hospitalized HIV-infected patients in St. Peters\u00ad burg, Russia and were associated with significantly higher sex-risk behaviors and a trend toward higher drug-risk be\u00ad haviors. As HIV spreads rapidly in Russia and Eastern Eu\u00ad rope, addressing alcohol use in HIV-infected persons holds potential to decrease the transmission of HIV by lowering the prevalence of high sex-and drug-risk behaviors.

SAMET1,3 1Clinical Addictions Research and Education Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, 2Department of Mathematics, Smith College, Northampton, MA, and 3Department ofSocial and Behavioral Sciences, Boston University School ofPublicHealth, Boston, USA Abstract We examined interpersonal violence and its association with health care utilization and substance use severity among a cohort of 349 HIV-infected men and women with histories of alcohol problems assessed biannually up to 36 months. Data included demographics, lifetime interpersonal violence histories, age at first violence exposure, recent violence (prior six months), substance use severity and health care utilization (ambulatory visits, Emergency Department (ED) visits, hospitalizations) and adherence to HIV medication. Kaplan-Meier survival curves estimated the proportion of subjects experiencing recent violence. Generalized estimating equation regression models evaluated the relationship between recent violence, utilization and substance use severity over time, controlling for demographics, CD4 counts and depressive symptoms. Subject characteristics included: 79% male; mean age 41 years; 44% black, 33% white and 23% other. Eighty percent of subjects reported lifetime interpersonal violence: 40% physical violence alone, and 40% sexual violence with or without physical violence. First violence occurred prior to age 13 in 46%. Twenty-four (41%) of subjects reported recent violence by 24 and 36 months, respectively. In multivariate analyses, recent violence was associated with more ambulatory visits, ED visits and hospitalizations and worse substance use severity, but not medication adherence. Due to the high incidence and associated increased health care services utilization, violence prevention interventions should be considered for HIV-infected patients with a history of alcohol problems. Introduction Interpersonal violence is intentional use of force (or threat of force), and includes both physical and sexual violence. It is experienced by a majority of people in the United States at some point in their lives. A survey of 16,000 men and women found that 52% of women and 66% of men had experienced physical assault at some point in their lives, while 18% of women and 3% of men had experienced rape (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000). Studies of the prevalence of childhood sexual violence, including national and local probability samples, Correspondence: Jane Liebschutz, MD MPH, Boston Medical Center, 91 East Concord Street, Suite 200 Boston, MA 02118, USA. Tel: +1 Francis Group Ltd DOl: 10.1080/09540120512331314358 Violence and health care utilization 567 have shown that approximately 25% of adult women and 16% of adult men report childhood violence (johnsen & Harlow, 1996). Among a variety of populations studied, individuals who report lifetime histories of interpersonal violence are more likely to report a number of associated findings compared to those who do not report such histories. These findings include: increased somatic symptoms, increased medical illnesses, worse self-rated health status, more sexually transmitted diseases, more substance use and abuse, increased mental illness, increased health care utilization (ED visits and hospitalizations) and more subsequent violence (Bergman et al., 1992; Coker et al., 2000, 2002; Eisenman et al., et al., 1998; Frayne et al., 1999; Johnsen & Harlow, 1996; Kilpatrick et al., al., 1991; Liebschutz al., 2002; Liebschutz et al., 1997, 2000, 2003; Windle, 1994). Although most of these studies focused on female victims of interpersonal violence, a few extended these findings to men (Clark et al., 2001; Eisenman et al., 2003; Liebschutz et al., 2002). A consistent feature of most of these studies is the cross-sectional association of lifetime history of interpersonal violence with worse consequences, physical health, mental health and risky behaviors (Felitti et al., 1998; Liebschutz 1998; Plichta, 1992; Zierler et al., 1991). Only one longitudinal study of 3,006 women assessed over two years found that exposure to violence during this period was associated with an increase in substance use and abuse (Kilpatrick et al., 1997). In addition, substance abuse and high risk sexual behaviors confer an increased risk of experiencing subsequent interpersonal violence (Clark et al., 2001; Kilpatrick et al., 1997; Liebschutz et al., 2002). HIV-infected individuals with drug abuse and risky sexual behaviors are at particularly high risk for having experienced violence. The prevalence and consequences ofviolence exposure have been studied most carefully among HIV-infected women and less so among HIV-infected men. Among HIV-infected women, 66-68% report physical and 32-46% sexual violence as adults; 41 % report physical and 31-41 % sexual violence as children; and 21-28% report interpersonal violence in the prior year (Cohen et al., 2000; Gielen et al., 2000; Kimerling et al., 1999; Morrill et al., 2001; Vlahov et al., 1998). Few studies examine exposure to violence among HIV-infected men, although studies of men at high risk for HIV (men who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drug users) demonstrate high violence exposure of all types: childhood, physical and sexual violence (jinich et al., 1998; Liebschutz et al., 2002; Zierler et al., 1991,2000). Among a nationally representative probability sample of 2,864 HIV-infected adults, 20.5% of the women, 11.5% ofthe MSM and 7.5% of the heterosexual men reported physical harm by a partner or someone close to them since the HIV diagnosis, a period of one to six years in the majority of the sample (Zierler et al., 2000). The thrust of the research on violence among HIV-infected persons has been the relationship of violence to risk transmission. The impact of violence exposure on physical health, mental health, substance abuse and health care utilization in this population has received less attention (Eisenman et al., 2003; Liebschutz et al., 2000). Studies have been limited by their cross-sectional design to examine the impact ofrecent violence compared to childhood or lifetime violence. Prospectively collected data on violence incidence in an HIV-infected population, male or female, has not been published. Existing studies utilizing cross-sectional violence exposure have not examined the effect oflifetime or recent violence exposure on HIV-medication adherence. Because HIV-infected individuals often have multiple comorbidities, it is difficult to attribute any observed associations to the violence or the comorbid problems. If recent violence is shown to be important in its relationship to 568 J M. Liebschutz et al. comorbidities, interventions to prevent violence might help improve quality and appro\u00ad priateness of medical care. To address these questions, we examined interpersonal violence in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected men and women with a history of alcohol problems and the association of violence exposure with health care utilization, substance abuse severity and adherence to HIV medications. We report data on males separately because of lack of such published data. We defme interpersonal violence broadly: physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by strangers, acquaintances and intimates at any age. We hypothesized that exposure to interpersonal violence in this cohort would be high, and that those who reported prior interpersonal violence, childhood violence and recent violence would have higher utilization, worse substance abuse severity and lower HIV medication adherence than those who did not report these exposures. Methods Subjects The HIV-ALC (HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort) study recruited HIV-infected indivi\u00ad duals with a history of alcohol problems with the primary aim of evaluating the effect of alcohol use on HIV disease. A randomized controlled trial was conducted for 151 members of this cohort to test a behavioral intervention to improve adherence to HIV medication (Samet et al., 2002). With the approval of the Institutional Reviews Boards of Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, individuals were asked to participate if they had a lifetime history of alcohol problems, (defined as two or more positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire (Ewing, 1984; Samet et al., 2004) and were HIV-infected. Those patients recruited from the Boston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit (Samet et al., 1995) who did not meet CAGE criteria were eligible ifone of the two regular attending physicians made a clinical diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Other eligibility requirements included fluency in English or Spanish, Mini\u00ad Mental State Examination score greater or equal to 21 (Folstein et al., 1975) and no plans to move from the Boston area in the next two years. Multiple methods ofrecruitment were utilized during the data collection period from July 1997 through July 2001. Primary enrollment, 56% of subjects, was from the HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit, an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients initiating medical care. Additional subjects were recruited as follows: 17% from posted flyers at homeless shelters and HIV/AIDS social service agencies in the Boston area, 13% from Boston Medical Center's Primary Care Practices, 5% from a respite facility for homeless persons, 4% from a methadone clinic, 4% from referrals by friends and 2% from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Data collection After obtaining informed consent, a research associate interviewed subjects using a standardized instrument to ascertain baseline information including the following: demographics, exposure to interpersonal violence, alcohol and drug use, health care utilization in the preceding six months, adherence to HIV medications and depressive symptoms. Subsequent research interviews were attempted at six-month intervals through July 2001, a maximum period of 30 months. We attempted to obtain CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels on all subjects. Laboratory tests performed within six months of the Violence and health care utilization 569 interview as part of clinical care were recorded. Ifnot available through routine clinical care, blood samples were obtained and tested for CD4 cell count and HIV RNA using the Boston Medical Center Clinical Laboratory. Interviews were conducted both in English and in Spanish. The Spanish interview utilized standardized scales when available; the remainder of the interview was translated from English into Spanish, back-translated to assure accuracy, and then corrected. Key variables Interpersonal violence. For physical violence, the subjects were asked, 'Have you ever been physically abused or assaulted ... (for example: kicked, hit, choked, shot, stabbed, burned or held at gunpoint)?' For sexual violence, the subjects were asked, 'Have you ever been sexually assaulted ... (for example: unwanted sexual touching anywhere on your body, touching of genitals and/or breasts, or made to have oral sex or vaginal or anal intercourse against your will by force or the threat of force)?' Ifa violence history was reported, subjects were asked their age at the time of the first violence and whether any violence occurred within the past six months. The questions about violence in the past six months were asked at each subsequent research interview to all subjects. Three variables were created to describe interpersonal violence: lifetime violence, recent violence and childhood sexual violence. Recent violence referred to violence occurring in the past six months. For lifetime violence and recent violence, three mutually exclusive categories were defined: no violence, physical violence only (without sexual violence) and sexual violence (with or without physical violence). Childhood sexual violence was defined as sexual violence occurring prior to age 13. Outcome variables Health care utilization. Three variables were used to define health care utilization in the prior six months: the number of ED visits, the number of hospitalizations and the number of ambulatory care visits. Alcohol and drug severity. Alcohol and drug use severity were assessed using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), an assessment instrument with well-documented reliability and validity, scored 0-1, with higher scores indicating increased severity (McLellan et aI., 1985). Medication adherence. Adherence was determined with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Questionnaire for Adherence to Anti-Retroviral Medications(Chesney et aI., 2000). Subjects reported the names of their antiretroviral medications, as well as the number of doses and the total number of pills prescribed daily. The three-day self\u00ad reported number of pills missed was computed for each HIV medication and the outcome was dichotomized (100% adherent versus less than fully adherent). The 30-day self\u00ad reported number of pills missed was also dichotomized (~95% adherent versus ~95% adherent). Other independent variables. Additional variables were included in our analysis including: gender, ethnicity (black, white, Hispanic or other), homelessness, CD4 count, any 570 J. M. Liebschutz et at. use of drugs or alcohol in the past 30 days, depressive symptoms, participation in the randomized controlled trial and medication status. Homelessness was defined as having spent at least one night either on the street or in a shelter in the six months preceding the interview (Kertesz et aI., 2003). Depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), a continuous scale to measure depressive symptoms. The question for HIV medication status was, 'Are you currently taking any HIV medications (such as AZT or protease inhibitors)?' Health insurance status was measured, but 99% of all subjects had access to private, Medicaid or a special publicly-funded health insurance for HIV-infected individuals such that all had coverage for medications, ambulatory visits and hospitaliza\u00ad tions. Data analysis Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. We used the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator to calculate the proportion of subjects reporting recent violence over time. Since recent violence was defined as any physical or sexual violence in the six months prior to each interview, time 0 was considered to be six months prior to the first interview. Thus, although there were 30 months of follow-up, the survival estimator calculated 36 months of possible exposure to violence. Generalized estimating equation regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between recent violence and ambulatory visits, ED visits, hospitalizations, adherence to HIV medication and substance abuse severity over time while controlling for age, gender, education, race, childhood violence, recent substance use, medication status, CD4 count, participation in the randomized control trial for adherence, depressive symptoms and homelessness. Models substituting lifetime violence (sexual and physical) for childhood violence exposure were also conducted. The results were similar in direction and magnitude, and are not reported separately. The logit link (Poisson regression) was used for the number of ambulatory visits, ED visits and hospitalizations per six-month period. The logit link was used for the dichotomous adherence outcomes and the identity link (linear regression) for the substance use severity indices. Only the 250 subjects taking HIV medication were used in the calculations involving adherence measures. An identity working correlation matrix was specified and empirical standard error estimates reported. Stratified analyses by gender were performed. They showed no differences in the directions ofthe findings, although the statistical significance ofthe results were attenuated by the lower numbers in the separate gender groups. Because recent violence was a low frequency event, the female models evaluating effect of recent violence on hospitalizations, ED visits, substance abuse severity and adherence did not include enough observations to be conducted separately. Only the total group and male model results are reported. Results Subject characteristics Characteristics of the 349 subjects in this cohort include the following, as outlined in Table I: mean age 41 years old; male 79%; ethnic minorities 77%; high school graduates 60%; and homeless 29%.

Alcohol and drug use in the last 30 days was reported by 47% of the subjects, while 19% reported hazardous drinking as defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 1995). Of the 349 subjects, 219 (63%) had at least one follow-up interview after baseline, with an average of three follow-up visits per subject. Previous work reported that time of recruitment into this study was the most important predictor of the number of completed visits (p <0.0001) with subjects entering at the beginning of the recruitment completing, on average, three interviews more than subjects entering at the end of the recruitment (Ehrenstein et al., 2004). Interpersonal violence prevalence A lifetime history of interpersonal violence was exceedingly common, with 80% reporting suchhistories, halfofthosewithphysical violence only andhalfwithsexualviolence withor without physical violence. Forty-six percent reported occurrence of first physical or sexual violence before age 13, 17% between 13 and 17 and 17% after 17 (Table II). In 885 follow\u00ad up interviews, 9.7% reported violence in the prior six months. Survival analyses show that 24% (95% confidence intervals 21, 27) and 41% (95% CI 36, 46) ofthe sample reported at least one episode ofviolence by 24 and 36 months, respectively. When including only those subjects who reported a lifetime history ofviolence at baseline, 45% (95% CI 40,50) repor\u00ad ted at least one episode of subsequent violence by 36 months. Among men, 36% (95% CI 31,41) reported at least one episode ofrecent violence by 36 months. Among women, 54% (95% CI 44, 64) reported at least one episode of recent violence by 36 months. 572 J. M.

Association of violence exposure with health care utilization Among 885 follow-up interviews, the median number of ambulatory visits, ED visits and hospitalizations in the prior six months was four (range =0-48),0 (range =0-15), and 0 (range =0-10), respectively, with 75% quartile numbers of six ambulatory visits, one ED visit and no hospitalizations. Lifetime and childhood violence were not associated with any difference in ambulatory visits, ED visits or hospitalizations (all p values >0.10). Recent violence (when controlling for lifetime and childhood violence) was independently associated with 1.45 more ambulatory visits (p=0.01), 1.65 more ED visits (p=0.003) and 1.65 more hospitalizations (p =0.03) in the prior six months. For the male subjects, recent violence was associated with 1.61 more ambulatory visits (p =0.01), 1.35 more ED visits (p =0.15) and 1.27 more hospitalizations (p =0.34) in the prior six months (see Table III). Other factors associated with increased ambulatory visits were female gender (p =0.02), younger age (p =0.02), white race (p =0.03), abstinence from drugs or alcohol (p =0.01), more depressive symptoms (p =0.05) and lower CD4 count (p =0.04). Other factors significantly associated with increased hospitalizations were black ethnicity (p =0.004) and lower CD4 count (p =0.03). The only other factor besides recent violence significantly associated with increased ED visits was increased depressive symptoms (p =0.0001). Table III.

Neither lifetime violence nor childhood violence was associated with worse alcohol or drug use severity as measured by the ASI. Recent violence was associated with 0.08 higher scores on ASI-alcohol (worse alcohol use severity) (p =0.004) and 0.02 higher scores on ASI-drug (p = 0.08). For the male analyses, recent violence was associated with 0.11 higher scores on ASI-alcohol (worse alcohol use severity) (p =0.001) and 0.02 higher scores on ASI-drug (p =0.30). Younger age (p =0.001), black ethnicity (p = 0.004) and homelessness (p =0.04) were associated with worse alcohol use severity. Black ethnicity (p =0.02) and increased depressive symptoms (p <0.0001) were associated with worse drug use severity. Association of violence with adherence to HIV medication lifetime, childhood and recent violence were not significantly associated with any change in adherence to HIV medications in any of the models tested (three-day and 30-day, males only), all p values >0.10. In both models, only increased depressive symptoms (p <0.003) and use of alcohol or drugs in the last 30 days (p =0.001) were significantly associated with decreased adherence to HIV medication. Discussion The overwhelming majority ofthis cohort of HIV-infected men and women with a history of alcohol problems experienced interpersonal violence. Half of those abused reported sexual violence. Close to half the sample experienced their first violence in childhood. Over the three-year follow-up, more than a third of men and half of women were exposed to subsequent violence. While the high level of violence experienced by women was expected, the men in this study experienced almost equally high levels of violence. These high exposures to violence have been suggested in other studies on HIV-infected persons (Gruskin et aI., 2002; Zierler et aI., 2000), although they were cross-sectional studies asking about recent violence and may not be as reliable in establishing incidence of violence exposure as was this prospective data collection. Our study's finding of such high violence exposure might, in part, be accounted for by the broader definition of violence (both known and unknown perpetrators) and by the eligibility criteria of past alcohol problems and high prevalence of prior drug abuse, a known risk factor for experiencing subsequent violence (Kilpatrick et aI., 1997). Given that violence was experienced by the majority of subjects, the consistent and significant association of recent violence with increased health utilization was impressive even after controlling for prior violence exposure. The association of increased health care utilization and interpersonal violence exposure is well documented among Hlv-infected and non-HIV-infected women (Bergman et aI., 1992; Eisenman et et aI., 1991; Liebschutz et aI., 2000; Plichta, 1992). Only one study evaluated the effect of intimate partner violence among HIV-infected men (Eisenman et al., 2003) and found that gaylbisexual men with violence victimization had increased ED visits (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.20-2.52), whereas heterosexual men with violence victimization had increased outpatient mental health visits (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.07 -4.64) and a trend toward increased hospitalizations (OR 2.74,95% CI 0.96-7.85). Among HIV-infected women in that study, only outpatient mental health visits were associated with violence victimization. 574 J. M. Liebschutz et al. That study was limited in its assessment of violence (physically hurt by partner or someone close to them since diagnosis of HIV), which might explain the lack of association of violence exposure to utlization outcomes. No study has been designed to look at causality of this association. One potential explanation for the increased utilization, that violent injuries account for the utilization, has not been shown in previous studies (Bergman et aI., 1992; Koss et aI., 1991; Liebschutz et aI., 2000; Rosenberg et aI., 2000; Schnurr et aI., 2000). Furthermore, this explanation would not account for an increase in ambulatory visits. A second hypothesis, that violence exposure affects physical health which leads to more need for medical care, has been suggested by previous study findings. The bulk of the studies on this topic have looked at somatic symptoms, chronic pain and self-reported health status (Coker et aI., 2000; Drossman et aI., 1990, 1995; Frayne et aI., 1999; Liebschutz et aI., 1997, 2000; McCauley et aI., 1998). A few studies have shown an association with physical illnesses such as pneumonias, or coronary events that would require ED visits or hospitalizations (Coker et aI., 2000, 2002; Cokkinides et aI., 1999; Frayne et aI., 1999; Liebschutz et aI., 1997, 2000). All studies were limited by use of self-report data or small sample sizes and most focused on women. Coker and colleagues found a 1.5-1.6 fold increase in chronic diseases (hypertension, heart disease, arthritis, obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer) among men and women, respectively, who reported a history of physical violence as part of a large national survey on interpersonal violence (Coker et aI., 2002). In multiple logistic regression analyses controlling for severity of violence exposure, they found that severe psychological violence, not physical, was associated with a 1.6 fold increased risk of developing a chronic disease in women only. In a study using medical record reviews of 50 HIV-infected women, exposure to interpersonal violence was associated with more infectious illnesses and health care utilization, even while controlling for CD4 count (Liebschutz et aI., 2000). A third possible explanation, increased mental illness leading to increased utilization, is theoretically supported by many studies. These show that violence exposure leads to worse mental health (Felitti et aI., 1998; Goodman et aI., 1993; Mullen et aI., 1988; Resnick et aI., 1997; Schelling et aI., 1998). As well as studies showing an increase in health care utilization associated with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, the mental illness most closely identified with interpersonal violence exposure (Calhoun et aI., 2002; Marshall et aI., 1997, 1998; Schelling et aI., 1998). All utilization studies looked at lifetime or childhood exposure to interpersonal violence and not recent violence. The only study suggesting an association with recent interpersonal violence did not measure physical or sexual violence exposure, per se, but marital stress among cohabitating Swedish women with coronary heart disease. It showed a threefold increased risk of recurrent coronary events among those reporting marital stress (Orth-Gomer et aI., 2000). The association between violence and increased health care utilization found in this and other studies warrants further examination through epidemiological and biological methods. In particular, studies of this relationship should include not only past exposure to violence but also recent exposure. The relationship between recent violence and increased substance use severity found in this study is consistent with other published data. Based on a two-year follow-up of a national probability sample of 3,006 women, Kilpatrick and colleagues (1997) concluded that 'drug use leads to a vicious cycle in which substance use increases risk of future assault and assault increases risk of subsequent substance use'. They also concluded that alcohol use appeared to be a reaction to assault and not a predictor of subsequent violence. Lastly, they found a strong predictor of recurrent violence based on prior violence exposure. Our Violence and health care utilization 575 study confirms these associations, although does not point to the direction of causality. Our finding that recent violence was only weakly associated with increased severity of drug use was likely due to the low incidence of recent drug use and of recent violence at anyone point through the follow-up period. The lack of association of adherence to HIV medication with prior or recent violence has not been reported elsewhere. Because of the smaller number of subjects taking HIV medications, our study may not have had sufficient sample size to detect such a difference. However, there was not even a trend toward increased or decreased adherence. Larger studies of adherence to HIV medication would be required to evaluate this question. A unique aspect of this study is the longitudinal nature of assessing violence exposure in combination with longitudinal assessment of health care utilization and other outcomes. The study by Eisenman and colleagues prospectively examined health care utilization in an HIV-infected sample but used a single baseline question on violence exposure as the sole determinant of this status (Eisenman et aI., 2003). In addition, our study included large numbers of heterosexual men, a group that has been understudied with respect to the associations between violence exposure and health outcomes. The study population is unique in that all subjects had a history of alcohol problems and a high proportion of the sample had a history of injection drug use. These characteristics provided a sample with a heavy burden of violence exposure, helping to tease out the effect of recent violence exposure on a number of outcomes. The study's main limitation is the lack of consistent follow-up by subjects over the 30\u00ad month follow-up period. Analytically, this was handled by using the Generalized Estimating Equation which takes advantage of longitudinal data while weighing responses based on number of observations for any subject. Because the main cause for lack of follow-up was late recruitment into the study, this would not bias the results in either direction. Another limitation was the self-report nature of the utilization data. This method has been used in numerous studies and shown to be a valid method for assessing health care utilization (Cleary & Jette, 1984; Roberts et al., 1996). Another limitation was the lack of statistical power to stratify the men by their sexual orientation to compare to the HIV Costs and Service Utilization Study sample (Eisenman et aI., 2003; Zierler et aI., 2000). Lastly, it would have been useful to stratify by the frequency and severity ofviolence exposure, but we were not able to measure that with the instruments used. Conclusion Violence is very common among HIV-infected men and women with a history of alcohol problems, including high exposure to recurring violence. The recent violence exposure was associated with increased health care utilization and worse substance use severity. These findings suggest that attention to violence prevention measures in such populations of HIV\u00ad infected persons may be an opportunity to minimize health care utilization and potentially improve physical and mental health. Future research about the health and health services implications of interpersonal violence exposure should account for both recent and past violence exposure.

Linden, MD, Paula Oldeg, MD, Supriya D. Mehta, MHS, PhD, Kerry K. McCabe, MD, Colleen LaBelle, RI\\JP Abstract Background: Although rare, HIV transmission is one of the most feared consequences of sexual assault. While avail\u00ad ability of medications to prevent HIV transmission (HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis [HIV nPEPj) is increasing, little is known about emergency department (ED) prescribing practices and patient adherence to treat\u00ad ment recommendations. Objectives: To determine factors associated with offering, following up with, and adhering to treatment when HIV nPEP is initiated for sexual assault victims. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of female patients presenting with complaint of sexual assault to an urban ED from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2002. HIV nPEP medications and/or follow-up were provided without charge. Chi-square analysis identified factors asso\u00ad ciated with being offered or referred for nPEP and follow\u00ad up. Variables significant at the p < 0.10 level were entered into logistic regression analysis. Results: Two hundred twenty-nine charts were reviewed. The final sample size was 181. Mean age was 29.1 years; median time from assault HIV postexposure prophylaxis (HIV PEP) is a form of secondary prevention of HIV transmission, and is often divided into occupational (i.e., exposure while on the job) and nonoccupational. Nonoccupational exposures include sexual assault (SA), human bites with skin break, unintended needles ticks (outside of the job), unsafe sexual practices, and injection drug use. HIV PEP has become the standard of care for occupational exposures, with clear recommendations supported by the Iiterature.l' The indications for nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP), however, are not well defined. The Centers for Dis\u00ad ease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently came out with clear recommendations for treatment after expo- From Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center GAL, SDM, KKM), Boston Medical Center Emergency Medicine Residency (PO), and Boston Medical Center (CL), Boston, MA.

HIV nPEP was offered to 89 (49%) patients, and 11 patients were referred to an HIV nurse. Eighty-five (85%) patients accepted, 38 of these 85 (45%) followed up, and 18 of the 85 (21%) completed treatment. In multivariate analysis, three variables were statistically significantly associated with increased likelihood of referral or being offered HIV nPEP: unknown assailant, having insurance, and younger age. Treatment was completed by 15 of 82 (18%) of ED-initiated patients, versus three of three (100%) referred for initiation. The authors were unable to identify factors associated with completing treatment. Conclusions: HIV nPEP was offered to less than half of sexual assault patients, and few completed treatment.

There is some evidence that HIV PEP can be beneficial when given early in nonoccupational exposures to HIV.5 Possible exposure during SA is the least controversial use of HIV nPEP (since the exposure is isolated and unlikely to recur) and accounts for a large percentage of patients seek\u00ad ing nPEp.6 The calculated risks of acquiring HIV through sexual contact are similar to those in occupational exposure, ranging from 0.3% to 0.5% per contact (anal inter\u00ad course) to 0.1% (penile-vaginal intercoursej.F\"?

Furthermore, this risk is a real concern to SA survivors, with 25% to 40% expressing serious concerns. 13,14 Few states have released recommendations for HIV nPEP in the general population.P'V Although many emergency departments (EDs) and health centers are offering HIV nPEP to SA survivors, there are few published studies evaluating patient adherence to treatment recommendations.6,I8-2I There are no stud\u00ad ies examining factors associated with physician offer\u00ad ing of HIV nPEP in the ED. The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with offering HIV nPEP to SA patients presenting to an urban ED, and subsequent follow-up and completion of HIV nPEP. METHODS Study Design. We conducted a retrospective chart review of female patients aged 18 years or older presenting to the ED with a complaint of SA between October I, 1999, and September 30, 2002. The institu\u00ad tional review board of Boston Medical Center ap\u00ad proved the study. Study Setting and Population. The study was conducted in the ED of Boston Medical Center, an urban teaching hospital with an annual census of 100,000. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, presenting with a chief complaint of SA. Exclusion criteria were: male gender, examination not per\u00ad formed in the ED, known HIV-positive status, already entered into the study, attempted assault without genital penetration, digital!object or protected as\u00ad sault, patient left before evaluation, patient left before examination, patient left before treatment was com\u00ad pleted, incomplete history due to intoxication, or altered mental status. Patients were identified via ED visit log by diagnosis, and via a secondary ED psychiatry log. Follow-up data were obtained from an HIV clinic nurse to determine compliance with clinic visits and completion of medication regimen. Study Protocol. The ED has access to a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) program funded through the Department of Public Health. Standard ED treatment for SA victims included evaluation by an emergency physician with or without a SANE. Treatment in\u00ad cluded a screening medical examination (performed by an emergency medicine [EM] resident), history and physical examination, collection of evidence utilizing a state-supplied evidence kit performed by a SANE or an EM resident (if the patient consented), serologic tests for hepatitis, and urine pregnancy testing. Emo\u00ad tional support was offered by an ED psychiatric nurse, a rape crisis advocate, the SANE (when pres\u00ad ent), and the emergency physician. Individual emer\u00ad gency physicians were responsible for prescribing STD and pregnancy prophylaxis when indicated. Our department's guidelines recommended that nPEP be offered to any SA patient with penetration and body fluid exposure. There was a written protocol for initiating nPEP, which was adapted from the occupational PEP protocol. Efforts to educate staff about nPEP and our protocol included a grand rounds on HIV nPEP, and ongoing input from SANE con\u00ad sultants. The decision to provide nPEP was made by the treating physician in consultation with the SANE. The HIV nPEP medications and follow-up were pro\u00ad vided free of charge. Three-day nPEP starter packs were distributed in the ED, with follow-up arranged in one to three days. Protocol included follow-up with a designated nurse in the HIV clinic on the next business day, initiated by the patient. Measures. Study variables included age, mode of arrival to the ED, insurance status, time elapsed between assault and ED presentation, identity and number of assailants (acquaintance or stranger), type of assault, and presence and source of bleeding in the patient or assailant (as reported by the patient). Most of these variables were abstracted from the standard\u00ad ized report form in the Massachusetts Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit. All study variables were explicitly defined. All data abstractors met periodically to review and discuss uniform handling of the data that were missing, ambiguous, or conflicting. If there was no documen\u00ad tation of discussion about HIV nPEP in the nurses' notes, the physicians' notes, or the SANE notes, then the patient was classified as \"not offered\" HIV nPEP. A 20% random sample of the final data set was selected for an interrater reliability check of data abstraction. Data Analysis. Data were entered into a Microsoft Access 2000 database (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), and analyzed using Stata SE 7.0 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Chi-square and Student's t-test were used to identify factors associ\u00ad ated with the offering of, follow-up with, and com\u00ad pletion of HIV nPEP in the ED. All variables statistically significant at the p < 0.10 level from exploratory and univariate logistic regression analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis. A p-value of <0.10 was chosen for the exploratory analysis due to the small sample size and limited power. We chose a less conservative threshold for significance because this was not a study of intervention effect, but an attempt to identify clinically significant factors associated with being offered or referred for HIV nPEP. Outcomes for analysiswere: 1) whether apatient wasoffered/given PEP in the ED, 2) whether the patient followed up for at least one visit at the HIV clinic, and 3) whether 642 he or she completed the one-month recommended course of therapy. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-nine charts were identified; 188 were eligible for inclusion, and seven charts were unavailable for review, leaving a final sample size of 181 (96%). Reasons for exclusion were as follows: male gender (7); previously documented HIV-positive status (3); left before evaluation, examination, or treatment was completed (14); patient history incom\u00ad plete due to intoxication or altered mental status (6); digital, protected, or attempted assault without actual penetration (4);already entered into the study (5);and examination not performed in the ED (2). Patients reported being assaulted by one assailant in 150 (83%) cases, and two or more assailants in 21 (12%) cases. Three patients (1.7%) reported an assault by an assailant with known or high risk for HIV. Vaginal assault was the most common type of assault (53%), followed by vaginal and oral (15%); vaginal, anal, and oral (6%); and oral (5%). Fifteen percent of the assaults were of undocumented or unknown type. Median time from assault to ED presentation was 10.1 hours (range: 0-241, binomially obtained 95% CI =7.1 to 12.9). Characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1. For the 20% of charts that were randomly selected for interrater reliability, kappa values were 0.68 for whether 0.87 for type of assault, and K= 0.78 for type of assailant (n = 41 each measure). The mean age of the subjects was 29.1 years (me\u00ad dian 27.6, range 18-82). Nearly half (48%) of the patients had Medicaid as their primary insurance, 17% were self-pay (no insurance), 28% had private insurance, and 16% had Free Care coverage by the Massachusetts uncompensated care pool (funds dis\u00ad tributed to hospitals for the care of patients who are not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid but are finan\u00ad cially eligible for assistance from state funds). The HIV nPEP treatment was offered to 89 of 181 (49%) patients, of whom seven of 89 (8%) declined, and 82 of 89 (92%) accepted (Figure 1). Of the 82 patients who accepted treatment offered in the ED, 78 of 82 (95%) were prescribed a two-drug regiment of zidovudine and lamivudine (common name 3 TC; Combivir is the combination of the two), and four of 82 (5%) were prescribed a three-drug regimen of Combivir and nelfinavir. Of the three patients whose care was started by the HIV nurse, two (66%) were started on the two-drug regimen, and one (33%) was started on the three-drug regimen. The HIV nNPEP treatment was not offered to 57 of 181 patients (31%). Additionally, 14 of 181 (8%) were not given nPEP because it was not indicated, 11of 181 Linden et al.

(6%) were referred to the HIV clinic to discuss possible treatment, and ten of 181 (6%) had unclear charts (i.e., contradictions in physician notes, nursing notes, or discharge instructions). HIV nPEP was not indicated in 14 patients for the following reasons: time of presen\u00ad tation was outside the suggested treatment window (>72 hours) (n = 10), no body fluid exposure (n =1), and assaulted by current significant other (n = 3). Of the 82 patients who began nPEP in the ED, 35 of 82 (43%) followed up for at least one visit, but only 15 of 82 (18%) completed the full one-month course of treatment. Of the 11 patients referred to the HIV clinic nurse, only six actually went. Half (three of six) of the patients who were referred to the HIV clinic nurse to discuss treatment were started on nPEP, and three of three (100%) completed treatment, although one stopped nelfinavir secondary to side effects but con\u00ad tinued the Comibivir. There was no documented sero\u00ad conversion during the follow-up period (Figure 1). When evaluating factors associated with being of\u00ad fered or referred nPEP in the ED, patients with genital bleeding and younger age were more likely to be offered or referred (Table 2).

DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, ours is one of the largest studies evaluating HIV nPEP given to SA victims from the ED.20.21 Other large studies included injection drug exposures, subsets of SA victims (pediatric and adolescent), and all blood/body fluid exposures.18,22 While the practice of offering SA victims prophylaxis for pregnancy and STDs is standard of care, offering HIV nPEP is becoming increasingly common, given SA victims' concerns regarding acquiring HN from the rape. Studies evaluating nPEP in men at high risk for HIV exposure and given medications to begin immediately upon exposure have shown a compli\u00ad ance rate of greater than 90%, and efficacy in decreas\u00ad ing seroconversion/' Kahn et al. studied completion rates in volunteers with sexual exposure or injection drug use, and found a 78% completion rate, with 12% returning for a repeat exposure.F Sexual assault victims differ in that the serostatus of the assailant is often unknown, therefore making estimates of risk of exposure and subsequent treatment recommenda\u00ad tions more difficult. One study of incarcerated prison\u00ad ers charged with a sexual offense in Rhode Island suggests a higher rate of HIV positivity than in the general incarcerated population (1% vs, 0.3%), although this may vary by region, and the prevalence is still low.P Sexual assault victims are often in crisis, and may have many safety concerns not related to HIV,making comprehension of and decision making in a very complicated topic more difficult. Recent CDC recom\u00ad mendations acknowledge that HIV can be transmitted through SA (albeit rarely), and that nPEP treatment has become widely encouraged. The CDC also rec\u00ad ommends that SA survivors will benefit from support services to increase the likelihood of completing the one-month therapy.\" Our data confirm findings of previous studies reporting a low likelihood of follow-up and comple\u00ad tion of nPEP treatment in victims of SA, with follow\u00ad up rates ranging from 38% to 53%, and completion rates ranging from 11% to 63%.18-20,24 In fact, the completion rate of health care workers who begin nPEP (a highly motivated and knowledgeable group of patients) is in the vicinity of 30%, although they are more likely to be given a three-drug regimen that carries with it a higher likelihood of adverse reac\u00ad tions.25 Although our overall completion rate was 21%, the completion rate of those patients started on nPEP from the HIV clinic was 100%, whereas only 18% of those patients who were started from the ED completed the 30-day regimen. We are unable to tell whether this is because the group of patients who Linden et al.\u00b7 POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS IN SEXUAL ASSAULT went to the HIV clinic were more motivated, were more organized, or perceived a higher risk, or whether the delayed discussion of the pros and cons of nPEP was more beneficial. All victims received the support of the HIV nurse, whether they were started in the ED or in the infectious disease clinic. We were able to identify factors that were associ\u00ad ated with a lower likelihood of being offered nPEP in our ED. One of these factors (acquaintance rape) is not surprising, as the HIV status of the assailant is more likely to be known. There may be a bias on the part of the provider that there is ongoing exposure. In fact, ongoing exposure may have been a rational reason on the part of the provider not to provide nPEP. Two other factors, lack of insurance and older age, are more disturbing. At our hospital, the medications given in nonoccupational exposures can cost $600.00 (two-drug regimen) to $1,200.00 (three-drug regimen) (Epocrates Rx,version6.13,2004,San Mateo, CA), and follow-up visits and laboratory tests an additional $1,200.00 (Boston Medical Center laboratory finances department), possibly posing a Significant barrier to uninsured/ underinsured patients, or those not want\u00ad ing to use their insurance (for instance, college students covered by their parents' insurance). Massa\u00ad chusetts has an HIV drug assistance program (HDAP) (funded through the state Department of Public Health) that covers nPEP medications for uninsured patients. A recent survey, however, suggests that many ED practitioners are not aware of this pro\u00ad gram,26 Older age and not being offered nPEP may possibly be due to an age bias, although our study population was skewed toward younger age. The reasons behind the decision-making process cannot be known from this retrospective review, and warrant further study. Standardized protocols and guidelines may clarify treatment recommendations and allow more uniform access to ED-initiated nPEP in SA victims. Unfortunately, this is difficult, given the paucity of clear outcome data from large-scale studies in this population. The new CDC recommendations suggest incorporating a more selective approach for offering HIV nPEp.4 Guidelines that include consid\u00ad eration of exposure risk category and HIV risk status of source may assist providers.I5-17,27 LIMITATIONS This study is limited by the weaknesses inherent in retrospective reviews. However, abstraction bias was limited by using formal inclusion criteria, prospective variable definition, abstractor training, standardized abstraction forms, abstractor monitoring, and assess\u00ad ment of interrater reliability.\" The HIV nPEP treatment may have been discussed with and offered to the patient but not documented. The decision to treat, although made in conjunction with an HIV nurse, with the guidance of Boston 645 ACAD EMERG MED July 2005, Vol. 12, No.7\u00b7 www.aemj.org Medical Center ED guidelines, was ultimately made by the treating physician. Although the SANE pro\u00ad gram and our ED had treatment guidelines, the standard of care for nonoccupational HIV exposures is in flux. The most recent CDC recommendations for HIV nPEP treatment in SA victims acknowledge that several aspects of SA may put victims at increased risk for HIV exposure, but that reported seroconver\u00ad sions remain extremely rare. The CDC report stops short of recommending nPEP, but acknowledges that the use of nPEP in SA survivors has been widely encouraged in the United States and elsewhere by manyexperts.4,29,30 Our results may not be generalizable to other settings. Our study did not include male SA victims (due to small numbers), who are often higher-risk exposures. Finally, our sample size was not large enough to allow us to identify factors associated with increased likelihood of follow-up and completion of PEP, limiting our ability to identify and define a population of better candidates for nPEP. CONCLUSIONS Nonoccupational HIV postexposure prophylaxis was offered to less than half of the sexual assault survivors in the ED, according to our chart review. Of those who opted to begin prophylaxis, completion rate was low; less than half followed up for one visit, and only 18% of those who began treatment in the ED completed the treatment course. Patients who accepted nPEP through the HIV clinic more often completed the one\u00ad month course; however, these patients were started after the initial ED visit, and may have been more able to focus on the discussion about risks/benefits of nPEP and make a more rational decision. HIV nPEP was more likely to be offered to those patients with insurance, younger age, and genital bleeding. Postexposure prophylaxis for nonoccupational ex\u00ad posures to HIY, including SA, is an evolving topic, with recent data helping to inform practice. Emer\u00ad gency departments are well suited to offer treatment to prevent pregnancy, HIV disease, and other STDs for SA survivors, given the familiarity with protocols for PEP in health care workers, and the time-sensitive nature of the intervention. Although treatment in high-risk populations is feasible, the population of sexually assaulted patients in the ED represents a particular challenge, as follow-up and completion rates appear to be poor,\" More information clarifying the recommendations for treatment and methods for increasing the likelihood of completion of treatment is needed. It is important to ensure that patients are offered treatment without bias with respect to insur\u00ad ance status or age. Prospective studies using stan\u00ad dardized treatment protocols, taking into account risk of exposure and regional HIV seroprevalence rate, with 24-hour expert counseling by persons knowl\u00adedgeable in the pros and cons of HIV PEp, and interviews exploring reasons why patients stop taking the PEP medications (e.g., side effects, low risk of transmission, unaffordability of medications) will help establish more definitive protocols for prescrip\u00ad tion of nPEP.

Assessment of Trauma History in Women McHVGO et al. 113The Women, Co-occurring Disorders, and Violence Study (WCDVS) was a large federally funded multisite study (N \u2014 2729) of the effectiveness of comprehensive, integrated, trauma-inlomied, and consumer-involved services for women with substance use and mental health disorders and a his- tory of interpersonal violence.\" The aims of this article are to contribute to the understanding of measuring potentially traumatic events and to describe the kinds and frequencies of such events in the lives of women with co-occurring disorders and histories of physical or sexual abuse. An existing trauma assessment instrument, the Life-Stressors Checklist-Revised (LSC-R). was adapted for the WCDVS. Data are presented on the test-rete.st reliability of the WCDVS version of the LSC-R, on study participants' tolerance of the instrument, and on the breadth and scope of po- tentially traumatic experiences in the past and current lives of women in the study sample. The development, psychometric properties, and use of summary measures are described, and recom- mendations are presented for the improvement of the WCDVS version of the LSC-R for use in future research. A literature review focused on issues and challenges in the measurement of stress- ful and violent events sets the stage by describing the context of the WCDVS's selection of the LSC-R as the instrument with which to assess past and current exposure to potentially traumatic events. Measuring Traumatic Events Some of the questions faced by WCDVS investigators in their choice of a measure of traumatic events were: Should the focus be on stressful life events or be limited to the formal assessment of traumatic events? What events should be included? Are self-reports of sucb events reliable (tempo- rally stable)? How deeply should interviewers probe for details of the events? What is sufficient for research purposes, as opposed to clinical purpo.ses? What meaningful and analytically useful sum- mary variables can be computed from the basic information? What instrument is most appropriate to the target population? Differences between stressful life events and traumatic life events The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual's (DSM) definition of trauma bas changed over time, as understanding of the scope and impact of trauma has grown. The initial definition was of an event that would be markedly distressing to almost anyone and outside the range of usual human experience. More recently, traumatic events have been expanded to include experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with events tbat involve actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to tbe physical integrity of oneself or others. The latest defmition also added the necessary condition of an emotional response of fear, helplessness, or horror at tbe time of the event. Whatever the definition, traumatic events are considered to be tbe cause of the development of subsequent post-traumatic reactions, and the current diagnostic procedure for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires a formal assessment of trauma, based on the definition in DSM-IV (Criienon A: threat of death or serious injury and emotional response of fear, helplessness, or horror at the time of tbe precipitating event). The framers of the original criteria for the PTSD diagnosis had in mind events sucb as war, torture, rape, and natural and man-made disasters. Traumatic events were considered different from 'This study was futided utider Guidatice for Applicants (GFA) No. TI 00-003, titled Cooperative Agreement to Study Women wilh Alcohol.

Stress research has been primarily concemed with the scientific exploration of a causal relationship between life stress and illness. Early studies focused on the characteristics of events that were likely to be stressful and to lead to changes in psychiatric or physical health.' A parallel view of stressful life events emerged through the lens of bereavement, loss, and adaptation. Events such as divorce or death of a loved one were understood as rendering obsolete the individual's assumptive world and requiring a psychosocial transition that could generate internal turmoil, denial, and depre.ssion.-^^ This distinction between stressful life events and traumatic events assumes that most individuals can cope with ordinary stress, whereas the adaptive capacities of most people are likely to be overwhelmed when confronted by a traumatic event. Seif-report Self-report is often the only possible source of information on past or current experience of stressful events. The subjectivity of self-report of traumatic life events is often considered a hindrance to valid measurement. The recent discourse about \"false memories\" manifests the multifaceted problems involved in assessing the relative accuracy of self-reports, especially when they involve the report of past sexual or physical abuse.\"* Nonetheless, recent studies examining the use of self-report measures of trauma in psychiatric populations have concluded that they were reliable and valid.^-^ Which traumatic events to measure? The WCDVS was designed with the understanding that trauma is often at the core of co-occurring problems of substance use and mental illness. Traumatic events may be brief, single incidents or prolonged and repeated. They may have occurred at any point in the lifespan. and. once begun, they increa.se vulnerability to additional trauma, in making a choice of trauma history assessment, WCDVS investigators wished to include life events that may not necessarily meet /)5A/-/Vcriteria for trauma but which were highly stressful nonetheless. The view adopted was that trauma is a complex, multifaceted experience that can result in adverse outcomes well beyond those of diagnosable PTSD. Thus, a measure was sought that was comprehensive and appropriate to the experiences of women. Gender issues in the assessment of trauma history Three general factors affect the sensitivity of trauma history measures with respect to gender: (I) the extent to which trauma exposure is queried in language that respondents understand easily and are willing to endorse, (2) the extent to which specific characteristics of traumatic events are measured, and (3) the inclusiveness of events or experiences examined. The importance of using language that respondents are willing to endorse became apparent when women with sexual experiences that met the legal definition of rape did not label their experiences as such and did not endorse items such as \"Have you ever been raped?\"^ ** Characteristics such as age at the time of the event, severity, and chronicity are especially important with respect to gender, because they define the parameters of exposure tbat explain several gender differences in PTSD prevalence and eomorbid symptoms. Gender-sensitive measures also include content relevant to the stressors and traumatic experiences tbat are specific to, or more common for, women or men. Instrument choice The Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) was chosen for the WCDVS because it is specifically tailored to the trauma exposure and stressful life experiences of women and has established validity.^ The LSC-R is a 30-item instrument that includes stressors relevant to the lives of women who Assessment of Trauma History in Women McHUGO et al. 115do not usually meet DSM criteria for a traumatic event but may be relevant to understanding the context of trauma exposure, such as prolonged and unwanted separation from children or caregiving for someone ill or disabled. It also includes unique assessments for abortion and miscarriage, and differentiates forced .sexual touching (sexual assault) from forced penetrative sex (rape). The LSC-R uses behaviorally specific language, and it includes probes to assess age at the time of the lirst event, chronicity, und /)5A/-/V criteria for life threat and emotional response. Information regarding the relationship to the perpetrator (someone known well versus not known well) is imbedded in the item wording when relevant. The LSC-R has demonstrated good criterion-related validity lor PTSD in diverse populations of women and in several languages.'\" ' ~ Methods Description of the WCDVS The primary aim of the WCDVS was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that provide comprehensive, integrated, trauma-informed, and consumer-involved services to women wht) have co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders and a history of interpersonal violence.'-^ The WCDVS used a quasi-experimental, longitudinal design with a common, standardized interview at baseline and 4 follow-ups: al 6 and 12 months to obtain descriptive and outcome data, and at 3 and 9 months to obtain interim .services utilization data. Tbe WCDVS was conducted at 9 sites across the country, where women in intervention services were compared with women in services as usual. Although the sites had common core service elements to provide integrated trauma, mental health, and substance abuse treatments, they differed by portal (substance abuse, mental health, or community- based) and modality (outpatient, inpatient. or mixed). Women aged 18 or older were eligible for the WCDVS if tbey had a substance use disorder and a mental health disorder, had accessed the formal treatment system on at least 2 occasions, and had a history ol\" interpersonal abuse. The eligibility criteria were very broad, even though they included both a substance use disorder and a mental health disorder. Only one of these disorders had to be current at the time of study entry: the other could be current or within the past 5 years. In terms of substance use disorders, a woman at study entry might have been just out of detoxification services or in recovery for nearly 5 years. In terms of mental health disorders, a woman at study entry might have been seeking services for untreated psychological symptoms or she might have been symptomatically stable. WCDVS women could have any major mental health disorder, including not only PTSD and depression but also anxiety, bipolar, multiple personality, obsessive-compulsive, personality, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. ModiHcatlons to the LSC-R A workgroupof tbe LSC R for the WCDVS to tailor it specifically to the study population. The original authors of theLSC and LSC R had already addressed content validity,'' hut tbe workgroup felt ihat additional modifications were needed for the target population and the aims of the WCDVS. CSRs stressed the importance of gender specificity, cultural sensitivity, and caution regarding questions about abuse. They also expres.sed concern about potential distress to respondents as well as to interviewers and contributed to the common cross-site interviewer training and to tbe design of supports for inter- viewers. For example, CSRs endorsed separating death of a child from death of others close to the respondent and including a question about abuse by service providers. Their recommendations also led to the development of probes for frequency und age of onset of abuse that provided sufficient data for research purposes while maintaining a clinically sensitive approach and not prying too deeply into tbe details of specific stressful events. 116 The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research 32:2 April/June 2005The modified LSC-R, henceforth referred to as the WCDVS version of the LSC-R. contained 31 specific items and a final, open-ended Item that asked ahout \"any other stressful events.\" Eighteen items in the WCDVS version were identical to those in the original LSC-R, 6 items resulted from either merging or splitting LSC-R items, and 7 items were new (Table I). Each item inquired about lifetime exposure to a stressful cvcnK yes orno; \"has this ever happened\"), and. if posiiively endorsed, about current exposure (yes or no; \"has this happened in the past 6 months\"). There were no further prohes for the lirst 17 items. The next 14 items, which focused on interpersonal abuse and neglect, included follow-up probes concerning frequency and age of onset. The frequency probe. \"How often has this happened.\" had 3 response options: once, a few times, and a lot. The age of onset probe. \"How old were you when this (hrst) happened,\" had 5 response options: ()-5 years. 6-10 years. 11-13 years, 14-17 years, and 18 years or older, which were also anchored by school-based developmental periods (preschool, elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, beyond high school). As a result of these modifications and unlike the original LSC-R, the WCDVS version of ihe LSC-R does not assess trauma formally (ic. using DSM-IV Criterion A). Instead, it provides a comprehensive and sensitive assessment of stressful life events, many of which are presumed lo lead not just to post-traumatic reactions but also to other Axis 1 or II mental health disorders such as depression, generalized anxiety, dissocialive identity disorder, and suhstance use disorders. The WCDVS version of the LSC-R wa.s embedded in a comprebensive interview thai included measures of personal and family characteristics, substance abuse and mental health treatment history, patterns of substance use. general mental health sympkims. PTSD symptoms, service utilization, and perceptions of care. Common training in standardized research interviewing and study-specific procedures was provided for interviewers from all study sites. Retest sample A subset of women completed the cross-site baseline interview on 2 separate tKxasions. close in lime, to enable analysis oltest-retesi reliability (temporal stability). The retest sample numbered 186. which was approximately 20 women from each study site. For those women wht) completed the baseline interview in 1 session (n = 174), the retesl interview occurred an average of 7 days later (SD = 4.2; Range = 2-35 days). For ihe remaining 12 women, who required 2 sessions for their baseline interview, the time between the second session and the retest interview was also 7 days (SD = 4.8; Range = 1-20 days). Survey of sites concerning LSC-R tolerance A concern shared by CSRs, clinicians, and researchers was the ptneniial of the trauma his- tory assessment to elicit distress and to trigger unwanted emotional reactions. To assess how well participants in the WCDVS tolerated the trauma history assessment, we analyzed the responses from the study sites to 4 questions addressing (I) research Interviewers' opinions of women's reactions, both positive and negative; (2) whether interviewers noticed any patterning in women's reactions; (3) what it was like for interviewers to administer the WCDVS version of the LSC-R; and (4) whether there were any adverse events asstKiated with it. Summary variables A WCDVS workgroup discussed ways in which information from the WCDVS version of the LSC-R could be used to create summary variables for use as measures of (1) individual dilTerences in lifeiime trauma history, for description and as covariales in statistical analyses, and (2) individ- ual dilTerences in current exposure to traumatic events, as covariates in statistical analyses and as secondary outcome measures.

A C^ ^ ^ Qi :^ cS of Trauma History in Women Mr HUGO et ol. 119Five summary variables resulted: Lifetime exposure to stressful events (LESE) uses information from all 31 specific items to indicate the breadth of exposure to stressful events in each woman's lifetime. A score on the LESE is equal to the total number of items endorsed (Range = 0-31); Lifetime frequency of interpersonal abuse (LFIA) uses follow-up probe information from 9 items (Table 1: items 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 29, 30. 31) to quantify the frequency of interpersonal abuse in each woman's lifetime. Respondents can answer \"never\" (0), \"once\" (1), \"a few times\" (2), or \"a lot\" (3) to each probe about the frequency of the abuse. Three of the 9 items (21,29, 30) ask about frequency of abuse in both childhood and adulthood, und ihus 12 responses are summed (Range = {)-36); Frequency of childhood abuse (FCA) is formed by summing the responses to 3 frequency probes pertaining lo childhood physical and sexual abuse (Table I: items 21, 29. 30); Current exposure to interpersonal abuse (CEIA) consists of the summed responses (\"no\" = 0; \"yes\" = 1) to 8 items pertaining to recent exposure to interpersonal abuse (Table I: items 19, 20, 21. 24, 25, 29, 30, 31); and Current exposure to other stressors (CEOS) sums the responses to the 20 recent-exposure items that are not included in the CEIA scale (Range ^ 0-20). In addition, the workgroup developed rules for combining item and probe responses to produce 4 dichotomous variables that indicated the presence or absence of childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, adulthood physical abuse, and adulthood sexual abuse. These summary variables assume that a high frequency of trauma exposure and a wider exposure are indications of increased severity, but they inlentionally refrain from assigning weights to different types of experiences. Although several factors other than frequency have been proposed to relate to the severity of trauma exposure, for example, age of onset and relationship to the perpetrator, the field is still far from generating an accepted severity algorithm. The purpose here is nut tt) codify these summary variables, but rather to suggest possible ways to combine single-item data into meaningful composites and to examine their psychometric properties. Despite serious limitations of summary measures when comparing individual women, there is a clear need for aggregate trauma history variables for statistical analyses of group differences. Qualitative analysis of the final open-ended item The Trauma Measures Qualitative Workgroup analyzed the responses to the final item of the WCDVS version of the LSC-R (\"Are there any other upsetting or stressful events we did not include that you would like to mention? What was the event?*\").* Members of the workgroup represented CSR, clinical, and research perspectives and included 2 WCDVS interviewers. The workgroup combined 2 different methodologies. Initially, analysis of responses was guided solely by grounded theory, according to which themes arise from the data rather than being imposed on it by the analyst.''' As workgroup members identified themes in ihe baseline responses, they *The aulhors ;icknowledge their debt lo all the members of the Traumd Qualitalive Workgroup, which was responsible for analyzing sludy participants\" responses lo ihe final, open ended question of ihe WCDVS version of the LSC-R.

Limitation on the number of authors prevented ofliciaily including all members of the workgroup a.s atJthors. 120 The Journal of Behavioral Health Serx'ices & Research 52:2 April/June 2005recognized that some respcmscs described events that were eovered in one of the preceding speeific items. In addition, they recognized that many of the ihemes identified were elosely related to the events covered in those items. Therefore, a second analytic strategy was employed, which derived themes or ctKles from categories in the specific items. Combining this top-down approach with the holtom-up approach of grounded theory resulted in u tripartite coding structure: Coding I, themes that are the same as those in the 31 specific items; Coding II, themes that are similar to those in the ,speci)ic items; and Coding III, themes that are new and different from those in the specific items. Results Characteristics of the WCDVS study participants The WCDVS baseline sample (A'\u2014 2729) represents the largest study sample of dually diagnosed treatment-seeking women who have completed a common trauma history assessment. A description of the characteristics of these women sheds light on the generalizability of the WCDVS Hndings on the past prevalence and fi-month incidence of stressful events in women's lives, as well as on tolerance of the WCDVS version of the LSC-R. The WCDVS participants were, on average, 36 years old. ranging from 18 to 76. Fifty pereent had completed high school, and another 24^ had a Graduation Equivalency Diploma (GED). Women self- white/Caueasian (54'/r). blaek/Alrican than one third (38%) were married or partnered, while almost one third (30%) had never married. These women had, on average. $682 during the past 3(J days, with a range from $0 to $30,000; 12.6% were employed cunently; and 71.8% had been homeless somelime in their life. Most of the women had had children {86.79r). hut only 31.7% were living with a child younger than 18 years (See McHugo el al\" and Becker et al'*\" for fuller descriptions). In addition, study participants lived in urban, rural, and suburban settings in 6 states and the District of Columbia. Reactions to the WCDVS version of the LSC-R When asked about respondents' reactions to tbe trauma history assessment, interviewers reported tbat most women either had little reaction or found it a positive experience. Women stated that the questions gave them perspective on how much they had endured and survived, or how fortunate they were to have avoided some oi tbe events asked about. A number of women said that they appreciated being asked directly about stressful experiences in their lives and that they bad told interviewers things ibat they bad never disclosed to anyone else. For the few women who appeared distressed during tbe administration of tbe WCDVS version of tbe LSC-R, it was expressed as nervousness or tenseness, particularly at the baseline interview, or as tearfulness or weeping. Interviewee noted that women's reactions appeared to be related to their stages of recovery (eg, length of sobriety) and therapeutic experiences (eg, how often they had described their trauma experiences in clinical settings). Those few women who sti^iggled with the trauma assessment tended to be more fragile before tbe interview than women who did not. and women who bad experienced interpersonal violence during tbe preceding 6 months showed greater emotion. No interviewer reported that any woman refused the trauma history assesstnent. Only I site reported adverse events related to the WCDVS version of the LSC-R to their institutional review board (IRB); 3 such events were reported; none bad long-term negative eonsequences. Another site reierred 2 women for clinical services as a result of minor distress expressed during the trauma assessment. Thus, oul of roughly 60(K) baseline and follow-up interviews, there were only a handful of ciises where special consideriilions were necessary. Interviewers reported that they appreciated that women were not asked to tell their stories or probed for details, and that the items progressed from less intrusive to more intrusive events. Some interviewers said that it was difficult to hear about the traumatic experiences of the women they Assessment of Trauma History in Women McHUGO et al. 121interviewed, but as they became more experienced, they felt that the interviews became easier to administer. Although avoiding the details of traumatic events is protective of respondents and interviewers, a few interviewers felt uncomfortable asking women about such events without giving them an opportunity to tell their stories. Lifetime and current experiences of stressful events Table 1 presents the frequency statistics for the 31 specific items of the WCDVS version of the LSC-R. The lifetime frequencies from the baseline interview (A^ = 2729) range from 9.7% for the death of a child to 87.1% for money problems. Other low-frequency (<20%) lifetime events were having a handicapped child and being the victim of a hate crime. Other high-frequency (>80%) lifetime events were loss of a loved one. emotional abuse, and physical abuse. Some of these exposures occurred in the past 6 months. The current frequencies range from 0.6% for death of a child to 65.2% for money problems. Other low-frequency (<5%) current events were experiencing a disaster, being in a serious accident, having an abortion or a miscarriage, and being the victim of a bate crime. Other high-frequency (>30%) cunent events were homelessness, having a serious physical or mental illness, becoming separated against her will from a child, and emotional abuse. Test-retest reliability of Ihe WCDVS version of the LSC-R Table I also presents the test-retest reliability statistics for the specific items, based on the retest sample {n \u2014 186). Tbe percent absolute agreement is presented to indicate obtained levels of agree- ment, and K. which reflects the chance-corrected level of agreement, is presented as the index of reliability. All of tbe lifetime items exceed published criteria for acceptable reliability based on K (>0.40). and many show high levels of agreement between test and retest.'*' In general, test-retest reliability based on K was lower for the current items, although the percent absolute agreement was seldom lower than 90%, a discrepancy that is likely due to low base rates.'^ Kappa for 4 items was below 0.40, but most were moderate to high, indicating good test-retest reliability for reports of recent stressful events. Open-ended questions are not designed for test-retest reliability, and no standard method of calcu- lating their reliability exists. Yet there was interest in examining the correspondence between test and retest responses to the final item. In the test-retest sample of 186 women, 134 (72%) did not answer this item at either administration. Of the 52 women who answered it at one or both administrations, the pattem of responses was 20 at both, 16 at test only, and 16 at retest only. Of the 20 who answered at botb administrations. 9 gave responses with identical content both times, 7 gave responses that overlapped partially, and 4 gave responses that were completely different. Summary variables The distributions of the lifetime summary variables {LESE, LFIA. FCA) had good properties, with means centered within tbe range and good variability (Table 2). The intraclass correlation coefficient was computed as an index of test-retest reliability for continuous measures.'\" The lifetime summary variables showed high test-retest reliability. On average, women in the WCDVS reported exposure to about half of the 31 stressful events in tbeir lifetimes (LESE mean \u2014 16.32. with a range from 2 to 30). The scales for current exposure {CEIA and CEOS) had lower test-retest reliability, although it was still acceptable. On average, the women reported about I exposure to interpersonal abuse and about 3 exposures to other stressors during the past 6 months. Table 3 presents the frequencies and the test-retest statistics for the 4 indicator variables. The frequencies indicate very high rates in all 4 abuse categories among the women in the WCDVS study group, and test-retest reliability (K) is moderate to high for these 4 indicator variables. 122 The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research 32:2 April/June 2005Table 2 Descriptive and test-retest (intraclass correlation ciK'fficient) statistics for the summary variables from the WCDVS version of the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised' Summary variable Mean SD RangeIntraclass cor relation coefficient Lifetime exposure to stressful events (LESE) Lifetime frequency of interpersonal abuse (LFIA) Frequency of childhood abuse (FCA) Current exposure to interpersonal abuse (CEIA) Current exposure to other sircssors item: Coding 1 and II The item-by-ilem specilicalions for the WCDVS comprehensive interview instructed interviewers to record the response to the open-ended itetn verbatim and tti record the event even if it tits into an earlier question. At baseline, 583 (2! .36%) of 2729 women described \"other\" events. There are several reasons why women may have reported events appropriate to the specific items in response to the final, open-ended item. One reason is not understanding the close-ended item that covered (heir response. Some instances of differential understanding may be due to the .structure of 14 items, which contain a parenthetical clarification that was read only if a woman asked about the question's meaning. For instance, the parenthetical to the item about ever having a serious physical or menial illness includes \"tried to kill yourself as an example, but some women's responses to final item mention their suicidality or suicide attempts. The final item also offered some women an opportunity to tell their \"story\" by naming or recounting traumatic events that they had experienced. Other women may have described an event because they felt that its emotional weight, or some nuance of its meaning or nature, was not fully captured by any of the preceding questions. Some of the responses to the final item suggest that women were conveying the complexity or muliifaceted nature of the event or .series of events, which are qualities not captured in the close-ended questions. Many resptmses to the final item concerned experiences closely related to those covered by the specific items, but they included additional dimensions. Examples include sexual harassment outside the context of work or school, and harassment that was not experienced as sexual in content. Two questions for which additional dimensions were frequent were death of a child (/; = 8; 1.49^ of the 583 responses) and death ul someone close to the respondent other than her child (\u00ab = 73: 12.5% Table 3 Descriptive and test-retest statistics for the indicator variables based on the WCDVS version of the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised* indicator variable Frequency \"yes\" (% yes) % absolute agreement Childhood sexual abuse Childhood physical abuse Adulthood sexual abuse Adulthood physical abuse1688(62.0) the Women, Co-occurring Disorders, and Violence Study. Assessment of Trauma History in Women McHUGO et al.of the 583 responses). These additional dimensions included dealh by suicide, murder, accident, or disaster; death that the respondent was present at or witnessed; multiple losses; and death followed by the respondent finding or seeing tbe body. Many responses to the final item were similar to the two specific items concerning sexual abuse (Table 1: items 29 and 30). Because some women may not attach the word \"rape\" or \"incest\" to their experiences, neither word was included in these specific items, but without the inclusion of these words, some women found that these items did not capture their experiences. In tbe words of one woman when asked about other stressful events, \"I consider my rape and kidnapping something you didn't specifically get to.\" A number of women mentioned incest or molestation by a relative in response to the final item. The wording of the specific question about forced penetrative sex (Table I: item 30; \"Did you ever have sex...?\"') may have implied aetive participation on the respondent's part tbat she did not feel oecurred. An interviewer noted that a respondent identified a rape in the final item but did not include it in response to the specific item, because \"that question was about having sex when you did not want to. not rape.\" These events may also have been reported in the final item because respondents did not consider them to have involved either the force or threat that is explicit in the specific item, or they did not consider forced penetration to be \"sex.\" Final item: Coding III Using grounded theory, tbe Trauma Measures Qualitative Workgroup identified a number of themes that are either not among or not closely related to the events covered in the specific items. These themes include (I) a number of events or experiences of tbe respondent (eg. risky sexual behavior, self-hann). (2) experiences of the respondent's children (eg. respondent abused her children, someone else abused her children, respondent abandoned her children). (3) other violence perpetrated by the respondent (eg, respondent killed someone). (4) issues related to the respondent's natal family (eg. mental illness of a parent), (51 ihe respondent being falsely accused or not believed, and (6) the respondent keeping seerets or fearing negative consequences of telling the truth. A stressful personal experience that 18 of 583 (3%) reported in answer to tbe final question was being kidnapped or abducted. Discussion The findings indicate tbat the WCDVS version of the LSC-R was well received by respondents and interviewers, asks about stressful life events that are common to women in the target population, andhasgood test-retest reliability (temporal stability). The relevance oftbe items to the experiences of the women can be inferred from the high rates of endorsement of single items and membership in all 4 abuse categories. The test retest reliabilities for single items were similar to those found in other studies with similar populations.'''^ The summary variables were also temporally stable (high test-retest reliability) and had good measurement properties. By combining quantitative and qualitative information, the WCDVS findings document not only the prevalence of these stressful events but also tbe complexity of the lives of women witb co-occurring disorders. Most responses to the final item concerned events covered in specific items or captured additional dimensions of an event covered in a specific item. If anything, therefore, the responses to the final, open-ended question suggest that some specific items are undercounted rather than overcounted. All women in tbe WCDVS reported, when being screened for eligibility, that they had accessed services for substance use or mental health problems on at least 2 previous occasions. The duration of eaeb previous contact could bave been as short as a single office visit. All women in tbe study also endorsed an item on the common eligibility screening instrument tbat asked if she had ever been physically or sexually abused. This does not mean that the women in the study bad previously been assessed for trauma or had previously received counseling in any format for their trauma. Information from site interviewers and clinicians and from responses to the open-ended question 124 The Jouriuil of liehiiviaral Health .Services & Research 32:2 April/June 2005in the WCDVS version of the LSC-R indicated that some of ihe women had never revealed their irauniaiic experiences priitr lo iheir participaiion in ihe WCDVS. had never received treainient ihai addressed iheir iraunu prior to the WCDVS. Thus, women in the WCDVS represent a large, demographically and geographically diverse sample with varying degrees of current substance use and mental health symptoms and varying frequencies of past and current stressful life experiences. In addition, they had received and were receiving varying amounts of services, including treatment for trauma, in a variety of settings. This suggests that findings concerning the lifeiime prevalence and the past 6 months' incidence of stressful events are broadly generalizable to trealnioni-seeking women aged 18 and older who have co-occurring substance use and menial health disorders and a history' of interpersonal violence. Despite convenience, clusteretl sampling in WCDVS. the broad eligibility criteria, the large sample size, and the site diversity support the wide applicability of the WCDVS version ot the LSC-R for the assessment of trauma among women accessing public-sector services for substance abuse and menial health treatment and rehabilitation. Overall. WCDVS data on Ihe LSC-R support the conclusion of Newman and colleagues that women \"expressed few adverse reactions to the inquiry, and in many ca.ses. derived hcnctit from participation in the study.\"''' The WCDVS version of ihe LSC-R was well tolerated hy participants and liked hy inten iewers. There were many reports of positive reactions to it. and there were very few adverse reactions. Diversity among the WCDVS study pariicipants in terms of severity of previous and current trauma, whether or not they had ever been assessed for trauma or previously revealed their stressful life experiences (\"told their story\"), ami intensity of both prior and current treatment suggests thai the WCDVS versionof the LSC-R wouklbe well tolerated by mosl wonicn willi trauma histories. Because researchers and IRBs arc obligated to follow the principals of nonmalfeasance and benelicence. it is important to examine tolerance of trauma history assessments such as the WCDVS version of the LSC-R. The data gathered through the survey of interviewers indicate the value of multiple strategies for collecting information on study participants' tolerance of trauma history assessment. The WCDVS participant interviews wt)uld have benetitcd from the inclusion of self-report items on reactions to the trauma assessment. Six recommendations for the JTiiprovenient of the WCDVS version of the LSC-R emerged from the Trauma Measures Qualitative Workgroup's analysis of baseline responses to the tiiial item. First. parenthetical examples and clarilications contained in speciiic items should be either dropped or included directly in the questions. To prevent respondents from taking examples as exhaustive rather ihan illustrative, they should be preceded by phrasing such as. \"Some examples of the kinds of events this question covers are...\" Second, based on the frequency of open-ended responses that noted added dimensions ol\" the tleaih of a child or of someone else close lo the respt)ndent. these dimensions should be added as specific probes following an affiniiative answer to either question. The thirJ recommendation concerns one of the specitic questions about physical abuse (Table 1: item 21). Some instances of physical abuse in which the jK;rpetrator was not well known to the respondent were missed because physical abuse by a stranger was included with being robbed or mugged. Separating physical ahusc hy a stranger from a robbery or mugging would elicit a broader range of reported events. The fourth recommendation is that the scope of several specific questions should be expanded. The specitic item about the separation or divorce of parents pertains only to legally married par- ent.s. Similarly, another speciiic item asks whether the respondent has \"ever been separated or di- vorced?\" Some women who answered either of these items in the affimiative may have been counting partnerships that were not legal, whereas other women may have saved such instances for the final item. The specific item about serious money problems includes the example of not having enough money to pay the rent, but it does not include not having enough money to pay ihe mortgage. The specific item about being \"strip searched, forcihly restrained, or held against your will by a provider of mental health or substance abuse services\" could include representatives of any sort of service or Assessment of Trauma History in Women McHUGO et at. 125official agency, including corrections officers and members of the clergy. Women's responses to the final item also indicated other reasons for discrimination and other contexts for sexual harassment. The Jtf!h recommendation is lo add a specihc question about kidnapping and abduction, whether by a stranger or someone known well. Finally, the high frequency of respon.ses to the final item that were coded as sexual abuse indicates that these 2 specilic items require revision (Table 1: items 28 and 29). Although not using the term.s 'molestation,'\" \"'childhood sexual abuse.\" \"rape,'\" and \"incest\"\" in specific items may prevent undercounting among women who do not apply them to their own experiences, it may lead to undercounting among women who do. As one woman said in response to the final, open-ended item at the 12-month loliow-up, '\"I think rape should be a specific question...\"' On tbe basis of these recommendations and otber experiences during the WCDVS, a workgroup is revising the WCDVS version of the LSC-R further to increase the clarity and scope of the items, and, consequently, to increase reliability and validity (content validity and construct validity). Copies of the revised WCDVS version of the LSC-R will be available from the original author.' Implications for Behavioral Health Tbe WCDVS version of the LSC-R provides researchers and service providers with a trauma history assessment that is especially appropriate for women who have substance use and mental health problems and who have a history of interpersonal violence and ahuse. This version of the LSC-R is appropriate for research where a trauma assessment is needed that is comprehensive and has good psychometric properties but is not distressing to respondents. The summary variables used in the WCDVS, or variations on them, may be especially useful for research where the specific details of trauma history are less important than glohal measures of exposure and severity. The WCDVS version of the LSC-R is also appropriate as an initial assessment of trauma history in clinical settings, where in-depth follow-up assessments would be used to determine post-traumatic diagnoses or to prepare for trauma-specific treatments. In addition, tbe findings from tbis study can be used to reassure IRBs and other stakeholders concerning the minimal risks associated with the assessment of trauma history. More broadly, tbe WCDVS highlighted the value of involving consumers in developing and tailoring assessments to .special populations. It also showed that trauma history assessment can be tolerated well, and even regarded positively, despite the vulnerabilities of tbe target population. As service systems and single agencies move toward trauma-informed and trauma-specific services, the need to assess both pa.st and recent trauma history will increase accordingly. The WCDVS version of the LSC-R offers a safe and reliable assessment of trauma exposure and life stressors. wbich will enable improved treatment and rehabilitation strategies and lead to better outcomes for women with co-occurring disorders.

Received for publication January 13, 2005; accepted for publication April 7, 2005. Declines in coronary disease and stroke mortality have occurred, but it remains unclear whether intermittent claudication (IC) incidence and mortality rates have changed. The authors sought to examine long-term trends for IC in the community. Cases of IC among Framingham Study participants aged ~40 years were classified according to date of onset from the 1950s to the 1990s. IC was defined as the presence of exertional calf discomfort that was relieved with rest. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression, and 1O-yearsurvival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. IC occurred in 668 participants (286 women). The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of IC fell from 282 per 100,000 person-years during the period 1950\u00ad 1969 to 225 per 100,000 person-years in the 1990s. The decline in IC incidence across time periods was significant (p for trend = 0.01), with an initial increase in the 1970s being followed by declines of 16% in the 1980s and 18% in the 1990s. Approximately 40% of persons with IC died within 10 years of diagnosis, with no significant change occurring during the study period. IC incidence has declined since 1950, but mortality has remained high and unchanged. Factors contributing to the declining incidence of IC need clarification. cardiovascular diseases; intermittent claudication; mortality Abbreviations: CVD, cardiovascular disease; PAD, peripheral arterial disease. Intermittent claudication is a symptomatic expression of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a highly prevalent athero\u00ad sclerotic condition affecting more than 5 million persons in the United States (1). Claudication is associated with increased risks of mortality, nonfatal cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and cerebro\u00ad vascular disease), and impaired lower extremity function (2\u00ad 6). All major CVD risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and an elevated cholesterol level, are associated with increased risk of intermittent claudication (7-9). It is unclear whether or not the incidence of intermittent claudica\u00ad tion is declining in the US population in response to changes in smoking behavior and increased awareness and treatment of hypertension and elevated blood cholesterol (10-12). Recent national data have shown a relatively low aware\u00ad ness of PAD among primary care physicians and less inten\u00adsive treatments for modifiable risk factors in persons with the disease as compared with persons with other manifes\u00adtations of CVD (13). Thus, given that secondary prevention efforts are utilized less in PAD patients, it is uncertain whether survival following the onset of intermittent claudi\u00ad cation has improved in parallel with improvements in sur\u00ad vival following the onset of other CVDs such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure (14, 15). Although antiplatelet drug therapies effectively reduce fatal ischemic events in patients with PAD (16), these therapies, as well as other secondary prevention efforts, appear to be underuti\u00ad lized in patients with the disease (13). We examined temporal trends in intermittent claudication incidence and subsequent survival among participants in the Framingham Heart Study during the time interval from 1950 through 1999. Since its inception, the Framingham Heart Correspondence to Dr. Joanne M.

Study has used standardized criteria in the ascertainment of intermittent claudication, and the study cohorts have been monitored continuously with respect to vital status and the occurrence of CVD endpoints. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study sample The Framingham Heart Study was established in 1948, enrolling 5,209 men and women aged 28-62 years in a pro\u00ad spective epidemiologic cohort study. Members of the origi\u00ad nal cohort have undergone follow-up examinations every 2 years. In 1971,5,124 offspring of the original cohort mem\u00ad bers and offspring spouses ranging in age from 5 years to 70 years were enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study. Follow-up examinations are conducted approximately every 4 years. Study design and entry criteria have been reported elsewhere (17-20). Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants, and the institutional review board of Boston Medical Center approved the examination content for both the original cohort and offspring examinations. Ascertainment of Intermittent claudication At each original cohort and offspring cohort examination, intermittent claudication was assessed using a standardized physician-administered questionnaire (8) that asked about the presence of exertional calf discomfort related to rapidity of walking or uphill walking and whether symptoms were relieved with rest. A second physician independently inter\u00ad viewed all participants suspected to have claudication. A review panel comprising three Framingham Heart Study investigators examined all available evidence (including hospital records and personal physician office records) and made the final diagnostic determination of the presence of intermittent claudication. The diagnosis was adjudicated solely on the basis of medical history. Confirmation with ankle-brachial blood pressure testing was not available. If the exact date of onset of claudication was unavailable, the midpoint between the date of the last symptom-free Heart Study examination and the date of the Heart Study exami\u00ad nation at which claudication was identified was assigned. Persons with intermittent claudication at study entry were excluded. Lower extremity bypass, lower extremity angio\u00ad plasty, and lower extremity amputation for ischemia were not considered, since these data were not available at all Heart Study examinations and thus could not be compared across all decades. Measurement of risk factors and Identification of CVDs Each Heart Study examination included a standardized medical history interview, a physical examination, labora\u00ad tory testing, and electrocardiography. Blood pressure was measured twice by the examining physician with the par\u00ad ticipant in the seated position. Two blood pressure mea\u00ad surements were averaged to determine the presence of hypertension. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 2140 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg,or the use of antihypertensive medication. Height and weight were obtained using standard protocols, and body mass index was defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Participants were asked whether they had smoked cigarettes regularly during the year pre\u00ad ceding each examination, and if the answer was yes, the number of cigarettes smoked per day was recorded. Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose level of 2126 mg/dl, a nonfasting blood glucose level of 2200 mg/dl, or the use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication. Elevated blood cholesterol was defined as a total cholesterol level of 2240 mgldl or the use of cholesterol-lowering medication. New CVD events were identified at each examination on the basis of a medical history interview, physical examina\u00adtion findings, electrocardiography, and review of outside medical records (hospital records, personal physicians' re\u00ad cords, and death certificates). A review panel of three phy\u00ad sician investigators (or a panel of study neurologists for cerebrovascular outcomes) examined all available evidence and made the final determination of events using established Framingham Heart Study criteria. CVD outcomes included angina, coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction, con\u00ad gestive heart failure, intermittent claudication, stroke and transient ischemic attack, and death from cardiovascular causes. Statistical analysis Cases of intermittent claudication among participants aged 40 years or older were grouped by date of onset: 1950-1969 (191 cases), 1970-1979 (191 cases), 1980-1989 (148 cases), and 1990-1999 (138 cases). Because crude trends were similar in men and women and there were no significant age-sex interactions, we pooled men and women for all analyses. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of intermittent claudication and 95 percent confidence inter\u00ad vals for each time period were calculated using the direct method. Log-linear Poisson regression (pROC GENMOD in SAS) was used to estimate sex-and age-adjusted rate ratios for intermittent claudication incidence during the I 970s, 1980s, and 1990s, with the 1950-1969 time period being used as the reference period (21). A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We conducted prespecified subgroup analyses to examine whether the time period effects for intermittent claudication incidence differed by 1) smoking status (ever smoking vs. never smoking) or 2) prevalent CVD at diagnosis of inter\u00ad mittent claudication (yes/no). We chose to examine smoking status given the importance of this risk factor in the risk of intermittent claudication. Furthermore, prior work demon\u00ad strated a decline in the prevalence and incidence of claudi\u00ad cation in association with a decline in smoking among Icelandic men between 1968 and 1986 (22). Stratification by baseline CVD allowed us to explore possible differences in intermittent claudication incidence related to primary versus secondary prevention efforts over time (a decline in claudication incidence among persons free of CVD would suggest primary prevention effects, whereas declines in claudication incidence in persons with CVD would suggest secondary prevention effects).

The log-rank test was used to test for homogeneity across strata. Risk factor profiles over the time periods of study for persons with incident intermittent claudication were com\u00ad pared using data from the last examination attended prior to the diagnosis. Adjustment for sex and 5-year age group was performed using the direct method. Time trends in risk factors in the full sample of men and women at risk of intermittent claudication were also examined; for each participant, risk factor values for all examinations attended within each time period were averaged. Linear regression, adjusting for 5-year age group and sex, was used to obtain least-squares mean values for each risk factor according to time period. RESULTS From 1950 through 1999, intermittent claudication oc\u00ad curred in 668 participants (43 percent women). The mean age at diagnosis of claudication was 61 years in the 1950\u00ad 1969 time period; it rose to 69 years in the 1990-1999 time period. Age- and sex-adjusted risk factors for eVD at the time of diagnosis with intermittent claudication for each time period are shown in table 1. The majority of persons diagnosed with intermittent claudication were current or former cigarette smokers, and pack-years of smoking in\u00ad creased with each successive time period. Of note, from 1950 to 1969, 32 percent of cases with intermittent claudi\u00ad cation had never smoked, but in the 1990-1999 time pe\u00ad riod, only 25 percent of intermittent claudication cases were never smokers. Among claudication cases, the preva\u00ad lences of diabetes, obesity (body mass index >30), use of cholesterol-lowering medication, and hypertension in\u00ad creased across time periods. Age- and sex-adjusted preva\u00ad lent eVD was present in approximately 40-60 percent of cases in the later time periods, as compared with only 27 percent of cases in the referent period. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of intermittent claudication in the 1950-1969 referent period was 282 per 100,000 person-years. In the 1970s, the rate rose to 345 per 100,000 person-years; it then fell in the 1980s and 1990s to 243 per 100,000 person-years and 225 per 100,000 person\u00ad years, respectively (figure I). The results of age- and sex\u00ad adjusted log-linear Poisson regression analyses are shown in table 2. Overall, the incidence of intermittent claudication fell by 16 percent in the 1980s and by 18 percent in the 1990s relative to the 1950-1969 period (for trend across time periods, p = 0.01). Never smokers experienced a steeper decline in intermittent claudication incidence across the time periods than ever smokers (42 percent vs. 20 percent, respectively). In the subgroup of subjects with\u00ad out prevalent eVD, the incidence of intermittent claudica\u00ad tion was 20 percent lower in the 1990-1999 time period than in 1950-1969 (p for trend = 0.035), whereas in subjects with prevalent eVD, no significant decline in the incidence of claudication was observed (p for trend = 0.31). Temporal trends in risk factors from 1950 to 1999 among subjects at risk of developing intermittent claudication are shown in table 3.

Bars, 95% confidence interval. diabetes, obesity, and antihypertensive treatment increased, whereas the prevalences of current smoking and high blood cholesterol declined in the study population over the four time periods. Of note, the prevalence of diabetes increased dramatically among persons with prevalent CVD, from 7 percent in the 1950-1969 time period to 22 percent in the 1990-1999 time period. The prevalence of CVD in the full sample was 12 percent in the first three time periods and II percent in the 1990-1999 time period. Survival following the onset of intermittent claudication remained unchanged over the course of the study (figure 2) (p = 0.27). By 10 years following the onset of intermittent claudication, nearly 40 percent of claudicants in all time periods had died. In subgroup analyses, no significant differ\u00ad ences in mortality after claudication onset across time peri\u00ad ods were observed in never or ever smokers or in claudicants with or without prevalent CVD at the time of intermittent claudication diagnosis. DISCUSSION The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of intermittent clau\u00ad dication in our population-based sample declined by 16-18 percent in the 1980s and 1990s in comparison with the period 1950-1969. The decline in intermittent claudication incidence was steeper among never smokers, with rates in the 1990s being over 40 percent lower than rates in 1950\u00ad 1969. Smokers may have experienced less of a decline in intermittent claudication incidence than nonsmokers, be\u00ad cause some of the smoking-related adverse effects on the arterial wall may be cumulative and irreversible (23). By the time smokers enter middle age, the thickness of the periph\u00ad eral arterial wall is already greater than that of nonsmokers (24). In our sample, the incidence of intermittent claudica\u00ad tion also declined significantly among persons without prev\u00ad alent CVD, suggesting that primary prevention efforts aimed at modifying risk factors were successful. Among persons at risk of intermittent claudication who were free of CVD, rates of smoking and high cholesterol decreased whereas blood pressure treatment rates increased during the latter two decades of our study (table 3). In the Reykjavik Study, declines in intermittent claudication among men from 1968 to 1986 have been linked to declines in smoking and serum cholesterol (22). Despite reports that persons with CVD were more likely to receive treatment for risk factors (13), we did not find a significant decline in incidence of claudication among those with prevalent CVD. The reasons for the lack of im\u00ad provement in claudication incidence among persons with CVD over the calendar decades studied are unclear. Al\u00ad though rates of smoking and high cholesterol decreased and blood pressure treatment increased greatly, prevalences of diabetes and obesity among persons with prevalent CVD progressively increased across calendar time. It is possible that emerging medical and surgical therapies for CVD over time resulted in improved overall function among persons with CVD. The improvement in function may have allowed participants to walk a distance great enough to develop symptoms of claudication, whereas in the past persons with CVD may have been too functionally limited by symptoms TABLE 2.

Furthermore, survival following the on\u00ad set of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease has improved, which may have permitted participants to FIGURE 2.

Shown are the results of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis adjusted for sex and age group at diagnosis of intermittent claudication. AmJ Epidemiol 2005;162:1-8 develop claudication. The increasing prevalence of diabetes among persons with prevalent CVD. along with improve\u00ad ments in CVD treatment and survival over the time periods studied, may have resulted in the lack of significant im\u00ad provement in incidence of intermittent claudication among persons with prevalent CVD in our study. No temporal improvement in survival after the onset of claudication was observed. Approximately 40 percent of claudicants died within 10 years of onset in all time periods. The lack of improvement in survival following the diagnosis of intermittent claudication contrasts with the significant decline observed in rates of sudden and nonsudden cardiac death (25), as well as observed declines in mortality follow\u00ad ing the onset of other CVDs, including myocardialinfarc\u00ad tion, congestive heart failure, and stroke in the community (14, 15, 26, 27). Heart disease and stroke have been the focus of national prevention programs, with education ef\u00ad forts being directed at both physicians and the general pub\u00ad lic, whereas PAD has not yet emerged as a target for a national public health campaign. Recent national data demonstrate that PAD is underdiag\u00ad nosed in the primary care setting; with the exception of smoking, risk factors are less intensively treated in persons with PAD than in persons with other types of CVD (13). Survey data from primary care physicians, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons suggest that deficiencies in physician knowledge and attitude play an important role in the lower 6 Murabito et al. intensity of risk factor modification efforts in PAD patients (28). It appears that PAD patients do not fully appreciate the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with their disease and the benefits of risk factor reduction (29). Mis\u00ad perceptions on the part of PAD patients may contribute to the lower rates of risk factor control. Only a small number of randomized controlled trials of CVD risk reduction have been carried out in persons with PAD. Nevertheless, data support the beneficial effects of antiplatelet therapies and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapies on car\u00ad diovascular outcomes in PAD patients (16, 30, 31). More\u00ad over, in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, lipid\u00ad lowering therapy with simvastatin in coronary heart disease patients resulted in a 38 percent reduction in new or wors\u00ad ening intermittent claudication (32), and a review of ran\u00ad domized trials of lipid-lowering therapies in PAD patients demonstrated a marked but nonsignificant reduction in mor\u00ad tality (odds ratio = 0.2, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.03, 1.17) associated with treatment (33). More recently, results of the Heart Protection Study demonstrated that simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major vascular events by approximately 25 percent among persons with PAD (34). Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis of persons with vascu\u00ad lar disease, including PAD, simvastatin substantially re\u00ad duced the risk of stroke (35). Intensive blood pressure control in persons with both diabetes and PAD has been shown to be associated with a marked reduction in CVD events (36). These data suggest a beneficial role for modi\u00ad fication of high blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure in persons with PAD. Despite existing evidence demonstrating a clear benefit, antiplatelet therapies have been prescribed less frequently in PAD patients than in pa\u00ad tients with other CVDs (13). Barriers to effective secondary prevention of CVD probably explain, in large part, the lack of improvement in survival among claudicants in recent decades, given that the majority of deaths among persons with the disease are due to coronary and cerebrovascular causes (2-4, 7). Smoking is the single most important risk factor for PAD (7,37,38), and it is associated with disease progression and risk of limb amputation. Although, in our study, the decline in incidence of intermittent claudication was seen in both ever smokers and never smokers, the magnitude of the de\u00ad cline was greater in persons who had never smoked. The declining trend in intermittent claudication in the later de\u00ad cades is not surprising, given the concurrent decline in cig\u00ad arette smoking in the population at risk. In the 1990s, the prevalence of current smoking in our study sample was 17 percent, less than half that observed in the 1950-1969 time period. Smoking cessation in the Quebec Cardiovascular Study was associated with a decline in risk of intermittent claudication such that men who stopped smoking for I year had a risk of claudication similar to that of nonsmokers (37). In the Reykjavik Study, a prospective study of Icelandic men, Ingolfsson et al. (22) also reported a marked decline in incidence and prevalence of claudication from 1968 to 1986 in association with a decline in smoking rates and a lowering of cholesterol levels in Iceland. However, other studies have demonstrated a persistent elevation in risk of PAD among former smokers (39). In addition to smoking, all other major CVD risk factors have been shown to be associated with risk of claudication (7). Thus, national ef\u00ad forts aimed at detection, treatment, and control of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol have probably contributed to the observed decline in the incidence of in\u00ad termittent claudication in our study. Of concern is recent national survey data demonstrating an increasing prevalence of multiple risk factors among adult men and women in the US population (40), which in tum may lead to a reversal of gains made in decreasing CVD incidence. Our study had a number of potential limitations. First, the Framingham Study sample is not nationally representative and is primarily Caucasian; results may not be generalizable to other racial or ethnic groups. Studies of racially diverse samples have observed a higher prevalence of PAD among non-Hispanic Blacks than among Whites (1, 41, 42). Sec\u00ad ond, we studied intermittent claudication diagnosed only by classical medical history and did not have confirmatory test\u00ad ing. Thus, misclassification is possible, but diagnostic crite\u00ad ria remained the same over the decades studied. Any misclassification would therefore be expected to be random and result in a bias toward the null. Perhaps more impor\u00ad tantly, most persons with PAD are asymptomatic (41, 43\u00ad 45); some have atypical leg discomfort (46, 47), and others stop walking to prevent symptom onset. Our study was only able to observe incidence and mortality trends for the frac\u00ad tion of persons with PAD who develop classical symptoms. Finally, there have only been a few randomized controlled treatment trials in persons with PAD from which to establish the benefit of antiplatelet and risk factor reduction therapies (16, 31-36). Prior to these trials, physicians needed to ex\u00ad trapolate treatment benefits from observations in patients with CVD. We would not have been able to observe any recent improvements in mortality following the onset of claudication that may have occurred in response to the latest trial results. In conclusion, the incidence of intermittent claudication has declined in the general population over the past 50 years, but mortality following the onset of claudication has not improved; approximately 40 percent of persons with intermittent claudication died within 10 years in all time periods studied. Improvements in primary and secondary prevention to modify CVD risk factors and increasing uti\u00ad lization of effective therapies in persons with PAD are needed.

Parental CVD doubles the risk of CVD in adult off- spring. 2A seminal report by Maren- berg et al3established increased risk for death from coronary heart disease in twins. Risk associated with CVD in sib- lings in multiplex families is less because published estimates arelargely derived from lack sibling CVD event validation. 4-6Furthermore, estimates re- garding magnitude of risk associated with a history of sibling CVD vary greatly. Some studies have reported CVD risk similar to that conferred bya history of parental CVD 5,7; others have described much greater CVD risk in re- lation to sibling history than in rela- tion to parental history.6 Accurate information about familial CVD will have increasing importance in prevention and treatment of CVD in the post-genome era.8Recent national sur-vey data document that adults believe family history information is impor-tant to their health, but few have sys-tematically collected this informationfrom relatives. 9Recall bias, especially for premature CVD in the family, may re- Author Affiliations: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Framingham Heart Study, Framingham, Mass (Drs Murabito, Pencina, Nam, D'Agostino, Wang,and O'Donnell); Section of General Internal Medi-cine, School of Medicine (Dr Murabito) and Statisticsand Consulting Unit (Drs Pencina, Nam, andD'Agostino), Boston University, Boston, Mass; Car- diology Division, Department of Medicine, Massa- chusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School,Boston (Dr Wang); Department and Bluhm Cardiovascular sion of Cardiology, Feinberg of North-western University, Ill (Dr Lloyd-Jones); De-partments of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and MedicalGenetics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charles-ton (Dr Wilson); and National Heart, Lung, and BloodInstitute, Bethesda, Md (Dr O'Donnell).

Objective To determine, using validated events, whether sibling CVD predicts out- come in middle-aged adults independent of other risk factors.Design, Setting, and Participants The Framingham Offspring Study, an incep- tion cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, a prospective population-based cohort study initiated in 1948 with the offspring cohort initiated in 1971. Participants (n = 2475)were members of the offspring cohort aged 30 years or older, free of CVD, and withat least 1 sibling in the study; all were followed up for 8 years. Main Outcome Measures Association of sibling CVD with 8-year personal risk for CVD using pooled logistic regression. A secondary analysis restricted to offspring with both parents in the study assessed the joint impact of parental and sibling CVDoccurrence. Results Among 973 person-examinations in the sibling CVD group (mean age, 57 years) and 4506 person-examinations in the no sibling CVD group (mean age, 47 years), 329 CVD events occurred during follow-up. Baseline risk factors were more prevalent in thesibling CVD group compared with the no sibling CVD group. Sibling CVD was associ-ated with a not substantially attenuate the risk (adjusted OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.91). In theanalysis restricted to persons with both parents in the study, in models adjusting for bothsibling and parental CVD, the multivariable-adjusted OR for 1.02-2.05). Conclusion Using validated events, sibling CVD conferred increased risk of future CVD events above and beyond established risk factors and parental CVD in middle- aged adults.

We fur-ther sought to examine the impact ofsibling CVD over and above that of pa- rental CVD. METHODS Study Sample and Definitions In 1971, 5124 participants (offspring of the original Framingham Heart Studycohort and offspring spouses) aged 5to 70 years were enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study, a pro-spective epidemiologic cohort study. 16,17 The offspring cohort included 3498 par- ticipants who were members of an iden-tified Framingham Study family. Par-ticipants have undergone follow-upexaminations approximately every 4 years since study inception. Study de-sign and entry criteria for both the off-spring cohort and the original cohortof the Framingham Heart Study havebeen previously reported. 16,18All par- ticipants provided written informed consent at each examination at-tended, and all study protocols were re- viewed by the institutional review board at Boston Medical Center. Data from 4 offspring examina- tions, each with 8 years of follow-up,were pooled: offspring cohort exami-nations 1 (1971 to 1975), 2 (1979 to1982), 4 (1987 to 1990), and 6 (1995to September 2, 1998). Follow-up forthe final examination cohort ended inDecember 2004. Since the first and sec-ond examinations were about 8 years apart, to ascertain comparable lengthsof follow-up after each of the 4 exami- nations, we chose to examine the 8-yearoccurrence of CVD events. All off-spring participants who were mem-bers of a Framingham Study family andwere aged 30 years and older at any ofthe 4 examinations were eligible for in-clusion in our study if they had at least1 sibling enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study and if they were freeof CVD at the time of examination(thus, the posi-tive CVD occurrence was excluded)(F ). In addition, we ex- cluded 1 sibling from families with nosibling CVD to provide comparable structure between families with andwithout CVD. Our final studysample men) contributing 973 per- son-examinations from in a family with sibling CVD and 4506 per-son-examinations from participants ina family without (Figure).

All CVD events (bothsibling events and incident events oc-curring in participants in the study sample) were adjudicated by a panel of 3 senior investigators (or a panel ofstudy neurologists for cerebrovascu-lar disease events) who were unawareof sibling CVD status, using standard-ized criteria previously reported. 19 Parental occurrence of premature CVD was available in a subsample of off- spring participants with both parents en- rolled in the original Framingham co- hort (Figure). Parental events wereadjudicated using the same protocol andstandardized criteria. Parental prema- ture CVD was defined as the occur- rence of a validated parental event priorto an offspring examination and beforeage 55 years in fathers or age 65 yearsin mothers. These age cut points werederived from existing guidelines regard-ing family history of premature CVD. 20 Risk factors were measured at each examination. Height and weight were obtained by trained technicians, and body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by thesquare of height in meters. Blood pres-sure was measured twice at rest by the examining physician, and the mean of the 2 blood pressure readings was used.Hypertension was defined as systolicblood pressure of 140 mm Hg orgreater, diastolic blood pressure of 90mm Hg or greater, or use of antihyper-tensive medication. Current smoking was defined as smoking 1 or more ciga-rettes per day in the year preceding ex-amination. Blood was obtained in thefasting state, and the ratio of total cho-lesterol to high-density lipoprotein cho-lesterol was calculated. The presence ofdiabetes was defined by a fasting glu-cose level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)or greater or use of insulin or oral hy-poglycemic agents. Statistical Analysis Pooled logistic regression analyses weighted for sibship size were used toexamine the risks of incident CVD events associated with the occurrenceof sibling CVD. The fac-tors and events and hasbeen shown to provide estimates ofeffect similar to those provided by time-dependent Cox analyses. 21A weight for family size was used to diminish bias related to differences in the number of siblings across families. For all logis- tic regression analyses, the referencegroup consisted of participants with nosibling CVD prior to the examination. Odds ratios (ORs) and 8-year event rates with corresponding 95% confi-dence intervals (CIs) were calculatedin unadjusted, analyses sibling premature CVD (defined as a CVD event in a brother before age 55years or in a sister before age 65 years).Covariates in the multivariable modelincluded age, sex, systolic blood pres-sure, use of antihypertensive ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, bodymass index, diabetes mellitus, and in-teractions with sibling CVD were notedfor age, systolic blood pressure, and hy-pertension treatment. Therefore, we re-peated the analyses stratifying by agegroup above and below the median age(/H1134948 years, /H1102248 years) and hyperten- sion status (yes or no). In secondary analyses limited to participants with both parents in thestudy, logistic regression analyseswere repeated with the multivariable-adjusted model including parental pre-mature CVD in addition to the other co-variates. Finally, to examine whetherthere was a dose effect for occurrenceof CVD in any first-degree relative, themultivariable analysis was repeated, thistime entering predictor variables for pa-rental premature CVD only, siblingCVD only, and both parental prema-ture CVD and sibling CVD. To assess the added usefulness of the sibling CVD status in predicting fu-ture CVD events for each participant,we calculated a risk score according to the risk guidelines from the NationalCholesterol Education Program AdultTreatment Panel III. 20Participants were then stratified into 10-year risk catego- ries for coronary heart disease to orgreater). These guidelines also placepersons with known diabetes into the high-risk group. We used sex- and age- adjusted logistic regression analyses tocompare 8-year CVD event rates be-tween individuals with and without sib-ling CVD within each risk strata de-fined above, as well as across strata ofindividual CVD risk factors. All statis- tical analyses were performed using SASversion 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,NC). Pvalues were 2-sided; P/H11021.05 was used to determine statistical signifi-cance. RESULTS Most sibling events occurred prema- turely, with a mean age at onset of 48.2 (SD, 4.79), 48.7 (SD, 7.36), 50.7 (SD, 8.27), and 53.6 (SD, 9.94) years at the4 pooled examinations, respectively.Compared with the group with no sib-ling CVD, those with sibling CVD wereolder and had higher prevalence of alltraditional risk factors except currentsmoking ( T ABLE 1). Of the 329 inci- dent CVD events during follow-up, there were 11 coronary deaths, 8 other CVD deaths, 99 nonfatal cases of myo- cardial of angina pectoris, 59strokes or transient ischemic attacks, and 46 cases of intermittent claudica- tion. There were 223 events in thegroup with no sibling CVD over 34 110person-years of follow-up, yielding acrude rate of 6.54 events per 1000 per-son-years; there were 106 events in thesibling CVD group over 6943 person- years of follow-up, yielding rateof 15.27 events per 1000 person-years. The 8-year CVD event rates and ORs for CVD events associated with the oc-currence of sibling CVD are shown inT ABLE 2.

Sibling CVD was associated with a stronger risk forincident CVD than was parental pre- mature CVD; multivariable-adjusted ORs 1.45 (95% CI, both parental premature CVD and sib-ling CVD. Of note, the lower multivari-able-adjusted risks among partici-pants with both parental and siblingCVD might be explained by the par-ticularly high prevalence of risk fac- tors in this group (prevalence of dia-betes and treatment for hypertensionwas 12.2% and 31.5%, respectively, inthose with both parental and siblingCVD, compared with 5.8% and 22.3%,respectively, in those with sibling CVDonly and 14.1%, respec-tively, in those with parental prema-ture CVD only). When we stratified participants by el- evated levels of individual risk factorsand estimates of overall CVD risk cat-egories, sibling CVD 8-year event rates ( T ABLE3). Of note, when we stratified by age, sib- ling CVD was associated with a signifi- cantly higher event rate in those aged 30 to 59 years but not in those aged 60years and older. Sibling CVD was as-sociated with increased risk in per- sons with adverse levels of most risk fac- tors and in persons in the intermediateand high Adult Treatment Panel III riskcategories. However, sibling CVD wasnot associated with significantly in-creased risk among persons with knowndiabetes or hypertension who already had substantially higher event rates. COMMENT Using a prospective design and vali- dated sibling CVD events, we found that sibling CVD was associated with a sig- nificantly increased risk for incidentCVD events in middle-aged statistically significantlyelevated in age- and sex-adjusted andmultivariable-adjusted models, sug-gesting that age and traditional risk fac-tors explain part but not all of the in-creased risk associated with sibling CVD. Furthermore, in analyses re-stricted to participants with both par-ents in the Framingham Study, the pres-ence of sibling CVD conferred anincreased and sibling CVDmay be more strongly associated withincident events than is parental prema-ture CVD. Our findings provide strongevidence that sibling CVD is an impor-tant risk factor for incident CVD andrepresents a useful marker of familialvulnerability to CVD events. Results from a previously reported, population-based, case-control studyconducted to estimate risk of coro-nary heart disease associated with vari-ous definitions of a family historyclearly established the value of going be-yond the simple yes or no response toquestions about presence of disease ina first-degree relative. 4This work dem- onstrated that distinguishing between an affected parent and an affected sib- ling was important, particularly for younger ages of disease onset. More-over, having a sibling with coronaryheart disease was associated with sig- nificantly increased risk, even in fami- lies with a parent already affected at ayoung age. The importance of a sib-ling history is consistent with twin stud-ies in which coronary heart disease Table 3.

Some case-control studies have re- ported that the risk conferred by a his- tory of sibling CVD is similar to thatconferred by a history of parentalCVD, 5,23but others have found that sib- ling CVD confers a greater risk than pa- rental CVD.6A recent study that ex- amined the association between familyhistory and subclinical measures of coronary atherosclerosis found a much stronger association between the pres-ence and extent of coronary artery cal-cification on electron beam tomogra- phy and sibling history compared with parental history. In the analysis con-sidering both together, the ORs forcoronary calcification associated withsibling history and parental history were2.3 and 1.3, respectively. 14When we conducted an analysis comparing pa- rental premature CVD with sibling CVD, we also found stronger associa- tions for sibling than for parental CVD.The magnitude of risk for incident CVDassociated with sibling CVD and pa- rental premature CVD in our study was strikingly similar (ORs, 1.99 and 1.45,respectively) to that in the prior re-port. In the prior report, recall bias can-not be excluded as an explanatory fac-tor contributing to the stronger ORs forsibling history compared with paren- tal history; however, our data are notsusceptible to this limitation, becausesibling and parental events were basedon medical records rather than on self-report. Concern has been raised that risk as- sociated with familial CVD history canbe largely explained by familial aggre-gation of traditional risk factors. Con-sistent with other investigations ofsibling history, 12,13,24-27we found that participants with sibling CVD had higher prevalence of risk factors com-pared with participants with no sib- ling CVD. This finding was especiallystriking in participants with both sib-ling CVD and parental premature CVD,who had high prevalence of diabetesand use of medication for hyperten-sion. Nevertheless, the risk associatedwith sibling CVD remained signifi-cant in multivariable models. This find-ing suggests that a significant propor-tion of risk is explained by factors otherthan traditional risk factors, in turn sug-gesting that other genetic risk factorsmay influence susceptibility to CVD.Among the possible factors for in-creased risks conferred by sibling CVDare shared early environmental expo-sures (in utero or early childhood) anda shared genetic background. Strengths and Limitations Several strengths and limitations of our study merit comment. Our prospec-tive study design allowed the exami- nation of incident CVD events, and all events within the family were adjudi-cated by a panel of senior investiga-tors using the same standardized cri- teria. Thus, sibling events were validated by review of medical recordsrather than reliance on self-reports. Riskfactors were directly measured for allparticipants and updated over time, in-dependent of sibling CVD. Thus, mea-sures of lipid levels and diabetes were ascertained directly and not obtainedby self-report, which is more suscep-tible to misclassification. The use of re-ported risk factors in multivariableanalyses may not fully account forshared risk factors within families andin turn results in an overestimation ofthe OR associated with sibling CVD.The original and offspring cohorts ofthe Framingham Heart Study are pri-marily white, potentially limiting theextent to which our findings can be gen-eralized to other groups. Further, wedid not have risk factor or event infor-mation on siblings who declined en-rollment in the Framingham Study. Itis possible that siblings with early-onset CVD died prior to enrollment ordeclined enrollment due to poor healthstatus; this would be expected to biasour results toward an underestima-tion of the risk associated with siblingCVD. Clinical and Research Implications Using validated events and a prospec- tive design, our study substantially ex-tends the knowledge base regarding the importance of sibling CVD. We ob- served that sibling CVD confers in-creased risks of CVD events above andbeyond traditional risk factors and pa- rental premature CVD. Thus, sibling CVD should be considered as impor-tant as parental premature CVD in theassessment of risk. Further investiga-tion is needed to better understand whysibling history may be a stronger pre-dictor for CVD than parental history, including exploration of the contribu-tion of an early shared environment toincreased sibling risk. Moreover, in-vestigation of whether to incorporatesibling CVD as well as parental CVDinto existing risk prediction and pre-vention algorithms is warranted.

To describe the urologic and sexual complications of male survivors of sexual torture, including prevalence, sequelae, diagnosis, and treatment. Methods. Through chart reviews, we identified all male survivors of torture who had been treated for physical and/or psychological symptoms due to sexual trauma at the Boston Center for Refugee Health and Human Rights at Boston Medical Center between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002. Of the 72 men seen, 20 (28%) were survivors of sexual trauma. Our study focused on genital trauma leading to urologic and/or sexual dysfunction. Therefore, all cases of male genital trauma that had been referred to the urology department (3 of 20) were selected for this review. Results. The patients presented with chronic genital and erectile pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, and sexual dysfunction. The diagnostic workup included history, physical examination, and ultrasonography. Treatment included steroid injections for chronic pain and oral erectogenic agents for sexual dysfunction. Conclusions. The apparent prevalence and severity of the physical and mental sequelae to sexual trauma make it an important area for screening when treating survivors of torture. Our study is the first of its kind to document urologic complications of sexual torture ina foreign-born U.S. cohort of tortured men, including prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment.

Our aim was to sensi\u00ad tize medical professionals to the male genital trauma that occurs in the context of sexual torture by discussing the methods of torture and the phys\u00ad ical sequelae, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Through chart reviews, we identified all male torture survi\u00ad vors who had been treated for physical or psychological symp\u00ad toms due to sexual trauma at the Boston Center for Refugee Health and Human Rights at the Boston Medical Center. Be\u00ad tween January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, 20 (28%) of the 72 men seen were identified as survivors of sexual trauma. The patients were all between 31 and 50 years of age and refugees from African countries in conflict. They had all been impris\u00ad oned or captured and had suffered torture, including severe genital beatings. Table I lists the most common methods of sexual torture, as well as the acute and chronic physical se\u00ad quelae, among the 20 survivors of torture. Most patients had experienced multiple sexual assaults of the same or different kinds. We focus on the genital trauma leading to urologic and/or sexual dysfunction. Therefore, all cases of male genital trauma that had been referred to the urology department C3 of 20) were selected for this review. The cases are presented and serve to illustrate the different aspects of the symptoms, diag\u00ad nosis, and treatment of male genital trauma. All patients have been kept anonymous. The Institutional Review Board at Bos\u00ad ton Medical Center approved the study. RESULTS CASE 1 Patient 1 was a 50-year-old man who had fled from a country in Central Africa after being perse\u00ad cuted by the military for rebel activity and impris\u00ad oned on 7 occasions between 1996 and 2000. Dur\u00ad ing imprisonment, he was repeatedly beaten with fists and sticks all over his body, including the gen\u00ad ital area. On one occasion, he was suspended na\u00ad ked from the ceiling by his arms with his legs bent, his feet secured to the floor wide apart, and his UROLOGY 65 (1), 2005 genitalia tied to the floor for 12 hours. He was unable to stand upright without painfully stretch\u00ad ing his genitalia. He presented with complaints of erectile dysfunction and chronic incapacitating genital pain. On physical examination, he had di\u00ad minished tunica elasticity and compliance, consis\u00ad elic\u00ad radiating to the pubic bone and suspensory ligament. After he provided informed consent, two subcutaneous steroid injections (triamcinolone 50 mg) on the dorsal aspect of the penis, fundiform ligament, and pubic tubercles were performed within a 4-month period. After the first steroid injection, the patient experienced immediate and significant improve\u00ad ment of his incapacitating genital pain. After the second injection, the pain resolved completely. At last follow-up, his erectile dysfunction was being managed with oral erectogenic agents (sildenafil) with excellent results. CASE 2 Patient 2 was a 31-year-old man who had also been repetitively beaten in the genitals by fists and sticks while imprisoned in an East African country for political activities. He also presented with com\u00ad plaints of erectile dysfunction and severe and chronic genital pain. He had no orgasmic or ejac\u00ad ulatory problems, but his erections were reduced in rigidity compared with previously. The physical examination revealed exquisite pubic tubercle, cord, and suspensory ligament tenderness. Penile occlusive dysfunc\u00ad tion) cavernosal artery insufficiency, most likely secondary to blunt perineal trauma. No penile plaques or tunica thickening were observed. After he provided informed consent, two steroid injec\u00ad tions (triamcinolone 50 mg) were given into the cord, fundiform, and pubic tubercle, with com\u00ad plete resolution of his genital pain. At last follow\u00ad up, he was taking oral erectogenic agents (silde\u00ad 29 nafil) for the management of his erectile dysfunction, with excellent results. CASE 3 Patient 3 was a 39-year-old man who had fled from a West African country after being captured by rebels and forced to do hard labor. During captivity, he was severely beaten in the genital area with fists and sticks on multiple occasions. He presented with complaints of erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symp\u00ad toms (International Prostate Symptom Score of 23) characterized by decreased force of stream, incom\u00ad plete emptying, and urinary frequency. He achieved an approximately 50% erection, which had poor spontaneity and sustaining capabilities. His past medical history was only remarkable for a urethral stricture managed endoscopically several years previ\u00ad ously. His physical examination was unremarkable, a peak systolic velocity of 31 and 15 cmls for the right and left cavemosal artery, respectively, with normal end-diastolic velocities. These findings were consistent with pure (no corporeal occlusive dys\u00ad function) cavernosal artery insufficiency, most likely secondary to blunt perineal trauma because of tor\u00ad ture. He underwent internal (endoscopic) urethrot\u00ad omy of a long bulbar st.ricture. However, the stricture recurred within 6 months, requiring a second inter\u00ad nal urethrotomy with excellent results. The patient also began taking sildenafil, with excellent results. A detailed vascular evaluation was obtained to assess the feasibility of penile revascularization from the dorsal to the cavernosal artery in an attempt to re\u00ad establish normal erectile function, COMMENT Little has been written about the sexual trauma of men within the published medical reports on torture. Attention has so far mainly been devoted to female survivors of sexual trauma. The myth that men are only aggressors and not victims seems prevalent.\" The legal definition of rape in many countries and in some states in the United States dismisses that men may be victirns.!? The prevalence of male sexual trauma is uncertain. Estimates, however, have shown that 5000 to 8000 men were raped in the former Yugoslavia and that thousands of men and boys were raped during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.\"! Male sex\u00ad ual trauma mostly takes place during detention and is perpetrated by guards, interrogators, or other prisoners. Agger'? found that 52% of male political prisoners who sought help after torture had been sexually abused. Peel et al. l3 specifi\u00ad cally studied male sexual trauma among Tamil refugees, who had been imprisoned, and found a prevalence of 21%. In a different study, Peel\" studied 607 men from 45 countries, of whom 25% had been sexually assaulted. Of these, 21% had been raped, 47% had had assaults to the genitals, 27% had had electric shocks to the gen\u00ad itals, and/or 21% had had an object inserted in the anus or urethral meatus. These prevalence figures may be underestimates because of the ta\u00ad boo and stigmatization to discussing male sexual trauma inherent in most cultural norms. A study of British male victims of sexual assaults in gen\u00ad eral showed that 79% of raped men sought no help for a mean time of 16 years after the as\u00ad sault. 1+ The sequelae of sexual torture include both psy\u00ad chological'Y'\" and physical manifestations.tv'<'? In this report, we focused on the physical sequelae. When reviewing published reports, we found few studies describing the physical sequelae of sexual trauma.l 5,lB,19 Blunt genital trauma from other causes has, however, been documented. Erectile dysfunction has resulted from innocent falls or blows to the crotch.2o ,2 1 Avid bikers can develop erectile dysfunction and groin pain owing to pro\u00ad longed pressure on the pudendal nerves-! and ar\u00ad teries. 23 ,24 Earlier studies and our work have sug\u00ad gested that blunt genital trauma may roughly result in four clinical problems that are not mutually ex\u00ad clusive: 1. Chronic genital pain, including erectile pain 2. Peyronie's disease characterized by penile pain, penile curvature, and erectile dysfunction 3, Lower urinary tract symptoms 4. Erectile dysfunction These clinical problems arise from different pathologic mechanisms. Chronic genital pain may result from injury to the inguinal cord, suspensory and/or fundiform ligaments, or tunica albuginea, leading Peyronie's disease.\" Peyronie's disease is characterized by decreased tunica elasticity and compliance secondary to fibrosis and plaque for\u00ad mation. Lower urinary tract symptoms may be due to urethral trauma leading to stricture formation. Apart from Peyronie's disease, erectile dysfunction may result from compression injuries of the pu\u00ad dendal arteries as they enter the perineum through Alcock's canal and/or corporal damage leading to corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction (venous leak). Depending on the symptoms, the diagnosis of male genital trauma is based on the physical examination and penile duplex Doppler ultra\u00ad sound findings. Not yet described in published re\u00ad ports, we propose that chronic genital pain due to Peyronie's disease, pubitis, or suspensory ligament injury can be successfully treated with steroid in\u00ad jections. Penile curvature can be managed (verapamil, Urethral can be generally treated. The treatments for oral Erectile dysfunction is most common in survivors who have been ex\u00ad posed to sexual trauma, but it may also arise after nonsexual torture.v' Sexual trauma may also lead to psychological disturbances, including post-traumatic stress dis\u00ad order and major depressive disorder. These disor\u00ad ders include symptoms such as insomnia, night\u00ad mares, irritability, avoidance behavior, and depression.t>!? according to the DSM-IV. Post\u00ad traumatic stress disorder and/or major depressive disorder occur in most patients who have been tor\u00ad tured,15,17 and the recognition and treatment of the underlying psychological disorder is essential to therapeutic success. Torture survivors may be exposed to human im\u00ad munodeficiency virus through contaminated blood, anal rape, or unsterile instruments of tor\u00ad ture, or when seeking medical care for wounds that occurred during torture. Thus, all male rape vic\u00ad tims and torture survivors with male genital trauma should be screened for human immunode\u00ad ficiency virus. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study and others have indi\u00ad cated that male sexual trauma is an important issue in refugee and asylum seeker populations. Still, the subject of male sexual trauma has rarely been ad\u00ad dressed in published reports and is little under\u00ad stood. This is partly a result of the silence of the victims, as well as lack of awareness by, or discom\u00ad fort among, medical professionals. The apparent prevalence and the severity of the physical and mental sequelae to sexual trauma, however, make it an important area for screening when treating survivors of torture and refugee trauma. Itis, there\u00ad fore, crucial that health professionals working with asylum seeker and refugee populations are aware of the problem and trained to recognize the phys\u00ad ical and psychological symptoms and make appro\u00ad priate referrals to knowledgeable providers or treatment centers (National Consortium of Tor\u00ad ture Treatment Programs). This includes referral to a urologist in the case of urologic complications. Also, urologists need to be aware of the diagnostic tools and possible treatment strategies. In this con\u00ad text, our study is the first of its kind to document the urologic complications occurring after sexual UROLOGY 65 (1), 2005 torture in a Ll.S. cohort of tortured men, including the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment. The pro\u00ad posed use of steroid injections in the clinical treat\u00ad ment of these patients has not been previously re\u00ad ported. REFERENCES 1.

We describe the frequency of smoking cessa\u00ad tion counseling, and factors affecting its provision in methadone programs. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of methadone patients and their counselors. Of 575 patients, 76% were eligible smokers. Although only 48% of patients reported receiving smoking cessation counseling within the previous six months, 97% of counselors reported providing it (p < OJ)OOl).

Smoking, smoking cessation, methadone maintenance, health services research, substance abuse treatment INTRODUCTION Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable death among substance abusers in treatment.l? and the prevalence of smoking in these populations often exceeds 80%.3,4 Historically, treatment provid\u00ad ers have hesitated to focus on smoking cessation because of fear of compromising sobriety.\" However, several studies among alcoholics suggest that tackling both nicotine and alcohol dependence simulta\u00ad neously leads to longer periods of sobriety, and less relapse to alco\u00ad ho1.67 In the general population, counseling and pharmacotherapy for nicotine dependence are effective.s? Several small studies suggest that smoking cessation therapy works among alcohol and drug dependent patients in treatment as well.1O-12 Approximately 20% of the 900,000 heroin addicts in the United States receive methadone maintenance treatrnent.l'' According to fed\u00ad eral regulation, methadone maintenance treatment includes regular ad\u00ad diction counseling.!\" Close to 95% of methadone maintenance patients smoke cigarettes. I 5-17 Many smokers on methadone maintenance show an interest in quitting cigarettes,3,15,16 but little is known about the ex\u00ad tent to which smoking cessation counseling occurs in these settings. We undertook the current study to test two hypotheses; first, that smoking cessation counseling occurs infrequently in methadone programs, and second, that counselors and patients in methadone programs differ in their beliefs about the effect of smoking cessation on recovery from her\u00ad oin addiction. We also assessed which factors are associated with pa\u00ad tients receiving smoking cessation counseling as part of methadone maintenance treatment. OLsen et aL. 35 MATERIALS AND METHODS Setting The study was conducted at three large, urban methadone programs that provide comprehensive pharmacological maintenance therapy and counseling services to a large spectrum of opioid dependent persons in the greater Boston area. The Institutional Review Board at Boston Uni\u00ad versity Medical Center approved the study. All subjects provided in\u00ad formed consent. Subject Inclusion Criteria Patients Eligible subjects were current smokers, defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and at least I cigarette in the last month, had met with their assigned addiction counselor at least once, and understood English. Counselors All counselors caring for at least one methadone patient in anyone of the three study programs were eligible for inclusion. To ensure that pa\u00ad tients at all program sites would have had a chance to meet with their counselor at least once, counselors who began work with eligible pa\u00ad tients on or after the date subject enrollment began were excluded. Counselors who left study sites within one month prior to patient enroll\u00ad ment were included in the study, as many patients would have had at least one visit with these counselors prior to transitioning to new thera\u00ad pists. Measures Patient-Level Predictor Variables Patient interviews assessed demographics, smoking and drug use his\u00ad tory, readiness to quit smoking, and beliefs about smoking cessation and relapse to heroin. Using questions based on the trans-theoretical model of behavior change, patient readiness to quit smoking included assessment of motivation, importance, confidence, and interest in quit\u00ad36 JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES ting within 6 months, using 4-point Likert scales. I5,I8 In addition, pa\u00ad tients rated their readiness to change on a 5-level contemplation scale, using a previously validated IO-point contemplation ladder.'? To assess patients' beliefs about smoking cessation counseling and relapse to her\u00ad oin, we asked patients to rate their agreement with the statement \"the stress of quitting smoking would make me relapse to heroin\" using a 4-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Counselor-Level Predictor Variables Counselor surveys assessed demographics, smoking history, and be\u00ad liefs about smoking cessation and relapse to heroin. We asked counsel\u00ad ors to rate their agreement with the statement \"the stress of quitting smoking would make my methadone maintenance patients relapse to heroin\" using a 4-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. As much as possible, the wording for all questions that appeared on both patient and counselor questionnaires was identical. Patient-and Counselor-Level Outcome Variables To assess patient-reported smoking cessation counseling, patients rated, on a 5-point Likert scale from always to never, the frequency with which their counselor had, over the previous 6 months: (1) asked whether they smoked, (2) asked whether they felt ready to quit, (3) dis\u00ad cussed the adverse health effects of smoking, (4) advised them to quit, and (5) discussed smoking cessation options. To assess counselor-reported provision of smoking cessation coun\u00ad seling, we used the same approach. Counselors reported, on a 5-point Likert scale from always to never, the frequency with which they had, over the previous 6 months: (1) asked patients whether they smoked, (2) asked patients if they felt ready to quit, (3) discussed with patients the adverse health effects of smoking, (4) advised patients to quit, and (5) discussed with patients smoking cessation options. Counselors were asked to respond to each item considering all of their smoking metha\u00ad done patients. Data Collection Procedures Patients From July through December 2000, four trained research assistants approached patients waiting for methadone dosing or counseling ses\u00ad37 Olsen et al. sions, and asked them to participate in a study about smoking cessation in methadone programs. Willing patients answered three screening questions to determine eligibility for entry into the study. Research as\u00ad sistants administered 23-item surveys by interview to enrolled subjects immediately following the screening interview, and recorded the data anonymously. Patients received $2 gift certificates towards the pur\u00ad chase of food as compensation for participation. Research assistants ap\u00ad proached patients during a combination of dosing and counseling times in each clinic, thus ensuring recruitment of patients with and without take-home privileges and from early morning to evening hours ofclinic operation. Counselors Two investigators met with addiction counselors at a usual weekly staffmeeting at each site during the first 3 months of the study to distrib\u00ad ute 20-item, self-administered surveys, ensure confidentiality, and collect completed questionnaires. Questionnaires were mailed or hand-deliv\u00ad ered to counselors not present at these staff meetings, and collected sev\u00ad eral days later. Analysis In order to link patients and counselors, patients identified their pri\u00ad mary addiction counselor. Proportions, means, and 95% confidence in\u00ad tervals (CI) were calculated to describe the sample. We defined a dichotomous SU111mary measure of receipt or provision of smoking ces\u00ad sation counseling, for patients and counselors respectively, as having answered \"always,\" \"often,\" or \"sometimes\" to anyone of the five questions involving receipt or provision of smoking cessation counsel\u00ad ing. Having infrequently received or provided smoking cessation coun\u00ad seling, respectively, was then defined as having answered \"rarely\" or \"never\" to all five questions. We dichotomized the five individual components of smoking cessa\u00ad tion counseling into ever versus rarely/never in the same fashion as the summary measure. Comparisons between patient and counselor report of continuous variables (e.g., cigarette consumption) were made using two-sample t-tests, while comparisons of categorical variables (e.g., smoking cessation counseling) were made using chi-squared tests, both with an alpha level of 0.05. 38 JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES Generalized estimating equation regression models were used to as\u00ad sess factors associated with patient report of counseling.w-\" These models account for the clustering of patients within counselors. The GEE was fit using a logit link function and an exchangeable working correlation structure. In developing models, we considered for inclu\u00ad sion patient and counselor demographics, smoking histories, metha\u00ad done program experience, and patient readiness to change smoking behavior, and chose other variables with potential clinical significance: length of time with a counselor, patient daily cigarette consumption, counselor smoking status, duration of time counselors had worked in the addictions field, counselor training in specific smoking cessation counseling, counselor caseload, percentage of patients that smoke, per\u00ad centage of patients on methadone maintenance, patient readiness to quit as indicated by the modified contemplation ladder, and patient and counselor beliefs about smoking cessation and relapse to heroin. Mod\u00ad els were also fit with other potential confounders: program site, patient age, patient and counselor gender, patient and counselor race/ethnicity, patient recent use of illicit drugs, patient employment status, and coun\u00ad selor education. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement between patient and counselor report of smoking cessation counseling, using first, the individual, dichotomized components of counseling and, second, the summary measure for both patients and matched counselors. These analyses were repeated stratified by counselor smoking status. All analyses were done using SAS statistical software, Release 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). RESULTS Of 575 methadone patients screened, 438 (76%) were smokers eligi\u00ad ble for inclusion into the study. All 438 eligible subjects completed questionnaires. There were 42 eligible counselors, all of whom com\u00ad pleted surveys. At least half of both patients and counselors were fe\u00ad male, both groups were mostly white, and on average in their 40s. Despite methadone treatment, 44% of patients reported using some form of illicit drug in the previous month. Patients had been with the same counselor for a median of ]2 months. Although patients and coun\u00ad selors hadasimilarnumber ofpriorquitattempts, only 31% (13/42) of counselors were current smokers, and this group smoked significantly fewer cigarettes than patients (p <0.001). Less than 25% of patients and 39 Olsen et at. counselors felt that stress caused by quitting cigarettes would. lead to re\u00ad lapse to heroin (Table l), Although no patients were actively taking steps to quit smoking ciga\u00ad rettes, 58% of the 408 patients responding to this question indicated that they were contemplating or determined to give up nicotine (\"think I should quit but not ready\" or \"think I need to consider quitting\"), and TABLE 1.

Only 9% were pre-contemplative, in that they had no thought of quitting. Data from this question was missing for 7% of the sample. Weekly counselor caseloads averaged 28 patients, with a mean of 86% on methadone maintenance. Counselors estimated that, on aver\u00ad age, 78% of their patients smoked cigarettes. Only 24% of addiction counselors had received training in smoking cessation counseling. Overall, 48% of patients reported receiving smoking cessation coun\u00ad seling at least sometimes from their counselors over a six-month period. In comparison, over the same time period, 97% of counselors reported providing smoking cessation counseling at least sometimes to patients (p < 0.000l). Of note, no significant chance-corrected agreement was found between patient and counselor reports of smoking cessation counseling (K = -0.01, 95% CI -0.04-0.03). For example, although only 28% (120/436) of patients reported having been asked by their counselor at least sometimes within the past six months whether they smoke, 71% (30/42) of counselors reported having asked their patients about smoking at least sometimes during the same time period (p < 0.0001). Only 31% (137/437) of patients reported having been advised at least sometimes to quit, compared to 64% (27/42) of counselors stat\u00ad ing that they had at least sometimes provided this advice (p < 0.000 1). Similarly, significantly fewer patients reported at least sometimes dis\u00ad cussing the adverse health effects of smoking (32% vs. 81 %, P < 0.0001) and talking about smoking cessation options (26% vs. 81%, P < 0.0001) compared with counselor reports. In analyses adjusted for clustering of patients within counselors and patient and counselor demographic and smoking characteristics, each additional year spent in a therapeutic relationship with one counselor was significantly associated with greater odds of patient report of hav\u00ad ing received counseling (OR 1.19 [95% CI 1.04-1.36]) (Table 2). Pa\u00ad tients with master's level counselors had lower odds ofreporting having received counseling compared with patients with non-master's level counselors (OR 0.35 [95% CI 0.20-0.63]). In addition, as counselors' percentage of methadone maintenance patients increased, the odds of patients reporting having received smoking cessation counseling de\u00ad creased (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.97-1.00]).

DISCUSSION In a group of patients receiving regular addiction counseling, we found that effective smoking cessation counseling is not a routine part 43 Olsen et al. of this therapy. Fewer than half of smokers reported receiving smoking cessation counseling from their counselors at least sometimes during a six-month period. Only about a quarter to one-third of patients reported having at least sometimes been advised to quit or engaged in discus\u00ad sions with their counselor about the adverse health consequences of smoking or options for smoking cessation. Less than a third of patients reported just being asked whether they smoke. These findings signifi\u00ad cantly contrasted with the majority of counselors who reported provid\u00ad ing frequent smoking cessation counseling to their patients over the same time period. The belief that stress caused by smoking cessation would compro\u00ad mise recovery from heroin addiction did not appear to act as a strong de\u00ad terrent for patients and counselors to address nicotine dependence. Contrary to our hypothesis, patients and counselors agreed that quitting cigarettes would not cause relapse to heroin abuse. We also found that, contrary to prior work, counselors' smoking status was not significantly associated with patients' report of having received smoking cessation counseling. Bobo and Davis found that counselors in rural Nebraska who were former smokers were six times more likely to routinely urge their patients to quit smoking compared with counselors who currently smoked.P Public perception around smoking and smoking cessation has changed over the last ten years, which may explain the disparate re\u00ad sults we found compared with those of Bobo and Davis. Clinically surprising, patients' level ofreadiness to change did not af\u00ad fect patients' report of having received smoking cessation counseling. Given the empiric evidence for the importance of this clinical measure 011 smoking quit rates, 18 we would have expected to find a difference be\u00ad tween the various readiness to change levels in patients' report of hav\u00ad ing received smoking cessation counseling. It may be that the limited number of subjects on either end of the readiness to change scale left the majority of responders in the middle of the scale where differences in their recall of counselor advice about smoking may not have been statis\u00ad ticallyevident. Interestingly, length of time patients had spent with the same coun\u00ad selor was significantly associated with patients' report of having re\u00ad ceived smoking cessation counseling. In fact, patients had 1.19 times the odds of receiving smoking cessation counseling for every additional year spent in a therapeutic relationship with their counselor. One expla\u00ad nation for this could be that a counselor will only tackle smoking once he/she feels other perceived priorities have adequately been addressed. This follows earlier work by Bobo and Gilchrist on the timing of smok\u00ad44 JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES ing cessation for substance abusers in treatment. They reported that 53% of 311 staff members at several inpatient alcohol treatment centers favored addressing smoking cessation only after the first year of sobri\u00ad ety.\" Alternatively, patients who are more advanced in their recovery may be more open to hearing and retaining smoking cessation counsel\u00ad mg. Controlling for caseload, we also found that as the percentage of methadone maintenance patients each counselor was assigned increased, the odds of patients reporting having received smoking cessation coun\u00ad seling decreased. It seems clinically plausible that busy counselors deal\u00ad ing with substance abuse issues as well as methadone may address smoking cessation differently than those counselors with a lower per\u00ad centage of methadone maintained patients in their caseload. This bor\u00ad derline significant finding must be interpreted with caution, however, because of multiple comparisons. Surprisingly, those patients with master's level counselors had 0.35 times the odds of reporting having received counseling, while simulta\u00ad neously controlling for years as counselor and counselor age. No previ\u00ad ous work has documented such a difference. This finding should be confirmed in other studies and explored further. Several studies have documented patient interest in quitting ciga\u00ad rettes, both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Orleans and Hutch\u00ad inson reported that 42% of 118 patients in a residential treatment program had a strong interest in smoking cessation.P Richter et al. found that, among 550 methadone maintenance patients, 80% were somewhat or very interested in quitting smoking. 16 Other researchers, including those in this study, have noted similar findings.J,15,24 While our study did not assess the effect of a smoking cessation inter\u00ad vention, several reports document the positive impact of nicotine de\u00ad pendence therapy among patients receiving other substance abuse treatment. IO-12,25 To our knowledge, however, our study is one of the first to report simultaneous counselor-level and patient-level reports of the current state of smoking cessation counseling in outpatient addic\u00ad tion treatment clinics. It is also one of the few studies documenting pa\u00ad tient reports of smoking cessation counseling. Counselor reports of smoking cessation counseling have been docu\u00ad mented before. In a 1993 survey of staff in recovery at a chemical de\u00ad pendency program in Nebraska, 44% of counselors reported having advised at least one patient to quit and 25% stated that they routinely did SO.22 Geographic and time differences between our study and that of Bobo and Davis may account for the lower rates of counselor-reported Olsen et al. 45 advice to quit found in their study. Gill and Bennett noted that smoking cessation training heavily influenced counselor-reported practices with regards to nicotine dependence in their patients.\" While over 50% of counselors with smoking cessation training addressed smoking with at least 50% of their patients, only 5% of those with little to no training did the same. The large discrepancy between patient and counselor reports of smoking cessation counseling noted in our study may cause some to wonder where the truth lies. While under-and over-reporting of smok\u00ad ing cessation counseling may have occurred from patients and counsel\u00ad ors, respectively, it seems clear that if counselors delivered smoking cessation counseling, it was not effective in reaching their patients. For effective behavior change, whether it involve diet, excessive drug use, or smoking, it is crucial that patients recall whether and what counseling they have received from their providers. In a study of alcoholic workers advised to quit alcohol by their health care providers, recall of the warn\u00ad ing was associated with improved drinking outcomes two years later.I? In a general medical population, recall of smoking cessation advice was associated with high numbers of quit attempts, particularly among pa\u00ad tients with serious health problems.P In our study, only 24% of addiction counselors reported receiving training in smoking cessation counseling and therefore may not know how to deliver messages about pharrnaco\u00ad therapy or the long-term risks of smoking effectively. There are limitations to our study. There may be different timeframes for recall for patients and counselors since they were asked about the previous six months but often a month or two apart. There also may be a social desirability bias leading counselors to over-report the amount of counseling they provided. In addition, our sample may not be represen\u00ad tative of all methadone maintenance patients who smoke because our recruitment methods may have missed eligible patients who did not have to wait for methadone dosing or counseling sessions. It is likely that our sample represents the majority of patients in these settings, however, for four reasons: (1) most patients wait for at least a few min\u00ad utes when attending dosing or counseling sessions; (2) we enrolled pa\u00ad tients from all possible clinic hours; (3) most patients screened were eligible for the study; and (4) we enrolled all eligible patients screened. Although only three sites were included in the study, these public and private clinics cover a large number of patients on methadone in the greater Boston area, with patient populations similar to those in other urban centers where most methadone programs are located. Finally, counselors were asked about their patients as a group, whereas patients 46 JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES were asked about particular counselors. Counselors and patients thus may have interpreted questions differently, which may explain some of the discrepancy noted in the frequency of smoking cessation counseling reported by both groups. However, both counselors and patients were asked about the frequency of counseling in the same fashion and using nearly identical language. Since multiple comparisons were involved in our analyses without adjustments made, results reaching statistical sig\u00ad nificance with p-values near p = 0.05 should be used with caution. Methadone maintenance patients are at extremely high risk for mor\u00ad bidity and mortality from smoking-related conditions, for which effec\u00ad tive preventive measures exist. In fact, in the long-term, they are more likely to die of the consequences of smoking than of addiction to other drugs. Fortunately, in methadone programs, the opportunities to ad\u00ad dress the high prevalence of smoking are numerous. Patients are inter\u00ad ested and motivated to learn about smoking cessation, and, as our study shows, concerns about compromising recovery do not appear to be common among patients or counselors. Although the vast majority of counselors in our study reported pro\u00ad viding smoking cessation counseling, a minority of patients reported having received it. In addition, a small percentage of counselors re\u00ad ported having received specific training in smoking cessation-counsel\u00ad ing techniques. These results imply that effective smoking cessation counseling is not routinely occurring in these patient-provider interac\u00ad tions. It appears that the most important factor associated with effective smoking cessation counseling is a patient's continuous relationship with one counselor. Methadone programs should prioritize smoking cessa\u00ad tion as part of their overall addiction counseling, and should facilitate stable, long-term counselor-patient relationships to increase the occur\u00ad rence of smoking cessation counseling. Methadone programs should also invest in training their counselors to ensure that smoking cessation counseling is effectively delivered in order to effect behavior change in their patients. Future research should focus on using qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the educational components needed by counselors for effective smoking cessation counseling, assess the effec\u00ad tiveness of smoking cessation counseling in methadone programs, and study better ways todisseminate interventions for the leading cause of mortality among adults receiving opioid dependence treatment: to\u00ad bacco. 47 OLsen IT, Gomez-Dahl L, Kottke ton Ll, Ill.

The Challenges of Informed Consent for Low-Literate Populations Michael K. Paasche-Orlow, MD, MA, MPH The objectoflanguage is nottobemusegrammarians, butto convey ideas, and the more simply it accomplishes that object the more effectively it meets the needs ofan energetic and practical people. -H. L. Mencken, The American Language, 1921.1 Many of the activities of health care and medical research are outside the bounds of normal social interaction. Clinicians, investi\u00ad gators, and the institutions they work for protect themselves against claims of impropriety with the doctrine of informed consent. For exam\u00ad ple, under normal circumstances, when a surgeon suggests an operation, the surgeon cannot proceed unless the patient agrees. This agreement must be based on a fair understanding ofwhat to expect from the surgery. The surgeon has an obligation to teach the patient about the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the proposed procedure. With this information, the patient can decide to refuse or accept the operation. Although patient comprehension is crucial to the informed consent process, elements of the consent process have consistently been found to be highly formal and complex.2-12 This complexity presents a major barrier to comprehension for all patients but especially for approxi\u00ad matelyone quarter of the adult population in the United States with low literacy skills.P Because informed consent is a communication process, many themes that emerge in this chapter mirror those of other chapters that explore the role of health literacy in physician-patient communication. Concern fortheprotection ofrightsforlow-literate adults is especially salientin 119 120 Health Literacy and Communication the case of informed consent, because the ethical and legal obligations inherent in this type of communication process may not be fulfilled by typical patterns of practice. Essentiallylow-literate adults are a vulnerable population with respect to informed consent. 14 This vulnera\u00ad bility is also a danger for providers. When the consent process is inadequate, health care providers not only fail in their professional and ethical obligation but are exposed to liability.I5-18 While many features of the traditional informed-consent process are' known to be challenging for low-literate patients, there is still much unexplored territory. This chapter evaluates the role of health literacy in various aspects of the informed-consent process. Specifically, the chapter discusses formal and informal consent; barriers experienced by low-literate patients, challenges to preserving patient rights, the relia\u00ad bility of informed-consent forms, and consent as a protection of human subjects. The chapter concludes with suggestions for future research and advocacy to promote the autonomy oflow-literate adults. ~NFORMAL AND FORMAL CONSENT In extreme circumstances (eg, delirium, incompetence, or dangerous\u00ad ness), health care providers may have a positive duty and legal obligation to oppose a patient's stated wishes. However, generally, peo\u00ad ple do not cede their right of self-determination by becoming a patient. Negotiating the details of what health providers may do with patients during the course oftreatment is the arena of informed consent. While much of the consent literature has focused on written documents, these represent only a small part of physician-patient interactions involving informed consent.\" Most consent is elicited informally and sometimes nonverbally; indeed, it is the minority of instances in which informed consent is confirmed in writing. While the issue oflow literacy tends to be raised exclusively for formal written consent docu\u00ad ments, low-literate patients may have difficulty with comprehension in multiple aspects of the informed-consent process.\" Typically, higher medical risk (including risk of physical, economic, psychological, and social harm) is associated with a more formalized consent procedure. For example, invasive surgery is almost always accompanied by an executed informed-consent document, while many, simple, low-risk procedures and tests may proceed with a head nod.\" However, rules for what types of activities require formalized consent are difficult to discern. HIV and genetic testing are done subsequent to counseling and the completion of written informed-consent documents. However, this is not typical for other tests like syphilis testing, despite mandatory reporting laws and the implicit risk for loss of privacy. The level of risk that will trigger the use of more formalized consent procedures is highly variable. Myriad factors-including local convention, The Challenges of Informed Consent 121 legal constraints, personal preference, and training-influence the type ofinformed-consent process that isconsidered. appropriate forvarious clinical interactions. Patients cannot assume that the absence of a formal process implies the relative safety or appropriateness of clinical decisions. For example, medication regimens with important risks and side effects are often initiated without a signed document in primary care. ARRIERS EXPERIENCED BY OW-LITERATE PATIENTS IN THE Theoretical and empirical evaluations of informed consent and decision\u00ad making have established the elements needed to ensure that patients have attained substantive and meaningful informed consent. 17. 21-25 Table 8-1 exhibits these elements and notes specific ways patients with low literacy may have difIiculty with the consent process. Decision-Making Capacity According to Table 8-1, a starting condition is assessment of decision\u00ad making capacity. Because low literacy has been shown to decrease performance on several commonly used neuropsychiatric tests, it is possible that some low-literate adults, particularly the elderly, will be wrongly classified as incompetent.26-28 Misclassification may result in fewer attempts to obtain informed consent directly from the patient and greater reliance on family members or other proxies. Process of Decision-Making Next, Table 8-1 represents informed consent as a process that includes multiple levels of communication. An underlying feature of patient\u00ad physician communication involves establishing the model of relationship that will guide the informed-consent process; in paternalistic decisions the physician is dominant; the reverse is true in a consumer model, and in a collaborative decision-making relationship a balance is established. 29 While the informed consent process need not conform exactly to a theoretical model, insight into the dynamics of decision-making allows clinicians and patients to adjust their communication accordingly. Because informed consent is an ongoing interactive process, fea\u00ad tures of the clinical encounter that interfere with physician-patient communication are also barriers to informed consent.f\" Among the typical communication barriers that may complicate physician-patient communication, several are common, particularly for low-literate patients (eg, socioeconomic differences, general physician-patient differences, and cultural differencesl.P' Haste and the use of technical jargon by health care providers and investigators are common TAB L E 8\u00b71 Areas of Concern for Low-Literate Adults in Informed Consent ...a-:; Patient has decision-making capacity Process of decision-makingt: ~~ternalism - \"You're the doctor; you tell me what to do.\" Consumerism - \"Tellme about this so I can make my decision.\" Collaboration - \"Let's talk about this and decide together.\" Characteristics of the primary option being onersd c (]) Risks of primary option o en ~ EEc: Often presented Benefits of primary option as numerical ~ () Degree of uncertainty ~Jj estimate Alternatives to primary option 1 What is implied by consent .Lack of coercion 00 f/) I....

The Challenges of Informed Consent 123 pitfalls.\" Even nontechnical health terms are often interpreted differ\u00ad ently by physicians and patients with little education.\" In addition, the nature of these barriers depends on the etiology of low functional literacy. Functional literacy is predicated on having adequate vision, reading ability, and cognitive capacity. Stigma may preclude open disclosure of such deficits. Many low-literate adults ex\u00ad perience their illiteracy as shameful and use a range of techniques to hide their deficiency.34,35 Indeed, they are often successful; most physi\u00ad cians are not able to identify which of their patients are functionally illiterate.36-38 Furthermore, people have varied levels of insight about their functional limitations. Paternalism as a model for physician-patient communication and decision-making may be an authentic choice embraced by patients for a myriad of reasons. However, ifthis hierarchical model is chosen be\u00ad cause of a stigmatizing condition, the freedom with which this choice is made is limited. Generally, people who do not feel empowered to en\u00ad gage in a collaborative decision-making process with their providers should be supported to do so. Information Exchange In Table 8-1, the next element ofinformed consent involves informa\u00ad tion exchange. For decisions to be substantively informed, people need to be informed of and understand five content domains: (1) the essen\u00ad tial features of the option under consideration, (2) the potential risks, (3) the potential benefits, (4) the degree of uncertainty surrounding these items, and (5) the alternatives. Unfortunately, there is a very large gap between theory and practice. In an evaluation of 540 hospi\u00ad tals' informed consent for procedure forms, only 26.4% of these forms included information on all four central content areas evaluated: nature of procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives.P Numerous studies have shown that low-literate patients have a lower fund ofk.nowledge about their medical conditions than other patients.4O-43 Because'ofthis, low-literate patients may need to over\u00ad come a larger informational hurdle to be in a position to comprehend these content domains. Furthermore, particular aspects of these content domains are commonly presented in a manner that may be problematic for low-literate patients. For example, clinicians often depict risks, benefits, and the degree of certainty in statistical terms. Because numeracy is an integral component of functional literacy, fulfilling these domains of informed consent may be a particular challenge for low-literate adults. A sixth content domain that is easily overlooked relates to the basic meaning and implication of consent. Consent is an authorization that allows a provider or investigator to do something he or she would not 1:&4 Health LIteracy and Oommunication otherwise do. The significance of this authorization depends on the context, but patients and physicians may understand this aspect of informed consent differently. Patients need to understand that consent constitutes a limited authorization and should not get the impression that signing an informed-consent form involves signing away any rights they otherwise retain.F The meaning of the authorization put in motion by informed consent is often unarticulated and not evaluated in research. It is unclear iflow-literate patients have more difficulty than other patients do in apprehending this aspect of informed consent. Consent (Voluntariness) The final element of informed consent in Table 8-1 deals with the con\u00ad sent itself. For decisions to be substantively voluntary, they must be made without coercion and must represent the patient's actual inten\u00ad tions; confirmation of the authenticity of a patient's decision has been recommended.\" For example, comparison of the current decision being made to prior decisions can help make a person's values over time more explicit. While there is no requirement that a person's decisions corre\u00ad spond with their stated values, many people want their health care decisions to reflect their values; discordance may reflect a departure from prior ethical commitments or may simply be evidence of misunder\u00ad standing. There are subtle ways that the authenticity of a person's decision can be compromised. Cognitive research in decision-making has shown that patients' choices are sensitive to the order and number of al\u00ad ternatives they are given and that people often choose options that run counter to their stated desires.f While these findings have not yet been evaluated in patients with low literacy, such patients may have a low sense oftheir own decisional authority and may have more anxiety than other patients when presented with a set of alternatives. Furthermore, patients are highly influenced by recommendations presented by physicians.t\" Low-literate patients with a lower sense of self-efficacy may have even more difficulty opposing the authority of the physician than other patients. Consequently, low-literate patients may incorrectly experience a physician's description of the primary option as a Hobson's choice-a situation in which you have to take the one poor option that is offered or get nothing at alL Note that Table 8-1 represents informed consent as a discrete episode of decision-making and does not capture the complexity that is introduced by an ongoing process with multiple parties over time.30, 47 Time is needed for education and to allow for synthesis of complicated ideas and the application ofpersonal values by the patient. Time is also needed for confirmation of patient understanding, preferences, and decisions by the health care provider. The process is not over when a document is signed. Opportunity for discussion with family --------_._~---The Challenges of Informed Consent 125 and other confidants may solidify a person's decision or provoke .. concern and introduce uncertainty. Questions and answers continue to be relevant to reinforce not only the central elements of the decision but also the physician-patient relationship itself. Asking patients to recount key information may be an effective method of confinning understanding.\" While a form maybe used at a particular time to document a decision, ongoing information exchange is crucial. The act of signing may give the impression that discussion has been closedoffor irreparably sealed. While each element ofinformed consent need not be the focus of explicitdeliberation in every clinical decision.i\" observation studies regarding how many of the essential domains ofinformed consent are actually used in clinical decision-making have shown that norms clearly fail ethical standards.19.21.5o For example, audiotape analysis of 81 ambulatory care visits revealed that in only 2% ofthe 262 clinical de\u00ad cisionsevaluated was there any understanding/\" jHALLENGES TO PRESERVING PATIENT IGNTS IN FORMALIZED INFORMED CONSENT The act of signing a consent form is typically reserved for the most formal types of informed consent such as for invasive surgical proce\u00ad dures, the receipt of blood products, or the recruitment of human subjects for research. There are different ways to formally designate that a decision has been made. Physicians and patients can write and sign a contract or review and sign a preprinted contract. These docu\u00ad ments may be cosigned, witnessed, copied, and filed. These activities confirm that a decision was made at a specific time. Unfortunately, such formality has similar attributes to other signed legal agreements and contracts, and people may mistakenly apply attributes of other documents they sign to the informed-consent context. In the recruitment of human subjects, federal regulations preclude the use of exculpatory language in informed consent forms that would \"waive or appear to waive any ofthe subject's rights\" to pursue compensation for injury.52 However, this is exactly the purpose of the liability waivers people sign in nonmedical contexts, and low\u00ad literate adults may associate the legal formalities of informed-consent forms with such a waiver ofrights.53 The Federal Officefor Human Research Protection (OHRP) encour\u00ad ages careful wording of informed-consent language to ensure that subjects do not think they give up any rights when they sign consent forms.54However, failure appearscommonplace. As oneresearcher noted, \"It is doubtful that many subjects understand these studied attempts to protect the institution. The researcher, who supposedly is seeking informed consent. rarelv will be able to exnlain the statement. 126 Health Literacy and Communication Thus, the very essence of the relation of informed consent between subject and investigator is compromised.t''\" Ifcomprehension has been compromised, the consent may be nulli\u00ad fied. Medical malpractice case law supports functional illiteracy as a basis for overriding an executed consent form. For example, the Inter\u00ad mediateCourtofAppealsofHawaii,in a 1991opinion nullifying an informed consent form due to a patient's low literacy, stated that it would \"pervert the law of informed consent to allow a physician to discharge his or her affirmative duty by merely securing a signature\u00ad even that ofa...confused or uneducated patienton an abstruse, jargon-ridden, and largely unintelligible preprinted consent form.,,56 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also established a special obligation to protect the rights of illiterate individuals during the consent process and warns that: Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to co\u00ad ercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated. 57 Despite these concerns, the FDA offers no guidance for literacy as\u00ad sessment and does not elaborate criteria for assessment of \"illiterate individuals.\" The only hint regarding their definition of illiteracy is from guidance that states: \"Illiterate persons who understand English mayhave the consent read to them and'make theirmark,' ifappro\u00ad priate under applicable state law.\"This is neither adequate guidance for managing the barriers presented by low literacy nor an adequate operational definition of illiteracy. Most of the 40 to 44 million American adults estimated to be functionally illiterate are able to sign their names without difficulty. 13 In most circumstances where formalized consent is used, both clini\u00ad cian and patient may benefit from the procedure. Where there is risk of bodily harm, possible dissatisfaction, high cost, abuse, or potential exposure to discrimination for the patient, there is also risk of poten\u00ad tialliability for the provider. The overwhelming complexity of many formalized consent materials, however, is evidence that the central focus offormalization is not patient education but an attempt to avoid professional liability. _~EADABILITY OF INFORMED-CONSENT FORMS Most adults admit to not reading consent forms/\" This is not surpris\u00ad ing as informed-consent forms are too long, have poor layout, use font sizes that are too small for many readers, and use unexplained med\u00ad ical jargon and legal patois. Despite decades of reports decrying this The ChallengesofInformed Consent 127 problem, informed-consent forms have largely remained complex and are getting longer. 59,60 Expanding disclosure obligations have exacerbated this trend.61,62 For example, in an attempt to protect patients' privacy rights, the re\u00ad cent Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HlPAA) has added a considerable amount of additional text to consent forms. The current informed-consent form HlPAA section required for the recruitment of human subjects at Johns Hopkins is comparatively briefat 727 words long, or roughly 2%pages (www.hopkinsmedicine. org/irb/jhmirb). Because marginal readers read simple text at 80 to 160 words per minute, this one mandatory section will add about 9 minutes of reading time.63 While it is possible that a low-literate reader could make it through the text, it is unlikely that poor readers will sustain such an effort. Research on readability analysis was initiated more than 75 years ago to evaluate grade-school textbooks.64,65 Since then, dozens of tech\u00ad niques have been developed. These analysis systems operate with word lists and evaluate cognitive and organizational complexity, and/or by means of formulas based on text characteristics, such as av\u00ad erage word length (semantics) and average sentence length (syntac\u00ad tics). No word-list system has been validated for decades, and shifts in word use may have made these systems obsolete: An automated and combined approach with an updated word list would maximize the benefit of traditional readability measures. One particular readability formula is the Flesch-Kincaid formula, which is based on average sentence length and the average number of syllables per word. Because the Flesch-Kincaid formula has been incorporated into Microsoft's word readability statistics, it has become broadly available and the most frequently used in the medical literature. Unfortunately, though it has been validated in adults up to a 16th-grade level, the formula is truncated erroneously at a 12th\u00ad grade level in Microsoft Word.63, 66--68Consequently, many studies that have used Flesch-Kincaid analysis likely present falsely low evaluations. I Readability formulas do not ensure that text will be understand\u00ad able. For example, they are not able to identify authors who know the operating parameters of the formula and purposefully write in short but arcane argot and cant. The formulas serve to highlight problem areas and should never be the only tool used to ensure that text is clearly written.69-72 While the appropriate readability level will vary from setting to setting, many institutions set a particular grade-level readability standard and give the impression that documents will be acceptable providing they are written at a lower readability level than the chosen standard.\" In a survey of US medical schools, grade-level readability TAB L E 8\u00b72 Examples of Informed-Consent Text Provided by Institutional Review Boards at US Medical Schools\u00b7 Fourth gradet Sixth gradet Eighth gradet Tenth gradell \"You don't have to be in this re\u00ad search study.

However, this standard is neither based on the epidemiology of local rates of low literacy nor actually fulfilled in the template text presented by these same institutions. Indeed, only 8% of US medical schools met their own target standards in the template language they promulgate.

The OHRP has identified readability of informed-consent forms as a priority area in its reviev\u20ac; process. Informed consent for medical research is particularly sensitf because comprehension beyond the requisite ofusual care is requir and there are historic concerns about exploitation ofvulnerable t populations. 74 A great deal has changed over the last 50 years in human subje research. In a landmark study in 1966, Beecher reviewed the ethic 50 studies and found that consent was mentioned in only 2 studi . He wrote: \"Ifsuitably approached, patients willaccede,on the bas trust, to about any request their physician may make.\"75 Beecher. ported mandating informed consent for research but also felt tha \" such consent would be a safeguard for patient protection only in ..... hands of responsible investigators. Furthermore, he felt that the 0, informed-consent forms are meaningless ifinvestigators do not e gage the process with integrity. . A particular barrier to informed consent in research is the b . misunderstanding of the central concepts ofmedical research an: the pivotal vocabulary commonly used to describethem. For ex . The Challenges of Informed Consent 131 more than three quarters of subjects do not understand the word \"randomly.\"54,76,77 To achieve systemic change in the readability of informed-consent forms for research, institutional review boards will need to improve the template and sample text offered to investiga\u00ad tors. Federal review appears to improve readability of informed\u00ad consent text offered to investigators; in fact, US medical schools that have undergone federal compliance oversight were found to have informed-consent form templates with better readability than those that had not undergone such review. In addition, models already exist to aid interested medical schools.\" Institutions as diverse as the National Cancer Institute and the State University of New York Downstate Medical School have presented informed-consent tem\u00ad plates and sample forms that are below an eighth-grade readability leve1.78,79 These forms can serve as models for a national informed consent form template to markedly improve much of the current text offered by institutional review boards. A randomized controlled trial of an easy-to-read informed consent form of 226 patients at 44 institutions revealed that an informed con\u00ad sent form with a decreased readability level was associated with less anxiety, higher satisfaction, and higher accrual rate.80Other studies have suggested that improved forms may decrease medical litigation'\" and that lowering readability levels of written materials improves patient satisfaction and comprehension for patients, even ifthey are fully literate.82-85 However, while lowering the readability level of informed- consent documents is crucial, it does not ensure comprehension. Sub\u00ad jects commonly think they will personally have medical benefits from phase I protocols, despite enrolling with consent documents that say otherwise.\" This type of confusion will not be completely ameliorated by improving the readability ofthe text. Improving methods for presenting information to potential research subjects is an ongoing challenge and is itself an enduring topic of randomized trialS.87,88 Ultimately, confirmation of comprehension is the safest approach., -P0NCLUSION Informed consent can be a technique for empowering patients and re\u00ad search subjects. Itis also a technique for clinicians, investigators, and institutions to use to manage risk and liability. Both agendas will be advanced by improvements in the informed-consent process. The over\u00ad whelming complexity of many consent forms gives the impression that medical institutions seek to disempower their clients with obfuscatory confabulations. With regard to informed-consent forms, it must be remembered that these educational documents are intended to facilitate the 132 Health Literacy and Communication decision-making process.\" An obvious barrier to fulfilling this pur\u00ad pose is the readability level of these documents. Many institutions have adopted an eighth-grade readability level as the upper limit of understandability, but in reality, this standard is too high. Further\u00ad more, this standard is inconsistently adhered to in the template text presented by many institutions. N3 demonstrated in Table 8-2, the central concepts of informed consent can be written at a fourth grade level. Reasonable grade-level readability standards may remove the barrier of low literacy currently built into consent forms. Quality control must be extended beyond the use of readability formulas. Readability formulas, such as the Flesch-Kincaid and Fry formulas, are ubiquitous, easy to use, and easy to fool. Adding a few periods and acronyms will improve a readability statistic more than actually advancing clarity or general understandability. Materials such as informed-consent documents should be developed and tested with target populations.89-91 Beyond shorter words and sentences, other techniques may help improve the comprehension of informed-consent materials. These techniques include modifying features such as font, layout, length, and conceptual complexity as well as using multimedia presen\u00ad tations, including video-and audiotape, and interactive computer programs.771,92-103 There may also be a benefit to supplementing consent documents with systems, known as decision aids, that contextualize ab\u00ad stract risk concepts and compare the consequences of'various options. These may take many forms, ranging from personalized risk profiles derived from questionnaires or computer programs that deliver tailored messages to interactive CD-ROM or Web-based instruction. Decision aids have been found to have a range of benefits in the communication of risk information, although they have not been specifically evaluated in low-literate populations. In particular, decision aids have been shown to improve knowledge, improve accuracy ofrisklbenefit assessment, promote shared decision-making, and improve concordance between pa\u00ad tients' stated values and the decision to pursue cancer screening.104-107 Future research may indicate that this approach to risk communication is useful in the informed consent process with low-literate patients. The consent document and any ancillary materials, however, are simply tools of the communication process that must be present to ensure high-quality informed consent. The larger context of communi\u00ad cation involves examining the assumptions and expectations that inform not only the specific decision that is being considered but also as the nature, purpose, and meaning of consent itself. Low-literate pa\u00ad tients may be less likely to ask physicians questions to confirm their understanding. Research may confirm that a communication process in which patient questions are solicited and addressed is more likely to result in accurate patient understanding. The Challenges of Informed Consent 133 Unfortunately, the present culture of medical care allows routine abrogation of patient rights through a desultory and cursory approach to informed consent. Trainees are often sent to obtain a patient's consent without adequate training in the informed-consent process and without adequate knowledge of the procedure being of\u00ad fered.1 08-113 Clinicians often view the process as \"consenting a patient\" rather than of helping a patient decide whether or not to pursue a particular option.P\" Part of this problem stems from the amount of time it may take to adequately perform the informed-consent process. It is possible that clinicians may be encouraged to invest the required amount of time if the consent process becomes a billable item, as has been done in JapanY5 A cultural shift toward a patient-centered model could significantly advance the opportunity for high-quality informed consent.1l6,m This may especially be true for low-literate patients who often know less about their medical conditions and may be less likely to question their health care providers. What are the patient's objectives for their care? What are the potential research subject's goals? Ifhealth profes\u00ad sionals elicit responses to these core questions, they will be oriented to the patient's perspectives and level of understanding and have the opportunity to begin a dialogue that can lead to a successful informed\u00ad consent process. Physicians and medical institutions have a responsibility and incen\u00ad tive to optimize the consent process. When informed-consent documents are at readability levels that exceed the reader's capacity, physicians and medical institutions fail a significant ethical precept and expose themselves to legal risk.15,16 Beyond legal and ethical obligations, there is also a pragmatic benefit from having a fully informed constituency. Nonetheless, optimization of the informed-consent process should be driven primarily by the purpose of informed consent-namely, the education of patients-rather than fear of liability. After all, the trans\u00ad formation of the largely incomprehensible informed-consent process to clear, plain, and direct communication that conveys honesty and under\u00ad standing is nothing less than what th~ \"energetic and practical\" people of our country deserve. ~EFERENCES 1.

CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY Assessment of medical school institutional review board policies regarding compensation of subjects for research-related injury Michael K. Paasche-Orlow, MD, MPH,aFrederick L. Brancati, MD, MHSb aFrom the Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; and the bDepartments of Medicine and Epidemiology, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. PURPOSE: Although the Institute of Medicine (IOM) calls for research organizations to compensate subjects for research-related injury, administrators may fear that candid presentation of such policieswould create nancial risk. We hypothesized that informed consent language at U.S. medical schoolswould be particularly complex and fall short of IOM goals, especially for projects without industrysponsorship. METHODS: Medical school websites (N /H11005123) were surveyed for informed consent language for research-related injury. Text was extracted from 113 sites (92%) and evaluated for details regardingnancial liability for research-related injury. When sufcient template text was available (n /H11005106), the readability of liability policies was compared with the readability of other standardized passages usingFlesch-Kincaid analysis. RESULTS: Coverage for medical bills is offered at 61% (23/38) of schools when there is an industry sponsor as compared with 22% (22/102) when there is none ( P/H110210.001). When coverage is offered in studies with no industry sponsor, it is limited to emergency bills in half (11/22) of these policies.Seventy-two percent (81/113) of medical school consent forms specically rule out the possibility ofmonetary compensation. The mean ( /H11006SD) reading grade level of liability text in consent forms is higher than that in other template paragraphs (11.5 /H110061.4 vs. 10.6 /H110061.4;P/H110050.0001). CONCLUSION: Federally funded research at most U.S. medical schools is conducted with consent form language that is particularly complex and that fails to protect subjects from the nancial burdenof research-related injury. Few schools meet IOM standards.\u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, the IOM advo-cates for research institutions to provide at least the costof medical care and rehabilitation, without regard tofault, until federal protection is initiated. However, froma risk management perspective, candid presentation ofsuch a policy might create nancial risk. Consequently,lawyers seeking to mitigate nancial risk may tend todraft complex informed consent language that appears to Dr. Brancati was supported by a Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient Oriented Research (K24DK62222).

We further hypothesized that schools would offerbetter coverage for industry-sponsored research than forresearch sponsored by the National Institutes of Health(NIH), as industry provides an alternative source of funding,and that schools with more research activity and those witha public mandate might be more likely to offer coverage. Methods Data sources All data were obtained from publicly available websites between 2001 and 2002. The websites of medical schoolinstitutional review boards (N /H11005123) were surveyed for any suggested text for research-related injuries in informedconsent documentation. Of the 123 medical schools in the50 states and the District of Columbia, we were unable toidentify policies for research-related injuries in 10 for thefollowing reasons: website restricted to intranet access (n /H11005 6), website without mention of injury or compensation (n /H11005 1), and no indication of existence of an institutional reviewboard website (n /H110053). The NIH website yielded the rank order of medical school funding in 2002. 9This was used as an indicator of research activity at the medical school. Text abstraction Each medical school's institutional review board website was examined for suggested text for informed consent doc-umentation. Applicable templates, sample documents, andsample language were downloaded into Microsoft Word2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington). These materialswere surveyed for any text related to injury and compensa-tion for adult human research subjects with full decisionalcapacity. Payment for medical care Abstracted text regarding research-related injury was eval- uated for indications of nancial responsibility for the cost ofmedical care. Any distinctions between the cost of emergencycare and other medical expenses, stipulations of nancial lia-bility, or specied billing procedures were noted.Financial compensation for injury Abstracted text regarding research-related injury was evaluated for any description of a system or policy forsubjects to receive nancial compensation of any kind (e.g.,lost wages, disability, pain, and suffering). Readability assessment Readability was measured with a component of the au- tomated readability statistics offered in Microsoft Word: theFlesch-Kincaid readability scale (range, 0 to 12th grade).The readability of the liability policy statement was com-pared with the average readability of three other templatetext paragraphs. 10The Flesch-Kincaid system is a valid measure that assesses readability based on the average num-ber of syllables per word and the average number of wordsper sentence. 11,12There was sufcient template text from the informed consent form in 94% (n /H11005106) to allow analysis of readability. Statistical analysis Rates of compensation according to funding source, pub- lic versus private status, and tertiles of NIH funding rankwere compared using chi-squared tests. Comparison ofmean observed readability scores of compensation text withthat of other template text was conducted with the Wilcoxonsigned-rank test. All signicance tests were two-tailed.Analyses were conducted with Stata, version 8 (CollegeStation, Texas). This research was classied as exempt bythe Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Results Informed consent language for research-related injury wasidentied in 92% (n /H11005113) of medical school websites. Indemnication arrangements are negotiated between pri-vate sponsors and the ofce for research administration atthe medical schools on a case-by-case basis. As such, manyschools do not present template language for sponsoredstudies. Of the 113 medical schools, 90% (n /H11005102) provide template language for federally sponsored studies and 34%(n/H1100538) provide template language for industry-sponsored studies. Separate texts for federal- and industry-sponsoredresearch are provided by 24% (n /H1100527) of the schools and 10% (n /H1100511) of the schools exclusively provide text for industry-sponsored studies. Payment for medical care Of 38 schools that present language templates for indus- try-sponsored studies, 23 (61%) declare that industry spon-sors will pay the medical expenses of research-related in-jury. An optional format is presented in 34% (n /H1100513) to accommodate various policies, and 8% (n /H110053) appear to presume that sponsors will not be offering free medical care.176 The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 118, No 2, February 2005Only 13% (3/23) of the industry-sponsored policies that offer some form of coverage are explicitly limited to reim-bursement of costs related to emergency care. In contrast, of the 102 schools with NIH text, only 22 (22%) offer some form of nancial support, 58 (57%) specify that nonancial support is available for the medical bills from re-search-related injuries, and in the remaining 22 (22%) nancialresponsibility is unclear. Most policies that offer nancial pro-tection are clearly limited, with half (11/22) offering only thecost of emergency medical care ( Table 1 ). Overall, informed consent language in industry-sponsored research is signicantly more likely than in NIH-sponsoredresearch to offer free medical care for research-related injury(Table 2 ). This difference persists in analyses stratied by level of research activity and medical school type. Higher level ofresearch intensiveness is associated signicantly with languagethat is more likely to offer free care for research-related inju-ries. In contrast, there appears to be no difference in languagebetween public and private medical schools.At the 27 schools that present separate texts for industry and non-industry-sponsored liability language, there are 11concordant policies, seven of which representing instanceswhere both texts offer some payment for medical bills. Ineach of the 16 sets of discordant policies, nancial supportis offered in the industry-sponsored policy and not offeredin the absence of an industry sponsor ( P/H110210.005). Financial compensation for injury No school offered to provide nancial compensation for research-related injury. Notably, 72% (81/113) of informedconsent forms specically rule out nancial compensation,using a variety of wording ( Table 3 ). No mention of com- pensation for research-related injuries is made in 18% (n /H11005 20) of schools. In 11% (n /H1100512), the language is not clear and sometimes leaves open the possibility that some sub-jects could receive monetary compensation in certain un-specied circumstances. For example, four schools indicate,Table 1 Characteristics of 22 programs with no industry sponsor that offer subjects nancial protection for research-related injuries Policy limits* Typical language Number of schools Emergency coverage only \" . . . will pay the cost of emergency rst aid for any injury that may happen as a result of your being in this study.\"8 Reasonable and necessary \" . . . will reimburse you for the reasonable costs of medically necessary treatment.\"4 Emergency and short-term coverage \"Only immediate, essential, short-term medical treatment as determined by the participating hospital, will be available for the injury withoutcharge to you personally.\"3 Only medical coverage \"Medical treatment for physical injury directly resulting from the research procedure.\"3 Unspecied \"You will not have to pay any charges resulting from the harmful effect or injury.\"3 Nontherapeutic \" . . . injured as a direct result of research procedures not done primarily for your own benet, you will receive treatment at no cost.\"1 *Six of these policies relate solely to charges that remain subsequent to attempts to recover funds from subject's insurance policies.

Subjects at approximately three quarters ofU.S. medical schools sign forms that reject institutionalresponsibility for the direct or indirect costs of research-related injury. In programs where subjects are offered someform of nancial relief, this is typically limited to the billsassociated with emergency care. Further, the language usedto describe these policies is particularly complex and so isless likely to be understood by many potential subjects. When medical schools host studies paid for by industrial sponsors, they generally ensure indemnication arrange-ments are in place. However, when they host research paidfor by the NIH, most do not maintain this standard. In manyinstitutions, this creates a double standard whereby theterms of liability shift from study to study depending on thefunding source. The strengths of our study that lend weight to these conclusions are the nearly complete sampling of U.S. med-ical schools and the use of standardized instruments for dataabstraction. Nonetheless, several limitations should be keptin mind. First, data were obtained exclusively from web-sites. Although it is likely that the materials presented onmedical school websites accurately reflect the materials used locally, additional documents were not examined. Forexample, only a third of the schools presented template textfor privately sponsored studies. It is plausible that medicalschools not presenting such materials might systematicallyendorse policies that are less protective; however, there isno particular reason to link the choice to post materials ona medical school's website with the details of compensationpolicy. Second, our analysis was limited to templates andsamples rather than actual consent forms. Although we didnot directly evaluate the possibility that investigators mightintroduce changes in the liability language, our experiencesuggests that such action is rare. Third, and most impor-tantly, our analysis was limited to informed consent lan-guage and did not evaluate the actual practice pattern ofinvestigators, administrators, and risk-managers. There maybe a gap between the language and actual practice. Althoughschools may have unstated policies, an a priori rejection ofnancial responsibility paired with a subsequent plan to payfor research-related injuries is problematic. This type ofarrangement uses the informed consent document as a de-vice to dissuade injured subjects from seeking nancialsupport. There are several ways for informed consent documents to prevent people from achieving their rights as humansubjects. Two of these barriers, which are specically pro-hibited by federal statute, were commonly noted in ourstudy. The rst is the presence of overly complicated lan-guage. 14Forty-eight percent of adults in the United States read at or below an eighth-grade reading level.15Since 1970, experts have recognized this concern and called forliability policies to be \"prominently placed in clear, readableterms at the top or front of consent forms or be presented ina separately signed document\". 16As the mean reading levelof informed consent language pertaining to liability exam- ined in our study was higher than the 11th-grade level, it isclearly a prevalent and persistent problem. The second barrier is the presence of exculpatory lan- guage, which would \"waive or appear to waive any of thesubject's rights\" to pursue compensation for injury. 14The Federal Ofce for Human Research Protection (OHRP)encourages careful wording of informed consent languagefor research-related injury and offers acceptable text, in-cluding phrases such as \"not able to offer nancial compen-sation\" or \"makes no commitment to provide free\" medicalcare. 17Much of the language we found appears more ex- culpatory than the OHRP examples, but even what isdeemed acceptable by OHRP may give many subjects themistaken impression that they have no recourse to pursuecompensation beyond the institution's voluntarily chosenlimits. 8 Legal representatives for medical schools must be con- cerned about nancial liability. Possibly, they feel that theydo not want to encourage the participation of a litigiouscohort of subjects with informed consent form language thatmight serve as a roadmap to compensation. 8After the fact, risk-managers determine which injured subjects will be compensated ex gratia and which will have to sue. How- ever, as noted by the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Ad HocAdvisory Panel, \"remitting injured subjects to the uncer-tainties of the law court is not a solution\". 5This arrange- ment creates hurdles to compensation and promotes anadversarial relationship between the injured subject and theinstitution. 19 The whole discussion begs the question: what is a re- search-related injury? Institutions should be concerned bythe vagaries of assigning causation in many circumstances.Any adverse event must be reported to the institutionalreview board; however, only a fraction of adverse eventswill be due to the research and only a fraction of these willbe due to negligence. In a trial of cholesterol-loweringinterventions, every myocardial infarction is an adverseevent, but few, if any, may constitute a research-relatedinjury. Further, data to characterize the scope of this prob-lem are inadequate. Research institutions carry insurance to protect them- selves from claims of negligence; yet, injuries that resultfrom research, but are not due to negligence, are typicallynot covered by institutional policies. 20In addition, when policies are based on proof of negligence, investigators mustmanage contrasting obligations. Will they advance the in-terests of their subject or of the institution? To avoid the concern of dual loyalties, decrease admin- istrative obstacles, decrease cost, and fulll the moral dutyof compensating injured subjects, the IOM and others haveadvocated for a no-fault compensation system. 4-6,20-23In- deed, the Veterans Administration and the Department ofDefense have instituted formal programs to pay for themedical care of injured subjects in research they fund. 24,25 Similarly, policies to provide compensation for injured re-179 Paasche-Orlow and Brancati Research-Related Injurysearch subjects are in place at the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, the European Union,and other countries. 4,26Such programs indicate a broad endorsement of the importance of compensating injuredsubjects. However, such programs cannot serve as directmodels for U.S. policy as organizations such as the VeteransAdministration are both the payer and the provider. Several medical schools that offer some form of payment for medical services differentiate between therapeutic andnontherapeutic research. This distinction is hard to defend.The fact that a subject may potentially derive some benetfrom a therapeutic protocol does not add force to the claimthat subjects who are also patients should not be compen-sated for injury related to the research. Although the naturalprogression of a disease and a true research-related illnessmay sometimes be difcult to discern, this should not pro-vide a categorical rejection of responsibility. 1,19 We all benet from medical research. People who be- come research subjects are exposed to the small but realchance of being injured. Our study provides evidence thatmost publicly funded research is conducted without a safetynet to protect subjects from the nancial burden of injuries.Research institutions should help shoulder the burden ofrisk for subjects in NIH-sponsored research to provide atleast the cost of medical care and rehabilitation, withoutregard to fault, until federal protection is initiated. Such apolicy will afrm our social contract with these invaluablevolunteers, simplify the relationship between subjects andthe physician-researchers who recruit them, and establishcandor as the cornerstone of consent. 27,28 Acknowledgment The authors thank Dr. Paul Lietman, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, forencouragement and review of the manuscript.

Methods : We evaluated a cohort of female detainees at The Rhode Island Adult Correc- tional Institute between July and September 2004. Among the 423 women who participatedin the study, 55% did not have a high school diploma, 29% had /H113498th grade reading capacity, 32% had a learning disability, 37% had problem drinking, and 61% (257/423) reported HIVrisk behavior. Results : In multiple logistic regression, participants who had completed high school had the lowest likelihood of HIV risk behavior (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% confidence in-terval [CI] 0.12-1.00). There was no association between participants' literacy level and HIVrisk behavior (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 0.83-4.92). Conclusions : Correctional education programs to reduce HIV risk behavior should focus on those with low educational attainment irrespective of literacy skills. 852INTRODUCTION THE PREVALENCE OF LOW educational attain- ment, low literacy, and learning disabilities has been found to be particularly high amongprisoners. 1-4According to the U.S. Department of Justice's 1997 survey of over 1 million state in-mates, 68% did not have a high school diploma. 2 Among the 1147 subjects assessed in the prisonsample of the National Adult Literacy Survey of1992, 68%-72% were found to have limited prose,document, and quantitative literacy and lack theskills needed for independent participation in so-ciety. 1,5Prisoners' educational attainment and literacy have been correlated with correctional out-comes. 1,2,6,7Indeed, the potential for correctional education programs to reduce recidivism hasbeen an intensive area of research. 8-16However, almost no research has explored the role of edu-cational factors among prisoners for health out-comes or evaluated the potential health benefit ofcorrectional education. Prisoners have a high disease burden and are important vectors for infectious diseases. 6,17,18Fe- male prisoners with short incarcerations in par-ticular have been identified as a high-risk popu-lation for the spread of HIV and sexually 1Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts. 2Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brown University School of Medicine, Providence, Rhode Island.

Lower educational attainmenthas been reported as a risk factor for higher ratesof HIV risk behavior among female inmates, al-though evaluation of different educational factorshas not been conducted. 29 Low educational attainment and low literacy have been linked to low levels of knowledge andworse health outcomes for such chronic diseasesas diabetes, asthma, and HIV infection. 30-35How- ever, the relationship of educational attainmentand literacy with HIV risk behavior has not beenevaluated. We sought to examine the relationshipbetween educational factors and HIV risk behav-ior among women in short-term incarceration. Inaddition, we sought to provide an estimate of theindependent relationship of specific educationalfactors and HIV risk behavior in an adjustedanalysis. We hypothesized that low educationalattainment, low literacy, a history of special edu-cation, and a history of a learning disabilitywould all be associated with higher HIV risk be-haviors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design This is a cross-sectional analysis of data in- cluding HIV risk behavior, alcohol consumption,educational attainment, literacy, history of spe-cial education, and demographic information ob-tained by face-to-face interviews from a cohort offemale detainees within 4 days of arrival at TheRhode Island Adult Correctional Institute (ACI).Study approval was obtained from the MiriamHospital Institutional Review Board, the Officefor Human Research Protection, and the MedicalResearch Advisory Group at the ACI prior to ini-tiation. A Certificate of Confidentiality was ob-tained from the federal government to further en-sure participant privacy. The warden of thewomen's facility agreed to help guarantee par-ticipant confidentiality and granted permissionfor all interactions with the women to occur one- on-one with research assistants in unmonitoredrooms. Study site The Rhode Island ACI is a unified correction system serving as a combined prison and jail,holding all pretrial and sentenced inmates in thestate. There are approximately 2000 female com-mitments to the ACI annually, of which 400 re-sult in sentences. Similar to women prisonersthroughout the country, most women in the ACIare charged with nonviolent crimes (79%), 31%with drug-related charges. Over 72% of the wo-men are less than 40 years old. In Rhode Island,56% of women released from prison are reincar-cerated within 1 year. For women who are notsentenced, 69% are released within 4 days, and45% of those women who are sentenced are re-leased in 6 months or less. Outcome variable The outcome variable of interest was HIV risk behavior. This was defined as a dichotomousvariable based on response to the followingquery: During the last 3 months, have you hadsex without using a condom ORhave you shared any part of injection drug equipment (needle, sy-ringe, cotton, cooker, or rinse water) at least oncea month? Primary independent variables Four separate educational variables were eval- uated: educational attainment, literacy, specialeducation, and having an individualized educa-tional plan (IEP). Consistent with the definitionused by the National Center for Educational Sta-tistics and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, educa-tional attainment was defined as the last com-pleted year of school. 1Subjects who did not have a high school diploma were asked if and wherethey may have taken classes for the general equiv-alence degree (GED). Literacy is the capacity touse \"printed and written information to functionin society, to achieve one's goals, and to developone's knowledge and potential.\" 1Literacy was evaluated with the 66-word version of the RapidEstimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM).The REALM is based on the pronunciation of 66medically relevant words. It is the most com-monly used literacy instrument in the medical lit-5887_10-p852-859 11/15/05 11:28 AM Page 853 erature and is well correlated with other mea- sures of medical and 0.88,SORT-R 0.96, PIAT-R 0.97, TOHFLA are cat- egorized as having /H113506th grade, 7th-8th grade, or /H113509th grade reading capacity. A history of special education was defined by affirmative endorse-ment of the question: Did you ever go to specialeducation classes or work with a resource teacheroutside of your regular classroom? An IEP is apersonal pedagogic plan developed for studentswho are found to have a learning disability. Suchplans are adapted to accommodate specific learn-ing deficits identified by neuropsychological test-ing, available free in the state of Rhode Island forthe past 25 years. Such plans include (1) assess-ment of the child's level of educational perfor-mance, (2) delineation of short-term and annualinstructional objectives, (3) statement of thechild's capacity to learn in regular education pro-grams and the need for specified educational ser-vices required, (4) specified dates for initiationand completion of specified educational services,and (5) statement of the objectives, evaluationprocedures, and results of at least an annual as-sessment of these goals. 38Having an IEP was de- fined by affirmative endorsement of the question:When you were in school, did you ever have anIEP, an individualized educational plan? Other independent variables Other specific variables assessed included age, race (black, white, or Hispanic), and problemdrinking. Problem drinking was defined as hav-ing a score of /H113508 on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). 39,40The AUDIT is a 10-item instrument that evaluates consumption,dependence, and consequences of alcohol. Sample and procedure From February 4, 2004, through July 19, 2004, women entering the ACI who were awaiting trialwere recruited to participate. Research assistantsreviewed traffic sheets (daily printouts of all fe-male inmates committed to the facility) on a dailybasis, Monday (which included weekend traffic)through Friday, and attempted to contact eachwoman. Research staff collected data on whichwomen declined participation, were releasedprior to contact, or did not meet inclusion crite-ria. Eligibility criteria included English speaking,housed in general facility population, age 18 or older, not yet sentenced, and able to competentlyprovide verbal consent. If a woman was unableto be screened secondary to being in segregation,being ill, or in acute withdrawal from drugs oralcohol or both, her status was followed until shewas released or could be approached for partici-pation. Eligible women met with research assistants who introduced themselves as members of a re-search team from Rhode Island Hospital, per-forming a brief survey regarding educational experiences. It was emphasized that study par-ticipation was completely voluntary and that noidentifying information was going to be recordedon the woman's questionnaire. Analysis Fisher exact test and two-sample ttests were used to compare subject characteristics by HIVrisk behavior. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)was used to evaluate the relationships among theeducational variables. Bivariable logistic regres-sion analysis was used to relate the primary inde-pendent variables educational attainment ( /H113498th grade, 9th-11th ( /H113496th grade, 7th-8th grade, or /H113509th grade), history of special education (yes vs. no), history of having an IEP (yes vs. no), and de-mographic variables to HIV risk behavior and arepresented as unadjusted odds ratios (ORs). Agewas evaluated in tertiles (youngest 18-30, middle31-38, and oldest 39-64). In addition, a multi-variate logistic regression model was fit that in-cluded race, age, and problem drinking. Allanalyses were carried out using Stata, version 8.0(College Station, TX). RESULTS During the study period, there were 966 nonre- dundant commitments; 459 women were re-leased before contact was made, and research as-sistants attempted to recruit 507 subjects. Amongthese inmates, the participation rate was 83% (423of 507): 52 refused to participate, 9 were non-Eng-lish speaking, 16 were in segregation or on thehospital ward, and 7 were incompetent. Partici-pants in the study had an average age of 34 years,63% were Caucasian, 55% did not have a highschool diploma, 29% had /H113498th grade reading ca-PAASCHE-ORLOW ET AL. 8545887_10-p852-859 11/15/05 11:28 AM Page 854 EDUCATION AND HIV RISK BEHAVIOR 855 pacity, 32% had either a history of special educa- tion (26 %) or a history of an individualized ed-ucational plan (15%), 37% had problem drinking,and 61% (257 of 423) reported HIV risk behavior.Younger age, being Caucasian, having lower ed-ucational attainment, and having problem drink-ing were each associated with HIV risk behavior.There was no difference in age ( participants. Demographiccharacteristics and the relationship to HIV riskfactors are summarized in Table 1. Unadjusted ORs for HIV risk behavior reveal a graded relationship for educational attainment,with more education being significantly relatedto lower HIV risk behavior (Table 2). There wasalso a graded relationship between literacy leveland HIV risk behavior. Participants with lowerliteracy had less HIV risk behavior; however, thisrelationship was not statistically significant. Par-ticipants who were older, African American, anddid not have problem drinking had lower oddsfor HIV risk behavior. These same trends persisted in a multiple lo- gistic regression model of adjusted ORs for HIVrisk behavior (Table 2). Whereas participants whohad completed high school had the lowest likeli- hood of HIV risk behavior (adjusted OR 0.35, 95%confidence interval [CI] 0.12-1.00), participantswho had the highest literacy level had the high-est likelihood of HIV risk behavior (adjusted ORof 2.02, 95% CI 0.83-4.92). 95% 0.29-0.86)had lower rates of HIV risk behavior. A historyof problem drinking continued to be associatedwith lower rates of HIV risk behavior; however,this was no longer significant (aOR, problemdrinking, yes vs. no: 1.60, 95% CI 0.97 -2.64) DISCUSSION We found that educational attainment is asso- ciated with HIV risk behavior among incarcer-ated woman. Specifically, women with the high-est likelihood of HIV risk behavior were thosewho had left school prior to 9th grade. Staying inschool into high school was associated with a 65%decreased odds of HIV risk behavior, and havinga high school diploma was associated with a 70%decreased odds of HIV risk behavior.

The central message of these failed hypotheses may be that health prevention messages havebeen relatively successful in reaching across lit-eracy and special education barriers for peoplewho had stayed in school at least into high school.Specifically, staying in school was helpful even ifit did not advance literacy skills. Early identifi-cation of learning disabilities in states like RhodeIsland, which have broadly supported the evalu-ation and education of students with learning dis-abilities, may alter the HIV risk behavior for suchsubjects by helping to keep people with learningdisabilities in school. As this is a cross-sectional study, we can pro- vide no evidence of a causal relationship for ourmain reported association between low educa-tional attainment and HIV risk behavior. How-ever, we speculate that many of the reasons par- ticipants dropped out of school early were di-rectly related to either sex-risk or drug-risk be-haviors. For instance, addiction and unwantedsexual activity are causes for leaving schoolearly. 41Similarly, the social interactions for young woman outside of school may bring peo-ple in contact with older men who may them-selves offer a higher-risk behavior profile. Alter-natively, it is possible that participants whostayed in school were influenced by this envi-ronment to be risk averse. It is unlikely, however,that the beneficial influence of remaining inschool is mediated through aspects of cognitivefunction or literacy skills, as neither having alearning disability nor low literacy was associatedwith HIV risk behavior. The lack of concordance for HIV risk behavior between educational attainment and literacy rep-resents the fact that these variables measure dif-ferent phenomena.

In contrast, the level of educationalattainment is a historical marker of overall socialfunction, status, and behavior. People often ad-vance in school without adequate education, aphenomenon known as social promotion, andother people are fully literate even if they dropout of school. At a statistical level, this can be rep-resented in the current study by the fact that only7% of the variance in literacy levels is attributableto the level of education (ANOVA R 2/H110050.07). A broad literature has documented the associ- ation between educational attainment and an ar-ray of healthcare outcomes. 42The mechanisms by which this association is elaborated are likelycomplex and include such factors as life coursesocial stratification that clusters types of experi-ences over an individual's lifetime, biological fac-tors that predispose people both to education andhealth advantages, and social dynamics that in-volve the broader cultural, economic, policy, andpolitical environment. 43Similar mechanisms have been evoked to explain the connection be-tween literacy and health, 35,44but specific delin- eation of risk factors and mechanisms for crucialhealth conditions, such as HIV, may help informthe development and implementation of success-ful interventions. African American women were found to have half the odds of reporting HIV risk behavior. Toour knowledge, no previous study has identifiedrace as an independent risk factor for HIV riskbehavior among female detainees. In a cohort offemale inmates from the same facility in 1999,Rich et al. 25reported the HIV prevalence among African American women to be 5.9, which was2.7 (95% CI 1.7-4.1) times higher than the ratefound in Caucasian women. 25Potentially, the high HIV prevalence among African Americanwomen in the past helped advance the publichealth message of decreased risk behavior amongAfrican American detainees currently in the fa-cility. Similar to previous studies, younger agewas found in this study to be associated with HIVrisk behavior among female inmates. 45 Several limitations in this study warrant dis- cussion. The HIV risk variable used in this studycombines sexual and drug use risks. It is certainlypossibly that female inmates have divergent pat-terns of behavior for these different types of riskbehaviors and that educational factors may playdistinct roles in different types of HIV risk be-havior. Similarly, the HIV risk variable used in this study requires a certain threshold of risk(monthly). Such a threshold forces complex phe-nomena to be viewed in a dichotomous fashion.Although this threshold may help focus on thepeople who are at highest risk, this particularthreshold has not been validated to be the mostuseful predictor of HIV risk behavior and was notdeveloped for this study question. Similarly, al-though not always observed in correctional set-tings, it is generally thought that self-reports ofprevious stigmatizing behavior may lead to un-derreporting. 46,47Other than the literacy test, all data are self-reported. We collected no docu-mentation to substantiate reported level of edu-cational attainment, special education, or IEP sta-tus. The most likely error introduced by thiswould be that participants would overstate theirlevel of educational attainment, which is a so-cially desirable phenomenon. It is improbablethat such overstatement would preferentially oc-cur among participants who also report less HIVrisk behavior. Although highly correlated with several other literacy tests, the test used in this study (REALM)has not been used in other studies of female in-mates. This limits prevalence comparisons withother reports. An additional limitation relates tothe potential generalizability of these findings.This study was conducted in a single facility, andthis cohort exhibits a higher rate of educationalattainment and literacy than previous studies forfemale prison inmates. Although 55% of partici-pants did not have a high school diploma, this isconsiderably less than the 64% of female stateprison inmates in 1997 who did not have a highschool diploma. 2Whereas 29% of participants in this study were classified as having low literacy,fully 60% of the female inmates tested by Moodyet al. 3were classified as having low literacy. The prevalence of low literacy in the current study iscloser to the rates found outside of prisons. Theonly data available to provide a direct compari-son is the National Adult Literacy Survey of 1992,which reported that the lowest level of literacywas found in 23% of community-dwelling wo-men and 43% of female inmates. Despite a higherthan expected level of education and literacy, thiscohort also had a higher rate of participants whohad been in special education in elementaryschool (26%) than what has been reported previ-ously (16%). 16The total portion of participants in this study with a learning disability (32%), how-5887_10-p852-859 11/15/05 11:28 AM Page 857 ever, is comparable to previous reports (33%).16 This likely represents the level of support pro- vided in Rhode Island to maintain students inmainstream learning environments. These con-siderations make it important to retest thisstudy's findings in other settings. The key implication of our findings is that to maximize the impact of correctional educationprograms to reduce HIV risk behavior, it may bebeneficial to focus efforts on those with lower ed-ucational attainment irrespective of literacy skills.Correctional education settings provide the op-portunity to present messages about HIV risk re-duction. Adult education programs, which are of-fered in most correctional education programs,have had a rapid growth of health-oriented cur-ricula. 16,48As the highest rates of HIV risk be- havior were observed among people who haddropped out of school, incarcerated women whohad dropped out of school are the most appro-priate targets for interventions to reduce HIV riskbehavior.

Results: NPP texts were available for all hospitals (lIS of 115). A Spanish-language NPP was available for 25% (29 of 115). All content items were evident in 76% (87 of lIS) of hospitals' NPP texts.

E-mail: rnpo@bu.edu. Copyright \u00a9 2005 2005;43: 558-564) On April 14,2003, all covered healthcare providers were required to begin providing patients with a Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). I The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule spec\u00ad ifies that the NPP must communicate: 1) how a patient's health information may be used and disclosed by healthcare providersr' 2) 6 federally mandated rights regarding patients' health information.\" and 3) providers' responsibilities regard\u00ad ing their patients' health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule specifically delineates 18 elements that must be included in every valid NPP and defines under what conditions it must be provided, to whom, and how. Furthermore, to emphasize the importance of privacy considerations, the NPP must be provided during the first service delivery and on request, be posted in a clear and prominent location, and, for covered providers that maintain a web site, must be posted on the web site. The goal ofHIPAA is to protect patients' privacy, and the NPP is supposed to explain how this works. As such, the NPP is intended to be a document that is easy for patients to understand. Health providers are required to customize the NPP for their practice environment and to use the NPP to inspire conversations between patients and providers regard\u00ad ing privacy rights. Indeed, the Privacy Rule establishes a firm \"duty to provide the notice in plain language so that the average reader can understand the notice.?\" In 1992, the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) sponsored by the US Department of Education profiled the functional English-language literacy skills ofover 26,000 Amer\u00ad ican adults and found that half of US adults have limited or low literacy skills.\" This means that the average US adult is unable to use complex texts to accomplish everyday tasks and lacks the skills needed for full participation in our current society, includ- Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 Copvriqht \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

We hypothe\u00ad sized that NPPs would be available on institutional web sites and would meet the mandated content requirements but would not be readable by patients. Because NPP texts are supposed to be crafted to meet local needs, we hypothesized that lower rates of local literacy would be associated with NPPs that are easier to read and that lower rates of English proficiency would be associated with the NPP texts that are easier to read and pre\u00ad sented in other languages. METHODS Data Sources We surveyed the Internet web sites of 115 American Hospitals to obtain an electronic copy ofeach hospital's NPP. The list of hospitals was preselected from the US News and World Report ranking of America's Best Hospitals 2002; it included the honor roll (top 17 hospitals in that ranking) and a random selection of half of the remaining hospitals on the list.? English NPP texts were obtained from institutional web sites for 98% (113 of 115) of the hospitals and 2% (2 of 115) were sent to the authors by institutional compliance officers on request. In addition, each web site was evaluated for the availability of a NPP in any language other than English. Two markers for language skills were used to reflect local language patterns. The National Adult Literacy Survey of1992 involved in-person literacyassessment ofa nationally representative sample of 24,944 adults in America; the Na\u00ad tional Institute for Literacy web site provided synthetic esti\u00ad mates from these data by congressional district for each hospital.\" This same web site provided the rate, according to the 1990 US Census, respondents reported verbal English fluency by congressional district for each hospital. Low verbal English fluency was indicated by a subject responding that they \"speak English not well or not at all.\" To differen\u00ad tiate these factors in this article, the former is referred to as the local rate of low literacy and the latter as the local rate of low English proficiency. Hospital web sites were repeatedly accessed for NPP text from August 2003 to October 2004. Survey of Required Content The HIPAA Privacy Rule stipulates 18 required ele\u00ad ments that must be included in a valid NPP. We used a checklist to evaluate adherence to statutory guidelines; the 18 required elements are presented in Table 1. Two additional elements examined were statements regarding medical re\u00ad search and any stated costs associated with obtaining an accounting of disclosures and copies of medical records. Each NPP was independently reviewed by 2 authors who \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins recorded each element as present, absent, or present but clearly different from statutory intent. Each instance of dis\u00ad agreement among reviewers was reevaluated in a joint con\u00ad ference for final classification until agreement was reached. Text Abstraction English NPPs, downloaded from hospital web sites, were converted into Microsoft Word 2000 (Microsoft, Red\u00ad mond, WA) documents. We exclusively evaluated the NPP intended for use among a hospital's general patient popula\u00ad tion. NPP texts intended for special populations (eg, em\u00ad ployee health plans) or special circumstances (eg, research\u00ad subject recruitment) were excluded from consideration. Readability Score and Word Length Readability ofNPP text was measured with the (range, 0-16th grade).\" The Flesch\u00ad Kincaid formula is based on the average sentence length (ASL) and the average number of syllables per word (ASW): Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level = (0.39) ASL + 11.8 (ASW) - 15.59.10 Although it has been validated in adults up to a 16th-grade level, the formula is truncated erroneously at a 12th-grade level in Microsoft Word. 9,11 Microsoft Word does report the ASL and ASW without restriction. To cir\u00ad cumvent this programming limitation, we created a program in Microsoft Access to solve the Flesch-Kincaid formula when given ASL and ASW for a given block of text. This data was then truncated at a 16th-grade reading level. Many medical systems include the names of affiliated practice sites in the NPP text. Such lists vary in length and are often presented at the end of the document and/or as part of the pledge statement. To avoid the influence of such lists on Flesch-Kincaid and word length analyses, lists of affiliated practice sites were removed from the document. Readability was evaluated for the document as a whole as well as separately for the pledge, uses and disclosure, and rights sections of each NPP. In some cases, the subsections were not well-defined and reviewers independently made judgments to decide, for example, which text constituted the pledge section. Reviewers compared the reading grade level for each section and when results varied by less than half a grade level, the Flesch-Kincaid score assigned to the docu\u00ad ment would be the average of the 2 findings. When review\u00ad ers' results varied by more than half a grade level, documents were reexamined in a joint conference to resolve disparate findings. Figure 1 provides excerpts of NPP text for 2 differ\u00ad ent required elements at different reading levels. In addition, the word length of each NPP was recorded. Statistical Analysis Analysis of variance was used to test the association of readability and local rates of low literacy. The mean readability of NPP text for hospitals that present foreign-language NPPs versus those that do not was compared using Wilcoxon rank sum Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The most frequent item absent was a statement regarding fundraising, as seen in Table 1. All but 1 hospital included a statement regarding research. Although 93% (107 of 115) included a general statement explaining that there could be charges for copying medical records or obtaining more than I accounting of disclosures in a 12-month period, 9 hospitals specified details for such costs. The most frequent elements that appeared in a format that was clearly different from statutory intent: treatment (12 of 115), healthcare operations (9 of 115), and the right to receive confidential communications (14 of 115), as seen in \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Table 1. For the 14 NPP texts that presented the right to receive confidential communication in a format that was different from the statutory intent, the topic was raised with statements such as \"You can request how and where we communicate with you,\" without explicitly introducing the idea of confidentiality. Readability The NPP text had an overall mean readability that was higher than a 12th-grade reading level (12.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0-12.7).

Factors Thought to Influence Readability The local rate of low literacy (range, 10-50%; mean, 25.4%) was not significantly associated with overall NPP readability (P = 0.16). Hospitals with >4.9% local rate of low English proficiency (range, 0-34%; mean, 4.9%) were not more likely to have foreign-language NPP texts available on their web sites (P = 0.15) and were significantly more likely to present NPP texts that are more difficult to read (12.8 versus 12.0, P = 0.03). DISCUSSION Our findings suggest that most hospitals present NPP texts that include the required content but are written at a level of complexity that far surpasses the average US reading capacity. The readability of NPP text does not appear to be influenced by the local rate of literacy. Contrary to our hypothesis, hospitals serving populations with lower rates of English proficiency were likely to present NPP texts that were more difficult to read and were not more likely to present NPP texts in other languages. The strengths of this study that lend weight to our conclusions are the broad sample of top quality US hospitals and the use of standardized instruments for data abstraction. Nonetheless, several limitations should be kept in mind. Data were obtained exclusively from web sites. Although it is likely that the NPP texts presented on institutional web sites accurately reflect local practice, additional materials were not examined. In addition, the HIPAA compliance of hospitals included in this survey may not reflect typical practice in US hospitals. It is possible that hospitals on the US News and World Report list of Best Hospitals in America invest more resources in HIPAA compliance and present NPP texts that are different than other hospitals. It is unclear if this might introduce a bias to over- or underestimate the central findings of this analysis. We chose the Flesch-Kincaid scale for our main anal\u00ad ysis primarily because of its convenience. Of the dozens of readability scales, the Flesch-Kincaid scale is the most widely available for computerized use, because it is embedded in Microsoft Word. Other advantages include its wide use in studies of readability, excellent repeatability, and high corre\u00ad lation with other established readability scales (r = 0.87\u00ad 0.90).10.11 Unlike previous research using Microsoft Word, which artificially truncates readability at the 12th-grade level, this study was conducted with scores extending to the 16th grade, reflecting the full range of the scale.P The Flesch-Kincaid formula is based on word and sentence length. The formula cannot account for the com\u00ad plexity introduced by short but unfamiliar medical or legal terms.P Similarly, such an approach does not evaluate the overall reading difficulty introduced by factors such font size, 18 layout, and document length.14 -All of these limitations tend to result in underestimation of the actual reading skill required to understand NPP texts. In addition to the frequent use of medical jargon (eg, cadaveric) and legal patois (eg, pursuant to), the NPP texts are encumbered by an additional linguistic barrier that stems from the HIPAA itself. 19 The Privacy Rule attributes specific and idiosyncratic meaning to common words and phrases. A set of specially defined terms, which are the conceptual and linguistic building blocks ofthe Privacy Rule, is ubiquitous in NPP texts. For example, the words \"protected health infor\u00ad mation,\" \"organized healthcare arrangement,\" and \"hybrid covered entity\" have unique meaning in the context of HIPAA but little meaning to average readers ofan NPP. This feature is further complicated by the common use of acro\u00ad nyms such as PHI to denote such defined terms. Almost half of American adults read at or below the 8th-grade level.2o Although most texts had over a 12th\u00ad \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. 562 Medical Care Volume 43, Number 6, June 2005 Notices of Privacy Practices grade reading level, several institutions such as Abbot Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis and the Children's Hospital and Medical Center of Seattle present NPP text written at an 8th-grade reading level and can provide initial guidance for interested institutions. In addition, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), in consultation with the Office for Civil Rights, and other offices and agencies within the US Department of Health & Human Services have presented extensive guidance on the development of plain English NPP texts. 21 Beyond writing NPP texts to convey key concepts simply and directly, HRSA recommends pretesting draft NPP lan\u00ad guage with members of the target audience and provides a protocol with which this can be done.\" Such simplification is likely to benefit a broad range of patients because plain language improves comprehension and retention for all readers.14.22-2s The Office of Civil Rights has projected that approximately 613 million NPP texts will be distributed annually.\" Marginal readers typically read simple texts at approximately 160 words per minute.\" Because the average text was 2922 words long, it would take more than 18 minutes for marginal readers to read an NPP. Most patients will not sustain such an effort and will simply not read the document, as is the case with informed consent forms.\" Alternative methods for communicating the concepts ad\u00ad vanced by the Privacy Rule such as multimedia systems are also likely to be of substantial benefit as has been shown in research relating to informed consent and risk communi\u00ad cation. 28 -32 It is unlikely that institutions will broadly incorporate plain English texts such as the examples presented in Figure I unless regulators confirm that such texts meet the content requirements. However, if regulators presented a range of plain English template text options that could be tailored for local use, marked improvement in readability would result. In lieu of presenting prepared text, establishment of a specific grade-level readability standard as a benchmark for readabil\u00ad ity paired with endorsing the HRSA recommendation to pretest NPP text with the target audience could guide im\u00ad provement toward fulfilling the plain language requirement. In reviewing modifications made to the Privacy Rule in response to public comment, the Office of Civil Rights made clear that \"nothing in the final modifications relieve a covered entity of its duty to provide the entire notice in plain language so the average reader can understand it.,,4 However, the hospitals in this survey present NPP texts that are not written in plain language suitable for an average reader. Violation of the plain language requirement of the HIPAA Privacy Rule is prevalent. This is largely the result of insufficient federal guidance. Explicit instructions are needed to help privacy lawyers draft NPP texts that are both comprehensive and comprehensible. \u00a9 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins REFERENCES I.

Nielsen-Bohlman, PhD,4Rima R. Rudd, ScD5 1Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA;2Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA;3Department of Health Policy and Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA;4Board on Neuroscience and Behavioral Health, Institute of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA;5Department of Society, Human Development, and Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review U.S. studies examining the prevalence of limited health literacy and to synthesize these findings by evaluating demographic associations in pooled analyses. DESIGN: We searched the literature for the period 1963 through Janu- ary 2004 and identified 2,132 references related to a set of specified searchterms. Of the 134 articles and published abstracts retrieved, 85 met in- clusion criteria, which were 1) conducted in the United States with /C2125 adults, 2) addressed a hypothesis related to health care, 3) identified ameasurement instrument, and 4) presented primary data. The authorsextracted data to compare studies by population, methods, and results. MAIN RESULTS: The 85 studies reviewed include data on 31,129 subjects, and report a prevalence of low health literacy between 0% and 68%. Pooled analyses of these data reveal that the weighted prevalenceof low health literacy was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22% to29%) and of literacy was 20% (95% CI, 16% to 23%). Most studies used either the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Med- icine (REALM) or versions of the Test of Functional Health Literacy inAdults (TOFHLA). The prevalence of low health literacy was not asso- ciated with gender ( P =.38) or measurement instrument ( P=.23) but was associated with level of education ethnicity ( P=.0003), and age ( P=.004). CONCLUSIONS: pooled analysis of published reports on health lit- eracy cannot provide a nationally representative prevalence estimate. This systematic review exhibits that limited health literacy, as depicted in the medical literature, is prevalent and is consistently associatedwith education, ethnicity, and age. It is essential to simplify healthservices and improve health education. Such changes have the poten- tial to improve the health of Americans and address the health dispar- ities that exist today. KEY WORDS: prevalence; functional health literacy; literacy.DOI: 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.40245.x J GEN INTERN MED 2005; 20:175-184. Health literacy is increasingly described as the currency for improving the quality of health and health care in America.1-3InHealth Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion , the Institute of Medicine (IOM) described the growing body of literature documenting the magnitude and associations of lim-ited literacy, and made recommendations for promoting ahealth-literate society. 4This report adopted the definitionused in Healthy People 2010, which defined health literacy as ''the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain,process, and understand basic health information and servic- es needed to make appropriate health decisions.'' 3Multiple studies indicate that people with limited health literacy haveworse health status and higher rates of hospitalization. 4-6 Medical and public health literature also highlight the highreading demands made on people in need of important healthinformation. Over 300 published articles document that most health materials are beyond the comprehension skills of most Americans. 6 The National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), a nationally representative household survey conducted in 1992, profiled the functional English language literacy skills of over 26,000American adults and found that half of U.S. adults have lim-ited or low literacy skills. 7This means that American adults with average literacy skills have difficulty using complex texts to accomplish everyday tasks and lack the skills needed for fullparticipation in our current society. 8The prevalence of limited health literacy in medical settings, however, has not been sys- tematically reviewed. In its report, the IOM committee presents a sample of published studies on the prevalence and demographic associ- ations of low health literacy. The current article extends thebackground review conducted for the IOM report to a system- atic review of the medical literature. This article summarizes the methods and findings of published studies on the preva-lence of limited health literacy in health care contexts andsynthesizes these findings by evaluating demographic associ- ations in pooled analyses. Understanding this evidence will help practitioners, researchers, and funding institutions for-mulate solutions to the pressing issues that emerge from a mismatch between system demands and the average literacy skills of health care consumers. METHODS Research Questions The objectives of this review are to examine 1) the prevalence of low and marginal health literacy in the medical literature; 2) the methods used in studies evaluating the prevalence of lim- ited health literacy in medical care; and 3) the demographicfactors associated with low health literacy.

Databases searched were MEDLINE Behavior Abstracts (1973-2004), and Sociological Abstracts (1974-2004). After developing the search parameters, identifying databases to target, and pur-suing references in consultation with the coauthors andthrough review of the annotated bibliographies of the Nation- al Center for Adult Learning and Literacy, 4,9the lead author conducted the search, retrieval, and selection process. Inclusion Criteria References were included if the study was conducted in theUnited States, related to health care or a health services in- quiry, involved 25 or more adults, and provided evidence of direct testing of subject literacy. Study Selection After screening 2,132 references, 134 articles and publishedabstracts were retrieved and 85 were included in this review.Those excluded did not present primary data, were not con- ducted in the United States, involved fewer than 25 adult sub- jects, were not part of a health services inquiry or conducted ina medical context, or did not provide literacy prevalence. Data Abstraction All studies were evaluated for participation rate, study design, subject selection criteria, setting and dates, literacy measure used, vision testing, cognitive testing, demographic character-istics (age, gender, ethnicity, highest level of education, andincome), and prevalence of low literacy and marginal literacy. Some researchers used multiple instruments to evaluate liter- acy, alternative versions of these instruments, or alteredinstruments. For example, data extracted from studies using the full Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), the abbreviated TOFHLA, and the shortened TOFHLA were allincluded. Statistical Analysis Low health literacy was defined as the rate of subjects scoring at an inadequate level on versions of TOFHLA or at the sixth grade level and below on other measures. Marginal literacywas defined as the rate of subjects scoring at the marginal levelon versions of TOFHLA or at the seventh to eighth grade levels on other measures. Weighted analyses of variance were used to compare the mean rates of low literacy according to quartiles ofdemographic characteristics: age, gender, education, and eth- nicity. The percentage of subjects who had not completed high school or received a general education degree (GED) was usedas the indicator of education. The percentage of female sub- jects was used to represent gender. Due to variation in the presentation of data on ethnicity, the percentage of black sub-jects was used as the indicator of ethnicity. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the rate of low literacy between studies conducted with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy inMedicine (REALM) versus versions of the TOFHLA, between thelanguages of test administration (Spanish vs English), between the total pooled estimate versus studies with greater than 300 subjects, and between the total pooled estimate versus studiesnot conducted with convenience samples. Prevalence data de- rived from different iterations of the REALM and TOFHLA were combined to make the comparison by testing instrument.Pooled analyses were conducted with weighted means, that is, each study influenced analyses in proportion to the size of the population in that study. All significance tests were two-tailed. Analyses were conducted with Stata software, version 8(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). RESULTS The 85 studies included data on 31,129 subjects. Pooled anal- yses of these data reveal that over one quarter of subjects (26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22% to 29%; range, 0 to68), had low health literacy. An additional fifth of subjects (weighted mean of 20%; 95% CI, 16% to 23%; range, 11 to 65) had marginal health literacy. Systematic review of the published data on health literacy does not provide a nationally representative sample. Over one third of subjects did not complete high school (weighted mean of 37%; 95% CI, 32 to 41) and about half of all subjects wereblack (weighted mean of 55%; 95% CI, 48 to 62). Table 1 presents the studies included in this review; 10-94an appendix (available online at http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/products/journals/suppmat/jgi/jgi40245/jgi40245.htm) in- cludes the literacy rates and demographic characteristics for each of the studies. The first section of Table 1 presents stud-ies conducted with the REALM, the second section presents studies conducted with versions of the TOFHLA, and the third section presents studies conducted with all other measures. Analysis of Study Design and Methods More than three quarters of the studies (79%; 67/85) were from convenience samples of subjects. Exclusion of studies conducted with convenience samples did not significantly alterthe mean rate of low health literacy (24%; 95% CI, 16% to 33%; range, 9 to 48) in comparison with the total pooled estimate (P =.90). The sample size ranged from 26 to 3,260, with an av- erage of 366 subjects and a standard deviation of 60. Elimi- nation of small studies ( No300) did not significantly alter the mean rate of low health literacy (25%; 95% CI, 19% to 30%;range, 9 to 48) in comparison with the total pooled estimate(P =.48). Participation rate could be calculated from published information in half the studies (54%; 46/85) and had a weight- ed mean of 63% (range, 48% to 100%). Many studies specifically excluded subjects who did not speak English (18%; 15/85),12,17,19,30,70read English (8%; 7/85),34,35,45,85-97,92or have English 4/85)48,61,69,81or first language (4%; 3/85).37,52,84Span- ish-speaking subjects were tested in Spanish in 11% of studies (9/85).5,53,55,59,63-67 Visual function was mentioned as a specific criterion in 20% of studies (17/85).13,21,37,41,48,52,53,61-63,66,76,85-87,89,92 While 7 studies mention cognitive disorders as an exclusion criterion,33,34,41,53,69,84,92only 2 specified details for this176 JGIM Paasche-Orlow et al., Prevalence of Limited LiteracyTable 1.

Of the 14 literacy skills assessment instruments used by studies in this review, 9 were used inmore than 1 study and are outlined in Table 2. 95-102Most of these instruments are validated and have been used for the assessment of literacy skills in multiple contexts. Several in-struments, developed for specific health contexts, are not yetwell validated and have limited clinical data. Several instruments, such as the Adult Basic Learning Examination (ABLE), evaluate comprehension of written text(prose literacy), capacity to use and understand tables and forms (document literacy), and arithmetic skills (numeracy). However, studies conducted with instruments that includemore than 1 domain of literacy typically presented only a sin- gle summary measure. Five of the instruments are exclusively tests of word pronunciation, which is a component of proseliteracy. While some of the instruments include subtests that focus on various domains of literacy, they were commonly em- ployed in a restricted form. For example, pronunciation, butnot spelling or arithmetic, was evaluated in most studies con-ducted with the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R). 94 The majority of tests must be completed in English. Only 3 tests, the TOFHLA, the Instrumento Para Diagnostical Le- cturas/Instrument for Diagnosis of Reading (IDL), and the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE), provide the option forSpanish language testing. No other languages are accommo- dated by any of the instruments in this study. Fully 68% (58/ 85) of the studies used either the REALM or versions of theTOFHLA. Studies conducted with the REALM had similar ratesof low literacy (22%; 95% CI, 17 to 27) as studies conducted with the TOFHLA (28%; 95% CI, 22 to 34). Demographic Associations The most common demographic features reported to be associ-ated with health literacy were education level, age, 16,36,43,48,50- 53,63,65,66,79-81ethnicity,11,12,16,17,30,36,40,43,51,53,57,63,72,78,83,84 geographic location, and income.11,51,53,56,57,83Studies report- ing multivariate regression used a variety of different covariates.Most frequently, education and ethnicity remained significant in regression analyses. 36,43,51,53 The rate of high school completion was significantly as- sociated with the rate of low literacy ( P=.02). For example, studies in the top quartile of high school graduation rate had the lowest prevalence of low literacy (10.7; 95% CI, 8.5 to 13.0). The rate of black subjects was significantly associated with the rate of low literacy ( P=.0003). For example, studies with the highest quartile of black subjects had the highest prevalence of low literacy (31.3; 95% CI, 26.8 to 35.7). The average weighted age was 42.9 with a standard devi- ation of 1.49 years. Subject age was significantly asso- ciated with the rate of low literacy ( P=.004). For example, studies in the lowest quartile of average age had the lowest prevalence of low literacy (15.9; 95% CI, 7.7 to 24.1). Studies with an average age over 50 years old (the top 2 quartilestogether) had a prevalence of low literacy of 37.9 (95% CI, 31.6to 44.2). Overall, more women participated than men (65%; 95% CI, 59 to 70). The percentage of female subjects was not asso-ciated with the rate of low literacy ( P =.38). Data for Spanish language testing were separately report- ed for 5% of subjects (1,504/31,129). Subjects tested in Span-ish had a higher rate of low literacy than those tested in English (44%, 95% CI, 26% to to 29%; P =.002). The combined weighted mean of low and mar- ginal literacy for subjects tested in Spanish in the studies pre-Table 1. Part 3.

Comment One in four subjects in the studies presented in this review hadlow health literacy and nearly half had low or marginal health literacy. The instruments used to measure literacy, popula- tions sampled, and study methods varied across studies. De-spite these methodological differences, the level of health literacy was consistently associated with level of education, ethnicity, and age. The level of health literacy was not associ-ated with gender, or with data collection instrument (REALM or TOFHLA). The strengths of this study that lend weight to our con- clusions are the large sample size and the use of validated lit-eracy assessment instruments in nearly all studies. However, this systematic review has several limitations. This article presents a systematic review of the published literature onthe prevalence of limited health literacy. While a systematic review of the medical literature on literacy does not provide a nationally representative prevalence estimate, the NALS pro-vides an opportunity to compare the results of this article to a nationally representative household survey of general literacy skills. The NALS assessment exhibited that 21% to 23% ofAmerican adults scored in the lowest of 5 skill levels and anadditional 25% to 28% scored 1 level better. 7People who score at level 1 or 2 of the NALS assessment lack the skills needed for full participation in our current society.8Direct correlation be- tween the NALS scale and the scales used by the various in- struments collected in this review is not possible. Yet, the similarities between the NALS findings and the prevalence es-timates presented in this systematic review underscore the importance of basic literacy skills in health literacy and lend credence to the central findings of this article. Nevertheless,several important features of the literature on health literacy promote the possibility that the point estimates presented overestimate the true prevalence of limited health literacy.Publication bias may have limited the presentation of dataon populations without high rates of limited health literacy. Similarly, it is likely that investigators interested in literacy would conduct such research in settings that have high ratesof limited health literacy. In this review, it is apparent that investigators often conduct research in medical settings that cater to subjects with a low level of socioeconomicstatus. This may partially account for the overrepresentation of black subjects. Fully 55% of the subjects in the pooled anal- ysis were black, 37% had not graduated high school, andthe average age was 42.9 /C61.49. These parameters have to be kept in mind in order to interpret the main findings of this article. However, while subjects with low health literacy may be thought to be overrepresented in cited reports, it is notable that exclusion of studies conducted with subjects recruited by convenience sampling did not alter the rate of low health lit-eracy presented. Further, while low income was associated with low literacy in some studies, income data were frequently not reported and in other studies this relationship was not ex-hibited. In addition, we were unable to include a summary measure of income in this analysis because of the multiple techniques used to report income data among the reviewedstudies. It is also important to note that summary conclusionsfor demographic associations reported in this study are unad- justed. There may be systematic confounding among the de-mographic characteristics summarized in this article or withother unmeasured features. However, the association between health literacy and ethnicity found in this systematic review suggests the importance of incorporating health literacy im-provements in efforts related to addressing health dispari- ties. 103 There are at least 4 important reasons that this literature review may actually present a conservative assessment of the prevalence of limited health literacy. First, studies reviewed for this analysis focused almost exclusively on aspects of readingand numeracy. However, all domains of literacy\u2014listening,speaking, writing, reading, and numeracy\u2014are relevant to health literacy. The IOM report supports a broad concept of health literacy which includes not only the 5 skills above butcultural and conceptual knowledge of health as well. 4Oral lit- eracy skills of listening and speaking are essential to patient- provider interactions, public health communication, and un-derstanding direct to consumer marketing. 4,104,105Future research on measuring health literacy should enhance our ability to capture these other important components of healthliteracy. Second, the current analysis was based on a limited pool of data for languages other than English. As people commonlymaneuver through the health care system with family andfriends, another important aspect of the prevalence of low health literacy relates to concepts such as linguistically iso- lated households and social support. 106,107Approximately 47 million individuals in the United States (18% of the total pop- ulation) speak a language other than English at home. This rate has increased between 1990 and 2000.106Studies ex- cluding subjects who are not native English speakers may ex- clude this portion of the American population, and are likely to underestimate the prevalence of low health literacy. Further-more, the challenge of evaluating health literacy in languagesthat have direct phoneme-grapheme correspondence, such as Spanish and Haitian-Creole, may be difficult to surmount as the quickest and most commonly used instruments are basedon word pronunciation tests. 108 Third, most studies reviewed did not evaluate vision or cognition. Vision and cognitive capacity contribute to healthliteracy, and accurate assessment with the instruments used in these studies assumes normal or corrected vision and nor- mal cognition. Vision and cognition must be tested, especiallyin populations such as the elderly where such deficits are known to be common and underreported. 109The failure to evaluate cognitive capacity likely yielded an underestimate oflow health literacy in studies with older populations. Wordpronunciation, used in many of the studies included in this review, is commonly retained in the face of significant demen- tia and has even been used as a marker for premorbid intel-ligence in demented cohorts. 110 Fourth, the studies may have been influenced by partic- ipation bias. People with limited literacy may participate lessfrequently in research. 51,111,112Such a bias is clearly a con- cern as half of the studies did not disclose information to cal- culate the participation rate and the weighted participationrate for the remaining studies was 63% (range, 48% to 100%). In 2003, the U.S. Department of Education initiated the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), which containsexpanded health-related components. 113This second nationalJGIM 181 Paasche-Orlow et al., Prevalence of Limited Literacyliteracy assessment of American adults will provide data on the percentage of persons with inadequate or marginal literacyskills who can perform specific health literacy tasks related toclinical, prevention, and navigation activities. The NAAL fo- cuses on adults' ability to use prose, documents, and numbers to accomplish specific tasks and will be used to gauge progressin meeting the Healthy People 2010 objective related to im- proving health literacy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) recently performed an evidenced-based review of health liter- acy interventions and the influence of literacy on health out- comes and disparities. However, the AHRQ did not address thequestion of prevalence. 114The current systematic review sum- marizing the prevalence of health literacy skills in American adults as depicted by reports in the medical literature will complement the AHRQ study. However, the focus on patients'literacy skills in these reviews reflects the state of the current literature, and should not distract attention from the over- whelming complexity of the health care system. The discourseof health literacy should address both the high literacy de- mands of complex systems and the skills required by individ- uals to navigate systems of care to self-manage chronicconditions and promote their health. Conclusions A pooled analysis of published reports on health literacy can-not provide a nationally representative prevalence estimate.This systematic review exhibits that limited health literacy, as depicted in the medical literature, is prevalent and is consist- ently associated with education, ethnicity, and age. It is es-sential to simplify health services and improve health education. Such changes have the potential to improve the health of Americans and address the health disparities thatexist today.

Krishnan Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; and Departments of Medicine, Emergency Medicine, and Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland Rationale: Although inadequate health literacy has been associated with lower asthma medication knowledge and worse metered-doseinhaler (MDI) technique, the relationship between health literacyand the capacity to learn asthma self-management skills is unknown.Objectives: In this prospective cohort study of adults hospitalized for severe asthma exacerbations at two inner-city hospitals, weexamined the relationship between inadequate health literacy anddifficulties learning and retaining instructions about discharge med-ications and appropriate MDI technique.Methods: At hospital discharge, participants received one-on-one, 30-min, guideline-based, written and oral instruction about theirasthma discharge regimen as well as appropriate MDI technique.Measurements and Main Results: Seventy-three patients were en- rolled. Inadequate health literacy was identified in 16 (22%) partici-pants. Before instruction, inadequate health literacy was associatedwith lower asthma medication knowledge (5.2/10 vs. 7.2/10, p /H11021 vs. 3.9/6, p /H110050.03). How- ever, inadequate health literacy was not associated with difficultylearning (p /H110050.33) or retaining (p /H110050.35) instructions about the discharge regimen. Similarly, inadequate health literacy was notassociated with difficulty learning (p /H110050.26) or retaining (p /H110050.97) appropriate MDI technique. Results were similar in multivariablemodels adjusted for demographic characteristics and asthma sever-ity indicators.Conclusions: These findings suggest that inadequate health literacy is a surmountable barrier to learning and remembering key asthmaself-management skills. Keywords: asthma; education; functional health literacy Health literacy is \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health informa-tion and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\"(1-4) and is most often measured by reading comprehension ofhealth-related information (5, 6). Multiple studies indicate thatinadequate health literacy is associated with worse health statusand higher rates of hospitalization across a number of patientpopulations (4, 7, 8), including patients with diabetes mellitus,patients with HIV infection, and the elderly (9-12). However,there are relatively few data about the effects of inadequatehealth literacy in patients with asthma, a common chronic respi-ratory disorder affecting 5 to 10% of the U.S. population (13).

E-mail: mpo@bu.edu This article has an online supplement, which is accessible from this issue's table of contents at www.atsjournals.org Am J Respir Crit Care Med Vol 172. pp 980-986, 2005 Originally Published in Press as DOI: 10.1164/rccm.200409-1291OC on August 4, 2005Internet address: www.atsjournals.orgIn cross-sectional studies, inadequate health literacy has been linked to lower asthma-related knowledge (14, 15) and improperuse of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) (14). Although nationalasthma guidelines recommend patient education to improvepatient-physician partnerships for care (16), no studies haveevaluated the extent to which inadequate health literacy serves asa barrier for patients to learn and retain asthma self-managementskills (17). The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between inadequate health literacy and difculties learning andretaining instructions about discharge medications and appro-priate MDI technique. We recruited an inner-city predominatelyAfrican-American patient population hospitalized for asthmaexacerbations, a group at high risk for low health literacy anda two- to threefold risk of death from asthma exacerbations(18-20). We hypothesized that inadequate health literacy is asso-ciated with lower knowledge of asthma medications, improperuse of MDI technique, as well as difculty learning and retaininginstructions about discharge medications and proper MDI tech- nique. These hypotheses represent secondary goals of a studyalso intended to examine adherence to corticosteroid therapyafter hospital discharge (21). Some results of the current studyhave been previously reported in the form of an abstract (22). METHODS Study Design This was a prospective cohort study conducted from April 2001 through October 2002. Adults (age, /H1109118 yr) admitted with a physician diagnosis of asthma exacerbation to two inner-city academic medical centers werescreened for eligibility. Patients with other chronic lung diseases, thosewith a contraindication to corticosteroids, patients (or physicians) whodeclined consent, and investigators' patients were excluded. The studywas approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Study Procedures At hospital discharge (discharge study visit), eligible subjects wereapproached about participating in this study. Patients who providedwritten, informed consent were enrolled. Participants completed aninterviewer-administered survey about sociodemographics (age, sex,ethnicity, education, income), smoking history (never, ever, current),and asthma-related health care use (emergency department or hospital-ization) in the past year. On the basis of a review of medical recordsand interview responses, subjects were classied as having a history ofnear-fatal asthma exacerbation if they had ever been intubated due toasthma (yes vs. no). Health literacy was measured with the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults and classied as having inadequate healthliteracy (yes [score /H1108816/36] vs. no [score /H1102216/36]), based on published recommendations (23, 24). The Short Test of Functional Health Liter-acy in Adults is a test of reading comprehension that takes 5 to 7 minto administer. The test has a set of sentences from medical scenarios with key words missing. Subjects select words to complete the sentencesfrom a list provided. There are 36 items and each correct response isawarded 1 point (range of possible scores, 0-36). The test has high internalconsistency (Cronbach's /H9251/H11005 0.97) and is well correlated with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (Spearman correlation, 0.81)Paasche-Orlow, Riekert, Bilderback, et al.: Asthma Education and Literacy 981 and the full Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (Spearman correlation, 0.91) (25). In addition, we also assessed patients' understanding of asthma medications. There were no previously validated measures to assesspatients' understanding of asthma medications (inhaled corticosteroids,oral corticosteroids, and short-acting bronchodilators). Therefore, wedeveloped 10 items based on existing asthma knowledge scales, profes-sional opinion, and the desire for each item to be directly related to medication use. Participants were given 1 point for each correctlyanswered item. Based on a total possible score of 10, we calculated amean asthma medication knowledge score (total score/10). Internalconsistency reliability was adequate (Cronbach /H9251/H11005 0.62) and compara- ble to another published asthma knowledge scale (26). Participants were asked to demonstrate use of an MDI. Participants' MDI technique was assessed on the basis of the following six criteria(16, 27-30): ( 1) shaking the MDI, ( 2) exhaling before actuation, ( 3) closing lips tightly around the mouthpiece, ( 4) pressing down once on the canister, ( 5) taking a full/deep breath without triggering the auditory \"whistle\" indicator of the spacer, and ( 6) holding breath for at least 5 s. One point was given for each step for a total possible score of 6 as follows:0 (unable to perform any step) to 6 (perfect technique; Figure 1). Theasthma discharge regimen was standardized to include both oral cortico-steroids (prednisone: 20 mg/tablet, 2 tablets each morning for corticosteroids (fluticasone (albuterol MDI: 2 puffs every 4 h asneeded). These medications and a spacer for use with MDIs wereprovided for free to study participants. Participants took part in a one-on-one, 30-min-long, guideline-based, written and oral asthma-educationsession about this discharge regimen. This session included educationabout appropriate MDI technique; the research assistant provided bothverbal instructions and demonstrated proper technique to study partici-pants. After the education intervention and before discharge, partici-pants were asked to state the following: ( 1) the name of each medica- tion, ( 2) the number of tablets or actuations to be taken each time, (3) the number of times per day the medication should be taken, and (4) the prescribed duration of medication use. Teaching was repeated until participants could successfully demonstrate mastery of the asthmadischarge regimen (dened as correctly describing items 1-4 for allthree of the medicines) and MDI technique (30). The number of roundsof teaching necessary to achieve mastery of the asthma discharge regi-men and MDI technique was recorded. Participants returned for a 2-wk follow-up visit. At the follow-up visit, participant's MDI technique and knowledge of the asthma dis-charge regimen were reevaluated. In addition, at follow-up, asthmasymptom control was assessed using the six symptom items in theAsthma Control Questionnaire (31). The total possible asthma symp-tom control was (0, well controlled, to 6, extremely poorly controlled). In a subset of participants (n /H1100546) enrolled in the current study, we also electronically measured patients' use of inhaled and oral corticoste-roids after hospital discharge. Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids was Figure 1. Proportion (%) of patients correctly performing each compo- nent of metered-dose inhaler (MDI) technique according to health literacy: white bars /H11005yes; black bars /H11005no.1: shaking the inhaler (p /H110050.91); 2: exhaling before actuation (p /H110050.02); 3: closing lips around mouthpiece (p /H110050.97); 4: pressing down once (p/H110050.38); 5: taking a full/deep breath without triggering \"whistle\" (p/H110050.19); /H110050.18).assessed using the CT (Meditrac, Inc., Hudson, MA), which records the number of actuations of the fluticasone MDI each day (32, 33). Adher-ence to oral corticosteroids was assessed using the MEMS TrackCap(AARDEX Ltd., Union City, CA), which records the number of predni-sone bottle openings each day (34-36). Adherence was dened aspercentage of prescribed use after hospital discharge (use/prescribeduse/H11003100%) and was calculated for both inhaled and oral corticoste- roids. Poor adherence to corticosteroid therapy was dened a priori as electronically measured adherence to inhaled corticosteroids of lessthan 50% during the 2-wk period after hospital discharge or electroni-cally measured adherence to oral corticosteroid therapy of less than50% from hospital discharge through Day 7 (oral corticosteroids wereprescribed for the rs t 7 d after discharge). The data collection and educational intervention were conducted by a trained research assistant using standardized text and questionnaires.To minimize interviewer bias, the health literacy status of participants wasnot available to the interviewer at the follow-up visit. Also, electronicadherence data were collected after the interviewer-administered survey.Participants were informed that medication use was assessed, but werenot told about precise monitoring abilities (i.e., that daily medicationuse was electronically measured). Thus, at the discharge study visit, data regarding sociodemographics, asthma care, smoking history, morbidity, health literacy, asthma medi-cation knowledge, and MDI technique were collected before any educa- tional intervention. After the rst and subsequent rounds of education,knowledge of the asthma discharge regimen and MDI technique wereassessed. The education was repeated until participants could demon-strate mastery of the asthma discharge regimen and MDI technique.At the follow-up visit, knowledge of the asthma discharge regimen andMDI technique were tested again, adherence data for corticosteroidtherapy were collected, and asthma symptom control was assessed. Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics used means, medians, and proportions. Wilcoxonrank sum, matched pairs signed rank, or /H9273 2tests were used in bivariate analyses. Logistic regression models were used to determine if inade-quate health literacy was an independent predictor of the followingoutcomes: better asthma medication knowledge (yes [ /H11091mean score] vs. no), better MDI technique (yes [ /H11091mean score] vs. no), mastery of the discharge regimen after one round (yes vs. no), poor adherence tocorticosteroid therapy (adherence /H1102150%: yes vs. no) (21), and better asthma symptom control (yes [ /H11091mean score] vs. no). To determine if knowledge about medications mediated the relationship betweeninadequate health literacy and inferior self-management practices, weconstructed additional models in which we included \"better asthmamedication knowledge\" as a covariate in models MDItechnique\" and \"poor adherence to corticosteroid therapy.\" Each regression model included the identical set of demographic and asthma severity indicators as independent variables: inadequatehealth literacy (yes vs. no; primary predictor of interest), age (quartiles),sex, ethnicity (African American vs. white), education level (high schoolgraduate or equivalent degree; yes vs. no), income (annual combinedhousehold income /H11088$19,999: yes [ /H11088mean score] vs. no), history of near- fatal asthma (yes vs. no), asthma hospitalization in the prior 12 mo (yesvs. no), having a physician for asthma care (yes vs. no), and prior emergency department visits for asthma in the past 12 mo (yes vs. no).Results were similar when we analyzed outcomes as continuous or asbinary variables; we presented the latter results to facilitate interpreta-tion. To avoid overtting the regression models, we elected to use abackward stepwise procedure in the multivariable logistic regressionmodels to identify the most influential predictors for each of the out-comes (p /H110210.2 for removal) (37). A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 dened statistical signicance. Computations were performed usingSTATA, version 7.0. (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Additional de-tails regarding the methods are available in the online supplement. RESULTS Of 136 patients screened for eligibility, 36 met the following exclu- sion criteria: history of another chronic lung disease (n /H1100520), discharged to location other than home (n /H110058), clinic patient of an investigator (n /H110052), and contraindication to corticosteroids982 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE VOL 172 2005 (n/H110056). Of 100 eligible patients, 8 patients were excluded be- cause the physician declined consent and 19 were excluded be-cause the patient declined consent. Seventy-three patients (73% of eligible) were enrolled. Partici- pants' mean age was 41 yr and they were mostly African American,female, unmarried, and employed. There was substantial evi-dence of previous asthma morbidity among participants, withmore than three-quarters reporting at least one other emergencydepartment visit for an asthma exacerbation in the previous12 mo and nearly half with a history of near-fatal asthma. Fifty-six participants (77% of enrolled) returned for the 2-wk follow-up visit. Those not returning for the 2-wk visit were younger,had lower asthma medication knowledge scores, and tended to beAfrican American. However, health literacy was similar, whetheror not patients returned for the follow-up visit (Table 1). Health Literacy At the discharge study visit, 16 (22%) participants had inade-quate health literacy. Sociodemographic characteristics (includ-ing age) were similar in patients with and without inadequatehealth literacy (Table 2). However, participants with inadequatehealth literacy were signicantly more likely to have been hospi-talized for asthma in the past 12 mo (81 vs. 52%, p /H110050.04) and there was a trend toward a higher rate of near-fatal asthma inpatients with inadequate health literacy (63 vs. 37%, p /H110050.07). Asthma Medication Knowledge Questionnaire At the discharge study visit, the mean asthma medication knowl- edge score was 6.8 (of 10, SD /H110052.1; Table 3). Participants with inadequate literacy had lower Asthma Medication Knowledgescores (odds ratio [OR] for better asthma condence interval [CI], 0.03-0.42; p /H110050.001; Table 4). Participants with inadequate health literacy were lesslikely to correctly answer every question, with signicant differ-ences noted for 5 of 10 items. In a multivariate logistic model, inadequate health literacy was the only signicant independentpredictor of asthma medication knowledge (OR for better asthmamedication knowledge score, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.38; p /H110050.002).

Wilcoxon rank sum test or /H92732test.MDI Technique The mean MDI technique score at the discharge study visit was 3.8 (of 6, SD /H110051.4). Failure to exhale before actuation of the MDI was the most frequently missed step. Pressing once on thecanister at the time of actuation was the step that was mostfrequently done correctly. At the discharge study visit, subjectswith inadequate health literacy were less likely to have superiorMDI technique (OR for better MDI technique, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.87; p /H110050.03). Having a history of near-fatal asthma was also associated with worse MDI technique at discharge studyvisit (OR for better MDI technique, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; p /H11021 0.01; Table 4). In a multivariate model, inadequate health literacywas the only signicant independent predictor of MDI technique(OR MDI technique, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-1.00; p /H11005 0.05). When asthma medication knowledge was included as acovariate, inadequate health literacy was no longer a signicantpredictor of MDI technique (OR for better MDI technique,0.53; 95% CI, 0.14-2.01), and asthma medication knowledgebecame the sole independent predictor of MDI technique (ORfor better MDI technique, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.08-2.03). After a single round of education, 59% (10/16) of subjects with inadequate health literacy and 73% (41/57) of subjects with higherhealth literacy exhibited mastery of MDI technique (p /H110050.26). Overall, 21% (15) of subjects required one additional round ofeducation, 10% (7) required two additional rounds of education,and no subject needed more than two additional rounds of educa-tion to exhibit mastery of MDI technique. Inadequate healthliteracy was not associated with the number of rounds of educa-tion needed to exhibit master of MDI technique (p /H110050.79). At the follow-up visit, the overall mean MDI technique score was 4.8 (SE /H110050.14), which was signicantly improved from the discharge study visit measurement (change /H110051.1 [SE /H110050.21], p/H110210.001). There was a greater increase in the proportion of subjects achieving better MDI technique in patients with inade-quate health literacy (p /H110050.02; Figure 2), suggesting that this subgroup beneted most from the tailored education. At 2 wk,the proportion of participants with better MDI technique wasno longer associated with health literacy (p /H110050.57).Paasche-Orlow, Riekert, Bilderback, et al.: Asthma Education and Literacy 983 TABLE 2.

Understanding of Discharge Regimen After a single round of education, 69% (11/16) of subjects with inadequate health literacy and 68% (39/57) of subjects withhigher health literacy were able to exhibit mastery of the dis- charge regimen. The need for supplemental education to exhibitmastery of the discharge regimen at the discharge study visit wasnot associated with health literacy in bivariate and multivariableanalyses (p /H110050.73 and p /H110050.33, respectively).

At the follow-up visit, the propor-tion of patients having mastery of the discharge regimen wasalso similar between groups based on health literacy (p /H110050.35; Figure 2). Adherence Data on adherence to corticosteroid therapy and asthma symp-tom control were available in a substudy of 46 participants (63%of participants for the current study). About half (22/46, 48%)of the patients had poor adherence to corticosteroid therapy. Inadequate health literacy was not associated with poor adher-ence to corticosteroid therapy (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.2-3.3; p 0.86). In multivariable analyses, health literacy was not associ-ated with adherence to corticosteroid therapy, whether (p /H11005 0.45) or not (p /H110050.45) the model included asthma medication knowledge. Asthma Symptom Control At the follow-up visit, asthma symptom control was similar inpatients with and without inadequate health literacy (mean [95%CI]: 1.6 [0.95-2.31] vs. 1.5 [1.22-1.75]; p /H110050.69). In multivariable analyses, inadequate health literacy was not associated withasthma symptom control at the follow-up visit (p /H110050.84). DISCUSSION Deciencies in asthma medication knowledge, MDI technique, and mastery of the discharge regimen were common in inner-city adults hospitalized for asthma exacerbations. Observed de-ciencies in asthma self-management skills could not be ex-plained by sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity,and education) or past asthma-related health care use but wereindependently associated with inadequate health literacy. Inade-quate health literacy was associated with a greater likelihood ofhospitalization for asthma exacerbations in the past 12 mo andsignicantly less knowledge of asthma medication and improper984 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE VOL 172 2005 TABLE 4.

MDI technique. Patients with inadequate health literacy also were more likely to have lower asthma medication knowledgescores and improper MDI technique before the educational in-tervention. Surprisingly, inadequate health literacy was not asso-ciated with difculty learning or retaining instructions aboutdischarge regimen and proper MDI technique. The link between inadequate health literacy and less knowl- edge of asthma medication and improper MDI technique re-ported here is consistent with prior reports (14, 15). A few studiesin other disease models present evidence related to the role ofhealth literacy in learning and retaining self-management skillsin patients with other chronic diseases. For example, simpliedmaterials have been shown to improve knowledge (38-44),health care use (45), and health behaviors (46, 47) for patientswith diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, and hyper-tension, irrespective of health literacy. In addition, subjects withlow health literacy have been able to learn and retain self- Figure 2.

Results of our study, however, are the rst to provide data in asthma and indicate that interventions using tailored educa-tion can successfully overcome barriers related to inadequatehealth literacy and improve asthma self-management skills. Theseobservations are reasons for patients, clinicians, and policymak-ers to be optimistic about the benets of providing tailorededucation to vulnerable patient populations. Additional studies,however, are needed to determine whether these short-termgains in self-management are retained at subsequent points intime or whether \"refresher\" courses are necessary. Sustainedsuccess with asthma self-management may, for example, be re-lated to specic health beliefs, which may be related to healthliteracy (51, 52). Also, future research should include interventionsfocused on other guideline-recommended self-managementskills (e.g., allergen avoidance and other triggers), which arecritical to maintaining effective asthma control. We provided intensive asthma medication education at hospi- tal discharge, which included both oral and written instructionsduring a one-on-one training session until mastery was achieved(\"teach to goal\" strategy). Although this study cannot clarifywhich aspects of the education were critical to ensure learningand retention (combined use of oral and written instruction, one-on-one personalized training, teach-to-goal until mastery wasachieved, exhibiting appropriate MDI technique), we speculatethat the physical exhibition of MDI technique by study personnel and structured assessment of participants' understanding servedto reinforce what was learned and overcome the barrier of inade-quate health literacy (30). Because resources needed for this typeof intensive inpatient education may not be routinely available,additional research is needed to identify key components of ourmultimodality intervention. It is important to underscore the high prevalence of poor MDI technique and poor understanding of the discharge regimenwe observed. Despite our intensive program to improve patients'self-management skills provided in this study, fully 28% did notunderstand the discharge regimen and 30% had not masteredPaasche-Orlow, Riekert, Bilderback, et al.: Asthma Education and Literacy 985 the MDI technique after one full round of education. These observations suggest that dramatic gains from the use of effectivetherapies in asthma are not reaching this high-risk populationand highlight the need for evaluating patients' comprehensionwhen providing discharge instructions and the development ofsystematic approaches to tailored inpatient asthma education. Asthma self-management skills and use of acute medical ser- vices for asthma have been linked to various sociodemographicfactors (18, 19, 53-56). In particular, fewer years of educationcompleted has been implicated as an important risk factor inpatients with asthma for cigarette smoking, worse MDI tech-nique, and higher rates of emergency room visits, hospitalization,and mortality (19, 53-58). In this study, patients' level of educa-tion was not an independent predictor of asthma medicationknowledge, MDI technique, or understanding of the dischargeregimen. Instead, we found that health literacy was predictiveof asthma medication knowledge and MDI technique. Moreover,our ndings indicate that asthma medication knowledge playsa role in the causal pathway linking inadequate health literacyto poor MDI technique. The prospective study design, uniform medication regimen after hospital discharge, and standardized education before dis-charge provided the unique opportunity to determine whetherinadequate literacy served as a barrier to learning and retainingasthma self-management skills. Nonetheless, several potentiallimitations should be kept in mind. Although rates of follow-up were high (77%), bias may have been introduced due toincomplete follow-up, because not returning to the 2-wk follow-up visit was associated with age, race, and asthma medicationknowledge. Also, without a control group, we cannot denitivelyconclude that our educational intervention was responsible forall the gains in asthma self-management that were noted. Forexample, it is possible but not certain that the lack of associationwe report between literacy and adherence was due to our educa-tional intervention. Our data do, however, provide estimates ofeffect sizes that can be used to develop more denitive studiesin this area (e.g., randomized clinical trial with an attentioncontrol group). Although interviewer bias is unlikely due toseveral safeguards put in place in our protocol, it is difcultto exclude completely the possibility that knowledge of healthliteracy status of participants influenced the teaching or assess-ment of self-management. Also, although we deliberately tar-geted an inner-city predominantly African-American popula-tion, a group at highest risk of complications resulting fromasthma exacerbations, further research is needed to determinewhether our ndings are generalizable to other vulnerable pa-tient populations (e.g., elderly with asthma). Prior hospitalization strongly predicts risks of reexacerba- tions and death in the subsequent 12 mo (59-60). These pooroutcomes are particularly common among African-Americanand inner-city patients for whom both hospitalizations anddeaths related to asthma exacerbations are two to three timesmore likely than in other patient populations (64-66). Theseobservations have led to a variety of inpatient programs to im-prove patients' self-management after hospital discharge (67, 68).The current study demonstrates that inpatient programs that embrace an intensive education program similar to ours arelikely to overcome disparities in asthma self-management skillsassociated with inadequate health literacy. In conclusion, this study presents evidence that inadequate asthma self-management skills are common and that inadequatehealth literacy is associated with worse asthma medicationknowledge and MDI technique. However, inadequate healthliteracy was not associated with difculty learning or retaininginstructions about discharge regimen and proper MDI technique.Our results suggest the need for a systematic assessment ofpatient comprehension of discharge instructions and medications at hospital discharge. In patients with deciencies in asthma self-management, we recommended a tailored, teach-to-goal, asthmaeducation program.

Horton, Nicole Tibbetts, Seville Meli, and Jeffrey H. Samet Background: We examined the association of substance abuse treatment services on hospitalization among participants in the HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort (HIV-ALC) study of HIV-infected individ-uals with a history of alcohol problems. Methods: A standardized questionnaire that inquired about demographics, substance use, use of sub- stance abuse treatment services, and hospitalization was administered to 349 HIV-ALC participants. Wedefined substance abuse treatment services as any of the following in the past 6 months: 12 weeks in ahalf-way house or residential facility, 12 visits to a substance abuse counselor or mental health professional,or participation in any methadone maintenance program. Results: Almost one third of this cohort were hospitalized in the past 6 months. Substance abuse treatment was not significantly associated with hospitalization [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.0; injection drug 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2) were independently associated withincreased odds of hospitalization over time. Conclusions: Engagement in substance abuse treatment was not associated with a decrease in hospital use by HIV-infected individuals with a history of alcohol problems. The period of substance abuse treat-ment may present an opportunity to address health care utilization patterns of HIV-infected individuals. Key Words: Health Services Utilization, Substance Use, Alcohol Use, HIV Disease/AIDS, Hospitalizations. LESS THAN OPTIMAL patterns of health care utiliza- tion have been observed among certain HIV-infected individuals (Shapiro et al., 1999). In particular, HIV-infected drug users have frequent hospitalization (Laine et al., 2001; Palepu et al., 2001; Stein, 1994) with high associ-ated costs (Palepu et al., 2001; Stein and Sobota, 2001).Direct complications of illicit drug use (Palepu et al., 2001;Stein and Sobota, 2001) as well as indirect consequencessuch as a reduced ability to adhere to antiretroviral therapy(Lucas et al., 2001) account for a substantial portion of thehealth care utilization by HIV-infected injection drug users.Patients with alcohol problems have also been found to have less than optimal patterns of health care utilization(Hunkeler et al., 2001; Saitz et al., 2000; Weintraub et al.,2001). In addition, it is not uncommon encounter alcoholproblems among HIV-infected et al. (2001) used New York State Medicaidfiles to examine the relationship of outpatient medical andsubstance abuse care with subsequent hospitalization ratesamong drug users. Subsequent hospitalization was reducedfor both HIV-infected and HIV-negative drug users whohad regular medical and drug abuse care. Little is known,however, about the relationship of substance abuse treat-ment services and the hospital use of HIV-infected individ-uals with alcohol problems. As substance abuse treatmentservices can also provide an opportunity to address one'sbehaviors and medical needs beyond the use of substances From the Centre for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences (AP), St. Paul's Hospital, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia,Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Department of Mathematics (NJH),Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts; DM-STAT Inc.

We examinedthis among participants in the HIV-Alcohol LongitudinalCohort (HIV-ALC) study, composed of HIV-infected in-dividuals with a history of alcohol problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population Patients who had HIV infection and a history of alcohol problems were identified by explicit eligibility criteria. All potential participants who gave twoor more positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire (Buchsbaum et al.,1991; Ewing, 1984; Fiellin et al., 2000), a screening test for lifetime alcoholproblems (sensitivity ~80%, specificity ~90%), were eligible. In addition,patients who were recruited from the Boston Medical Center HIV DiagnosticEvaluation Unit (Samet et al., 1995) and did not meet CAGE criteria wereeligible when one of two attending physicians made a specific diagnosis oflifetime alcohol abuse or dependence. Thus, individuals with a historyof lifetime alcohol problems, despite not being detected by the CAGE, weredetected by the clinical interview and recruited. Other entry criteria includedthe following: fluency in English or Spanish, Mini-Mental State Examinationscore/H1135021 (Folstein et al., 1975), and no plans to move from the Boston area in the next 2 years. As chronic alcohol use is associated with cognitiveimpairment, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination cutoff of 21 toexclude individuals in whom such impairment may preclude obtaining in-formed consent, an accurate and complete interviewer-administered ques-tionnaire, or a follow-up interview. The Institutional Review Boards of BostonMedical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved this study. From July 1997 through July 2001, recruitment of participants occurred by multiple methods and from several sites: Boston Medical Center HIV Diag-nostic Evaluation Unit, 56%; posted fliers, 17%; Boston Medical CenterPrimary Care Clinic, 13%; respite facility for homeless people, 5%; metha-done clinic, 4%; subject referrals, 4%; and Beth Israel Deaconess MedicalCenter, 2%. The majority of participants were recruited from medical settingsthat addressed HIV-related issues. The eligibility criteria of a history ofalcohol problems was determined by the CAGE questionnaire in 313 (90%)of 349 participants and based on clinical assessment in 36 (10%) of 349participants. Diagnostic interviews for alcohol problems in a sample of theseparticipants ( n/H11005238) revealed a lifetime history of alcohol dependence [76% (181 of 238)] or abuse [15% (37 of 238)] in /H1102290% (Samet et al., 2004). Data Collection After obtaining informed consent, a research associate interviewed participants using a standardized instrument to ascertain baseline infor-mation including the following: demographics, HIV risk behaviors, alcoholseverity, use of substance abuse treatment services, medications used, andhealth care utilization in the preceding 6 months. For the Spanish inter-view, standardized scales in Spanish were used when available; the re-mainder of the questionnaire was translated from English into Spanish,back-translated to check for accuracy, and then corrected. We attemptedto obtain CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA (viral load) levels on all partic-ipants. Laboratory tests performed within 6 months of the interview aspart of clinical care were recorded. When not available through routineclinical care, blood samples were obtained and tested for CD4 cell countand HIV RNA using the Boston Medical Center Clinical Laboratory.Participants were followed every 6 months for up to seven observations,and follow-up ended July 2001. Outcome and Primary Independent Variables Hospital admission in the previous 6-month period was our outcome of interest. We defined substance abuse treatment services as any of thefollowing in the past 6 months: 12 weeks in a half-way house or residentialfacility, 12 visits to a substance abuse counselor or mental health profes- sional, or participation in any methadone maintenance program (Brandset al., 2002; Farre et al., 2002). Other Independent Variables Other specific variables assessed included sex, age, race/ethnicity (black, white, or other, which comprised mostly Hispanic participants),injection drug use in the previous 6 months, abstinence from alcohol in thepast 30 days, severity of alcohol dependence as measured by the AlcoholDependence Scale (Ross et al., 1990), incarceration in the previous 6months, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA, and homelessness. Homelessness wasdefined as having spent at least 1 night either on the street or in a shelterin the 6 months before the interview (Kertesz et al., 2003). We alsoassessed depressive symptoms as measured by the 20-item Centers forEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, in which /H1135016 denotes severe depressive symptoms (Andresen et al., 1994). We also assessed physicalfunctioning and mental health functioning by the physical componentscore and mental component score derived from the Short Form-36(Ware, 1993, 1994). Medical diagnoses were read to the participants, andthey indicated whether they had been hospitalized for these reasons in theprevious 6 months. We examined the distribution of these medical diag-noses among those who reported hospitalization at baseline to assesswhether the admissions were potentially HIV related or consequences ofsubstance abuse. Measurement of HIV RNA was performed usingbranched-chain DNA techniques (Pachl et al., 1995). Analysis In the bivariable analysis, categorical variables were compared using /H92732 test, and continuous variables were compared using the Student's ttest. Multivariable longitudinal logistic regression models were constructed toexamine the association of substance abuse treatment on hospitalizationover time. Because serial measures on the same individuals were consid-ered, generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for correlationbetween these measures over time using an independence working corre-lation matrix (Liang and Zeger, 1986; Zeger and Liang, 1986). Thesubstance abuse treatment variable was dichotomous. We adjusted forpotential confounding factors by including in the model sex, race, age,severity of alcohol dependence, homelessness, recent drug injection, in-carceration in the past 6 months, current use of highly active antiretroviraltherapy, abstinence from alcohol in the past 30 days, baseline CD4 cellcount, and HIV RNA. These were factors that we hypothesized wouldaffect the odds of hospitalization. All analyses were carried out usingSAS/STAT version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS Baseline participant characteristics are described in Table 1: 79% were men, two thirds were ethnic minorities, mean agewas 41 years, and 29% were homeless. The most commonHIV risk factor was injection drug use (59%), with menhaving sex with men and heterosexual sex each stated by 20%of participants. Of the injection drug users, 23% had injecteddrugs in the previous 6 months. In the past 30 days, 24%of participants reported using alcohol and heroin or co-caine, 18% used alcohol alone, and 5% used heroin orcocaine alone; 12% were enrolled in methadone mainte-nance. Among the participants who drank alcohol in thepast 30 days, the average daily alcohol consumption was 6.4drinks. One third (118 of 349) of the participants wereengaged in substance abuse treatment at the initial obser-vation, and the specific treatment services and averageexposure are presented in Table 1. More than half (59%) of390 PALEPU ET AL.the participants reported that they had received antiretro- viral therapy. Among the participants who were not en-gaged in substance abuse treatment at the initial observa-tion, 70 entered substance abuse treatment during the studyperiod. In terms of primary care, 92% (323 of 349) saw aphysician two or more times in the preceding 6 months. Ofall study participants at the initial observation ( n/H11005349), the number of participants who reported being on psychi-atric medications in the previous 6 months were and sedative/hypnotic (n/H1100514; 4%). In this research study, the participants were followed every 6 months for up to seven occasions, and themedian number of observations per subject was three. Timeof recruitment was the strongest predictor of number offollow-up observations because of the design of the inves-tigation (study participants were recruited over a 4-year period, and all follow-up interviews ceased in July 2001). The characteristics of hospitalized participants are shown in Table 2. They were more likely to be black, be homeless,and have higher alcohol dependence scores. Hospitalizedparticipants were also more likely to have received sub-stance abuse treatment in the past 6 months (42 vs. 30%;p/H110050.02). The results of the multivariable logistic regres- sion of factors associated with hospitalization are presentedin Table 3.

Overall, a majority of theepisodic illnesses were not HIV related. DISCUSSION In this sample of HIV-infected individuals with alcohol problems, engagement in substance abuse treatment ser-Table 1.

Many participantswho were hospitalized had episodic medical illnesses that mayhave been related to ongoing substance abuse. In contrast,Laine et al. (2001) found that among 11,566 HIV-infecteddrug users, the AOR for hospitalization was lowest amongthose with both regular medical and drug abuse care (0.76)followed by those with regular medical care alone (0.82) andregular drug abuse care alone (0.85) compared with thosewith neither. They used administrative data to derive theirregular drug abuse care variable and stringently defined it asat least three weekly claims per month for drug abuse treat-ment over a 6-month period. In our cohort, only one thirdwere engaged in substance abuse services and on average at alower intensity than the criteria used by Laine et al. The association of substance abuse and health care uti- lization has been documented in numerous studies (Alex-andre et al., 2001; French et al., 2000; Knowlton et al., 2001; McGeary and French, 2000; Palepu et al., 2001). In addi-tion, the substantial health care utilization of HIV-infectedindividuals has been well documented (Bozzette et al.,1998; Gifford et al., 2000; Shapiro et al., 1999; Smith et al.,2000). In the HIV Cost and Service Utilization Study,~20% of the patients reported being hospitalized in theprevious 6 months (Bozzette et al., 1998), which is lowerthan participants in our study (44%). The prevalence ofalcohol use among HIV-infected individuals (Samet et al.,2004) and its potential negative impact on behavioral andclinical issues increase the importance of understanding thepredictors of health care use in a population of HIV-infected individuals with alcohol problems (Conigliaro etal., 2003). The high use of primary care in this cohort, a result of the strategy by which recruitment occurred, allows for an ex-amination of an effect of substance abuse treatment inaddition to primary medical care for decreasing utilizationof hospital resources. The absence of any association ofsubstance abuse treatment on hospitalization was not whatwe had hypothesized and not consistent with the work ofLaine et al. (2001). Several reasons may account for theabsence of this effect. The effect of substance abuse treat-ment on hospital utilization in HIV-infected patients with ahistory of alcohol problems may be mild, if at all present.Alternatively, the effect is potentially substantial, but ser-vices as defined in this study may not have been sufficientlyintense or adequately integrated with their medical care tohave an association with hospital utilization. Special effortsmay be required to appreciate the potential synergisticeffect of primary medical care and substance abuse treat-ment services on utilization of hospital services. Despitehaving primary care (Samet et al., 2001), these patients maynot be able to attend all set appointments because ofcompeting priorities as a result of substance abuse (Frenchet al., 2000; Gifford et al., 2000) and present later in thecourse of an illness, thus requiring hospitalization (Aday,1994; French et al., 2000; Palepu et al., 2001; Samet et al.,1998; Weber et al., 2000). Substance abuse treatment pro-grams can stress the critical nature of ongoing medical carefor HIV-infected patients. A focus on dimensions of med-ical care that can include optimal medication use, saferbehaviors regarding sex, and drug-related HIV transmis-sion may result in fewer medical complications and fewerhospitalizations. Similarly, primary care providers can fa-cilitate their patients' entry into substance abuse treatment(Strathdee et al., 1999) and play a crucial role in thelong-term management of patients in recovery from alcoholor other drug problems (Friedmann et al., 1998; Stein andFriedmann, 2001). It is possible that only after the estab-lishment of such integration of substance abuse and pri-mary care services that optimization of the utilization ofhospital services will be achieved. Our study has several limitations. Most study participants were already engaged in primary care as that setting was a Table 3.

This selection bias may overes- timate the degree of health care utilization among HIV-infected urban individuals with alcohol problems as theyare already engaged in the medical care system. The hos-pital utilization and reported episodic illnesses (Table 4)was by self-report and not validated in our study; however,studies have found self-reported health care use to be avalid measure at 4-month (Weissman et al., 1996) and6-month recall (Palepu et al., 1999; Solomon et al., 1993)among HIV-infected individuals, including drug injectors;of note, the validity is highest for self-reported hospital usecompared with ambulatory visits. Given the concurrentillicit drug use, we cannot ascertain the independent con-tribution that alcohol problems had on hospital admissions.However, polysubstance use among HIV-infected individ-uals is not uncommon given that many people contract HIVvia injection drug use, and our sample is likely representa-tive of HIV-infected individuals with alcohol problems. Theduration of exposure to substance abuse treatment may nothave been sufficient to have an association on hospitaliza-tion patterns. It is possible that our study was underpow-ered to detect a small association. Finally, we do not havethe specific dates of when the patients were hospitalized orwhen they received substance abuse treatment. It is possi-ble that hospitalization may serve as a sentinel event thatmotivates HIV-infected individuals with alcohol problemsto seek substance abuse treatment, or, conversely, patientsin substance abuse treatment relapse and this results inhospitalization for episodic non-HIV-related medicalillnesses. In summary, we found that engagement in substance abuse treatment services was not associated with reducedhospitalizations among HIV-infected individuals with alco-hol problems. The counterintuitive nature of this findingsuggests the need to better understand the phenomenon.Does providing substance abuse treatment for HIV-infected individuals with a history of alcohol problems nothave an impact on their utilization of hospital resources, or,rather, does the present configuration of service deliverynot take advantage of an opportunity to reduce hospital-izations in this high-risk population? This opportunity toprovide higher quality and more efficient health care to thismarginalized population seems too substantial not to ex-amine further.

Our three outcome variables of high-risk behavior were the Risk Assessment Battery sex-risk and drug-risk scores and high-risk sex behavior which included any of the following: inconsistent condom use; having more than one sexual partner; and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Although sexual risk was high(51%) in our HIV-infected cohort, engagement in substance abuse treatment was not independently associated with lower frequency of any of our measures of high- risk behaviors. Although the opportunity exists to address HIV risk behaviors in the setting of substance abuse treatment, effective institutionalization of this challenging behavior change effort has not yet been realized.

Introduction Several studies have reported that drug and alcohol use is associated with high-risk sexual and drug use behaviors(Fitterling, Matens, Scotti, 2001; Stein et al., 2000 ). People with heavy alcohol use tend to engage in riskier behaviors, suchas sex with multiple partners, unprotected vaginal and analintercourse, and injection drug use ( Bagnall, Plant, & Temple, & Trocki, 1994 ). The relationship between alcohol and sexual risk taking is complex, and maybe explained in a number of ways. Alcohol use may influence high-risk behaviors by affecting judgment and increasing disinhibition. Alcohol use may be a marker of arisk-taking personality; people with heavy alcohol use mayalso be more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors(Leigh et al., 1994 ). Thus, one critical approach to slow the spread of HIV among persons with alcohol problems is tochange risky sexual behaviors. Active drug and alcohol use is associated with increased sexual and drug using risk behaviors ( Battjes, Pickens, & 0740-5472/05/$ - see front matter D2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jsat.2004.09.002* Corresponding author. 620B-1081 Brown, 1995; Booth, Kwiatkowski, & Chitwood, 2000; Rees et et al., 2000 ). Certain harm reduc- tion strategies have reduced these risk behaviors, such asenhancing methadone maintenance with an HIV harm reduction program targeting HIV-infected injection drug users. The authors found increases in both harm reduc-tion and health promotion behaviors ( Margolin, Avants, Warburton, Hawkins, & Shi, 2003 ). Numerous studies, including systematic reviews, have examined the effect of various types of HIV preventioninterventions and substance abuse treatment on high-risksex and drug use behaviors ( Avins Woods et al., 1999 ). These studies found that that these interventions can result in reduced sexualrisk behaviors among drug users ( Semaan et al., 2002 ). In the context of substance abuse treatment programs whichwere predominantly methadone maintenace therapy, one meta-analysis of such programs in North America, found reductions in risky sexual behavior and injection practices(Prendergast et al., 2002 ). Similarly, a study of 753 drug users enrolled in either methadone maintenance therapy orresidential treatment settings in the United Kingdom founda reduction of risky behaviors at one-year follow-up ( Gossop et al., 2002 ). These findings demonstrate the utility of substance abuse treatment as a means of HIV prevention with persons with substance use problems, but few studies to date haveassessed whether such intervention is associated with HIV-related risk reduction in HIV-infected persons with alcoholproblems. High-risk behaviors in this population haveserious public health implications with regards to HIVtransmission and have been a particular focus of recent U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pre- vention efforts. The effectiveness of prevention utilizing this opportunity, substance abuse treatment, in the life ofa substance-abusing HIV-infected person is important toassess. Therefore, we hypothesized that engagement insubstance abuse treatment services would reduce sexual anddrug use risk behaviors among participants in the HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort (HIV-ALC) study. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study design and population We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of HIV- infected patients with a history of alcohol problems. Pa-tients who were HIV-infected and had a history of alcohol problems were identified by explicit eligibility criteria. All potential subjects who gave two or more positive responsesto the CAGE questionnaire ( Buchsbaum, Buchanan, Reid, &O'Connor, 2000 ), a screening test for lifetime alcohol problems (sensitivity ~ 80%, specificity ~ 90%), wereeligible. In addition, those patients recruited from theBoston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit (DEU; Samet et al., 1995 ) who did not meet CAGE criteria, were eligible if one of two attending physicians made aspecific diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Thussubjects with alcohol problems, despite not being detectedby the CAGE questionnaire, were detected by the clinicalinterview and recruited. Still, within the DEU site, mostsubjects were recruited based on CAGE criteria. Other entrycriteria included the following: fluency in English or Spanish; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater or equal to 21 ( Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975 ); and no plans to move from the Boston area in the next twoyears. As chronic alcohol use is associated with cognitiveimpairment, we used the MMSE cut-off of 21 to excludesubjects in whom such impairment may preclude obtaininginformed consent, an accurate and complete interviewer-administered questionnaire, or a follow-up interview ( Smith, Saitz, Horton, & Samet, 2003 ). The Institutional Review Boards of Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center approved this study. From July 1997 through July 2001, recruitment of subjects occurred by multiple methods and from severalsources: (a) Boston Medical Center HIV DiagnosticEvaluation Unit (56%); (b) posted flyers (17%); (c) BostonMedical Center Primary Care Clinic (13%); (d) respite facility for homeless persons (5%); (e) methadone clinic (4%); subject referrals (4%); and (f) Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center (2%). The majority of subjects wererecruited from medical settings that addressed HIV-relatedissues. The eligibility criteria of a history of alcoholproblems was determined by the CAGE questionnaire in313/349 (90%) of subjects, and based on clinical assessmentin 36/349 (10%) of subjects. Diagnostic interviews for alcohol problems in a sample of the recruited subjects (N= 141) revealed in the overwhelming majority a lifetime history of alcohol dependence 80% (113/141) or abuse 15%(21/141; Samet, Phillips, Horton, Traphagen, & Freedberg, 2004 ). One hundred and fifty-one subjects in the cohort participated in a randomized controlled trial of an anti-retroviral adherence intervention; appropriate adjustmentswere made to the analysis to account for the trial ( Samet et al., 2002 ). 2.2. Data collection After obtaining informed consent, a research associate or study investigator interviewed subjects using a standard-ized instrument to ascertain baseline information includingthe following: demographics, HIV risk behaviors, alcohol severity, use of substance abuse treatment services, and health care utilization in the preceding 6 months. For theSpanish interview standardized scales in Spanish were usedwhen available; the remainder of the questionnaire wasA. Palepu et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 28 (2005) 3-9 4translated from English into Spanish, back-translated to check for accuracy, and then corrected. We attempted toobtain CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA (viral load) levels onall subjects. Laboratory tests performed within 6 months of the interview as part of clinical care were recorded. If not available through routine clinical care, blood samples wereobtained and tested for CD4 cell count and HIV RNA usingthe Boston Medical Center Clinical Laboratory. Subjectswere followed every 6 months for up to seven observations;follow-up ended July 2001. 2.3. Outcome variables Estimates of sexual risk and drug risk behaviors over the previous 6 months were derived from the Risk AssessmentBattery (RAB; Navaline et al., 1994 ). This instrument sums the scores for individual items, for totals of 35 (sex risk) and25 (drug risk). Items on each scale ask about HIV riskbehavior in the past 6 months. Examples of the sex-riskquestions are bwith how many men/women have you had sex?Qandbhow often did you use condoms when you had sex?QExamples of the drug-risk questions include bhave you shared needles or works? Qandbhow often have you been to a shooting gallery? QWe also created a variable for high risk sexual behavior in the past 6 months whichincluded any of the following: inconsistent condom use (i.e.not using a condom with every sexual encounter); havingmore than one sexual partner; and exchanging sex for money or drugs. 2.4. Primary independent variable We defined substance abuse treatment services as any of the following in the past 6 months: at least 12 weeks in ahalf-way house or residential facility; at least 12 visits to asubstance abuse counselor or mental health professional; day treatment for at least 30 days; or participation in any methadone maintenance program ( Brands, Blake, & Marsh, 2002; Farre, Mas, Torrens, Moreno, & Cami, 2002 ). 2.5. Other independent variables Other specific variables assessed included: (1) age; (2) gender; (3) depressive symptoms as measured by the 20-item Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, & Patrick,1994 ); (4) self-reported use of cocaine and heroin in the past30 days; (5) homelessness which was defined as havingspent at least one night either on the street or in a shelter inthe 6 months prior to the interview ( Kertesz, Horton, Friedmann, Saitz, & Samet, 2003 ); and (6) currently being on antiretroviral therapy at the time of an interview. We used the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol- ism (NIAAA) guideline for at-risk drinking: greater than14 drinks per week (or more than four drinks per day) formen, and greater than seven drinks per week (or more thanthree drinks per day) for women ( NIAAA, 1995 ). Alcohol consumption below these levels was considered not at-riskin our study. 2.6. Analysis We used multivariable longitudinal linear regression models to examine the association of substance abusetreatment on the following outcomes: sexual and drug userisk behavior as measured by the RAB sex risk score and theRAB drug risk score. A multivariable longtitudinal logisticregression model was constructed to examine the associa- tion of substance abuse treatment on high risk sexual behavior. Since serial measures on the same individualswere considered for these analyses, generalized estimatingequations were used to adjust for correlation between thesemeasures over time using a working independence correla-tion matrix and empirical variance estimator ( Liang & Zeger, 1986; Zeger & Liang, 1986 ). The substance abuse treatment variable was dichotomous. For the two models examining sexual risk behavior, we adjusted for age, gender, race, cocaine use, heroin use, at-risk drinking,homelessness, depressive symptoms, and current receipt ofantiretroviral therapy. In the drug use risk (i.e., RAB drugscore) multivariable model we only included subjects whoreported injecting drugs in the previous 6 months atbaseline. In all models, all of the predictor variables exceptfor gender, race and age were allowed to vary with time.

Results The 349 subjects had the following baseline character- istics: 79% were men, two thirds were ethnic minorities, mean age was 41 years, and 29% were homeless. The most common HIV risk factor was injection drug use (59%); withmen having sex with men (19%) and heterosexual sex(22%). Of the injection drug users, 35% had injected drugsin the previous 6 months. Of those injecting drugs, 51 of122 (42%) reported sharing needles or works. In the past30 days, 24% of subjects (84/349) reported using alcoholand heroin or cocaine, 18% used alcohol alone and 5% usedheroin or cocaine alone; 12% were enrolled in a methadone maintenance program. The average daily alcohol consump-tion of those drinking in the past 30 days was 6.4 drinks.Over one third (118/349) of the subjects were engaged in substance abuse treatment at the initial observation. Among the subjects who were not engaged in substance abusetreatment at the initial observation, 70 subjects enteredsubstance abuse treatment during the study period. In thisresearch study, the subjects were followed every 6 monthsfor up to seven occasions and the median number of ob-servations per subject was three. The distribution of inter-views (observations) conducted per subject was as follows: 111 subjects had one interview; 40, two interviews; 48, three interviews; 44, four; 39, five; 47, six; and 20completed seven interviews. Because study subjects wererecruited over a four-year period, and all follow-ups ceasedat the end of recruitment, time of recruitment was the majorfactor affecting the number of follow-up observations in Horton, & Samet, 2004 ). Subjects Tcharacteristics associated with high-risk sexual risk behavior at baseline are presented in Table 1 . A sig- nificantly higher proportion of subjects who were younger,more likely to use cocaine and heroin, and consume at-riskquantities of alcohol reported high-risk sexual behavior.Table 2 depicts the RAB sex-risk and drug-risk scoresTable 2 Bivariate associations of characteristics of HIV-infected subjects with alcohol problems and RAB sex-risk and RAB drug-risk scores at baseline RAB sex-risk ( N= 349) RAB drug-risk ( N= 122) Characteristics Mean (SD) p-value Mean (SD) p-value Sex Female 3.7 (3.3) 0.52 8.2 (7.0) 0.82 Male 3.4 (3.1) 8.5 (6.1) Ethnicity Black 3.8 (3.2) 0.09 8.3 (5.7) 0.20White 3.5 (2.9) 0.30 7.1 (5.6) 0.03 Other (ref) 3.0 (3.1) 10.7 (7.5) Homeless a Yes 3.9 (3.7) 0.11 10.3 (6.1) 0.03 No 3.3 (2.8) 7.1 (6.2) Cocaineb Yes 4.1 (3.3) b0.001 7.7 (5.8) 0.45 No 2.7 (2.9) 8.8 (6.6) Heroinb Yes 3.3 (2.6) 0.73 7.5 (6.1) 0.30 No 3.5 (3.2) 9.0 (6.5) At-risk alcoholc Yes 4.1 (3.3) 0.007 7.6 (5.5) 0.46No 3.2 (2.9) 8.8 (6.7) S.A. treatment d Yes 3.3 (3.1) 0.48 8.0 (6.3) 0.45No 3.6 (3.1) 9.0 (6.4) Antiretroviral Receipt a Yes 3.4 (2.9) 0.64 8.2 (6.7) 0.75 No 3.6 (3.3) 8.7 (6.0) Pearson 6 months. bIn the past 30 days. cAt-risk alcohol consumption refers to greater than 14 drinks per week (or more than 4 drinks per day) for men, and greater than 7 drinks per week(or more than 3 drinks per day) for women. dSubstance abuse treatment: Having at least 12 weeks in a half-way house or residential facility; 12 visits to a substance abuse counselor ormental health professional; day treatment for at least 30 days; or participationin any methadone maintenance in the previous 6 months. eMeasure of depressive symptoms where a CESD score z16 indicate depressive symptoms.Table 3Multivariable linear and logistic regression models for the factors associatedwith RAB sex-risk and high-risk sexual behavior a FactorRAB sex-risk Adjusted Beta Estimate (95% CI)High-risk sexual CI) estimating equations and controlling for time; 1111 observations used in the RAB sex-risk model and 1114 observations used in the High-risk sexual behavior model. bS.A.

HIV-infected persons who were younger, who used cocaine and consumed at-risk quantitiesof alcohol had significantly higher RAB sex-risk scores. Higher RAB drug-risk scores were significantly associated with being white and homeless. Substance abuse treatment was not associated with less risky sexual behavior as measured by the two study out-comes, RAB sex-risk, or high-risk sexual behavior. The mul-tivariable models of the factors independently associated withthe RAB sex-risk score and high-risk sexual behavior areshown in Table 3 . For both models, younger age and cocaine use were independently associated with measures of sexual risk behavior. In the RAB sex-risk model, heroin use wasassociated with a significantly lower score: less sexual risk. Substance abuse treatment was not associated with the less risky drug use behavior as measured by RAB drug-riskscore. The factors associated with the RAB drug-risk scoreare presented in Table 4 . Black race was associated with a lower score and homelessness was associated with a higher RAB drug-risk score. 4. Discussion Addressing the behaviors of HIV-infected persons has only recently attracted the main focus of preventionresearchers and public health practitioners. This strategicapproach has been adopted by the CDC ( Jaffe & Janssen, 2003 ). By giving particular effort to promoting safe behaviors in the HIV-infected, in addition to the ongoingefforts to reduce HIV risks in the general population, the goal of limiting the spread of HIV infection may be better achieved. This study identified a group of HIV-infectedpersons with particularly high reports of recent HIV sexualand drug use risk, namely HIV-infected persons with al-cohol problems ( Ehrenstein et al., 2004 ). In this cohort, over half reported sexual or drug use risk behaviors for HIVinfection in the past 6 months. Notably, 51% of this same at-risk population received substantial substance abuse treat- ment over the study period. Thus, it would be particularly appropriate for this population to receive effective HIV riskreduction while receiving care in a substance abuse treat-ment program. Our investigation found that unfortunately,in this cohort, engagement in substance abuse treatment wasnot associated with lower sexual or drug use risk behaviors.These findings are in stark contrast to previous researchindicating that substance abuse treatment promotes HIV risk reduction behaviors in client populations ( Avins et al., 1997; Gibson et Sorensen & Copeland,2000; Woods et al., 1999 ). Conflicting findings between our study and previous work on the specific finding that exposure to substanceabuse treatment is not beneficial in terms of HIV risk re-duction is noteworthy and merits explanation. This dis- crepancy may be a consequence of the fact that some of the previous studies were mainly examining substanceabusers without regard to their HIV infection status. It ispossible that education about the risk of HIV transmissionwhen one is not already infected is more effective thanwhen one is infected. In the latter situation the majorperceived benefit of risk reduction is not one Ts own health, but the health of one Ts sex or drug partners. It may be that the education regarding high-risk behaviors need to better tailored to HIV-infected persons with substanceuse problems. For example, Margolin et al. (2003) studied 90 HIV-infected persons on methadone and tested a tar-geted HIV harm reduction program using a randomizedcontrolled trial. They found reductions in both illicit opioiduse and risk behaviors, as well as an increased uptake ofantiretroviral therapy. Another potential explanation for the discrepant findings between this study and previous work is the fact that, unlikein our study, many of the specific substance abuse treatmentprograms examined in previous work were aware that therewas ongoing monitoring for clinical outcomes. In contrast,our research assessed drug treatment programs broadly, asthey are practiced in the breal world. QAlthough Massachu- setts, the state in which the study was conducted, mandates HIV education as a part of substance abuse treatment delivery ( Klein Walker, 1997 ) the effort expended to reduce HIV risks in these settings may simply be insufficient topromote HIV risk reduction. These findings suggest a needTable 4 Multivariable linear regression model for the factors associated with RAB drug-riska FactorRAB drug-risk Adjusted Beta Estimate estimating equations and controlling for time; 227 observations used in the RAB drug-risk model. bS.A.

Palepu et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 28 (2005) 3-9 7for ongoing monitoring of efforts to address HIV risk be- havior among the clients of substance abuse treatmentprograms. It is possible that periodic assessments of HIVrisk behaviors could be a marker of quality of substance abuse treatment used in the accreditation process of sub- stance abuse treatment programs. Although we saw no relationship between substance use treatment exposure and HIV risk behaviors, consistent withother studies ( Booth et al., 2000; Fuller et al., 1998; Tortuet al., 2000 ), we did find that younger age and cocaine use were associated with higher sexual risk behaviors, suggest- ing the need to target intervention efforts to these groups inparticular. Notably, our findings demonstrated lower rates ofHIV-related drug use risk among Blacks; these findings aresurprising as previous study indicates higher injection druguse rates ( Turner, Miller, & Moses, 1989 ) and related HIV risk ( Kottiri, Friedman, Neaigus, Curtis, & Des Jarlais, 2002; CDC, 2002 ) among Blacks as compared with Whites. Discrepancy in findings may be attributable to the unique aspects of our sub-population of substance using HIV-infected persons (i.e., history of alcohol problems) anddemonstrates the need for further focus on this populationas risk and risk factors for this group may not be similarto other groups. Our study has limitations. Although our definition of substance abuse treatment services is not as stringent as that used by Laine et al. (2001) , we think it has face validity. Although 36% of this cohort were categorized as receivingsubstance abuse treatment services at a reasonable level ofexposure, it is possible that higher levels of exposure maybe required to demonstrate an effect. A strength of this studywas the ability to follow a cohort of HIV-infected subjectsover time, thus assessing subjects at times when substanceabuse treatment was both present and absent. In summary, we found that being engaged in substance abuse treatment was not associated with reduced sexual anddrug use risk behaviors among HIV-infected persons withalcohol problems. Further research is needed to assesswhether more intensive substance abuse treatment or in-tegrated substance abuse treatment and HIV risk reductionintervention can effectively meet the needs of this popu-lation. Nonetheless, given that the majority of our partici- pants reported recent involvement with substance abuse treatment programs, using this existing health care site forthese high risk individuals may provide an important venueto reach this population for provision of effective HIV riskreduction programs.

Richter, Won S. Choi, Daniel P. Alford [Received 24 June 2004; accepted 19 November 2004J Most drug treatment patients smoke cigarettes, and some facilities are beginning to help patients quit. Facility smoking policies can help or hinder this effort. The present study describes smoking policies in outpatient drug treatment. It is a secondary analysis of a survey on smoking cessation treatment in outpatient methadone maintenance facilities in the United States. One clinic leader (a medical director, head nurse, or clinic director) from each of the 697 U.S. facilities was invited to participate in the study. Main outcome measures included whether clinics had a written smoking policy as well as the types of indoor and outdoor policies in place for patients and staff. A total of 408 (59%) of U.S. clinics responded. Most clinics (73%) had a written smoking policy for patients, and more (82%) had written policies for staff. Over 90% banned indoor smoking by staff and patients. Few totally banned outdoor smoking. Approximately half in some way restricted where patients (48%) and staff (55%) smoke outdoors. Compared with clinics that did not treat nicotine dependence, significantly more clinics that treated nicotine dependence had written policies on smoking and restricted outdoor smoking for patients and staff. Likewise, many public clinics and those affiliated with hospitals had outdoor smoking restrictions for patients and staff. Drug treatment facilities routinely ban alcohol use and drug dealing, but only one in 10 banned smoking on the grounds. Outpatient facilities should restrict or ban outdoor tobacco use in order to remain consistent with their mission and avoid sabotaging clinic efforts to treat, and patient and staff efforts to stop, smoking. Introduction Some drug treatment facilities are beginning to treat smoking among their patients, and smokingThe vast majority of patients (80%-90%) in treat\u00adpolicy reform is an important part of the process ment for drug abuse smoke cigarettes (Sullivan & (Fogg & Borody, 2001).

Smoking policies can help or hinder efforts to incorporate nicotine dependence treatment into drug treatment. Some drug treatment facilities provide a variety of formal and informal services for nicotine dependence (Currie, Nesbitt, Wood, & Lawson, 2003; Richter, Choi, McCool, Harris, & Ahluwalia, 2004). Several developments suggest that more facilities are beginning to do so. Knapp and colleagues surveyed Minnesota chemical dependency treatment facility directors in 1988 and again in 1990; the percentage of facilities that treated tobacco dependence increased from 10% at baseline to 18% at follow-up, and those prohibiting smoking increased from II % to 27% (Knapp, Rosheim, Meister, & Kottke, 1993). In 1996, the Massachusetts Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) required that all facilities receiving BSAS funds be smoke-free; this policy also provided training on nicotine addiction and treatment (Bureau of Substance Abuse Services, 1996). In 1997, facilities licensure standards in New Jersey required addictions treatment programs to address tobacco in their policies and treatment offerings (Hoffman et aI., 1997). More recently, several national associations for the treat\u00ad ment of drug addiction have issued policy statements supportive of treating nicotine dependence among persons with other drug addictions (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2001; NAADAC, 2002). Lax smoking policies could send a mixed message to counselors (who are charged with treating smok\u00ad ing) as well as to the patients they serve. For example, a counselor might provide brief advice to a patient to quit smoking, only to witness that patient walk through a gauntlet of smokers outside the facility on the way to his car. Such a situation could undermine counselor motivation to address smoking with other patients. Conversely, restrictive smoking policies in facilities could support counselor advice to quit smoking and support counselor attempts to quit smoking themselves. In this way, policies could either speed or slow adoption of consistent treatment practices within individual facilities and across treatment systems. We do not know the prevalence or types of smoking policies in drug treatment facilities. Multiple studies describe the impact of indoor smoking bans in solitary units and focus on residential or inpatient facilities (El-Guebaly, Cathcart, Currie, Brown, & Gloster, 2002). Their findings apply to a minority of facilities because only 26%-31% of U.S. drug treatment facilities offer residential rehabilitation or hospital inpatient ser\u00ad vices (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2002). Smoking policies probably are different for outpatient facilities because patients Nicotine & Tobacco Research ntr61467.3d 25/4/05 12:45:23 The Charlesworth Group, Wakefield +44(0) 1924 369598 Rev 7.51 nNi (Jen 20 2003) have more autonomy and spend less time at the treatment unit. Understanding the prevalence of clinics with smoking policies, the types of policies in place, and the factors that influence those policies may help policy makers develop strategies for disseminating optimal policies. Strong policies may help protect the health of nonsmoking patients and staff as well as support the diffusion of nicotine dependence treatment in drug treatment. The present study describes smoking policies in outpatient methadone maintenance facilities. This study was based on a national survey of methadone clinics that sought to establish the prevalence and type of nicotine dependence services offered. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that examines smoking policies in a national sample of outpatient drug treatment facilities, which serve the vast majority of persons presenting for drug treatment. Method Clinic leaders from all outpatient methadone main\u00ad tenance facilities in the United States were invited to participate. The 20-min survey was collected by phone, fax, or mail from fall 2001 through spring 2002. One respondent-the medical director, clinic director, head nurse, or supervising counselor\u00ad completed the survey for each clinic. Details of survey development, methods, and main findings are available elsewhere (Richter et aI., 2004). Survey items collected information on respondent demographics, clinic and staff characteristics, and smoking cessation services provided. The present study focused on whether clinics had any written policy on smoking and what their indoor and outdoor policies were. Questions were asked sepa\u00ad rately regarding policies for staff and patients. Questions (and response categories) were derived from a regional survey of drug treatment facilities (Hahn, Warnick, & Plemmons, 1999) and included the following: \"Does your program have a written smoking policy for your employees/patients that designates where and when they can smoke?\" (yes, no); \"Which of the following statements best describes your program's current indoor smoking rules for staff/patients?\" (anywhere indoors, desig\u00ad nated rooms or areas only, prohibited from smoking indoors); \"Which of the following statements best describes your program's current outdoor smoking rules for staff/patients?\" (anywhere outside, in designated outdoor areas only, prohibited from smoking outside on facility grounds). Our survey included measures of characteristics that might be related to clinic smoking policies. Hospital size and whether hospitals are in tobacco states are two factors associated with the prevalence and restrictiveness of smoking policies found' in 3 NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH hospitals (Emmons & Biener, 1993; Longo et al., 1998). Main study findings from our methadone facility survey were that clinic ownership (nonprofit, for profit, or public) was related to whether the facility provided tobacco treatment services (Richter et al., 2004); perhaps ownership as well as whether the facility provides services are related to clinic tobacco policies. Other characteristics also might be linked to tobacco policy, including the type of organization with which methadone clinics were affiliated (mental hospital, hospital, or freestanding) and the clinic's type of accreditation. Our survey included measures derived from hospital-based studies (Emmons & Biener, 1993; Longo et al., 1998) and national surveys of methadone services (D'Aunno, Folz-Murphy, & Lin, 1999). We hypothesized that these characteristics, along with whether the clinic offered nicotine depen\u00ad dence services, would be associated with the preva\u00ad lence and type of methadone clinic tobacco policies. We summarized clinic responses to tobacco policy questions using frequencies and percentages. We used chi-square statistics to examine whether organiza\u00ad tional characteristics were related to tobacco policies. Results Out of 697 outpatient methadone maintenance clinics in the United States, 408 (59%) participated in the survey (Richter et al., 2004). Most participants (72%; n=293) completed surveys by phone, the remainder (28%; n =115) by mail or fax. Clinics had on average 229 patients; their ownership was a mix of private for-profit (40), private nonprofit (37), and public (23); and an estimated 22\u00b0!., of their staff and 71% of their patients smoked cigarettes. We com\u00ad pared data on our participating clinics to data from the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which collects data from 100% of drug treatment facilities in the United States. Participating clinics were similar in size, region, and ownership to nonresponding clinics (Richter et al., 2004). Below, we describe smoking policies across all clinics and examine differences in the prevalence of policies according to clinic type. Written smoking policies Most clinics (73%) had a written policy on smoking for patients, and a higher percentage (82%) had written policies for staff. Table I displays the organizational characteristics of clinics that did and did not have written smoking policies. A small proportion of clinics with no accreditation had written smoking policies for their patients. A large proportion of clinics that provided nicotine dependence treatment to their patients had written smoking policies for both patients and staff. Indoor smoking policies Some clinics restricted patient (2%) and staff (2.7%) smoking to designated areas indoors. Most banned indoor smoking completely-95.8% banned patients and 94.8% banned staff from smoking anywhere indoors. Outdoor smoking policies Clinics were less restrictive in their outdoor smoking policies. Few completely banned outdoor smoking: 10.7% banned patients and 8.4% banned staff from smoking anywhere outside. Many clinics restricted in some way where patients (47.8%) and staff (55.2%) could smoke outdoors. A sizable minority of clinics allowed patients (40.8%) and staff (35.2%) to smoke anywhere outdoors. Table I displays the organizational characteristics of clinics that banned or restricted outdoor smoking. Outdoor smoking policies tended to be more restrictive for staff than patients. Compared with clinics that did not treat nicotine dependence, significantly more clinics that treated nicotine depen\u00ad dence had written policies on smoking and banned or restricted outdoor smoking for patients and staff. A significantly higher proportion of public clinics, compared with private for-profits and nonprofits, banned or restricted outdoor smoking for patients and staff. Significantly more JCAHO-accredited clinics, compared with those accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and other organizations, banned or restricted outdoor smoking for patients. A significantly higher proportion of clinics attached to hospitals, compared with those attached to mental health organizations or freestanding clinics, banned or restricted outdoor smoking for both patients and staff. Discussion Most outpatient methadone maintenance clinics banned indoor smoking, and many restricted where patients and staff could smoke outdoors. Whether clinics had a written policy and whether they restricted outdoor smoking was consistently related to whether the clinic offered nicotine dependence treatment. Other characteristics, including accreditation, owner\u00ad ship, and organizational affiliation, also were asso\u00ad ciated with having written policies or outdoor smoking restrictions. Being located in a tobacco state was not associated with policies or restrictions. Some caution should be exercised in considering the findings from this study. First, 41% of the group did not respond.

JCAHO switched oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug accredits hospitals and requires them to adopt strict Administration to accreditation by JCAHO, CARF, tobacco policies for indoor smoking. Many hospitals and other health and rehabilitative organizations exceed these standards by instituting restrictive Nicotine & Tobacco Research ntr61467.3d 25/4/05 12:45:23 The +44(0)1924369598\u00b7 Rov7.51nlW (Jon 20 200a) 5 NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH outdoor smoking policies (Longo et al., 1998). This may be why most methadone clinics with JCAHO affiliation or those sited at hospitals had restrictive outdoor smoking policies. Interestingly, the relation\u00ad ship appeared to work both ways. Studies on tobacco policy in hospitals found that hospitals with chemical dependency units had more permissive indoor and outdoor smoking policies than did hospitals without inpatient drug treatment (Emmons & Biener, 1993; Longo et al., 1998). Our data suggest that few patients or staff were exposed to tobacco smoke inside clinics. Outside clinics, the exposure to tobacco was probably substantial considering that the average clinic (with 229 patients and 71% smoking prevalence) treated 163 smokers-many of whom attended clinic daily. These facilities appear to have a policy double\u00ad standard. To avoid sabotaging treatment efforts, alco\u00ad hol use and drug dealing are routinely and explicitly banned from the grounds of drug treatment sites. We found that only one in 10 banned outdoor smoking. Such a ban would be consistent with the organiza\u00ad tional mission of these facilities. Most patients in drug treatment are interested in quitting smoking Orleans & Hutchinson, 1993; Sees & Clark, 1993), staff are willing to help them do so (Knapp et a1., 1993), and quitting smoking can improve other treatment outcomes (Shoptaw et al., 2002). A number of implications flow from study findings. Private, for-profit clinics are the fastest growing sector in methadone maintenance treatment (Institute of Medicine, 1995).Thesefacilitiesweretheleastlikelyto restrict outdoor smoking. They may not be subject to tobacco regulations that apply to clinics sited in hospitals or government buildings. Private for-profit clinics also are the type of facility least likely to provide nicotine dependence treatment (Richter et al., 2004). To address these discrepancies it may be necessary for methadone treatment regulations to explicitlyrequire for-profit facilitiesto developpolicies and treatments for nicotine dependence. Facilities treating nicotine dependence were more likely to have restrictive outdoor smoking policies, compared with those not offering such treatment. Offering nicotine treatment could have caused facilities to adopt more stringent smoking policies; conversely, stringent policies could have encouraged facilities to treat smoking among their patients. A more in-depth study of the dynamics of the relation\u00ad ship between tobacco policies and nicotine depen\u00ad dence treatment might shed more light on how to help other clinics make the transition. Because stopping smoking appears to facilitate recovery, and many patients want to make smoking cessation a treatment goal, outpatient drug treatment facilities should severely restrict or ban tobacco use on their premises. This change might, however, be accompanied by adverse consequences. For example, in a 1988 survey of 227 chemical dependency professionals located in Minnesota, Knapp and colleagues (1993) found that the most commonly cited barrier to a smoke-free facility was fear of losing patients. Smoking bans might prevent patients from succeeding in treatment, possibly related to drug relapse or attrition. Also, it is likely that many staff and patients smoke together outdoors, and informal but potentially therapeutic interactions might take place during these times. Future research should examine the impact of smoking bans on treatment outcomes and other outcomes important to facilities, including losing patients to other facilities and the potential loss of \"smoke-break\" contact between staff and patients. These adverse consequences should be weighed against the potential benefits of banning smoking. Minnesota chemical dependency staff felt that a total smoking ban could benefit facilities by protecting staff and patient health, improving air quality, strengthening the message that smoking is an addiction, and enhancing efforts to treat tobacco (Knapp et al., 1993). If adopting smoking bans influences only a few clinics to begin to treat nicotine dependence, or helps only a small proportion of patients quit smoking, then the benefit to the drug treatment population could still be large because so many patients smoke and smoking is so deadly. It may be that state- or federally mandated smoking bans would have the greatest impact and be the most welcome to treatment providers. Most states reimburse private and public facilities for providing drug treatment services. Reimbursement is contingent on adherence to guidelines and mandates. If smoking bans were mandatory, all facilities receiving reimbursement would have to comply. The playing field would be leveled and a major barrier-the fear of losing patient to facilities that permit smoking-would be removed. Total smoking bans at outpatient drug treatment facilities are ethically justifiable because patients are free to come and go at will and because these facilities exist to help people recover from drug dependence.

Objective: This study assessed test-retest reliability and criterion validity for an automated version of the Alcohol Use Disor\u00ad ders Identification Test (AUDIn, a screening tool for alcohol-related problems. Participants' willingness to use such a system to learn about and change their drinking behavior was also assessed. Method: Partici\u00ad pants were 202 callers recruited through newspaper ads and flyers ask\u00ad ing for volunteers concerned about their drinking and willing to help test a new method of screening and referral for alcohol problems. Par\u00ad ticipants were divided into two groups. The first group of subjects re\u00ad cruited received the Telephone-Linked Communications (TLC)-AUDIT twice, administered a week apart. The second group received the TLC\u00ad AUDIT once and a human-administered AUDIT once, also a week apart. Results: Test-retest reliability was assessed in 102 participants; the intraclass correlation of AUDIT scores between both administrations was .87; IC for nonproblem versus problem drinking (AUDIT score of 8 or above) was .89. The validity study compared the TLC-AUDlT scores of the next 100 participants to AUDIT questions administered by a hu\u00ad man interviewer.The intraclass correlation was .94; ICwas .75. Seventy\u00ad five percent of all participants who screened positive for problem drinking agreed they would \"talk to a computer again to learn more about your drinking pattern and how to deal with it.\" Conclusions: Au\u00ad tomated telephone technology can be used to administer the AUDIT in\u00ad strument with high levels of reliability and validity. This technology could be used to deliver behavioral change interventions. (J.

Reasons for not seeking help include believing that people should do it on their own, fear that others will find out, fear of being labeled alcoholic, or not being aware of having a problem (Grant, 1997; Higgins-Biddle et al., 1997). To reach these indi\u00ad viduals, emphasis has shifted to early detection and inter\u00ad vention in primary-care practices. However, few patients are screened or given care in these settings, in part because busy practitioners are not trained in screening and follow\u00ad up care (NIAAA, 2000). One way to improve screening is through the use of technologies designed for that purpose. Automated or com\u00ad puterized telephone systems can provide a low cost way to screen for alcohol problems. People access these systems Received: April 18. 2005.

It can provide access for people with poor reading skills or who speak languages other than English. Research has shown that automated sys\u00ad tems are perceived by callers as being more anonymous than therapists or other health professionals and that people tend to be more truthful when reporting on embarrassing or personal issues to a computer than compared with a human professional (Gerbert et al., 1999; Turner et al., 1998). Computerized assessment for alcohol problems has been shown to be reliable (Bernadt et al., 1989) but has prima\u00ad rily targeted people coming into specialty substance use treatment or research programs (Bernadt et aI., 1989; Mundt et al., 2002; Perrine et al., 1995). Automated telephone in\u00ad terviewing using interactive voice response technology has been used to track daily drinking in a research setting. These systems have shown good to excellent validity when com\u00ad pared with both objective and subjective measures, espe\u00ad cially for the heaviest drinkers (Mundt et al., 2002; Perrine et al., 1995; Searles et al., 1995). More recently, automated telephone interviewing has been compared favorably to tra\u00ad ditional paper methods for collecting data on drinking pat\u00ad terns and medication adherence (Kranzler et al., 2004) as well as alcohol-related expectancies (Collins et al., 2003). In this study, we developed and tested the reliability, validity, and user acceptance of an automated telephone version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a widely accepted screening tool for problem drinking. In addition, callers who screened positive for 454 455 RUBTNET AL. problem drinking were asked for their reactions to the sys\u00ad tem and whether they would be willing to use it to change their drinking behavior. Method Design and development ofthe automated A VDIT Telephone-Linked Communications (TLC), a set of com\u00ad puterized telephone technologies, was used to develop the program (Friedman et aI., 1997). The TLC-AUDIT pro\u00ad gram included the following sections in order of presenta\u00ad tion: (1) greeting, (2) purpose ofTLC-AUDIT, (3) assurance of confidentiality, (4) AUDIT questions, (5) feedback and interpretation of AUDIT results to participants, and (6) clos\u00ad ing and referral to the state hotline number for more infor\u00ad mation or treatment referral. For the purpose of this study, feedback and referral were general and standardized: Par\u00ad ticipants were told either they appeared to have or not have a drinking problem. All were told the screening was not definitive and were given the recommendation to call their health care provider or the state substance use information and referral line. Development of TLC-AUDIT required a multistep pro\u00ad cess that involved mapping out the steps in the interview, writing conversational dialogue for each step that mirrored what a human interviewer would say, writing the computer programs that control the interviewer's statements and rec\u00ad ognize the caller's verbal responses, creating the database for storing the users' responses, and having an actor record the interview scripts. Also, because this system used speech recognition, verbal responses that participants might give had to be anticipated so that the software could be \"trained\" to recognize these responses. This results in a more natural conversation than was possible with older technology, in which answers were \"communicated\" by pushing buttons on the telephone. Reviews of the program were conducted in three rounds: by the research team, by 13 alcohol counselors recruited for this purpose, and by a sample of 50 callers recruited to pilot test the program. These 50 callers were anonymously recruited by placing flyers around the medical campus. The responses of the 50 callers were examined for the caller's ability to understand and respond to the system and for the ability of the speech recognition software to understand the caller. Their names or other information were not recorded., and they were not compensated. After each round of re\u00ad view, interview dialogue was modified, and computer soft\u00ad ware was reprogrammed. Reliability and validity testing Participants. Most participants were recruited through ads placed in two metropolitan area newspapers. In an at\u00adtempt to reach all segments of the community, ads were also placed in nine smal1 local neighborhood papers and one student paper. Flyers were posted on campus, ads were placed on an online bulletin board, and information was faxed to community health centers. Recruitment for the study was completed in 8 months: the first 4 months for the reliability study and the second 4 months for the validity study. The ads invited individuals concerned about their drinking and who were willing to test a new method of screening and referral for alcohol problems to calla toll-freenumber.Theadsstatedthatparticipantswould receive feedback on their drinking patterns and referral for further information and treatment, if required, as well as a $10 gift certificate to McDonald's or a local supermarket chain. Respondents were contacted within 1 week of their ini\u00ad tial call and screened for the following eligibility criteria: (1) able to use a telephone unassisted, (2) able to speak English, and (3) be 18 years of age or older. The research interviewer explained that, as part of the study, all of their conversations with the computer or with the interviewer would be recorded. The interviewer then asked permission to start tape recording the call. If permission was given, the informed consent was read and discussed, and participant consent was recorded. A copy of the consent form was mailed to participants at a later date. Measure. TheAUDIT isa 10-itemalcohol-screeningtool developed and used by the World Health Organization (Babor et al., 1992) in multinational trials of brief interven\u00ad tions. The AUDIT has been shown to he generalizableacross cultural characteristics, demonstrating good sensitivity and specificity in many populations (Allen et al., 1997; Saunders et al., 1993). The AUDIT produces a total score from 0 to 40, with a score ~ 8 considered positive for problem drink\u00ad ing (Babor et al., 1992; Cherpitel, 1995). For female par\u00ad ticipants, Item 3 was modified to read \"5 or more drinks\" instead of \"6 or more drinks,\" based on currently accepted standards for alcohol consumption in women (NIAAA, 2000). Procedure. In both studies, the AUDIT was given twice to each participant, with approximately 1 week between administrations (mean [SD] = 8.0 [2.4] days). The scoring and feedback sections of the AUDIT were given after the second administration only, primarily to avoid influencing their responses and to provide incentive for participants to perform the retest. Participants were also asked for addi\u00ad tional information, including their willingness to use a simi\u00ad lar system for changing their drinking. In the reliability study, participants received the TLC-AUDIT both times. In the validity study, the human-administeredAUDIT was used as the \"gold standard\" comparison for the automated AU\u00ad DIT. The order of presentation of the two versions of the AUDIT was randomized to control for order effects. 456 JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL I MAY 2006 Analysis Test-retest reliability and criterion validity were exam\u00ad ined both for the total TLC-AUDIT score and for the di\u00ad chotomized score of screening positive for problem drinking. Reliability for the total score was described through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). An ICC above .80 is considered to represent strong agreement, and an ICC between .6 and .8 represents good agreement (Shrout and Fleiss, 1979). Reliability for a positive screen was described through kappa, which measures the agreement beyond chance between ratings on a categorical measure. A l( above .75 is generally considered excellent agreement, and a 1C between .40 and .75 is considered moderate to good agree\u00ad ment (Fleiss, 1981). Validity of the TLC-AUDIT compared with a live interviewer was also described through ICC and kappa statistics. Results Participants were 37.4 [13.7] years old on average. Forty\u00ad nine percent were male, 49% were employed, 69% were single, 45% smoked cigarettes, and 8% were in substance\u00ad use treatment. A total of 282 people left messages on the toll-free line. Forty-six participants who left messages were unable to be reached. Seventeen people declined the study, and six subjects were found to be ineligible. Of the 213 subjects who enrolled and completed the initial AUDIT ad\u00ad ministration, nine participants were lost to follow-up, and two subjects withdrew from the study, leaving 202 partici\u00ad pants: 102 in the reliability study and 100 in the validity study. Test-retest reliability evaluation On initial administration of the AUDIT, participants' scores ranged from 0 to 37, with a mean of 15.6 [9.7] and a 72.6% scoring in the problem drinking range. Scores on the second administration of the AUDIT ranged from 0 to 36, with a mean of 14.2 [9.2]; 70.6% of the participants scored in the problem drinking range. The ICC between both administrations of the TLC-AUDIT was .87. Kappa for the presence versus absence of problem drinking was .89. Criterion validity evaluation On initial administration of the AUDIT, participants' scores ranged from 0 to 40 with an overall mean of 15.5 [9.8]; 73% of the participants scored in the problem drink\u00ad ing range. The second administration of the AUDIT ranged from 0 to 36, with a mean of 13.8 [9.0]; 69% of the partici\u00ad pants scored in the problem drinking range. The ICC for TABLE 1. Percentage of agreement between human and Telephone-Linked Communications (TLC) administration of the Alcohol Use Disorders Iden\u00ad tification Test Human TLC Problem No problem Problem 68% 2% No problem 8% 22% scores between the TLC and human administrations of the AUDIT was .94; 1C for ratings of the presence or absence of problem drinking was .75. There were no significant differences in the classification of problem drinkers based on the order of method of administration of the AUDIT (e.g., TLC or human first). There was no difference in clas\u00ad sification of subjects as problem drinkers by TLC versus human for the first administration of AUDIT (X2 '= 0.87, 1 df,p = .35) or for the second Oe = 0.15,1 df,p = .69). The percentage agreement between human and TLC is shown in Table 1. Potential acceptance ofa TLC treatment program Participants (n = 148) who scored in the problem drink\u00ad ing range on the TLC-AUDIT were asked to consider what their goals and methods for changing their drinking behav\u00ad ior might be. Sixty-five percent of the subjects indicated that they would prefer to drink moderately rather than ab\u00ad stain. They were also asked., \"If you were to change your drinking habits, what type of help would you consider us\u00ad ing?\" Seven choices were listed, and they were asked to indicate whether they were willing to use each of them. Sixty percent of the participants stated that they would con\u00ad sider using a computer program for information and ad\u00ad vice, and 78% of the participants stated they would consider using a face-to-face counselor. However, when asked, \"If you could talk to the computer again to learn more about your drinking pattern and how to deal with it, would you do it?\", 75% of the participants said yes. Of that 75% (n = Ill), 83% were willing to make multiple calls, and 78% were willing to 00 some work in between calls, such as writing down how much they drank. Discussion The results of this study show that an automated tele\u00ad phone system with speech recognition capabilities can be used to administer the AUDIT with high levels of test\u00ad retest reliability and criterion validity. These results sug\u00ad gest that a system similar to this one could be offered to the public to provide low-cost anonymous screening for those with questions about their alcohol use. Inexpensive programs can be offered as anonymous learning tools by Public Health departments and Employee Assistance 457 RUBINET AI.. Programs. When used in health care settings, TLC-AUDIT could also enable health care professionals to focus on those who screen positive as well as allow for screening efforts with much greater reach than is possible with traditional methods. Another goal of this research was to assess the willing\u00ad ness of problem drinkers to use this technology as a self\u00ad help tool to change their behavior. Although these reports of willingness to utilize such a system may be biased some\u00ad what by social desirability, they were encouraging. Reported behavioral intention of utilizing an automated telephone sys\u00ad tem for problem drinking treatment was high (75%). The authors are currently developing an automated intervention for problem drinkers based on Behavioral Self-Control Training (Miller and Munoz, 2005) that will test the will\u00ad ingness of problem drinkers to utilize this methodology as well as measure its efficacy. The main limitation of this study is that independent verification of reports of alcohol use at the time of the interview was not collected. However, the AUDIT itself has been shown to measure drinking behavior accurately (Babor et al., 1992). It would also have been appropriate to compare human interviewer test-retest reliability with TLC reliability; however, we did not include that test in our design. It was puzzling to find that on the second administration of the AUDIT in both studies (whether given by TLC or human administration), average AUDIT scores dropped. This drop, although not significant, may have lowered the kappa in the validity study. Automated screening, education, and intervention pro\u00ad grams for alcohol problems show great promise for im\u00ad proving access to health information, identifying affected individuals, and disseminating empirically based self-help programs. Automated programs can also provide accurate assessment and intervention with total fidelity to manualized instructions, thus simplifying interpretation of results by decreasing error variance. Altogether, computer-based tele\u00ad phone screening for problem drinking could increase the proportion of people who are willing to be screened and increase the probability of intervention and treatment.

Copyright \u00a9 2005 Massachusetts Medical Society. A 32-year-old man has a three-month history of difficulty sleeping. On questioning, he mentions that he drinks four to six glasses of wine three to four times per week.How should his case be assessed and managed? Each year in the United States, 85,000 deaths, along with substantial disability frommedical and psychiatric consequences, injuries, and \"secondhand\" effects (e.g., motorvehicle crashes), are attributed to the use of alcohol. The estimated annual costs thatare attributable to alcohol use are $185 billion. 1,2 Unhealthy alcohol use covers a spec- trum that is associated with varying degrees of risk to health (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Theprevalence of unhealthy use is 7 to 20 percent or more among outpatients, 30 to 40 per- cent among patients in emergency departments, and 50 percent among patients with trauma. 11,12 Dependence (alcoholism) is best understood as a chronic disease, with peak onset by the age of 18. 13 Moderate (i.e., less than risky) use of alcohol may be beneficial, but what constitutes \"moderate\" depends on age, sex, genetic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and otherfactors. Observational studies indicate that for men under the age of 34 years and womenunder the age of 45 years, those who report no alcohol intake have the lowest mortality.Above these age cutoffs, weekly intakes of no more than five drinks for men or twodrinks for women are associated with the lowest mortality. 14 The balance of harm (an increased risk of liver disease, motor vehicle crashes, hypertension, hemorrhagic stroke,and some cancers) and benefit (a reduced risk of ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke) determines these amounts. identification Patients with unhealthy alcohol use often present either asymptomatically, with early-stage problems, or with problems that are not recognized as being alcohol-related. Alladults should be screened with a validated survey instrument such as the CAGE question-naire (where each of the letters in the acronym refers to one of the questions) or theAlcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) 11 (Table 2 and the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). The CAGE ques-tionnaire is brief but was designed primarily to detect dependence. The AUDIT question-naire is long but detects the spectrum of unhealthy drinking. Asking questions aboutconsumption (AUDIT questions 1 to 3, question 3 alone, or questions about per-occasiondrinking) with or without use of the CAGE questionnaire is a less well validated ap-proach that directly determines the degree of risky drinking. 3,15-17 There may be ad- vantages (including increased truthfulness of patients and efficiency) to embeddingthe clinical problem strategies and evidence The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at BOSTON UNIVERSITY on August 5, 2011.

A standard drink is approximately 12 to 14 g of ethanol, which corresponds to 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of 80- proof liquor. The thresholds in the table do not apply to children, adolescents, or pregnant women; to persons taking med- ication that interacts with alcohol or engaging in activities that require attention, skill, or coordination (e.g., driving); o r those with medical conditions that may be affected by alcohol (e.g., gastritis or hepatitis C). For all these groups, the healt h- iest choice is generally abstinence. The term \"binge drinking\" is sometimes used to mean heavy use that is prolonged (>1 day), with cessation of usual activities. It is also used to refer to consumption that exceeds the specified limits per occasio n. Because the definition of problem drinking varies among studies, estimates of the prevalence also vary. Table 1. Definitions of Unhealthy Alcohol Use.* Category of Use Prevalence Definition and Features % Risky use 30 For women and persons >65 years of age, >7 standard drinks per week or >3 drinks per occasion; for men 65 years of age, >14 standard drinks per week or >4 drinks per occasion; there are no alcohol-related consequences, but the risk of future physical, psychological, or social harm increases with increasing levels of consumption; risks associated with exceeding the amounts per occasion that constitute \"binge\" drinking in the short term include injury and trauma; risks associated with exceeding weekly amounts in the long term include cirrhosis, cancer, and other chronic illnesses; \"risky use\" is sometimes used to refer to the spectrum of unhealthy use but usually excludes dependence; one third of patients in this category are at risk for dependence Problem drinking Varies Use of alcohol accompanied by alcohol-related consequences but not meeting ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria; sometimes used to refer to the spectrum of unhealthy use but usually excludes dependence Alcohol abuse, harmful use 5 In DSM-IV, recurrence of the following clinically significant impairments within 12 months: failure to fulfill major role obligations, use in hazardous situations, alcohol-related legal problems, or social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by alcohol; in ICD-10, physical or mental health consequences only Alcohol dependence,alcoholism4 In DSM-IV, clinically significant impairment or distress in the presence of three or more of the following: tolerance; withdrawal; a great deal of time spent obtaining alcohol, using alcohol, or recovering from its effects; reducing or giving up important activities be-cause of alcohol; drinking more or longer than intended; a persistent desire or unsuc-cessful efforts to cut down or control use; continued use despite having a physical or psychological problem caused or exacerbated by alcohol; in ICD-10, similar definition screening for alcohol use in interviews about oth- er health issues, but stand-alone screening is the best-studied approach. 11 The possibility of unhealthy alcohol use should be routinely considered in patients with hyperten-sion (especially if the condition is difficult to treat), depression, insomnia, abnormal liver-enzyme lev-els, heartburn, anemia, thrombocytopenia, injury,or problems in social life or at work (e.g., missedwork due to hangovers). 18 Approximately half of all cases of cirrhosis, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis, and cancers of the esophagus, larynx, and mouth are attributable to alcohol. 2 assessment and diagnosis Standardized interviews can diagnose alcohol abuse and dependence. Patients should be asked whetherthey have symptoms of alcohol-use disorders inorder to determine the diagnosis, the severity of theproblem, and the steps that should be taken to ad-dress it (Table 1). The assessment should identifycommon coexisting conditions and situations inwhich even a moderate amount of alcohol can beharmful, such as pregnancy; the use of medica-tions that can interact with alcohol; the use ofalcohol before situations that require attention,coordination, or skill (e.g., driving); a family his-tory of alcoholism; and the presence of cirrhosis,depression, anxiety, 19 personality disorders (par- ticularly antisocial and histrionic personality), 20 or other conditions that are potentially exacerbat-ed by alcohol. 3 intervention Detoxification Among patients who consume approximately 20standard alcoholic drinks per day, symptomaticwithdrawal is likely with abstinence 21 ; however, reported consumption is an imperfect predictor ofsymptoms associated with withdrawal. Withdraw-al can lead to seizures, delirium tremens, or death.However, most often it is mild and easily managed.

Brief Intervention \"Brief intervention\" generally refers to 10 to 15 minutes of counseling, with feedback about drink- ing, advice and goal setting, and follow-up contact(one or more discussions lasting 10 to 15 minuteswith a clinician) (Table 4). Randomized trials indiverse settings (e.g., primary care facilities, emer-gency departments, hospitals, and colleges) havedemonstrated that such brief interventions can de-crease drinking and its consequences at six-monthfollow-up or later, with a reduction of 10.5 percentin the prevalence of risky drinking and a reduc-tion in the intake of alcohol of three to nine drinksper week, as compared with no intervention. 4,26,27 Single five-minute contacts appear to be less effec- tive. When such a strategy is used with patients whoare not seeking treatment, efficacy is limited to thosewithout alcohol dependence. 26 One randomized trial compared the result of being given a booklet about general health topics(control group) with that of receiving a typical briefintervention (two discussions with a primary carephysician, followed by two telephone calls from anurse). 28 At one year, the brief intervention had led to greater reductions in self-reported drinking (from19 to 12 drinks per week, vs. a reduction from 19 to16 drinks per week in the control group) and in binges (from six to three binges, vs. a reduction from five to four binges per month among the con- trols). At three to four years, the intervention groupwas less likely to be engaged in risky drinking (prev-alence, 23 percent, vs. 35 percent in the controlgroup) and had spent fewer days in the hospital andhad lower associated costs (a difference of $7,780per patient) \u2014 all significant differences as com-pared with the control group. There were also few-er deaths in the intervention group (three, vs. sevenamong the controls), although this difference wasnot statistically significant. Another study assessed the long-term effects of a brief intervention among middle-aged male drink- Figure 1. The Spectrum of Alcohol Use. The spectrum of alcohol use extends from abstinence and low-risk use (the most common patterns of alcohol use) to risky use, problem drinking, harmful use and alcohol abuse, and the less common but more severe alcoholism and alcohol dependence. 10 Consumption and the severity of consequences increase from low-risk use through depen- dence. The areas of the pyramid reflect the approximate prevalence of each category. Clinicians and public health prac-titioners should be most concerned with the categories in the shaded upper portions of the pyramid (representing unhealthy alcohol use).

The intervention con- sisted of a monthly visit with a nurse and a quarterlyvisit with a physician for 18 to 48 months, includingfeedback regarding the importance of the patient's g -glutamyltransferase levels and advice that the pa- tient should restrict the use of alcohol. At the 16-yearfollow-up, alcohol-related mortality was lower inthe group that received the intervention than in agroup of patients who simply received a letter in-forming them of the results of the blood test and ad- vising a 2-year follow-up (4 percent vs. 7 percent). 29 Brief interventions should include counseling patients about setting a goal for a reduction in al- cohol consumption and ways to achieve that goal (Table 4). Interventions may be effective regard-less of a patient's readiness to change, but under- standing the patient's perception of the problemand whether he or she is ready for change is consid-ered to be important. Motivational-interviewingapproaches (which emphasize empathic listeningand the autonomy of patients in their own decisionmaking and encourage people to identify their ownreasons for change) have been shown to be moreeffective in reducing drinking than confrontationalcounseling (which imposes on the patient the cli-nician's view of the problem, minimizes the pa-tient's perspective, and forces the patient to admitto having a problem). 30 Treatment for Dependence Data from observational and clinical studies indi-cate that with treatment for alcohol dependence (be-havioral or pharmacologic), two thirds of patientshave a reduction in the consequences of alcoholconsumption (e.g., alcohol-related injury or jobloss) and the amount of consumption (by more than50 percent) after one year; one third of patients whoare treated are either abstinent or drink moderatelywithout consequences. 31 All patients with alcohol dependence should be offered treatment. Con-trolled studies that have compared the results ofrecommendations by physicians that patients cutdown their alcohol consumption with those of rec-ommendations that patients abstain did not finddifferences in drinking outcomes, 32 and no more than 11 percent of people with alcohol dependenceachieved controlled drinking in the long term. 33 Patients with alcohol dependence who are not readyto begin treatment may still benefit from referral toa specialist for confirmation of the diagnosis andrecommendations. Counseling Effective treatment for alcohol dependence can beprovided in the outpatient setting. Patients who havelittle social support, who have environments thatare not supportive of recovery, or who have complexcoexisting medical or psychiatric illnesses may needto be removed from environments in which alcoholis likely to be used. 34 Cognitive behavioral therapy, 12-step facilita- tion, and motivational-enhancement therapy (inweekly sessions) are effective treatments that aredetailed in written guides for therapists. 35 Cogni- tive behavioral therapy emphasizes the learningof skills to cope with situations that precipitateheavy drinking. 36 Twelve-step facilitation empha- sizes the con cept of alcoholism as a disease and ac- tive involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). 37 Motivational-enhancement therapy is motivationalinterviewing as outlined in written guides. 38 A large clinical trial that randomly assigned patients withalcohol dependence to these treatments showedthat they had similar efficacy. At the one-year follow-up, abstinence was reported on 85 percent of daysin all three groups on average, as compared with 20to 30 percent of days at the time the study began;at three years, two thirds of the patients were absti-nent. In addition, in all groups the proportions ofpatients who had a relapse of heavy drinking, de-pression, alcohol-related problems, and other druguse were reduced, as were liver-enzyme levels. Self-Help Publications outlining self-help strategies to de-crease drinking on the basis of the principles of cog-nitive behavioral therapy also have proven efficacy.In a randomized trial that compared the results ofgroup or individual sessions designed to encourageself-control with the results of use of a book outlin-ing the same principles, alcohol consumption wassimilarly reduced in the two groups at 12 months. 39 In another randomized trial, the consumption ofalcohol above recommended limits was significant-ly less frequent at the six-month follow-up amongdrinkers who received a self-help manual, as com-pared with those who received a booklet with gen-eral information and advice (53 percent vs. 78 per-cent, respectively). 40 Mutual Help AA is a fellowship that provides support, at nocharge, for people who want to stop drinking.

Evidence for the effectiveness of AA comes pri- marily from observational studies of individual andgroup counseling based on 12-step principles 35,41 and of AA involvement. 42 Follow-up of military vet- erans revealed a higher frequency of abstinence at12 months among those participating in 12-stepprograms than among those participating in pro-grams with a cognitive behavioral orientation (26 percent vs. 19 percent). 41 Participation in AA (by at- tending meetings and having a sponsor) has beenassociated with increased rates of abstinence sevenmonths after inpatient treatment, as compared withnonparticipation. 42 However, AA may be inferior to inpatient treatment. In a randomized trial com-paring these two approaches among persons withalcohol-use disorders, hospitalization in the sub-sequent year was significantly less common among Table 2.

AA supportsthe use of medications for alcohol dependence (asdescribed below), but some members may disap-prove of such a strategy. Meeting types vary (e.g.,closed or open and with smoking permitted ornot), and schedules are available locally (www.alcoholics-a nonymous.org). 25 Al-Anon, Alateen (for teenagers), and Adult Chil- dren of Alcoholics can help family and friends un-derstand alcoholism and not feel responsible for theillness. In a study in which \"concerned significantothers\" were randomly assigned to participate invarious strategies to engage problem drinkers intreatment (one being an approach based on Al-Anon), all strategies led to improvements in the * Cutoff scores with reasonable sensitivity and specificity for unhealthy alcohol use are as follows: CAGE, one or two posi- tive responses (sensitivity, 53 to 92 percent; specificity, 81 to 95 percent); AUDIT, score of 8 or more (sensitivity, 51 to 97 percent; specificity, 78 to 96 percent); AUDIT-C (first three questions, about consumption), score of 4 or more (sensitiv- ity, 86 percent; specificity, 72 percent); AUDIT question 3 (\"How often do you have 6 or more drinks on one occasion?\"), score of 1 or more (sensitivity, 77 percent; specificity, 83 percent); screening question about per-occasion consumption, \"in the past three months\" (sensitivity, 62 to 86 percent; specificity, 86 to 93 percent) (see Supplementary Appendix). The CAGE and consumption screening questions can be used in combination; this seven-question test is considered posi-tive if the results exceed either the cutoffs for \"risky drinking\" or there is an affirmative answer to any of the CAGE ques-tions (sensitivity, 83 percent; specificity, 84 percent). Laboratory tests (e.g., levels of g -glutamyltransferase [sensitivity, 65 percent] and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin [sensitivity, 60 percent]) are not more sensitive than are validated screening questionnaires and need to be followed by questions about alcohol use. As such, the tests have unknown in-cremental value. Questions regarding consumption and an additional interview are required to assess patients whose results on the screening tests are positive to identify the amounts and consequences of risky drinking. A standard drink is approximately 12 to 14 g of ethanol, which corresponds to 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of 80-proof liquor. Table 2. (Continued.)

Patients may need additional assistance if their goal is not achieved. Patients who are pregnant or trying to conceive, who ha ve a medical con- dition that would be worsened by drinking, or who are taking a medication that interacts with alcohol should be advised to abst ain. Discus- sions about alcohol use with patients who report no current consequences of drinking are analogous to discussions about other r isk factors (e.g., hypercholesterolemia and physical inactivity). Some generalist physicians who have expertise, availability, and adequate office support may choose to provide treatment rathe r than refer the patient to a specialist. Many patients will not be ready for referral. In such cases, a reasonable option would be brief counse ling to help the pa- tient abstain or, if the patient declines, to reduce consumption, with a follow-up session to assess progress. This is a reason able option that provides information for both the patient and the physician about what intervention will be required. \u00a7 Assistance that is commonly available by referral includes outpatient and inpatient detoxification, mutual-help groups (Alcoho lics Anonymous and alternatives such as Self-Management and Recovery Training [SMART], Secular Organizations for Sobriety, Moderation Manageme nt, Rational Recovery, and Women for Sobriety [links available at www.mentalhelp.net/selfhelp]), 24 mutual help for relatives (Al-Anon, Alateen, and Adult Children of Alcoholics), outpatient counseling, inpatient treatment (including counseling, mutual help, and a sober e nvironment for persons with coexisting illnesses or those for whom outpatient treatment is not successful), and sober living environments. \u00b6More information on this topic is available in Friedmann et al. 25 Table 4. Brief Counseling and Referral.* How to Advise or Refer Patients Examples or Explanations Elicit information about how the patient views the problem. \"What do you think about your drinking? Are you ready to make a change in your alcohol use? How confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to?\" Express concern and provide clear advice regarding the ideal goal (absti- nence or reduced consumption for those with nondependent alcohol use, achieved through brief counseling; abstinence for patients with alcohol dependence).\"I am concerned about your drinking; my medical advice is that the healthiest choice for you is to cut down or abstain.\" Provide specific feedback about alcohol consumption in comparison with population norms, and link existing problems to alcohol use when appropriate, to make information relevant to the patient.\"Ninety-three percent of adults drink less than the amounts you report drinking. You mentioned your heartburn is worse when you drink. Alcohol is probably causing your heartburn.\" Express empathy, let the patient know you believe that change is possi- ble, and acknowledge that it is the patient's responsibility to change.\"The fact you were able to quit before for a week tells me you can do it again. But it must be difficult. It is up to you to make these changes.\" When the patient expresses interest or gives permission, provide infor- mation, including a menu of options, about how to change.\"Would you like information on how to cut down or abstain? Oth- er people have found a range of options helpful, such as keep-ing a drinking diary, counseling, and mutual-help groups. What do you think about these?\" Anticipate and discuss situations in which the patient feels at risk for drinking excessively, and talk about strategies to avoid drinking excessively.\"What ways might help you avoid drinking excessively when you go out with friends who drink?\" Have the patient keep a drink-ing diary (including the number of drinks consumed per day). Schedule a follow-up session to assess drinking and changes in alcohol use.\"Please think about your drinking and the health risks we dis- cussed; contact me if you decide you would like assistance in the future. Let's schedule a follow-up visit in a month to talk again.\" In the follow-up, review the drinking goal, the actual drinking history, and any consequences since the last visit. If the serum levels of g -glutamyltransferase or carbohydrate- deficient transferrin were initially abnormal, monitor levels. For patients who are not ready to change their alcohol use, advice about changing their habits or getting help is counterproductive because the patient will enumerate the reasons against change; avoid con-frontation and argument. Elicit the patient's own reasons for drinking, reasons for not drinking, and concerns about changing.\"What do you like about drinking? What do you like to drink? What are some problems you have noticed when or after you drink? What would it be like not to drink?\" For patients with alcohol dependence, provide brief counseling with the goal of increasing motivation to change; the recommended change is abstinence and linkage with any or all known effective interven-tions (mutual-help groups, pharmacotherapy, and counseling).Consider referral to a specialist (a physician who specializes in addiction medicine or an alcoholism-treatment provider) for evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis, even if the pa-tient is not ready to begin treatment. Know local referral options, such as health plan referral services, pub- lic treatment resources, physicians, other counselors, employee-assistance programs, and national resources (in the United States, http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov); know what patients can expect when they seek assistance.\u00a7Help the patient take the first step (e.g., make an appointment); follow up on treatment entry and engagement.

Information regarding mechanisms,dosing, and side effects is summarized in Table 3. 45,46 A meta-analysis showed that in placebo- controlled, randomized trials of a short duration (three months or less), naltrexone decreased the riskof a return to heavy drinking from 48 percent to 37percent, and decreased drinking days by 4.5 per-cent; the proportion of patients who were abstinentwas higher with naltrexone (35 percent, vs. 30 per-cent with placebo), but this finding was of border-line significance. 46 In one study, 47 even though the decrease in the proportion of patients who had arelapse with naltrexone was not significant (oddsratio, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to1.08), the point estimate was consistent with thoseof other studies. 46 In addition, this study includ- ed a severely affected population that may have re-quired more intensive therapy (male veterans with long-standing alcoholism, most not married andmany disabled). A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials lasting 3 to 24 months showed that acamprosateincreased the proportion of patients who were ab-stinent (from 15 percent to 23 percent). 46 In a single- blind, 12-month study comparing naltrexone withacamprosate, the percentage of patients who report-ed no heavy drinking was higher with naltrexonethan with acamprosate (41 percent vs. 17 percent).For the most recent six months, abstinence was re-ported by 54 percent and 27 percent, respectively,and percentages of days with heavy drinking were33 percent and 53 percent, respectively. 46 Another trial comparing the combination of the drugs witheither drug alone found the combination to be assafe and more effective. 48 Most efficacy studies of naltrexone and acamprosate have required detoxi-fication first, 46 but two controlled trials found nal- trexone to be effective even when patients were notabstinent before starting to take the medication. 46,49 Controlled studies suggest that disulfiram can decrease the number of drinking days. 45 In small, controlled studies, administration of disulfiram un-der the supervision of another person improved ab-stinence as compared with unsupervised use. 50 In a six-month controlled trial (in which supervised ad-ministration of vitamin C was used as the control),supervised administration of disulfiram resulted ina greater increase in the number of abstinent days. 51 Abstinence is required before disulfiram therapy isstarted. Counseling should be provided with pharmaco- therapy, and primary care management is at leastas effective as cognitive behavioral therapy whencombined with pharmacotherapy. Primary caremanagement, as tested in randomized trials, in-cludes review of the patient's medical and alcohol- use history; development of a treatment plan withthe patient; review of advice, medication issues, andgoals for follow-up; referral to AA; and a follow-upsession of 15 to 20 minutes every one to two weekswith a physician, nurse practitioner, or physicianassistant to discuss adherence to the drug regimen,alcohol use, and any adverse effects of the drugregimen. 52 Pharmacotherapy for Coexisting Psychiatric Conditions Although a detailed review of the treatment of co- existing psychiatric illnesses is beyond the scope ofthis article, data from randomized trials suggestthat pharmacotherapy with antidepressant or an-xiolytic agents can decrease alcohol consumption.Increased time to a resumption of heavy drinkinghas been reported in a study of patients with coex-isting anxiety who were treated with buspirone 53 and in a study of patients with a coexisting majordepression who were treated with desipramine 54 or fluoxetine. 55 The selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors citalopram (Celexa) and fluvoxamine(Luvox) have also been reported to increase the pro- portion of patients who are abstinent among those who do not have depression. 56 Although screening for unhealthy alcohol use isroutinely recommended, there are limited data thatshow improvements in clinical outcomes after im-plementation of screening. Despite good evidenceto support brief intervention, some observers havequestioned its effectiveness and value in practice. 27 Limited data suggest that brief interventions havebenefits beyond decreased consumption and areareas of uncertainty The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org at BOSTON UNIVERSITY on August 5, 2011.

Promising strategies, such as additional brief counseling sessions for nondependent, unhealthydrinkers and treatment either with medications indoses as needed for craving 49,58 or with more than one medication, require study. The role of newmedications for treating alcohol dependence \u2014 in-cluding ondansetron, 59 topiramate, 60 and depot preparations of naltrexone 61 \u2014 remains unclear. Data are limited to guide decisions regarding the type of therapy, the necessary duration and timing oftreatments in relation to detoxification, 46,49 man- agement in the context of other drug use, and the use of less sedating medications to manage withdrawal. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recom- mends routine screening for unhealthy alcohol use with the use of the AUDIT or CAGE questionnairesin primary care settings. The group also recom-mends brief counseling interventions in primarycare settings to reduce alcohol misuse and referral to specialty treatment for those with alcohol depen-dence. 5 The American Society of Addiction Medi- cine recommends the administration of benzodiaz-epines for the management of alcohol withdrawaland has published criteria for recommending spe-cialty care. 22,34 Unhealthy alcohol use can and should be identifiedwith the use of questions validated for this purpose(the AUDIT or CAGE questionnaires or validatedquestions about alcohol consumption). Askingquestions in a matter-of-fact way in the context ofthe general health history can facilitate discussionof what can be a sensitive topic. For the patient whowas described in the vignette, the consumption ofalcohol \u2014 both per occasion and per week \u2014 pos-es health risks; his sleep disturbance may well berelated to his drinking. The patient should be as-sessed for additional consequences (e.g., depres-sion and hypertension) and symptoms of depen- dence. Brief counseling should be provided; thecounselor should make explicit the relationship be-tween drinking and health consequences, assessthe patient's readiness to change, advise him to cut down on alcohol consumption (for nondependentuse) or to abstain and obtain specialized treatment(for dependent use), negotiate a plan for reducingconsumption, and follow up (at least once and asneeded thereafter). After detoxification, all patients with alcohol de- pendence should receive treatment from someonewith expertise in the field. That treatment shouldinclude medication and counseling (on the basis oflocal availability but favoring a reproducible, testedapproach), participation in AA, and weekly follow-up for a month with decreasing frequency there-after to assess drinking, consequences, medicationuse, counseling, and participation in AA. Either nal-trexone or acamprosate is first-line therapy; nal-trexone is the better choice if the patient has not ab-stained from drinking for at least three to five days.Disulfiram is an alternative that works best whendosing is supervised.

Design We studied a prospective cohort of adults enrolled in a randomized trial to improve linkage with primary medical care. Methods Subjects at a residential detoxication unit with alcohol, heroin or cocaine as a substance of choice, and no primary medical care were enrolled.Receipt of primary medical care was assessed over 2 years. Outcomes included (1) alcohol severity , (2) drug severity and (3) any substance use. Findings For the 391 subjects, receipt of primary care ( 2 visits) was associ- ated with a lower odds of drug use or alcohol intoxication (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.45, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.29-0.69, 2 d.f. c 2 P = 0.002). For 248 subjects with alcohol as a substance of choice, alcohol severity was lower inthose who received primary care [predicted mean Addiction Severity Index(ASI) alcohol scores for those reporting 2, 1 and 0 visits, respectively , 0.30, 0.26 and 0.34, P = 0.04]. For 300 subjects with heroin or cocaine as a sub- stance of choice, drug severity was lower in those who received primary care(predicted mean ASI drug scores for those reporting 2, 1 and 0 visits, respec- tively , 0.13, 0.15 and 0.16, P = 0.01). Conclusions Receipt of primary medical care is associated with improved addiction severity . These results support efforts to link patients with addictionsto primary medical care services. KEYWORDS Health services, primary care, severity of illness, substance abuse. INTRODUCTION Alcohol and drug abuse cost the United States $328 bil- lion a year, more than heart disease or cancer [1-3]. Ef-cacious treatments for adults with addictions exist, yetmany do not seek treatment [4,5]. Those seeking treat-ment may nd barriers such as limited access and unco-ordinated systems of care [6]. Thus, most patients whoundergo detoxication do not link with addiction treat-ment to prevent relapse of this chronic illness [7].There is great potential benet to patients and provid- ers for linking the addiction specialty treatment systemwith primary medical care [6]. Proven effective interven-tions for alcohol and drug problems can be delivered inprimary care settings, such as screening, brief interven-tion and referral, relapse prevention and coordination ofmultiple specialty services (e.g. mental health, substance abuse, medical and social services) [6,8,9]; yet these sys- tems of care typically remain unlinked and potential ben-ets do not accrue. Primary medical care and addiction severity 71 \u00a9 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction, 100 , 70-78 Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated that integrating primary medical care and addiction treat-ment realizes actual benets, in particular for addictionoutcomes [10,11]. While these studies of on-site caresuggest benet they are not conclusive, and furthermorethey address a system of care that is currently not widelyavailable, nor likely to be in the future given that it would require major changes in our health-care delivery systems. Linkage of patients with addictions to primary care as it currently exists (in a distributive system of linkage/integration [12]) holds the promise of impact on addic-tion outcomes. Less impact might be expected from a dis-tributive system than of a primary care intervention at anaddiction treatment program, although distributive link-age, by using existing systems of care, would also proba- bly be less costly . With tailored interventions, patientswith addictions who do not have regular medical carecan be linked successfully with primary care from theaddiction treatment system [13]. Despite the promise ofbenets, the clinical impact of this linkage model with pri-mary care in the community remains largely unknown.As a clinical trial randomizing adults to receive or notreceive primary care is unlikely to be conducted, weassessed the impact of receipt of primary medical care onaddiction severity and substance use in a prospectivecohort of subjects with no primary medical care. METHODS Subjects and design Subjects were participants in a study of a multi-disciplin- ary assessment and brief motivational intervention tolink adults with addictions in a residential detoxicationunit, who had no primary care physician, with primarymedical care. The details of the randomized trial havebeen published [13]. Briefly , after the acute symptoms ofwithdrawal had resolved, eligible subjects were enrolledand provided written informed consent. Eligible subjectswere adults who spoke Spanish or English, reported alco- hol, heroin or cocaine as their rst or second drug ofchoice, and resided in proximity to the primary care clinicto which they would be referred, or were homeless.Patients with established primary care relationships they planned to continue, signicant dementia, specic plansto leave the Boston area that would prevent research par-ticipation, failure to provide contact information fortracking purposes, or pregnancy were excluded. The clin-ical trial intervention was associated signicantly withincreased primary care linkage [13]. However, a substan-tial proportion of intervention subjects did not link withprimary care (31%); and a substantial proportion ofcontrol subjects did link (53%) during the rst 12 months of follow-up. Thus, the clinical trial intention-to-treatanalysis was not informative regarding the impact of pri-mary medical care on clinical outcomes. This report isnot the 'treatment received' analysis of that randomizedtrial; rather, this prospective study focuses on the impactof exposure to what was the outcome (i.e. receipt of pri-mary medical care) of the clinical trial and takes advan-tage of the prospective data collection. Subjects were interviewed at baseline during their detoxication stay and completed up to 4 bi-annualfollow-up interviews over 2 years. The current study wasrestricted to a prospectively enrolled and followed cohortof these trial participants who completed at least one offour scheduled research follow-up encounters, 85%(400/468) of those enrolled in the trial and alive at rstfollow-up opportunity . There were no statistically signi-cant differences in subject characteristics listed belowbetween those who entered the trial and completed ver-sus those who did not complete any research follow-upobservations except for race. Of those with follow-up,54% were white but of those lost, 34% were white. TheInstitutional Review Board of Boston University MedicalCenter approved this study . Additional privacy protec-tion was secured by the issuance of a Certicate of Con-dentiality by the Department of Health and HumanServices. Assessments After initial resolution of the symptoms of acute with- drawal, trained research associates interviewed subjectsat the detoxication unit. Assessments included: demo- graphics, substance of choice, substances used and addic- tion severity [Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcohol readiness to changesubstance use [using the Stages of Change Readiness andTreatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES 8AOD)] [16],health-related quality of life [Short Form Health Survey(SF-36)] [17], self-report of attendance at mutual helpgroups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, and questions regarding primary medical care [13]. Except for demo-graphics, all the assessments were repeated at follow-up interviews. At follow-up interviews, alcohol breath testswere performed to encourage truth telling [18]. Receipt of primary medical care was assessed during follow-up interviews using the following questions: 'Isthere one particular doctor that you consider to be yourregular personal doctor?'; 'Have you seen any doctors inthe last 6 months (or since your last interview)?' If theydid not report having a regular personal doctor but hadseen a physician, they were asked: 'Would you call or goto one of these/this doctor(s) if you had a medical problem \u00a9 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction, 100 , 70-78 72 Richard Saitz et al. that was not an emergency?'; 'Do you think one of these doctors could be your regular doctor?'. Subjects reportingeither having or possibly having a regular personaldoctor or that they would contact the doctor for non-emergent problems were asked 'What type of doctor isyour regular personal/this doctor?' While we could not assess directly the validity of self- report, we did compare self-report with administrativedata sources. Computerized databases of patients seen forprimary medical care at Boston Medical Center (BMC) orby Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program were queried for visits by study subjects during a 12-monthperiod following study enrollment. This databaseincluded all visits to the two BMC-based primary carepractices ( > 120 physicians and > 70 000 visits per year), and all visits to primary health-care delivery sites for thehomeless at BMC or in a city-wide network for the home-less. While subjects in the randomized trial interventiongroup were usually referred to care at BMC, all subjects in the cohort could pursue primary medical care anywhere.These administrative data were obtained for 95% of studysubjects. Among subjects with any self-report data thatwere determined by administrative data to have linked, 81% (103/127) reported linkage (kappa = 0.41). We also identied 100% of study subjects by means of substance abuse treatment utilization data obtained fromthe Treatment Management Information System, whichis maintained by the Massachusetts Department of PublicHealth (DPH) Bureau of Substance Abuse Services(BSAS). These data were provided under an agreementbetween Boston Medical Center and the BSAS. This dataset includes all episodes of substance abuse treatment uti-lization that occur at programs receiving state fundingfor addiction treatment, regardless of whether a particu-lar treatment episode was paid for by the state. Treatmentutilization was assessed for 6 months prior to studyenrollment and 24 months afterwards. Predictor variables The main predictor variable was receipt of primary med- ical care. Receipt of primary care since the last researchcontact was dened as a visit to a primary care physician,nurse practitioner or physician assistant reported at a fol- low-up interview . For the visit to be dened as primarycare, the subject had to report having a 'regular personaldoctor', that they would call that doctor for a non-emer-gent issue or that they saw a doctor who 'could be their regular personal doctor'. In addition, that clinician hadto be in a specialty that could be considered primary care,including obstetrics and gynecology , family medicine,pediatrics, adolescent medicine, internal medicine, AIDSdoctor, asthma doctor, pulmonary doctor, cardiologist ora gastroenterologist. When the specialty was unknown tothe subject or was a specialty other than those specically queried, the physician's ofce was contacted to determinethe specialty . Examples of specialties that were classiedas non-primary care clinicians were podiatrists, emer-gency medicine physicians and psychiatrists. Because of its right-skewed distribution, we categorized primary carereceipt for analyses as 0, 1 or 2 or more visits to avoidundue influence of outliers on the analysis. For a second-ary sensitivity analysis to explore further dose-response,primary care receipt was categorized as a variable witheight levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 or more visits). Additional predictor variables of interest included the following: demographics, homelessness (dened as one ormore nights in a shelter or on the street in the preceding6 months), addiction severity (the alcohol and drug ASIscores at study entry), attendance at mutual help meet-ings, the physical and mental component summaryscores derived from the SF-36 [19] and the Taking Stepsscale score from the SOCRATES. Substance abuse treat-ment utilization was a dichotomous variable of interest.This treatment variable represented any treatment, notknown effective doses. The following BSAS services wereconsidered treatment: transitional support services,recovery homes, therapeutic communities, supportivehousing, residential treatment, family substance abuseshelters, day treatment, out-patient substance abusecounseling, methadone treatment, community-basedcase management, acupuncture, intensive out-patienttreatment and postdetox recovery programs [20]. Outcome variables Addiction severity was the primary outcome of interest. The alcohol and drug ASI composite scores (ranging from0 to 1), and any drug use or alcohol use to intoxication(or more than three drinks in a day) (a dichotomous vari-able) were the main outcome variables. This latter vari- able was based on questions on substance use in the ASI, regarding the most recent 30 days. A secondary analysis was conducted using substance- related problems as the dependent variable, as measuredusing the InDUC-2R covering a 6-month time frame(score range 0-135 [21], median of 73 observed previ-ously for men entering drug abuse treatment [15]). Sub-stance abuse treatment utilization (described above) wasan additional outcome variable of interest, as a possiblemeasure of impact of primary care linkage. Subject characteristics Of the 400 subjects eligible for this prospective cohort study , nine did not have complete data and wereexcluded. All subjects were interviewed at study entry; an additional 975 interviews occurred during the 2 years Primary medical care and addiction severity 73 \u00a9 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction, 100 , 70-78 after the initial interview . Of the nine subjects excluded, one was missing addiction outcome measures, ve weremissing addiction severity measures at study entry andthree were missing homelessness, insurance and health-related quality of life data (as they completed abbreviatedfollow-up interviews that did not reassess these items).None were missing primary care receipt information. Subject characteristics were similar regardless of drug of choice. Of the 391 subjects, 76% were male, mean agewas 36, 50% were African American, 9% Hispanic and 60% had no health insurance; 57% of subjects with alco-hol as a drug of choice were homeless, 43% of subjectswith another drug as a substance of choice were home-less. The mean SF-36 Physical Component Summary(PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scoreswere 48 and 31, respectively (the mean MCS and PCS score for the US population is 50; 89% of adults with MCSscores of 30-34 screen positive for depression [19]). Themean ASI alcohol and drug scores were 0.47 and 0.26,respectively (these ASI scores are similar to those of indi-viduals entering the public treatment system in Bostonand more severe than those in a clinical addiction treat-ment sample in an HMO in California [22,23]). Subjectsreporting alcohol as a drug of choice had a higher meanASI alcohol score (0.66, SD 0.25); subjects reportinganother drug as a substance of choice had a higher meanASI drug score (0.31, SD 0.10). The mean Taking Stepsscale score reflecting greater readiness to address addic-tion problems with higher scores was 36 (the possiblerange of this readiness assessment measure is 8-40 with a median of 33 for patients in alcoholism treatment [16]).Subject characteristics were similar across drug of choicegroups with the exception of drug and alcohol ASI com- posite scores, as would be expected. Analysis The analysis for this paper was generated using SAS/ STAT software, version 8.2 [24]. All study subjects wereeligible for analyses of treatment utilization and sub-stance use. Analyses of alcohol and drug addiction sever-ity were restricted to subjects who reported alcohol oranother drug as their substance of choice, respectively .Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the studysample (proportions, means and standard deviations).Reported P -values are two-tailed, and a P -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signicant. Esti-mates of time to rst report of linkage with primary med-ical care or substance abuse treatment, where linkagecould occur at 6, 12, 18 or 24 months, were calculatedusing the Kaplan-Meier method. Subjects were censoredafter linkage or their last follow-up time. We tted longitudinal regression models adjusting for time and intrasubject correlations for all multi-variableanalyses [25]. For dichotomous outcome variables used generalized estimating equations (GEE) imple-mented in PROC GENMOD. For the continuous outcomevariables we used generalized linear models for correlated data (GLMCD) implemented using PROC MIXED. Eachsubject contributed up to four observations of the out-come variables (from 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after studyenrollment). An independent working correlation modeland an empirical variance estimator were used for theGEE models, while an unstructured working covariancemodel was assumed for the GLMCD models. All analysesincluded covariates of clinical importance. Homelessness,health insurance, physical and mental health-relatedquality of life, readiness to change and addiction treat-ment, when included, were time-varying covariates.Other covariates were those assessed at study entry . We tted three multi-variable models to address the primary research question, one for each primary out-come. We also tted one model for the outcome of sub-stance abuse treatment. All analyses were adjusted fortime, age, sex, race, randomized assignment in the clini-cal trial, homelessness, health insurance, mental andphysical health-related quality of life, alcohol and drugseverity at study entry and readiness to change. Analyseswith addiction severity and substance use as the outcomevariables were also adjusted for substance abuse treat- ment and use of mutual help groups. Analyses with sub-stance abuse treatment and substance use as outcomeswere adjusted for substance of choice. Secondary conrmatory/sensitivity analyses ad- dressed whether the results of the three main models andthe substance abuse treatment model would differ whenentering primary care as an eight-level variable. Anadditional analysis conrmed the results by testing theeffect of primary care receipt on substance-related prob-lems, adjusting for the same covariates as in the modelswith substance use as the outcome. To address the possi-bility of higher-order effects, we added the followingseven interactions with receipt of primary medical care tothe three main models: alcohol and drug severity at studyentry , mutual help use, readiness to change, physicalhealth-related quality of life, randomization assignmentand substance abuse treatment utilization. RESULTS Of 391 subjects, 194 (49.6%) received a total of two or more primary care visits, 53 (13.5%) received a total ofone visit and 144 (36.8%) received no primary medicalcare visits during the study period. Kaplan-Meier esti-mated proportions of subjects receiving a total of one ormore primary care visits at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months afterstudy entry were 31%, 44%, 58% and 70%, respectively . \u00a9 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction, 100 , 70-78 74 Richard Saitz et al. The four corresponding proportions for receipt of a total of two or more primary care visits were 19%, 30%, 44%and 58%. Receipt of primary medical care and addiction severity and substance abuse treatment For subjects who reported alcohol as their rst or second drug of choice, receipt of primary care was signi-cantly associated with improved alcohol (ASI) severity( F 2,239 = 3.29, P = 0.04) (predicted mean alcohol ASI for 0, 1, 2 visits, respectively , 0.34, 0.26, 0.30) in a multi- variable analysis. Similarly , for subjects reporting heroin or cocaine as their rst or second drug of choice, receipt ofprimary care was associated signicantly with improveddrug (ASI) severity ( F 2,291 = 4.49, P = 0.01) (predicted mean drug ASI for 0, 1, 2 visits, respectively , 0.16, 0.15, 0.13). For all 391 subjects, regardless of substance ofchoice, receipt of primary care was associated signi-cantly with a decreased odds of drug use or use of alcoholto intoxication (during 30 days) ( c 2 = 12.90, 2 d.f., P = 0.0016). During the 2 years of follow-up, 267subjects (67.3%) received substance abuse treatment ser- vices (Kaplan-Meier each of the foursuccessive 6-month periods 33.5%, 44.3%, 59.9%,73.5%). In a multi-variable analysis, receipt of primarycare was not signicantly associated with receipt of sub-stance abuse treatment (Table 1). Conrmatory/sensitivity analyses In multi-variable models entering the same covariates as the previously described models, an eight-level variablefor receipt of primary care was associated with loweralcohol severity at a borderline level of signicance(decrease in alcohol severity score for additional visit- 0.009, 95% CI - 0.020-0.001, F 1,239 = 2.88, P = 0.09), was signicantly associated with improved drug severity (decrease in drug severity for additional visit, - 0.006, 95% CI - 0.010 to - 0.001, F 1,290 = 6.70, P = 0.01), and was signicantly associated with a reduced odds of drug use or drinking alcohol to intoxication (OR for one morevisit 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91, c 2 = 15.76, 1 d.f., P < 0.0001).

Time (1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th interview) was a signicant predictor of outcome only for the substa nce abuse treatment anal- ysis ( c2 = 29.53, d.f. = 3, P < 0.0001). ASI and substance use outcome analyses also adjusted for substance abuse treatment and mutual help use (not sig- nicant in any analysis). Substance use and substance abuse treatment outcome analyses adjusted for substance of choice (not st atistically signicant).Primary medical care and addiction severity 75 \u00a9 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction, 100 , 70-78nicantly associated with receipt of substance abuse treatment (OR for an additional visit 1.00, 95% CI,0.93-1.08, c 2 = < 0.01, 1 d.f., P = 0.97). For all 391 subjects, regardless of substance of choice, receipt of primary care (categorized as 0, 1 or 2 visits) was signicantly associated with decreased substance- related problems (measured by the InDUC-2R, a measureof problems in past 6 months or since last researchassessment if >6 months) ( F 2,381 = 13.59, P < 0.0001) (predicted mean score for 0, 1, 2 visits, respectively , 52, 51, 39). To address the possibility of higher order effects, we tested seven interactions between receipt of primary careand alcohol and drug severity at study entry , mutual helpuse, the Taking Steps score, physical health-related qual-ity of life, randomization group and substance abusetreatment utilization in models with alcohol and drugseverity and drug use or alcohol intoxication outcomes(three outcomes, three models). Of these 21 interactionstested, only one was signicant at P < 0.05, the interaction with physical health-related quality oflife in the model predicting drug use severity(Table 2) ( F 2,291 = 3.53, p = 0.03). The association between primary care receipt and drug use severity var-ied by physical health-related quality of life. Predictedmean differences in drug severity were similar regardlessof primary care receipt for those with better health(higher PCS). Primary care appeared to have a greaterimpact on drug severity in people with worse physicalhealth status (lower PCS scores), than it did on peoplewith better health status. At the observed mean PCS of48, and at 2 standard errors above this mean (70), therewas little difference in the decreases in ASI drug score attributable to receipt of primary care. CONCLUSIONS Receipt of primary medical care in a distributive model by adults with addictions who have not recently had such care is associated with reduced problems andseverity of addictions over a 24-month period. This asso-ciation does not appear to be mediated by exposure tosubstance abuse treatment, nor does it appear to beaffected by addiction severity , mutual help use or readi- ness to change. As might be expected, primary care hada greater impact on addiction severity in patients withworse physical health. However, given the numerous interactions tested and the appearance of the nding forsubjects with only cocaine or heroin as a substance ofchoice, these latter ndings should be viewed as hypoth-esis generating. Analyses suggest some evidence fordose-response, both those that tested levels of primarycare exposure and the ordered results from all othermodels (i.e. more effect from 2 visits versus 1, and 1 versus 0 visits). In the analysis of alcohol ASI results were not ordered according to primary care dose, but the one-visit group was substantially smaller than the0- or 2-visit groups. Our ndings are consistent with prior studies. In a landmark randomized trial, substance abuse treatmentpatients receiving on-site medical, psychiatric, employ-ment and family services had less opiate use and im-proved medical, employment, legal and psychiatricoutcomes [26]. In another randomized trial patientswith substance abuse-related medical conditions as-signed to on-site primary care at an addiction treatmentprogram were more likely to remain abstinent thanpatients in usual separate primary care [10]. In aretrospective cohort study patients with addictionstreated at programs with on-site primary care hadimproved addiction outcomes when compared withpatients treated in programs without such services [11].Willenbring et al . tested another variation of on-site medical and addictions care integration [27]. In a ran-domized trial in a special alcohol clinic for veterans, theintegrated care group was more likely to be abstinentthan a usual care group [28]. Laine et al . found that patients with addictions who receive both regular addic-tion and medical (not necessarily primary) care are lesslikely to be hospitalized than those who received one orneither service [29]. Thus, medical care in general, andprimary care specically , appears to improve addictionoutcomes. Our study adds to this literature by suggesting that these results are also true for primary medical care as itis delivered in the community to a group of patientswith addictions that include many without homes or Predicted mean differences in drug addiction severity Sample mean -2 SE Sample mean Sample mean +2 SE Receipt of primary care PCS = 26 PCS = 48 PCS = 70 No primary care visits -0.08 -0.15 -0.21 -0.19 -0.23Table 2 Predicted mean differences in drug addiction severity by receipt of pri-mary care for three values of physicalhealth-related quality of life (samplemean 48, and 2 standard errors aboveand below).\u00a9 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction, 100 , 70-7876 Richard Saitz et al. health insurance. In fact, it is people who are socially disadvantaged who may be most likely to benet fromprimary medical care. Laine et al .'s population, who received benet from regular care, were insured by Med-icaid (state health insurance for the poor or disabled)[29]. Gelberg et al . have noted previously that in a vul- nerable population, more severe addictions and moresevere homelessness did not deter access to needed care,and that having a regular source of care predicted betterhealth outcomes [30]. The observation that substanceabuse treatment did not appear to mediate the relation- ship between primary care and improved addictionseverity is not surprising. Linkage between primary careand the addiction treatment system has been elusive [6].Most patients with addictions do not seek specialtytreatment [5] and substance abuse treatment has beennotably not associated with linkage to primary medicalcare [31]. This absence of apparent contribution of sub-stance abuse treatment to the observed benet of pri-mary care to addictions outcomes could be viewed asboth a cup half empty and half full. Primary care maybe contributing independently to improved addictionsoutcome. In addition, the opportunity to achieve evengreater benet may exist if mechanisms were instituted to link primary care more effectively with substanceabuse treatment. The principal limitation that should be considered in interpreting our results is that our data are from anobservational study . As a result, the observed associa-tions between receipt of primary care and addictionseverity could be due to confounding. However, weadjusted for likely confounders of this relation. Further-more, the fact that data for this observational study werecollected prospectively in a study focused on primary careand addictions is a particular strength. One might alsoquestion whether primary care led to reduced addictionseverity , or whether adults with improved addictionsbecame health conscious and linked with primary care.Another similar possibility is that those with the mostsevere problems who 'hit rock bottom' began to take careof themselves, including a visit to primary care and absti-nence or less use. Both explanations seem less plausiblebecause analyses adjusted for substance abuse conse-quences and health status. Furthermore, measures ofaddiction severity referred to the recent past whilemeasures of primary care receipt referred to the past6 months or more, making the former more likely . Thetemporal association, the conrmation of a prior hypoth-esis, adjustment for important possible confounders andthe consistency across outcomes suggest that receipt ofprimary care was associated with later improvements inaddiction severity . Finally , some of the observed effectswere relatively small (e.g. differences of 0.02 in drug ASI). Our goal was not to determine clinical signicance butrather to identify an association. It is notable that an association between primary medical care and addictionseverity was detectable at all, given the variability in sub-ject characteristics and the many other contributors toaddiction severity . In fact, some effects were quite sub-stantial and clinically signicant (e.g. >50% decrease in odds of substance use, large changes in InDUC problemscore and alcohol ASI). The important question, of whether or not primary medical care as it is currently delivered in the commu-nity can improve addiction severity , is best answered in anaturalistic study , and this highlights several importantstrengths of this study . First, the data collection in thiscohort study was prospective. Secondly , two of the mainpurposes of the research assessments a priori were toassess primary medical care utilization and addictionseverity in detail. Thirdly , multiple measures of addictionseverity used in the study have been validated andresults across these measures were consistent. Finally ,receipt of primary care was corroborated by administra-tive data. One could still argue that our ndings are due to inadequately addressed confounding or that the out-come (i.e. addiction severity) leads to seeking primarymedical care. Such a critical assessment might contendthat the hypothesis, 'primary medical care leads toimproved addiction severity', can only be answereddenitively by a randomized trial of primary care.Addressing these concerns optimally is difcult, as sucha study will probably not be conducted, for pragmaticand ethical reasons. This study and previous studies support the conten- tion that receipt of primary care is associated withimproved outcomes for adults with addictions. Our studyresults and those of others cited herein may be the besttype of evidence to bring to address the question. This evi-dence suggests strongly that patients with addictionsshould receive primary medical care in addition to addic-tion treatment. Efforts to link and/or integrate primarymedical care with addiction specialty care are worth-while. Patients with addictions can be linked with pri- mary medical care [13]. In addition, actually providingservices known to be efcacious and feasible in primarycare settings that are not currently in widespread usecould lead to even greater improvements for patients withaddictions. How to make primary medical care trulyaccessible and actually used by adults with alcohol andother drug dependence remains a challenge for research-ers and clinicians alike.

In 1976. members of the Career Teachers Training Program in Alcohol and Drug Abuse, a US federally funded multi-disciplinary faculty development program. formed AMERSA. The organi\u00ad zation grew from 59 founding members, who were primarily medical school faculty, to over 300 health professionals from a spectrum of disciplines includ\u00ad ing physicians, nurses, social workers, dentists, allied health professionals, psy\u00ad chologists and other clinical educators who are responsible for advancing substance abuse education. AMERSA members promote substance abuse edu\u00ad cation among health professionals by developing curricula, promulgating rele\u00ad vant policy and training health professional faculty to become excellent teachers in this field. AMERSA influences public policy by offering standards for improving substance abuse education. The organization publishes a peer\u00ad reviewed, quarterly journal. Substance Abuse. which emphasizes research on the education and training of health professions and also includes original clinical and prevention research. Each year. the AMERSA National Conference brings together researchers and health professional educators to learn about scientific advances and exemplary teaching approaches. In the future, AMERSA willcon\u00ad tinue to pursue this mission of advancing and supporting health professional faculty who educate students and trainees to address substance abuse in patients and clients.

FOUNDING OF AMERSA Since its inception, AMERS~s goal has been to improve the substance abuse education of health professional trainees related to prevention, intervention and treat\u00ad ment of individuals and families, Advancing the knowl\u00ad edge and skills of faculty at academic professional schools has been seen as the most effective means. In 1976, members of the Career Teachers Training Pro\u00ad gram in Alcohol and Drug Abuse [8] formed AMERSA. The Career Teachers Program (1972-82), sponsored by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), was one of the first multi-disciplinary health professional faculty development programs. Over the course of this program's existence, S9 career teachers, faculty in medical and public health schools, were chal\u00ad lenged by the problems they encountered in pursuit of their goal: implementing curriculum changes to enhance substance abuse education within their own professional schools. Within the structure of the Careers Teachers Program, they were able to develop common strategies and support each other as they encountered common barriers to achieving this goal. Barriers included resistance from curriculum committees, facul\u00ad ties and deans who did not support inclusion of sub\u00ad stance abuse issues in the curriculum. Despite the resistance, these substance abuse educator pioneers rec\u00ad ognized the benefits of the support network of this national faculty development program. When it became clear that the effective federally funded Career Teachers Program was coming to an end, the faculty recipients of this support decided to broaden the group beyond the career teachers and form a new national organization. Thus, AMERSAwas established with Marc Galanter MD, iO2005 Soctety for the Study of Addtctlon leading the organization as the first president. The founding members also initiated the AMERSA journal. Substance Abuse, which has continued to be published and grow since its inception. Members of the organiza\u00ad tion and AMERSA staff continue to work closely with NIDA, NIAAA and other federal agencies to carryon and strengthen the mission of the organization. Origi\u00ad nally housed at the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, AMERS~s national headquarters are now independently located in Providence, Rhode Island. IMPACT ON FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE As stated on the organization's website: AMERSA members from diverse departments at health professional schools have developed, imple\u00ad mented, and evaluated state-of-the-art curricula, edu\u00ad cational programs, and faculty development programs. [Its] members have developed clinical and research measures for substance abuse services and professional education. They are actively engaged in research related to substance abuse education, clini\u00ad cal service, and prevention [9]. AMERSA has pursued the advancement of substance abuse education among health professionals by develop\u00ad ing and promulgating appropriate policy and by sup\u00ad porting health professional faculty to become more knowledgeable and skillful about teaching in this field. AMERSA has been instrumental in setting educational standards for essential knowledge and skills required of primary care physicians and more recently a whole spec\u00ad trum of health professions. The organization and its members have clearly articulated the rationale for inclu\u00ad sion of substance abuse health professional education [7,10]. Addiction 3 In 1985, AMERSA sponsored a conference with the Betty Ford Center, NIAAA and NIDA to develop consen\u00ad sus on the knowledge, skills and desirable educational experiences necessary for primary care physicians in alcohol and drug abuse, the optimal roles and responsi\u00ad bilities of the involved organizations and the best strate\u00ad gies for implementation. The result of this landmark conference was a delineation of the subjects and neces\u00ad sary skills that should be taught, the role of medical schools and government, and the development of specialty-specific guidelines. This meeting was the fore\u00ad runner of several subsequent USefforts in faculty devel\u00ad opment such as the US Health Services and Resources Administration (HRSA) Faculty Development Programs in alcohol and other drug abuse, targeting general inter\u00ad nal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics [II], and several faculty development programs in the I990s funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), SAMHSA, targeting nursing, social work, medi\u00ad cineand publichealth. Mostrecently,USfederalagencies supported AMERSA in the creation of the 2002 Strategic Plan for Interdisciplinary Faculty Development in sub\u00ad stance abuse and the newest faculty development pro\u00ad gram, Project MAINSTREAM (MultiAgencyINitiativefor Substance abuse TRaining and Education for AMerica) [7]. Members have worked closely with the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) and HRSAin Project MAINSTREAM for continuing development of multi\u00ad disciplinary addiction faculty. As part of Project MAINSTREAM, health professionals from a variety of disciplines attend the annual National AMERSA Confer\u00ad ence. Because of its long-standing commitment to sub\u00ad stance abuse training, AMERSA has been instrumental in establishing addiction training in medical, nursing and other health professional institutions nationally. Thus, one of AMERSXs greatest contributions is the clear articulation of critical curriculum content includ\u00ad ing skills training. Through its consensus statements [12], AMERSA has advanced the concept that primary care clinical teams are in a critical position to detect and treat patients with substance abuse problems, yet they continue to struggle, due in part to lack of training. Therefore, a focus of the organization is to incorporate substance abuse clinical and research activities into mainstream clinicalpractice. AMERSA pursues itsgoalof setting educational standards by presenting a showcase of model programs at its annual national meeting and publishing educational research in its journal, Substance Abuse. Internationally, AMERSA was not alone in its early efforts to effect change in the education of medical professionals. Advances in training and curriculum design were taking place in many countries; prominent among these were Australia, England, Sweden and Canada [13-15]. 02005 Soctety for the Study of Addiction AMERSA IMPACT ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE EDUCATION POLICY AMERSA affects public policy by offering standards that inform the federal government and others on how to improve substance abuse health professional education. AMERSA led the development of standards for a spec\u00ad trum of generalist health professionals with multi-agency federal support. Its members developed a strategic plan for the nation, released at the National Press Club in 2002, addressing substance abuse health professional education [7]. The strategic plan includes recommenda\u00ad tions to the US Department of Health and Human Servicesand other federal agencies as wellas recommen\u00ad dations to legislators. The Strategic Plan highlights the need for faculty development and the impact that routine substance abuse screening and intervention bygeneralist health professionals can have in linking patients and family members to services to facilitate treatment and recovery.TheStrategic Plan identifiesadditional methods for building a national infrastructure for faculty develop\u00ad ment in substance abuse. Most recently, AMERSA was invited by the White House Office of National Drug Con\u00ad trol Policy (ONDCP) to participate with national experts in the 2004 Leadership Conference on MedicalEducation in Substance Abuse. An ONDCP report is expected in 2005 that will outline a strategy that, in part, builds upon the 2002 Strategic Plan for Interdisciplinary Fac\u00ad ulty Development. SUBSTANCE. ABUSE.: THE OFFICIAL PUBLICATION AMERSA publishes Substance Abuse, a peer-reviewed, quarterly journal that emphasizes research on health professional education in substance abuse and also includes original clinical and prevention research. It is a recognized source of empirical findings for health profes\u00ad sionals and addiction specialists in teaching, clinical care and service delivery. It features original research and review articles on a variety of related topics: the educa\u00ad tion and training of health professionals in substance abuse; clinical care for substance abusers in a variety of settings; the organization of substance abuse treatment services: pre-clinical and clinical research, including therapeutic interventions and behavioral studies: medi\u00ad cal complications associated with drug abuse; substance abuse among specificgroups or populations: appliedsci\u00ad ence research; and policy issues. The journal publishes timely editorials and book reviews, as well as abstracts from the AMERSA National Conference. Substance Abuse is distributed to all AMERSA members. The journal has a multi-disciplinary Editorial Board that represents the AddIction 4 Jeffrey H. Samet et al. full strength and range of AMERSA's experience and teaching. ANNUAL CONFERENCE The annual AMERSA National Conference has been the central exceptional product of the organization, as it brings together researchers and health professional edu\u00ad cators to learn about scientific advances and exemplary teaching approaches. The conference fosters collabora\u00ad tion of health professionals within and among diverse dis\u00ad ciplines, backgrounds and professional environments in a particularly supportive atmosphere encouraging peer mentoring and career development. It attracts presenters with national and international reputations to share new developments in substance abuse education, treatment, prevention and research. New research presented in both poster and oral formats is subsequently published as abstracts in Substance Abuse. This national meeting is held regularly during the fall in the Washington, DCarea to take advantage of speakers from NIAAA and NIDA as well as to enhance networking with leaders of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). AWARDS SPONSORED BY AMERSA AMERSA sponsors several awards to support and recog\u00ad nize outstanding individual achievements in the field of substance abuse. The premier awards given to members or non-members of the organization are The John P. McGovern Award for Excellence in Medical Education and The Betty Ford Award. The John P. McGovern Award is given to an individual who has made impor\u00ad tant contributions to substance abuse education and research. The Betty Ford Award is given to an individ\u00ad ual who has played a significant role in the treatment and recovery of drug-dependent individuals, particu\u00ad larly women. Each Ford and McGovern awardee is invited to speak at the national conference. The New Investigator/Educator Award is given to an AMERSA member who has made significant contributions to sub\u00ad stance abuse education or research at an early stage in his or her career, and demonstrates the potential for future achievements in the field. The Excellence in Men\u00ad torship Award Isgiven to an AMERSA member from any discipline who has provided outstanding mentorlng to junior faculty and/or trainees, resulting in those individ\u00ad uals' increased scholastic productivity and career advancement in the area of substance abuse education or research. C> 2005 Society for the Study of Addictlon SOURCES OF FUNDING Sources of funding are primarily through membership dues and registration feesfromthe annualconference.In recent years other funds have been obtained from foun\u00ad dation and federal grants (the Endowment of the John P. McGovern Foundation, CSAT, HRSA, NIAAAand NIDAl, most of which are directed at improving health profes\u00ad sional substance abuse training. Funding for the annual conferences has included support from NIDA and NIAAA to ensure high quality presentations for plenary sessions and recruitment of attendees who are promising diverse health professional faculty. MEMBERSHIP As described previously, AMERSA was comprised origi\u00ad nally of medical school faculty. During the early years of the organization's development, however, members real\u00ad izedtheneed toinvolvea broaderspectrum ofhealthpro\u00ad fessionals in order to have a more substantial impact on the care of patients with addictive disorders. Addressing substance abuse issues among patients required multi\u00ad disciplinary efforts and thus multi-disciplinary training was required to achieve this goal. The recognition that other health-care professions had a direct stake in clinical education led to the broadening of AMERSA's multi\u00ad disciplinary base to faculty in all medical. nursing, social work and other health professional training programs. Gradually, nurses, social workers, dentists, allied health professionals and others became part of the organization. They started as active participants in the annual confer\u00ad ence, then active members, and then active Executive Committee members-the leaders of the organization. Being multi-disciplinary is one of the great strengths of the organization, distinguishing AMERSA from organiza\u00ad tions with physician-only or psychologist-only member\u00ad ship. This organizational hallmark encourages clinicians to take a patient-centered or family-centered perspective and enables members to discuss Interdisciplinary train\u00ad Ing, a focus not consistently pursued by other substance abuse organizations. AMERSA's members come from a range of disciplines and health professions and member\u00ad ship has grown to over 300; the organization's President (2003-05) is a senior faculty leader in a School of Social Work. Leadership structure AMERSA's ExecutiveCommittee,represented byavariety of professions, is responsible for setting the direction of the organization. The Executive Committee consists of President, Vice President, Immediate Past President, AddIction 5 Secretary, Treasurer and Substance Abuse Journal Editor\u00ad in-Chief, four Members-at-Large, Director and two Co\u00ad Directors. Officers take office at the conclusion of the national meeting following an election that has occurred a few months prior, and serve for a period of 2 years. No officer can serve on the Executive Committee for more than 8 consecutive years, excluding the 2-year term as Immediate Past President. For a current listing of officers see the website www.amersa.org. Joining AMERSA Full membership is open to people engaging in substance abuse research or education and to faculty of health professional schools. AMERSA also offers associate, cor\u00ad porate and emeritus membership. Members' range of benefits include the following: reduced rates for the annual national conference; a subscription to Substance Abuse; and a national voice supporting academic pro\u00ad grams in universities, professional schools, and organiza\u00ad tions that emphasize substance abuse education and research. CHALLENGES As in many non-profit organizations, AMERSA faces the ongoing challenge of limited financial resources. In gen\u00ad eral, support in the addiction area is directed at treatment and research rather than education and training. Train\u00ad ing is likely to be conducted by people involved in treat\u00ad ment and research, but only limited sources of funding have been traditionally available specifically for teaching efforts. Because of this, AMERSA members, through their commitment to the organization's educational mission, must creatively garner cooperation from many faculty members and operate with limited resources to fulfill their goals. Compared to other organizations in the United States that focus on substance abuse AMERSA has always had a relatively small membership, in part reflecting funding foreducational efforts.The organization's strengthisthat this group is committed, talented, collaborative and imbued with the spirit to provide guidance to junior and peer colleagues. It has survived and flourished, in part, because it is the only organization that focuses on the educational mission in the way that it does. Many within its committed membership are the leaders within health professional schools nation-wide; they are the teachers of substance abuse at the nation's major universities, hos\u00ad pitals and health-care institutions. They educate and mentor future clinicians, researchers and educators, cre\u00ad ating an impact well beyond their direct sphere of influ\u00ad ence. They are in the forefront leading this effort. Even \" 2005 SoeLety for the Study of Addtctlon AMERSA though AMERS~s numbers are not in the thousands, the organization has a big ripple effect on health professional substance abuse professional training. FUTURE OF AMERSA Members of AMERSA will continue to pursue the organi\u00ad zation's education and training goals, including the development of a national infrastructure for interdIscipli\u00ad nary faculty development. Teaching about substance abuse needs to become mainstream and rooted securely in health professional schools. New faculty at these insti\u00ad tutions must be inspired, well trained and supported so that students have a respected faculty source and role model for integrating substance abuse prevention, inter\u00ad vention and treatment into their daily work. These goals are the essence of what AMERSA will pursue in the com\u00ad ing years through its conferences, journal and training programs. AMERSA was a leading participant in the develop\u00ad ment of a strategic planning document [7] to guide the improvement of health professional education on sub\u00ad stance abuse. The future of AMERSA depends on the wide recognition of the problems of alcohol and drug abuse and dependence in society. It depends on the shift away from stigmatizing and towards understanding these problems as health issues, which has been occurring over the last 30 years. The efforts towards competency-based education [16], with a focus towards outcomes rather than process, should bring more attention to the field because the problems of substance abuse are so common\u00ad place in clinical practice. The high prevalence of alcohol and other drug problems in both hospital and ambula\u00ad tory practice will be a potent motivating force, as it has not yet been addressed adequately. As the trend toward skills training and competency based health professional education continues and the stigma of alcohol and drug abuse decreases, it is hoped that the training of doctors, nurses, social workers, dentists, allied health profession\u00ad als and other clinicians about substance abuse will be more widely recognized as essential to a quality educa\u00ad tion in these disciplines. At that time, the human resources that the AMERSA membership and organiza\u00ad tion provide will become even more valued. The current younger generation of students seems to recognize the importance of appropriate training in sub\u00ad stance abuse, A recent and encouraging illustration is the effort by students to form their own multi-disciplinary group called Health Professional Students for Substance Abuse Training. They have taken initiatives to expand substance abuse education in their institutions and have created their own website (www.HPSSAT.ORG) in order to provide curriculum and training opportunities. These Addletion 6 Jeffrey H. Samet et al. students are now forming an alliance with AMERSA. Thus it is anticipated that AMERSA will see a cohort of younger members in the next 5 years that willeventually become the leadership. AMERSA welcomes such change as the organization views mentorship as a core organiza\u00ad tional value. The new generation of leaders will come from a different style of health professional education than the current generation of AMERSA members. The continuing challenge is to integrate substance use disor\u00ad ders effectively into the traditional curriculum so that students will gain competence in these common prob\u00ad lems that take a heavy toll on the health of individuals and families in our society.

Design: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the usual medical follow-up with an adherence intervention. Setting: The principal enrolment site was Boston Medical Center, a private, not-for-profit. academic medical institution. Subjects: HIV-infected patients with a history of alcohol problems on ART. A total of 151 were enrolled and 141 (930f0) were assessed at follow-up. Intervention: A nurse, trained in motivational interviewing, completed the following over 3 months in four encounters: addressed alcohol problems; provided a watch with a programmable timer to facilitate pill taking; enhanced perception of treatment efficacy; and delivered individually tailored assistance to facilitate medication use. Main outcome measures: Prior 30-day adherence ;,,95%. prior 3-day adherence of 100%. CD4 cell count, HIV RNA and alcohol consumption, each at both short-and long\u00ad term follow-up. Results: At follow-up, no significant differences in medication adherence, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA or alcohol consumption were found (all P values >0.25). Conclusions: A multicomponent intervention to enhance adherence among HIV-infected individuals with a history of alcohol problems was not associated with changes in medication adherence, alcohol consumption or markers of HIV disease progression. The failure to change adher\u00ad ence in a group at high risk for poor adherence, despite utilizing an intensive individual-focused patient inter\u00ad vention, supports the idea of addressing medication adherence with supervised medication delivery or markedly simplified dosing regimens. Introduction .. Poor medication adherence is a problem across the spectrum of medical conditions and its degree varies with both illness and patient population [1]. In general, medication adherence has been reported as being between 50% and 65% for long-term regimens and as low as 18% for acute illnesses [2,3]. Historically, several variables have been associated with medication adherence: severity of the disease, complexity of the prescribed regimen, physician-patient relationship, potential for painful or undesirable side effects, patient's lifestyle and substance abuse [4]. Prior to the \u00a9 200SInternational Medical Press AIDS epidemic, adherence research demonstrated that effective intervention to enhance medication adherence must address multiple dimensions in a patient's life [5]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality from HIVinfection [6]. Medication regimens are most effective when adherence is at a level of 95% orhigher [7,8]. Decreased adherence to HTVmedications has been associated with lower CD4 cell counts, higher HIV RNA levels and more rapid disease progression [8-11]. Decreased adherence can increase the development of drug-resistant strains of 83 IHSamet et al. IHIV [12,13]. Antiretroviral therapy may involve Icomplicated regimens with potentially minor or major toxicity, factors that can promote non-adherence [14]. Alcohol abuse has also been associated with poorer medication adherence in HIV-infected individuals and heavy drinking is associated with taking ART off schedule [15]. One study found that among HIV\u00ad infected individuals with a history of alcohol problems, current alcohol consumption was the factor most strongly associated with decreased adherence [16]. Medication adherence has assumed a central role among HIV therapeutic recommendations [17,18]. A critical need exists to find methods to achieve optimal adherence and to provide methodologically sound assessments of these strategies [19]. Randomized controlled trials in general populations with HIV infec\u00ad tion have tested psychoeducational interventions to promote adherence with varying results [10,20,21]. In an intention-to-treat analysis by Tuldra et al., there was no significant difference in medication adherence between the experimental and control groups, although subjects receiving the intervention reported increased adherence [10]. Goujard et at. achieved significant increases in adherence but did not see improvements in clinical indicators [20]. Pradier et at. not only achieved significant improvements in adher\u00ad ence, but also decreases in viral load [21]. As yet, no randomized controlled trial to enhance medication adherence has been reported in an HIV-infected popu\u00ad lation with a history of alcohol problems. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of an individu\u00ad alized multicomponent intervention to promote adherence to ART in a cohort of HIV-infected individ\u00ad uals with a history of alcohol problems. Methods Study design and recruitment This study, ADHERE (Adherence to Drugs for HIY, an Experimental Randomized Enhancement), employed a randomized controlled trial design to study a multi\u00ad component intervention to enhance adherence to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients with a history of alcohol problems. Recruitment of subjects from several sites occurred from July 1997 to December 2000. The principal enrolment site was a Boston Medical Center clinic in which patients initi\u00ad ating HIV medical care underwent an extensive clinical evaluation [22]. Subjects in a previously described longitudinal cohort study, HIV-ALC (HIV Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort), were eligible for this trial if they were taking antiretroviral medication [23]. HIV-ALC subjects were HIV-infected and had a history of alcohol problems identified by explicit criteria. HIV infection was confirmed by a positive laboratory test result demon\u00ad strating infection or antiretroviral medication use. Alcohol problems were defined as current or lifetime history of alcohol abuse or dependence and were deter\u00ad mined by two or more positive responses to the CAGE screening questionnaire [24,25]. Patients recruited from the principal enrolment site who did not meet CAGE criteria were eligible if one of two attending physicians (JHS, KAF) made a clinical diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Other entry criteria included the following: fluency in English or Spanish, Mini-Mental State Examination score \u00ab21 [26] and no plans to move from the Boston area in the following 2 years. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria completed initial assessments and were recruited to participate in the randomized controlled trial (Figure 1). Subjects were randomly assigned to either the control or inter\u00ad vention group and balance between groups was ensured after every four subjects were enrolled. The Institutional Review Boards of the Boston Medical Center and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved this study. Subject assessment After providing informed consent for the ADHERE study, all subjects were interviewed by trained research associates. Interviews occurred at seven time points over 13 months and took place at the hospitals' General Clinical Research Centers. Prior to random\u00ad ization, a comprehensive evaluation ascertained demographic, HIV risk behaviour, alcohol and drug consumption, depressive symptoms (CES-D) [27], quality of life (5F-36) [28] and self-reported 3- and 30\u00ad day ART adherence information [29]. At the 6- and 12-month time points, alcohol consumption was re\u00ad assessed. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. For the Spanish interview, standardized scales were used when available, the remainder of the questionnaire was translated from English into Spanish, back-translated to check for accuracy and then corrected. We used routine clinical results of CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels when available at the pre-randomization, 6-and 12-month evaluations. When clinical values within a 3-month window were unavailable, we obtained results during the research interview. A survey was administered at the 0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 12- and 13-month visits to assess the effective\u00ad ness of the intervention. To corroborate self-report of ART adherence, two Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps were distributed to each subject at the baseline contact, collected at the 3-month contact, redistributed at the 12-month contact and recollected at the 13-month contact. MEM5 caps record the precise date and time of every bottle opening [30]. Assuming that a bottle opening represents a dose \u00a9 2005International Medical Press 84 ART adherence intervention Figure 1.

ADHERE intervention The ADHERE intervention incorporated four distinct components: i) assessment and discussion of the patient's alcohol and other substance use based on stage of readiness for behavioural change [31]; ii) use of a watch that served as a medication timer device, a prac\u00ad tical aid to improving adherence; iii) enhancement of perceived efficacy of medications; and iv) individualized HIV counselling and exploration of ways to tailor medication use to specific circumstances (Table 1). Subjects randomized to the intervention group were scheduled for an initial 60-min individual appointment (within 2 weeks after randomization), a follow-up home visit within the first 3 weeks and two subsequent IS-30-min appointments at 1 month and 3 months with the nurse interventionist who delivered the adher\u00ad ence enhancement intervention. The nurse had prior HIV and substance abuse expertise and was specifically trained in motivational interviewing to address substance abuse and HIV medication adherence [32]. A structured approach was used by the nurse to assess the subject's substance use based on the individual's readi\u00ad ness to change [31]. The nurse instructed the subject on the use of the medication timer device provided by the study - a programmable watch that sounded an Antiviral Therapy 10:1 auditory or vibratory alarm at the time scheduled for the subject's ART dose. The intervention included a review of the efficacy of HIV medications, answering subject's HIV-related questions and exploring ways to tailor medication use to specific circumstances (for example, homelessness, access to refrigeration, non\u00ad disclosure of HIV status and social support). The purpose of the home visit was for the nurse interven\u00ad tionist to observe the subject's living situation so that his or her particular barriers to medication adherence could be addressed. During the intervention visits, the nurse re-assessed barriers to medication adherence and coun\u00ad selled about strategies to overcome these barriers. Subjects in the intervention group who received at least one, but not all four nurse intervention encounters, were identified as having received a 'partial intervention'. The same nurse delivered all nursing interventions and, after each session, recorded if the pre-specified components of the adherence intervention had been delivered. A second nurse consultant experienced in HIV and substance abuse observed three interventions to assess and provide feedback to the nurse interven\u00ad tionist and verify that all pre-specified elements of the intervention were addressed. Subjects randomized to the control group received standard care for HIV infection. During this period standard practice with regard to ART was evolving, and typically included verbal or written instructions 85 JH Samet et 01. Table 1.

Subjects continued to receive their regular medical care for HIV infection. Primary outcome The primary study outcome was adherence to ART. Both 3-day and 30-day self-reported adherence were measured using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) scale [29]. We defined desired adherence as \",,95% adherence over the previous 30 days and 100% adherence over the previous 3 days. In addition to the dichotomous measure of adherence, additional analyses were conducted using a continuous measure of adherence for the past 30 days. This measure is the actual proportion of doses taken versus doses prescribed (0.0-1.0). We attempted to obtain both short-and long-term measurements for each of the outcomes. Short-term follow-up was defined as the 6-month interview result if available, otherwise the most proximal measurement was used (that is, the 3-month measurement if avail\u00ad able; if not, then the 2-month one). Long-term follow-up was defined as the 13-month interview if available, otherwise the 12-month interview was used. We corroborated self-reported adherence results using MEMS caps [30]. At the time of medication adherence assessment, subjects were asked about their pill-taking routine. Subjects who reported no change in HIV medications during the assessed interval and did not use a pill organizing container were included in the analyses corroborating self\u00ad report of adherence. Secondary outcomes We examined several secondary outcomes at both 6 and 12 months: CD4 cell count, log HIV RNA, and alcohol severity and consumption using both the Addiction Severity Index [36] and quantity and frequency questions assessing the previous 30 days (that is, the number of drinking days and maximum \u00a9 2005 International Medical Press 86 ART adherence intervention number of drinks in a day). These responses were used to calculate the average number of drinks per day and dichotomous measures of abstinence and hazardous drinking using National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines [37]. Statistical analysis To test for group differences in baseline characteristics, we carried out two-sample t-tests for continuous vari\u00ad ables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Measures of agreement between self-report and MEMS were calculated using the kappa statistic for dichoto\u00ad mous reports of adherence and intraclass correlation for continuous reports. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes were conducted using generalized estimating equations [38] to test for intervention effects at both short-term and long-term follow-up. These analyses controlled for baseline measurements of adherence for models of adherence, laboratory values for CD4 cell count and HIV RNA models, and alcohol consumption for alcohol models. These longitudinal regression models account for the correlation between observations taken over time on the same subject, using an exchangeable working correlation matrix and empirical variance estimator [39]. For each outcome, two models were fit, one with an interaction between the intervention group and time (to test for differences between short-term and long-term intervention effect) and one with main effects for time and group (which averages the inter\u00ad vention effect over time). In addition to the main analyses, a series of secondary analyses were performed to assess homogeneity of effect. Stratified analyses were performed to assess differences in impor\u00ad tant subgroups defined at baseline: gender, hazardous drinking, adherence ;,,9S%, injection drug use in the previous 6 months, undetectable HIV RNA \u00abSOO) and CD4 cell count ,;;3S0 cells/mm\". All analyses were performed by the intention-to\u00ad treat method. Reported P values are two-tailed and a P value <O.OS was considered statistically significant. No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. The study was designed to enrol 240 subjects (120 per group). Power calculations assumed that 10% of subjects would be lost at 6 months and an additional 10% at 12 months (n=108 per group and n=97 per group, respectively) and that the standard deviation of adherence was 21 %. The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a difference in adherence of 8% at short-term follow-up between groups (for example, 84% in intervention group vs 76% in controls) and 84% power to detect a difference of 9% at long-term follow-up. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software v8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) [39]. Antiviral Therapy 10:1 Results A total of 151 ADHERE subjects were randomized to either the control or intervention group (Figure 2 and Table 2). Of these, 67 subjects were recruited from the principal enrolment site with an additional 29 from Boston Medical Center's primary care practices, three from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 10 from a respite facility for homeless individuals, five from a methadone clinic and 37 referred by friends or posted flyers. At baseline, the control group and the adherence intervention group were comparable in terms of sex, race, age and mean log HIV RNA. Intervention subjects had significantly higher mean CD4 cell counts than control subjects (480 vs 364 cells/mm', P=O.Ol). Among the intervention subjects, 93% received at least one component of the intervention and 76% received all four pre-specified encounters of the intervention. Follow-up outcome data were obtained in a high percentage of subjects for the short-term time point in both control and intervention subjects (95% and 88%, respectively) and in a moderate percentage for the long-term time point (58% and 66%, respectively). No significant differences in the primary outcome (that is, medication adherence) or other secondary outcomes (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA or alcohol consumption) were found using the longitudinal regression models either at short-term or long-term follow-up (all P values >0.2S). Subgroup analyses were consistent with primary analyses. Because of challenges in subject recruitment, the study enrolled only 151 subjects, not the 240 planned, and as a result the study had less power than originally designed. Using the assumptions described in the Methods section with this smaller sample size, the expected power to detect differences between groups was 60% at short\u00ad term and 6S% at long-term follow-up. Because a large number of subjects used pill\u00ad counting devices or switched medications during the study, only 29% of subjects had usable baseline MEMS data for corroboration with self-reported data. This was a previously reported limitation of MEMS use in community-based clinical trials [40]. Similar to Arnsten et al. [41], we found among this subset of subjects that, although self-report of medication adher\u00ad ence at baseline was higher than that calculated using MEMS data (P<O.OOl), there was a slight association between 30-day data and MEMS data (intraclass correlatione O.Zri; kappa=0.19) [42J. Discussion Improving adherence to ART in patients at high risk for poor adherence is challenging [3]. We developed and assessed an individually-tailored multicomponent 87 JH Samet et a/. Figure 2.

Using behavioural science theories, the inter\u00ad vention was designed to be potent, utilizing interviewing principles of motivational enhancement to promote behaviour change, as well as Health Belief Model principles to support the benefit and need for therapy [43]. Despite consistently delivering this prag\u00ad matic theory-based intervention, we found no significant difference in the primary outcomes of either short-term or long-term adherence between the inter\u00ad vention and control groups.

The absence of any difference between groups, comparing all primary and secondary outcomes, is robust, as we measured outcomes at both short-term follow-up and long-term over the course of 13 months and corroborated adher\u00ad ence self-report data with available MEMS data. Previous adherence research not involving HIV\u00ad infected individuals describes several useful strategies for interventions to increase medication adherence. Traditional methods focus on communication between the physician and patient, written instruction, patient education about the illness and medication, physician advice, special drug packaging and tailoring medica\u00ad tions to a patient's daily schedule [3]. Early adherence research in HIV disease found that adherence to zidovudine was associated with a patient's belief that this medication would prolong life [44]. Recent factors associated with HIV adherence include the patient's Antiviral Therapy 10:1 correct understanding of the effect of HIV medications on viral load [45], alcohol use and active drug use [46], race [47], perceived self-efficacy to com pIy with the prescribed regimen, physician-patient relationship, older age, lifestyle and other psychosocial factors [48]. According to the Health Belief Model, the decision to adhere to medications depends upon the patient's feeling of susceptibility to the disease, belief in the severity of the disease, belief in the efficacy of the medication to prevent disease progression and perceived barriers to initiating or continuing medica\u00ad tion adherence, such as side effects [43]. Despite the rational construction and effective delivery of the adherence intervention in this study, we found no effect of its use. These results argue against a strategy of strengthening the skills of individual patients as the major approach to improving antiretro\u00ad viral medication adherence. It is possible that the efficacy of our adherence intervention was underesti\u00ad mated. Approximately a quarter (24%) of the 89 JH Samet et 01. intervention group received only a partial intervention or no intervention. Although this represents only a minority of the intervention group, this incomplete exposure of the intervention to subjects randomized to that group would reduce the demonstrated potency of the intervention. Another potential explanation for the lack of efficacy of the intervention is that the target enrolment was not met. Thus, the study was not completely powered to detect differences in the primary outcome. However, the lack of any trend towards a difference in any of the primary or secondary short-term or long-term outcomes argues against the likelihood that enrolling additional subjects in each group would have yielded different results. Study entry criteria yielded cohort characteristics that worked against the demonstration of potential effective\u00ad ness of this intervention. The focus on HIV-infected individuals with a history of alcohol problems was important, as alcohol has consistently been implicated as a factor associated with poor ART adherence. We hypothesized that an effective adherence intervention would need to directly address the impact of alcohol on adherence in these patients. However, this approach limited available subjects. In order to facilitate recruit\u00ad ment, study entry criteria were not limited with regard to current adherence, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA or alcohol use. This strategy allowed recruitment of a sizable cohort but risked both ceiling and floor effects that might limit the ability to demonstrate a change in study outcomes. For example, as reflected in Table 3, 30-day adherence at baseline was already ~95% in 69% of control subjects and 68% of intervention subjects. Thus, the potential to demonstrate an improvement in this outcome relied on the 32 % of subjects with baseline adherence being in need of substantial improvement. Comparable floor effects were encountered for HIV RNA, for which 54% of control and 64% of intervention subjects were unde\u00ad tectable at baseline. Of note, during the time this study was carried out (1998-2001), adherence was increasingly being recog\u00ad nized as an issue requiring clinical attention. Standard medical care was beginning to focus on improving adherence, making it more challenging for a specific intervention to demonstrate even better adherence. Improving medication adherence is difficult. Past research has shown behavioural interventions can increase medication adherence from low to moderate [1]. However, with antiretroviral therapy, the aim is to achieve greater than 95% adherence, an extremely high level in comparison with that needed for successful treatment of other illnesses [8]. It remains unclear what it will take to achieve this objective in HIV care. The ability to improve patients' knowledge about medication adherence has been previously demonstrated [49]. However, as in our study, it has also been shown that improving patients' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and its treatment may not be enough to change behaviour and increase medication adher\u00ad ence [49]. Intensive adherence interventions in the setting of HIV infection may be appropriate, as recent cost-effectiveness analyses have illustrated that it would even be cost-effective to institute expensive interventions, if improved adherence resulting in better viral suppression can be achieved [50]. Although the suggestion of implementing focused interventions to address risk factors for non-adherence in HIV-infected patients [51,52] is theoretically sound, attempts to improve adherence in this way have not been demon\u00ad strable. In the current study, a defined, repeated, multicomponent intervention to enhance adherence in HIV-infected individuals with a history of alcohol problems was not able to improve adherence or to significantly affect markers of HIV disease progression or alcohol consumption. To enhance adherence to ART in challenging popu\u00ad lations effectively, systematic interventions may be more effective than individually focused interventions. Directly observed therapy with the availability of addi\u00ad tional services has been shown to improve adherence during supervised medication administration in HIV\u00ad infected drug users [53]. Another systematic intervention is regimen simplification. In a study of self-report percep\u00ad tions, HIV-infected patients perceived that a twice-daily two-pill medication regimen with no dietary restrictions would yield higher adherence than more complicated regimens [54]. Future efforts to enhance adherence to antiretroviral medications in challenging populations, such as those with a history of alcohol problems, should focus on directly observed therapy and/or markedly simplified dosing regimens.

Aprospectivecohortof Introduction Detoxification services contribute approximately $4.7 billion (39.5%) of about $11.9 billion spent annually on substance abuse treatment in the United States (Harwood, Kallinis, & Liu, 2001; Lynskey, 1998; Mark et al., 2000). Some individuals use detoxification services frequently, accounting for a disproportionately large share of overall use, and do so without appropriate aftercare or treatment. In Corresponding author. 91 East Concord St., Suite 200, Boston, MA 02118, \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi: I0.1016/j.jsat.2005.05.005 one older study, 4% of patients accounted for nearly 25% of detoxifications, with nearly 51% of individuals receiving no continuing mental health and/or substance abuse treatment within 30 days of discharge (Richman, 1983). However, the substance abuse treatment system has made limited progress in addressing these challenges. Compared with those who do not have any addictions, substance-dependent individuals are more likely to have comorbid psychiatric illnesses, including major depression (Curran, Flynn, Kirchner, & Booth, 2000; Depression Guideline Panel, 1993; et al., 1998; Hesselbrock, Ross, German\u00ad118 c.W. Shanahan et al. / Journal 0.[Substance Abuse Treatment 29 (2005) 117-123 son, 1988). The medical, psychosocial, and financial costs of substance abuse are amplified by psychiatric comorbidity (Bums & Teesson, 2002; Davis, Macey, 2002; et al., 1996; Stein, O'Sullivan, Ellis, Perrin, & Wartenberg, 1993). Not surprisingly, comorbid mental health problems among people undergoing substance abuse treatment are associated with higher levels of impairment (Najavits, Weiss, & Shaw, 1999; Stoffelmayr, Benishek, Humphreys, Lee, & Mavis, 1989) and/or worse treatment outcomes (Amaro, 1999; Grella, 1996; Safer, 1987). Psychotic disorders, particularly severe Axis I disorders, predict treatment dropout and relapse (Brown et al., 1995; Curran, Kirchner, Worley, Rookey, & Booth, 2002). Likewise, Axis Il-related disorders such as symptoms of depression, somatization, and hostility are associated with treatment dropout; both the type and severity of psychopathology predict treatment attrition (Bovasso, 2001; Haller, Miles, & Dawson, 2002; Hasin & Grant, 2002). In addition, other factors may contribute to the probability that an individual will return for detoxification. For example, among homeless individuals, exposure to postdetoxification stabilization programs predicted delay in resumption of substance use after detoxification (Kertesz, Horton, Friedmann, Saitz, & Samet, 2003). Although this body of research suggests that comorbid mental health problems may increase the like\u00ad lihood of repeat use of detoxification services, this health services research question has not been explicitly addressed. In this study, we examined depressive symptoms (DS) and mental health functioning (MHF) after residential detoxification to determine their ability to predict recurrent use of detoxification services. Potentially, patient character\u00ad istics might help identify individuals at risk for repeat detoxification. Interventions to reduce the likelihood of future repeat detoxifications could then be targeted toward high-risk patients. We hypothesized that the presence of greater DS or worse MHF assessed after initial detoxifica\u00ad tion predicts repeat residential detoxification. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study design and population We conducted a secondary analysis of data obtained prospectively from the cohort of patients enrolled in the Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care (HELP) study who returned for interviews on one to four occasions during a 24-month follow-up period. The study, conducted in an urban short-term inpatient detoxification unit, was a randomized controlled trial of a multidisciplinary health evaluation session (the HELP intervention) designed to link substance\u00ad dependent persons without primary care physicians to out\u00ad patient primary medical care (Samet et al., 2003). The randomization allocated 205 and 195 subjects eligible for this analysis into the intervention and control groups, respectively. Eligibility criteria included the following: inpatient detoxification admission; being older than 17 years; and having alcohol, heroin, or cocaine as the substance offirst or second choice. Exclusion criteria were as follows: at least one visit to a primary care provider in the preceding 2 years; pregnancy; a Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) score lower than 21; lack of fluency in either English or Spanish; less than three contacts available to facilitate follow-up; and having specific plans to leave the Boston area within 24 months. Trained research associates identified 642 trial-eligible subjects, of whom 470 (73%) consented to be in the HELP trial, within 24-72 hours of initial admission for detox\u00ad ification. Research associates performed a 60- to 90-minute interview with all subjects prior to their discharge. Follow\u00ad up interviews were attempted with subjects every 6 months after the baseline interview for up to 24 months. Data from 995 follow-up interviews among 85% of the enrolled subjects (N = 400) were available. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. The Spanish instruments were translated from English, back translated by a different individual, reviewed for discrepancies, and corrected. Subjects were modestly compensated for their time in the interview. As previously reported, we used exhaustive techniques to track subjects enrolled in the HELP trial over the follow-up period (Samet et al., 2003). The institutional review board of the Boston Medical Center approved this research. All subjects provided informed consent and all the procedures followed were in accord with the standards of the institutional review board. 2.2. Administrative data In Massachusetts, all facilities receiving any public funding must report admission and discharge data for substance abuse treatment episodes to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Bureau of Substance Abuse Services. Subject use data were linked and extracted using a unique identifier. Each identifier-study subject match was validated by cross-checking the name code, sex, and birth date. Patients were also asked about addiction treatment during follow-up interviews to uncover additional treatment episodes (e.g., treatment from out-of-state facilities, general medical staff, self-help groups, or facilities receiving only private funds). For this study, a subset of administrative data collected from all Massachusetts addiction treatment use was extracted and matched to all subjects for the entire study period. These data records included information about substance abuse treatment use including detoxification services;outpatientand partial-daytreatmentprograms; short\u00ad and long-term residential treatments; and hospitalization. 2.3. Outcome variable For this prospective cohort analysis, the outcome variable of interest was the number of detoxification admissions per 119 c.w. Shanahan et al. / Journal ofSubstance Abuse Treatment 29 (2005) 117-123 6-month period following the initial detoxification admission for up to 24 months as recorded in the state administrative data. To ensure standard identification and enumeration of discrete detoxification episodes and minimize contamination by billing irregularities, we defined a single detoxification admission for a single subject as a 3-day window oftime. No repeat discharge could occur within 72 hours of previous discharge. This definition permitted consolidation of very short-term admission/discharge activities. 2.4. Explanatory variables 2.4.1. Depressive symptoms and mental health functioning The predictor variables examined were DS and MHF collected ateach follow-upinterview.Weused theCenterfor Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), a measure ofDS. We also used the mental component summary (MCS) subscale of the SF-36 to characterize MHF. Higher CES-D scores (range, 0-60) signify increased levels of DS and, conversely, higher MCS scores (range, 0-100) indicate better MHF. It is accepted that the manifestations of DS overlap substantially with the acute withdrawal syndrome. Further\u00ad more, it is widely acknowledged that most individuals experience withdrawal symptoms during acute detoxifica\u00ad tion. For this reason, our analysis did not include baseline DS and MHF information collected at study entry during the initial detoxification admission. 2.4.2. Covariates To adjust for suspected confounders, we selected covariates for inclusion in the multivariable analyses based on evidence from the literature and clinical experience. These covariates included age, race/ethnicity (White [refer\u00ad ence group], African American, Hispanic, and Other), homelessness (report of a night spent on the street or in a shelter in the past 6 months; Kertesz et aI., 2003), completion of high school education, employment (full time, part time, unemployed, other), any health insurance, current smoking, and problem substance (alcohol, heroin, cocaine) as well as a dichotomous indicator of random\u00ad ization assignment relating to the original trial. We defined a substance as a \"problem substance\" if subjects reported either 5 or more days of its use in the last 30 days or 1 or more years of its use three or more times per week in their lifetime (DeAlba, Samet, & Saitz, 2004). 2.5. Analyses Descriptive statistics were first used to characterize the sample. For the analysis, we modeled the outcome variable (detoxification admissions) as a count of each subject's individual detoxification admissions over each 6-month follow-up period to determine a rate during each period. Multivariable longitudinal Poisson regression (log link) models were constructed to assess the incidence rate ratio (IRR)ofadmissionsfordetoxification. Separatemodelswere fit for DS (Model A, containing CES-D) and MHF (Model B, containing MCS) as the main independent predictor of interest because CES-D and MCS are related but not identical measures. Updated information on CES-D and MCS from each follow-up interview was included in the model as a time\u00ad varying covariate. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for the clustering within subjects over time in the Poisson models (Zeger & Liang, 1986). An independent working correlation model was assumed, along with an empirical variance estimator. The multivariable longitudinal Poisson regression models controlled for time (6, 12, 18, or 24 months) and other covariate predictors listed previously to provide 6-month IRRs. We first constructed parsimonious models focusing on either CES-D or MCS versus outcome (number of subsequent detoxifications/past 6 months) while adjusting for core predictors (time [6, 12, 18, or 24 months], age, sex, race, randomization group, alcohol to intoxication as problem substance, heroin as problem substance, cocaine as problem substance). We tested an interaction term between sex and DS (CES-D) and between sex and MHF (MCS) in corresponding adjusted models to detect and characterize possible differential sex effects. The two final fully adjusted models included additional predictors (homelessness, high school graduation, employment status, health insurance status, and smoking) to more thoroughly account for potential confounding. The descriptive analysis and Poisson regres\u00ad sion modeling were performed using SAS/STAT software (Version 8.2; Cary, NC).

Cohort characterization: descriptive statistics The demographic characteristics of the cohort are described in Table 1. The subjects had an average age of 36 years, 76% were male, 50% were Black, 34% were White, 10% were Hispanic, 70% completed high school, 47% reported home1essness, 39% had health insurance, and 86% currently smoked tobacco (Table 1). Of the 400 study subjects, 394 had 990 separate observations for Model A (CES-D) and 395 had 992 separate observations for Model B (MCS). Criteria for inclusion into either model were identical. The number of subjects and that of observations differ because of missing CES-D or MCS data. Over the entire 2-year observation period, 169 subjects (42%) were found to have one or more detoxification admissions. 3.2. Multivariable longitudinal poisson regression models (Model A, CES-D; Model B, MCS) In separate models, more severe DS and worse MHF were significantly associated with a higher rate of detoxification use following the initial detoxification admission (Table 2). The IRR for a lO-point increase in the CES-D was 1.2 (95% Table 2 Multivariable models of the association of repeat detoxification with DS (Model A), MHF (Model B), and other factors IRR (95% CI) Covariate Model A Model B CES_Da,b (lO-point) 1.18 (1.02-1.36) NA MCSc (lO-point) decrease (1.03-1.31) Age (decade) increase 0,9 0.9 (0.7-1.1) Female sex 0.5 (0.3-0.7) 0.5 (0.3-0.7) RacelEthnicity White 1.0 1.0 African American 0.7 (0.5-1.1) 0.7 (0.5-1.0) Hispanic 0.4 (0.2-0.7)* 0.4 (0.2-0.6)** smoking 1.2 (0.8-1.8) 1.2 (0.8-1.8) Problem substance Alcohol to intoxication 1.0 (0.6-1.6) 1.0 (0.6 -1.5) Cocaine 0.8 (0.5-1.1) 0.7 (0.5-1.1) Heroin 1.5 (1.1-2.2) 1.5 (1.0-2.1) Note.

Clinically significant worsening (10 points) of DS and MHF on objective scales predicted a 20% increased rate of detox\u00ad ification readmission. The likelihood of repeat detoxification was 50% greater for men and subjects with heroin as problem substance whereas it was 60% less for Hispanic subjects. Comparison of the parsimonious and fully adjusted versions of both Model A and Model B revealed minimal to no difference in the calculated IRRs. Finally, the likelihood of repeat detoxificationwasmorethan 50%greaterforhomeless individuals in both models (A and B). The results from only the fully adjusted models are presented in Table 2. No significant association was found between the number of detoxifications in either Model A or Model B and any ofthe additional suspected confounding variables added in the fully adjusted models, nor were significant interactions detected. Additional regression models for counts (zero-inflated Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial) were fit to assess the sensitivity of the over\u00ad dispersed Poisson model. The zero inflation models allowed the proportion of zeroes to vary by the CES-D score and the MCS score, respectively. All models yielded consistent inferences regarding the association of CES-D or MCS with the number of detoxification admissions. The results of these analyses are not reported in this article. 4. Discussion DS and MHF each, in separate models, impacted detoxification admission rates over a 2-year period. These effects were substantial, consistent, and sustained, thus indicating that greater detoxification use can be found among people with a greater degree of DS or a lower level of MHF status. This finding was demonstrated similarly in a population-based study in which DS predicted greater overall medical care use despite adjust\u00ad ment for several measures of medical severity (Rowan, Davidson, Campbell, Dobrez, & MacLean, 2002). How\u00ad ever, the mechanism for this phenomenon is not entirely clear. In one study, elevated risk of substance abuse relapse after treatment discharge was related to patients diagnosed with depression (Curran et al., 2000). It is plausible that this group of patients might be more likely to seek help and consequently have increased detoxifica\u00ad tion use. However, this seems unlikely based on evidence that depressed patients are three times more likely than nondepressed patients to be noncompliant with medical treatment recommendations and perhaps, by extension, health-seeking behaviors in general (DiMatteo, Lepper, & Croghan, 2000). Alternatively, barriers to treatment (e.g., perceived separation between mental health and general health, stigma, cost, lack of time or confidentiality, and fear of documentation or unwanted intervention; Givens C 121 C.W Shanahan et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 29 (2005) l/7-123 & Tjia, 2002; Van Hook, 1999) might explain delayed but eventually greater overall use of detoxification services. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate this mechanism. Prior studies demonstrate that DS and MHF are strong but somewhat erratic predictors of several important substance abuse treatment outcomes. For example, DS increase the likelihood of relapse in abstinent individuals during the transitional period between short- and long-term treatment (Curran, Flynn, et al., 2000; Curran, Kirchner, et al., 2002). Furthermore, in substance abusers, depression decreases the functional health status and subjective quality oflife (Rudolf & Priebe, 2002) and significantly increases risk for suicide (Cornelius et al., 1995; Dhossche, Meloukheia, & Chakra\u00ad vorty, 2000). However, in contrast, depression was favorably associated with treatment outcomes (longer duration of abstinence and greater decreases in symptomatology) in a study of individuals interviewed within 3 months of starting outpatient substance abuse treatment (Charney, Paraherakis, Negrete, & Gill, 1998). Our study tested the hypothesis that DS increase the likelihood of return to detoxification after an initial detoxification. Direct associations were detected between repeat detoxification and sex, race/ethnicity, home\u00ad lessness, and heroin as problem substance (Table 2); however, no significant interaction was detected either between sex and DS or between sex and MHF. The IRR for repeat detoxification admissions among Hispanic subjects was 60% less than that found in Whites. Although it is possible that race may represent a proxy for unmeasured sociodemographic characteristics, we included several potential confounders to minimize the likelihood that the adjusted models would misattribute the effects of any variable. No significant relationship was detected between these additional potential confounders to detox\u00ad ification use in the fully adjusted models. This ethnic disparity for detoxification readmission remains unex\u00ad plained by our investigation. However, other investigators have noted differences in treatment use across ethnic lines (Arroyo, Westerberg, & Tonigan, 1998; Brecht, von Mayrhauser, & Anglin, 2000; Cherpitel, 2001). Subjects reporting heroin as a problem substance were 50% more likely than those not reporting this to be admitted for detoxification within a 6-month period. Current research has still not provided a consistent under\u00ad standing of the influence of specific problem substances on substance abuse treatment use. For example, while opioid\u00ad dependent persons have higher rates of general health care use (Darke, Ross, Teesson, & Lynskey, 2003), paradoxi\u00ad cally, long-term cocaine or heroin users are more likely than nonusers to not want health care treatment and to put off seeking needed health care (McCoy, Metsch, Chitwood, & Miles, 2001). Although this latter study demonstrates a negative relationship between problem substance and treatment use, it is equally plausible that delayed preventive care and treatment results in more urgent presentation for more intensive treatment. In persons presenting for detoxification, the likelihood of detoxification readmission being enhanced by increased DS or impaired MHF could be explained by several plausible mechanisms. First, a lowered threshold for care seeking could lead to an increased frequency of treatment seeking. Second, an increased likelihood for inappropriate or illicit self-medication of DS may hasten detoxification readmis\u00ad sion. Finally, repeat detoxification could result from a negative impact on the protective behaviors that lessen the risk of substance abuse behaviors. Examples include both low-level substance use heightening the risk of relapse and the need for treatment as well as decreased substance abuse treatment adherence leading to a diminished likelihood for therapeutic success after detoxification. Further studies on the type and intensity of services rendered, the acuity of dependence, withdrawal, and comorbid psychiatric burden at presentation as well as detailed longitudinal evaluations of treatment may make it possible to distinguish between these possible mechanisms. Up until the present, inconsistent effects have been detected in the relationship between depression and sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment use. However, these analyses have had limitations. Most studies use subject self-report out\u00ad comes. In addition, most studies define the dependent variable as a single time event, \"time to first drink\" (Greenfield et al., 1998). However, without actual counts of detoxification admissions, accurate rates of treatment use are not calculable. This study uses a multivariable Poisson regression analysis, which, as a more comprehensive modeling strategy, permits more accurate and efficient use of a state's substance abuse treatment use data. This modeling method not only validates the existence of a contemporaneous relationship between psychiatric health status and substance abuse treatment use but also provides an estimate of the relative contributions of relevant predictors. Moreover, the magnitude and consistency of the relationship as demonstrated by this analytic approach using two separate but related measures (CES-D and MCS) suggest that both DS and MHF have clinically meaningful effects on detoxification use. These data also support efforts to identify patients with a history of recent detoxification who are coincidently bur\u00ad dened with excessive comorbid DS or particularly low MHF and provide a rationale for testing interventions aimed at optimizing substance abuse treatment in individuals at risk for future repeat detoxifications (Novacek & Raskin, 1998). Several instruments have been developed to screen for depression in general medical settings (Williams, Noel, Cordes, Ramirez, & Pignone, 2002). In addition to the CES-D, such instruments include the Beck Depression Inventory, Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Although treat\u00ad ment of comorbid OS among substance-dependent persons appears to have some benefit (Cornelius, Bukstein, et al., 2004; Cornelius, Maisto, et al., 2004; Nunes & Levin, 2004), 122 c.W. Shanahan et al. I Journal ofSubstance Abuse Treatment 29 (2005) 117-123 it is not known whether this salutary effect would impact the sizeable subset of individuals who continue to cycle through detoxification programs. These data provide a rationale for future investigations to evaluate specific treatment interven\u00ad tions aimed at individuals exhibiting DS to determine whether a reduction in rates of repeat detoxification use can be achieved. Although not measured by the present study, this research calls to mind interventions that would reduce many of the negative consequences of depression (e.g., lost productivity, suicide, and overall increased health care use), which in tum could provide considerable additional benefit to this population (Dhossche et al., 2000; Frasure-Smith et al., 2000; Goldman, Nielsen, & Champion, 1999; Jackson, Manning, & Wells, 1995; Kessler et al., 1996; Pearson et al., 1999; Preuss et al., 2002; Rowan et al., 2002; Simon, VonKorff, & Barlow, 1995). 4.1. Limitations This investigation has some limitations. Despite adjust\u00ad ing for several known potential confounders and using extensive data collected prospectively, it remains possible that there are additional unaccounted confounders that may explain our findings. It is also possible that all detoxification admissions might not have been captured in the administrative database. However, it is unlikely that the study population would seek detoxification from programs not receiving public funding. It is reassuring however that 100% of the study subjects were found in the administrative database based on their index detoxification admission. Finally, there are limits to the mental health measures that we used. For example, CES-D DS do not correlate well with a diagnosis of depression. In addition, the DS and MHF measures used in this investigation have not been validated explicitly on a population with alcohol or drug dependence. 4.2. Conclusions and implications Greater DS or worse MHF is associated with future repeat detoxification use. These findings suggest that assessing patients for increased levels of DS and worse MHF after discharge from detoxification can identify individuals at a higher risk for repeat detoxification. Mental health interventions targeting these individuals might decrease subsequent detoxification service use and costs and thus represent an appropriate focus of future studies.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE Do Variations in Disease Prevalence Limit the Usefulness of Population-Based Hospitalization Rates for Studying Variations in Hospital Admissions? Michael Shwartz, PhD, * Erol A. Pekoz, PhD, * Arlene S. Ash, PhD, t Michael A. Posner, MS,! Joseph D. Restuccia, DrPH, * and Lisa I. Iezzoni, MD\u00a7 Background: Studies of geographic variation in hospitalizations commonly examine age- and gender-adjusted population-based hos\u00ad pitalization rates (ie, the numbers of persons hospitalized relative to what is expected given the age/gender distributions in the area population). Objective: To determine whether areas identified as extreme using population-based hospitalization rates remain extreme when ranked by disease-based hospitalization rates (the numbers of persons hospitalized relative to what is expected given the amount of disease in the area). Design: The authors examined 1997 Medicare data on both inpatient admissions and outpatient visits of patients 65 years and older in each of 71 small areas in Massachusetts for 15 medical conditions. For each area, the number of people having each condition was calculated as the sum of those hospitalized plus those treated as outpatients only. The authors used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to estimate area-specific population-based hospitalization rates, dis\u00ad ease-based hospitalization rates (DHRs), and disease prevalence. Main Outcome Measure: The extent to which the same areas were identified as extreme based on population-based hospitalization rates versus DHRs. Results: Area-specific population-based hospitalization rates, DHRs, and disease prevalence varied substantially. Areas identified as extreme using population-based hospitalization rates often were not extreme when ranked by DHRs. For 11 of the 15 conditions,S or more of the 14 areas ranked in top and bottom deciles by population-based hospitalization rates were more likely than not (ie, with probability ~ 0.50) to be at least 2 deciles less extreme when ranked by DHRs.

Wilkins ISSN: 0025-7079/05/4301-0004 Conclusion: Differences in disease prevalence can limit the useful\u00ad ness ofpopulation-based hospitalization rates for studying variations in hospital admissions. Key Words: small-area variations, hospital utilization, disease prevalence (Med Care 2005;43: 4-11) Many studies have reported large differences in age- and gender-adjusted rates of hospitalization across small geographic areas.1-13 Studies of surgery and procedures'P\"!\" and medical conditionsi\" have found that higher rates of inappropriateness do not explain higher hospitalization rates. Despite this, some suggest that savings are possible without sacrificing quality of care by reducing rates in high-rate areas to levels in lower rate areas.21,22 This suggestion assumes that much of the variation is due to \"practice style\" differences, either \"uncertainty\" about best treatment practices\" or \"en\u00ad thusiasm\" for one type of treatment over another.i\" which only minimally affect health care outcomes. Area-specific hospitalization rates are population based because denominators used in calculating the rates reflect the populations in the areas rather than the numbers of people within areas who have the disease. Differences in age- and gender-adjusted population-based hospitalization rates might be due to differences in the likelihood that patients with the disease are admitted to the hospital. Alternatively, they may reflect differences in disease prevalence. The most widely used approach to account for differ\u00ad ences in disease burden across areas is to adjust area-specific rates further for differences in hospitalization rates for se\u00ad lected marker conditions chosen as proxies for the underlying burden of illness in the population (eg, hospitalizations for hip fracture, colon or lung cancer treated surgically, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke ).25 This approach hypoth\u00ad esizes that hospitalization rates for the marker conditions are highly correlated with the total amount of other diseases in an Medical Care Volume 43, Number 1, January 2005 Copvrlqht @ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The hypothesis has some merit, as suggested by the finding that variation in such marker conditions explains about 25% of the variation in age-, gender-, and race-adjusted Medicare spending across regions.22 However, use of marker conditions as a proxy for the prevalence of other diseases has not been validated. Also, when examining variations in hos\u00ad pitalization rates for specific conditions, the conceptual jus\u00ad tification for using markers as a measure of prevalence is weaker. Over the last decade, several groups have developed risk assessment models that use both inpatient and ambula\u00ad tory claims to identify diseases and predict costs.\" Their success indicates that although diagnosis codes on claims forms are imperfect indicators of true disease prevalence, they contain useful information about the medical problems that are present. Especially in a Medicare population, in which most beneficiaries are insured for both inpatient and outpatient care, differences across areas in amount of disease as determined from claims forms should reflect, reasonably well, differences in underlying disease prevalence. In this study we used Medicare data from both inpatient and outpatient claims to identify people with any of 15 medical conditions. For each condition and geographic area, we calculated both the population-based hospitalization rate (the number of people hospitalized relative to the number expected given the age/gender distribution of the population in the area) and the disease-based hospitalization rate (the number of people hospitalized relative to the number ex\u00ad pected given the amount of disease in the area). We then examined the extent to which the same areas were ranked as either particularly high or low using the 2 measures. METHODS Database We studied hospitalizations and outpatient treatment of Medicare patients older than 65 years of age in Massachusetts in 1997. Hospitalization data were obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, formerly the Health Care Financing Administration) MedPAR file. Outpa\u00ad tient data were obtained from the CMS 1997 Carrier File (claims data for part B physician/supplier services) and Out\u00ad patient File (claims data for outpatient facility charges at hospitals and other institutions). Conditions Table 1 shows the 15 medical conditions in our study, defined initial1y by diagnosis-related group (DRG). As de\u00ad scribed elsewhere.F' within most DRGs we increased clinical homogeneity by considering only discharges with a principal diagnosis from selected ICD-9-CM codes. All 15 conditions had at least 1000 people hospitalized and 6000 treated as outpatients only in 1997. Determining Numerators and Denominators Disease prevalence cannot be inferred from claims for Medicare beneficiaries in health maintenance organizations (HMOs; because their outpatient claims are not submitted to CMS) or those not eligible for outpatient and physician office (part B) reimbursement. Thus, we wanted to include in our analyses only non-HMO part B-eligible enrollees. We did not have individual-level eligibility information. As a proxy for part B eligibility of hospitalized patients, we only counted hospitalized patients with at least I part B bill in 1997 TABLE 1.

We also eliminated from hospitalization counts the approximately 5% of discharges in the MedPAR file in which an HMO was the payer. We identified outpatient visits, including office, nursing and rest home, and home visits from CPT codes?7 Diagnosis coding for outpatient visits is generally less reliable than inpatient coding and is governed by somewhat different rules. To reflect the potential effect of different coding rules, we used 2 methods to assign outpatient visits to conditions: one based on a \"series\" of outpatient visits and a second based on a single visit. For inpatients, coding guidelines instruct ab\u00ad stractors to code a diagnosis accompanied by such phrases as \"rule out,\" \"suspect,\" or \"question\" as if the disease had actually occurred. For outpatients, coding guidelines stipulate that only confirmed diagnoses be coded to their highest level of specificity. As a result, a series of outpatient visits may carry multiple codes as the physician attempts to confirm a diagnosis. Because we wished to capture only \"final\" diag\u00ad noses, we proceeded as follows: We considered any outpa\u00ad tient visit within 6 weeks of a previous outpatient visit to be part of the same series of visits. Only diagnostic codes on the last visit in a series were used to identify the conditions being addressed. We required a gap of at least 8 weeks (ie, an additional 2-week buffer) to establish the beginning of a new series. We examined the sensitivity of conclusions to an ap\u00ad proach that ignored visit series and identified the conditions being addressed based on the presence of any relevant diag\u00ad nosis at any single visit. Because findings concerning the concordance between population-based and disease-based rates were similar for both approaches, we only report anal\u00ad yses using the \"visit series\" method. We considered the numbers of people with each con\u00ad dition, either treated in the hospital or as outpatient only, rather than the numbers of admissions or outpatient visits, primarily because the number of people who have a diagnosis is a more direct measure of underlying disease prevalence than service counts, which also reflect practice style.28 Most variation in overall hospitalization rates is caused by varia\u00ad tions in the number of people hospitalized.i\" By focusing on numbers of people rather than numbers of events, we can estimate the observed amount of disease in an area as the total of people hospitalized plus those treated as outpatients only. For each 5-year age category from 65 years and older, and for each gender, we determined the number of Medicare enrollees in each zip code in Massachusetts from the Annual Zip Code Enrollment File. Creating Small Geographic Areas As described elsewhere,27,29 we used Ward's clustering algorithm to create small geographic areas. Ward's clustering algorithm30,3 1 creates areas by combining zip codes based on similarity in the proportion of total hospital discharges from the zip code that were from each hospital. Discharges of patients with the following characteristics were used in clus\u00ad tering: age 65 years or older, Massachusetts resident, and discharged in 1997 from a hospital in Massachusetts paid under Medicare's Prospective Payment System. The results of the clustering were 71 small areas with the following distribution of residents 65 years and older: 20 areas had less than 5000; 21 had 5000 to 9999; 19 had 10,000 to 19,999; and II areas had more than 20,000. Analysis We considered 3 types of area-specific \"relative rates\" (referred to more simply as \"rates\"), defined as observed counts divided by expected. Population-based hospitalization rate = number of people hospitalized relative to the number expected. Disease prevalence = sum of people hospitalized plus those treated as outpatients only (ie, the number with the disease) relative to the number expected (we use the term prevalence rather than rate to emphasize what this rate is measuring). Disease-based hospitalization rate = proportion of people with the disease that were hospitalized relative to the ratio of the expected number hospitalized to the expected num\u00ad ber with the disease. Let 0ij = number of people hospitalized (ie, treated as inpatients) in area j 00j = number of people treated as outpatients only in area j Ei j = expected number of people hospitalized in area j Eo j = expected number of people treated as outpatients only in area j Both E ij and E o j are adjusted for age and gender distribution in the area using indirect standardization.V Ob\u00ad served relative rates are calculated as follows: Observed population-based hospitalization rate = OijlE i j Observed disease rate = (OU + Ooj)/(E ij + Eo j) Observed disease-based hospitalization rate Ooj) E/(E + Eo j) (Oij + Ooj)/(Eij + Eo j) The rates are centered at I because over all areas the observed number of events is equal to the number expected. Because population-based hospitalization rate equals disease\u00ad based hospitalization rate multiplied by disease prevalence, population-based hospitalization rates are similar to disease\u00ad based hospitalization rates only when disease prevalence varies little across the area from what is expected based on age and gender alone. We ranked areas from lowest to highest according to their population-based hospitalization rates. Areas in the first decile (ranks 1-7) had the lowest rates and those in the last \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copyright @ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. 6 Medical Care Volume 43, Number 1, January 2005 Population,-Based Hospitalization Rates decile (ranks 65-71) had the highest. We call areas in these deciles extreme. For each extreme area, we examined its ranking according to its disease-based hospitalization rate. We present detailed results for heart failure (DRG 127), which has over 10,000 people treated as inpatients and nearly 40,000 treated as outpatients only. Using the observed rates as calculated in the previous equations as estimates of \"true\" underlying rates does not explicitly take into account random variation of \"true\" rates across areas.f To estimate \"true\" rates more accurately, we 38-specifically,used a hierarchical Bayesian modee3- a Poisson model with area treated as a random effect. We validated the model by showing that, across the 71 areas, inpatient and outpatient counts generated from the model corresponded well to the observed counts. (Details of the model and validation are available from the first author.) We estimated \"true\" rates in each area using Gibbs sampling as implemented in WINBUGS 1.4.39 These esti\u00ad mates can be thought of as weighted averages of the observed rates in each area (as calculated from the previous formulas) and the average rate over all areas in the state (which is 1, because our rates are relative rates). Thus, the weighting \"shrinks\" each observed rate toward I. We refer to these estimates as \"shrunken\" rates. The areas with the most shrinkage are those with the most extreme observed rates and those with the fewest people. Shrunken estimates are more accurate than traditional estimates in predicting small-area hospitalization rates.'\" Based on the posterior means from Gibbs sampling, we ranked each area using both population-based and disease\u00ad based rates. Ranks, even when based on shrunken estimates, are inherently unstable.\" To describe the extent to which areas were ranked differently when using population-based versus disease-based rates, we estimated how often (in re\u00ad peated Gibbs samples from the appropriate posterior distri\u00ad bution) the rank produced by the disease-based rate differed from the rank produced by the population-based rate by at least 2 deciles (14 or more ranks). In summarizing results across conditions, we report the number of the 14 extreme areas in which it was \"more likely than not\" (ie, probability 2: 0.50) that the disease-based rank differed by more than 2 deciles from the population-based rank. RESULTS Table I shows the number of people hospitalized and the number treated on an outpatient-only basis for each condition. We use heart failure (DRG 127) to illustrate the anal\u00ad yses. Table 2 shows the effect of shrinkage on both the population-based and the disease-based hospitalization rates for those areas in the lowest and highest decile based on their observed rates. For example, although the area with the smallest observed population-based hospitalization rate had \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins TABLE 2.

The area ranked 65th according to its observed population\u00ad based rate was particularly small. Its shrunken rate was pulled a lot toward I (from 1.30-1.08), such that after shrinkage it was ranked only 49th. Although shrunken estimates were less spread out than the observed rates, shrinkage rarely caused large changes in rank. In fact, among the 28 observed-versus\u00ad shrunken rank comparisons in Table 2, 22 changed by 3 ranks or less and only 2 comparisons (both relating to the very small area with 909 residents) changed ranks by 14 or more. We were primarily interested in the extent to which areas identified as extreme (ie, in the top and bottom deciles) according to their population-based hospitalization rate were also extreme according to their disease-based hospitalization rate. Table 3 shows for heart failure the shrunken population\u00ad based hospitalization rate and rank, and the shrunken disease\u00ad based hospitalization rate and rank, for the most extreme 14 areas according to their shrunken population-based rates. The area with the lowest population-based hospitalization rate (62% of expected, rank I) also had a low disease-based hospitalization rate (78% of expected, rank 3). We call the area with the second lowest population-based hospitalization rate (rank 2) \"area A\" (we refer to it again later). Although area A's population-based hospitalization rate was 65% of expected, based on its disease-based hospitalization rate (105% of expected), it was ranked 41st.

Of the 7 areas in the 10th decile (ranks 65-71) based on their population-based hospitalization rate, 3 were in the 7th decile or lower (ranks 50 or lower) based on their disease-based hospitalization rate. Notably, when using the disease-based hospitalization rate, 2 areas in the highest population-based hospitalization rate decile (ranks 65 and 67) were ranked lower (ranks 33 and 11 respectively) than 2 of the areas in the lowest population-based hospitalization rate decile (population-based hospitalization rate ranks 2 and 6, which were ranked 41st and 38th based on disease-based hospitalization rate). The right 2 columns in Table 3, which show estimates of disease prevalence, demonstrate why population-based hospitalization rates and disease-based hospitalization rates can be so different. Area A, discussed earlier, had 62% of the amount of disease expected (the lowest estimated disease prevalence). Its low population-based hospitalization rate was largely a reflection of the low disease prevalence in the area. After taking disease prevalence into account (by using the disease-based hospitalization rate), the area actually had 5% more hospitalizations than expected. All 7 areas with the lowest population-based hospitalization rates had very low levels of disease and, to a large extent, this explains their very low population-based hospitalization rates. The highest decile demonstrates the same phenomenon. The area ranked 67th in terms of its population-based hospitalization rate had 44% more disease than expected. When this was taken into ac\u00ad count, the proportion hospitalized in the area was 90% of expected rather than the 29% more than expected indicated by the population-based hospitalization rate. Figure 1 is a box plot of shrunken population-based and disease-based hospitalization rates for the 15 conditions. Many of the conditions exhibited more variability in rates than heart failure. For most of the conditions, population\u00ad based rates varied from around 50% of expected to 50% more than expected. Disease-based rates also varied considerably, although in most conditions somewhat less than population\u00ad based rates. Table 4 shows for each of the 15 conditions for areas in the top decile of population-based hospitalization rates, what their rank would be according to their disease-based hospi\u00ad talization rate. To illustrate, for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs, top row) the area ranked highest (71st) based on its population-based hospitalization rate was ranked 62nd based on its disease-based hospitalization rate; the area ranked second highest based on its population-based hospitalization rate (70th) was ranked 49th based on its disease-based hos\u00ad pitalization rate. The numbers in parentheses indicate the fraction of the time in repeated Gibbs samples from the posterior distributions of the ranks that the 2 ranks differed by at least 2 deciles (shown if the fraction was ~ 0.50). For example, for TIA for the highest ranked area based on its population-based hospitalization rate, there was a 0.50 chance that the disease-based hospitalization rate rank differed from the population-based hospitalization rate rank by at least 2 deciles.

For 7 conditions (TIA, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, chest pain, cellulitis, diabetes, and electrolyte disorder), 5 or 6 of the 14 extreme areas based on the population-based hospitalization rate were \"more likely than not\" to differ by at least 2 deciles when ranked by their disease-based hospitalization rate. Only for ischemic heart disease, angina, and syncope was it more likely than not that most of the areas (12 or more) were within 2 deciles when ranked by each rate. DISCUSSION Population-based hospitalization rates varied widely across small areas in Massachusetts. However, disease prev\u00ad alence also varied widely. Because of differences in disease prevalence, areas with extreme population-based hospitaliza\u00ad tion rates were not necessarily areas in which a particularly high or low proportion of those with the disease were admit\u00ad ted to the hospital, relative to what was expected given the age and gender distribution in the area. Our approach relies on claims data to identify people with specific diseases. Because of concern about the validity of disease identification from outpatient codes, we conducted analyses using both a stringent definition (the series method) and a lenient definition (which considered all visits) for identifying disease from diagnostic codes on outpatient claims. Both analyses showed substantial differences in area ranks when calculated with population-based versus disease\u00ad based rates. However, claims data can be imperfect in many ways and are unlikely to capture all conditions noted on the medical record.\" Our conclusions do not depend on accu\u00ad rately estimating actual disease prevalence, but on estimating relative disease prevalence (ie, how much more or less disease one area has compared with another). The key as\u00ad sumption behind our analysis is that outpatient coding is not systematically biased across areas. However, areas with bet\u00ad ter access to technology or more specialists may identify more disease than other areas with a similar disease burden, or they may code presentations to justify use of the technol\u00ad ogy or referral to specialists. We are currently exploring the potential for such bias by examining the relationship, within areas, between specialist physician supply and claims-based disease prevalence. Another concern when identifying disease from claims is that higher rates of coded disease may reflect better access to primary care or may be a proxy for either physician or hospital bed supply. In a Medicare population eligible for \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Also, by focusing on the number of people with any visit for a condition rather than total numbers of medical encounters by those with the con\u00ad dition, we reduce the effect of practice style on our measure of disease prevalence. If supply were the main factor driving demand, the same areas that have high rates of disease would have high rates of hospitalization among those with the disease. Correlations between disease prevalence and the proportion of those with the disease who were hospitalized were, in fact, statistically significant for 9 of the 15 condi\u00ad tions. However, in all 9, the correlation was negative. Finally, despite concerns about outpatient coding, CMS judges them sufficiently valid that, starting in 2004, it will accept diag\u00ad noses from either inpatient or outpatient claims to calculate health-based payments to Medicare+Choice HMOs for the Medicare beneficiaries they enroll. As health care costs continue to outpace general infla\u00ad tion, pressure is mounting to revitalize certificate-of-need programs. For example, the Wall Street Journal recently wrote: \"the Big Three [auto companies] have lobbied aggres\u00ad sively to keep certificate-of-need programs in states such as Missouri and have fought ardently for the establishment of programs in Ohio and Indiana.r''\" Vermont recently issued a request for proposal for consultation services to develop a health resource allocation plan to guide health facility plan\u00ad ning and capital expenditures. Hospital capacity is a major focus of such programs. Motivating decisions about hospital capacity are area-specific hospitalization rates. Our analyses suggest that disease prevalence rather than population counts provide a more appropriate denominator for such rates. Un\u00ad fortunately, outpatient claims are not widely available. At a minimum, our study indicates that databases with outpatient as well as inpatient claims are needed to address better the research and policy questions raised by geographic varia\u00ad tions. Many current quality improvement efforts examine process measures for patients with specific conditions (eg, whether specifically identified patients with heart disease receive appropriate medications or diabetic patients receive appropriate assessment and preventive therapy). Whether patients with specific conditions are hospitalized is an impor\u00ad tant process measure, both because of iatrogenic events and costs. Although we have focused on variations across geo\u00ad graphic areas, our approach applies as well to examining variations in hospitalizations across physician practices. Be\u00ad cause of small samples, shrinkage estimators are even more important in this setting. Our study examined only 15 medical conditions using 1 year of data from 1 state. Also, some Medicare beneficiaries use both Veteran Administration (VA) and non-VA facilities and we have not included diagnostic or utilization data from VA facilities.43,4 4 Nonetheless, the large differences in dis\u00adease prevalence across small areas that remain after adjusting for age and gender raise concerns about the value of popu\u00ad lation-based hospitalization rates for studying hospital utili\u00ad zation and drawing inferences about physician practice styles.

None had been treated for HCV and only 30% had been evaluated for HCV treatment. While only 34% knew about HCV treatment, 54% of the sample became bdefinitely interested Qin HCV treatment after hearing the risks and benefits. Men were approximately five times more likely than women to know of some HCV treatment. Whites wereseven times and Latinos were about six times more likely than African-Americans to know about HCV treatment. Our findings suggestthat methadone programs can play an important role in increasing access to HCV treatment through educating patients about treatment options. D2005 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States. Injec-tion drug users (IDU) account for 60% of new HCV infec-tions ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998 ). Advancements in HCV treatment have proved effective at decreasing viral activity, producing sustained viral response rates of 40-80% depending on viral genotype ( National Institutes of Health, 2002 ). However, the 6- to 12-month treatment course requires regular monitoring and manage-ment for significant side effects including cytopenias anddepression ( Ho et al., 2001; National Institutes of Health, 2002 ). Because of these monitoring requirements there have been concerns about treating IDUs for HCV. WouldHCV-positive IDUs accept HIV treatment? Would theyadhere to the treatment regimen? Could the side effects bemonitored? Would HCV treatment exacerbate psychiatricillness? ( Davis Johnson, Fisher, Fenaughty, & Theno, 1998 ). Perhaps because of these concerns, early consensus guidelines on HCV treatment recommended delaying treat-ment for 6 months after patients who drank alcohol orused illicit drugs stopped ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998; National Institutes of Health, 1997 ). There have been ethical challenges to these guidelines recommend-ing the withholding of HCV treatment from IDUs ( Edlin et al., 2001 ), and two published case series have demon- strated that IDUs in drug treatment can be successfully 0740-5472/05/$ - see front matter D2005 Elsevier Inc.

Adult Medicine, Dimock Community Health Center, 55 Dimock Street, Boston, MA 02119, E-mail address: Walley).Journal ( 2001; Sylvestre, ). Thus the 2002 NIH Consensus Statement on HCV infection calls for increasedavailability of treatment to patients such as IDUs who were previously considered ineligible ( National Institutes of Health, 2002 ). About 20% of the 810,000 heroin users in the United States receive treatment for opiate dependence at methadoneprograms, and HCV prevalence among methadone clients to be 66-93% ( et al., & Burke, Murrill et al., 2002; Piccolo et al., 2002 ). Key components of drug treatment include education and counseling about transmission of blood borne pathogens, including hepatitis C ( Astone, Strauss, Vassilev, ). Some methadone clinics have linked drug treatment, primary care and HIV treatmentservices ( Friedmann, Alexander, & D'Aunno, Pabst, & Bigelow, 1994 ). Understanding what methadone patients know about hepatitis C treatment and learning whether they have beenevaluated or treated are important first steps in determiningthe role for methadone clinics in hepatitis C screening,education, evaluation, and treatment. Therefore, in thisstudy, we sought to determine patients Tknowledge of and interest in HCV treatment among patients at a university-affiliated county hospital-based methadone clinic. 2. Methods 2.1. Design, setting, and sample We conducted a cross sectional survey of clients receiving methadone at a university-affiliated, public hospital-based, opiate addiction treatment program between June and December 2002. This clinic offers approximately 460 treat-ment slots: 100 for methadone detoxification treatment(MDT) and 360 for methadone maintenance treatment(MMT). Serving the indigent population of the county, theclinic does not require insurance or exclude patients unableto pay. The clinic admits new MDT patients on a dailywalk-in basis. A nurse practitioner examines admitted MDT patients and offers optional screening for syphilis and hepa- titis A, B, and C. The hospital counseling and testing ser-vice screens patients for HIV. The MMT program recruitsits patients from the MDT program. Demand for MMT ishigher than available spots, so the MMT program selectspatients based on medical severity; patients with a higherburden of co-existing illness, such as HIV or mental illness,receive priority for MMT. An addiction counselor meets regularly with each MDT and MMT patient. The clinic provides mental health treatment and HIV primary care forMMT patients who do not receive these services elsewhere.MDT lasts 21 to 90 days with a tapered methadone dose.During data collection times, clinic staff informed each patient coming into clinic of the study and directedinterested patients to research staff. Research staff con-ducted interviews on different days and during different times of day, including weekends to include patients with different schedules. All participants provided signed in-formed consent and the Committee on Human Research atthe University of California, San Francisco, approved thestudy design. 2.2. Data collection One of seven trained interviewers conducted a 20-min face-to-face interview with each participant. Interviewertraining included several practice interviews with studyauthors and approximately five supervised interviews withstudy participants. All data for the study were by self-report. Study staff did not review medical records, due to resource constraints.Demographic questions included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and employment. Health information included treatment status (MMT or MDT), HIV status ( bever had a testQandbwhat you were told were your results Q), and HCV status (ever had a positive test or told by a health careprofessional that you were infected with hepatitis C). Threequestions surveyed knowledge of HCV disease ( bof those infected, how many get sick Q;bhow long does it take to become sick Q; and bcan someone die from hepatitis C Q). We asked questions about knowledge of transmission (bdo people get infected from sharing needles Q;b...from sharing cookers, cottons or rinse water Q) and treatment (bdo you know of any treatments or medications for hepatitis C infection Q). We asked if subjects had ever been evaluated for HCV treatment ( bhave you been evaluated for hepatitis C treat- mentQ;bhave you ever had an appointment with a liver or GI specialist for hepatitis C infection Q;bhave you ever had a liver biopsy for hepatitis C infection Q) and if they were undergoing or had completed treatment for HCV. Follow-ing these questions, we provided information about HCVinfection and treatment, and then we asked about interestin treatment ( Box). Subjects answered using a five-point Likert scale from bdefinitely not interested Qtobdefinitely interested Q. Upon completion of the interview the partici- pant received $5 and an information pamphlet about HCV infection. 2.3. Analysis We describe the sample in terms of demographic and health characteristics by treatment status (MDT vs. MMT).We made statistical comparisons between these groups and the overall clinic population (using Student Tst, Chi Square and Fisher Ts Exact test) to determine how similar the sample was to the clinic population. Information on gender,race/ethnicity, education, and HIV status was available forA.Y. Walley et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 28 (2005) 181-187 182MMT clients enrolled at the clinic for approximately the same time period, July 2002 to March 2003, as the study.Information on the MDT clinic population was not available for this time period, and so the comparison was limited to MMT clients. We collapsed certain variables for analysis. Gender, which included transgender categories, was collapsed intobbirth sex, Qmeaning sex at birth. HIV and HCV status were dichotomized into positive vs. all other responses (negative,donTt know, declined). We defined evaluation for HCV treatment as those who answered that they had been evaluated. Those who reported that they had never been evaluated for HCV treatment ( n= 8), but who were positive for HCV and reported either a GI appointment or a liverbiopsy, were also coded as having been evaluated for HCVtreatment. Interest in treatment was collapsed intobdefinitely interested Qvs. all other responses.We conducted separate analyses on the following out- comes: (1) knowledge of treatment; (2) having been eval-uated for treatment; (3) receipt or completion of treatment;and (4) interest in treatment under an assumption of being infected with HCV. First, we described the proportion that was positive for each outcome. We then examined socio-demographic and methadone treatment status with eachoutcome in univariate analysis to determine variables thatwere significant for inclusion in a multivariable logisticregression. For each categorical variable, a reference wasselected for comparisons. For example, African Americanswere selected as the reference group for ethnicity, and each other group was compared to African Americans. All analyses were done using SPSS software, with alpha = 0.10 Table 1 Demographic and health-related characteristics of the study sample by methadone treatment category (methadone detoxification [MDT], meth-adone maintenance [MMT]), and characteristics of main-tenance CharacteristicTotal study sample 25)MMT study sample (n= 85)MMT clinic (n= 469) Age Mean 45 42 46 na Median (range) 47 (19-62)44 (19-57)47 (21-62) Gender (% male) 66 68 66 64 Race/Ethnicity (%) African American 43 32 46 35White 35 44 33 50 Hispanic/Latino 14 16 13 10 Other/Mixed/ Declined88 8 6 Education (%) Less than high school31 28 32 40 High School 50 56 48 38 Some college and higher19 19 20 22 Employed (%) 9 20 6 na HIV positive (%) 26 0 33 39 HCV positive (%) 81 64 86 na Know about HCV treatment (%)34 44 31 na Ever evaluated for HCV treatment (%)30 8 36 na Undergoing or completed treatment for HCV (%)00 0 n a Interested in HCV treatment (%)Definitely 54 80 46 na Probably 22 12 25 Not sure 16 0 21Probably not 5 4 6Definitely not 3 4 2 na = not available. HCV = hepatitis C virus. HIV = human immunodeficiency virus.Box. Interest in HCV treatment question. Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver. There are medications to treat hepatitis C infection, called inter-feron and ribavirin. I Tm going to tell you a few things about the virus and the medications and then ask you how interested you think you might be in gettingtreatment. !People with chronic hepatitis C who don Tt take any medications have about a 1 in 5 chance of gettingcirrhosis (severe liver disease) at some point intheir life. !Usually a liver biopsy is required before starting treatment. A liver biopsy is a common test to checkfor damage caused by hepatitis C. It is done bytaking out some cells from the liver using a needleplaced in your right side just below the rib cage. !The medications usually include shots and pills. The shots usually need to be taken once a week forat least 6 months and often a full year. The pills need to be taken two times every day. !The medications make about half of the people who take them feel achy, like they have the flu\u2014irritable, tired, or depressed, throughout the timethey take the medicine. !People who finish the medications have about a 50% chance of getting rid of the hepatitis C viruscompletely. !If you do get rid of the virus, you can probably get it again if you share syringes, cookers, cottons, orrinse water with anyone. Knowing these things AND assuming you been in- fected with the hepatitis C virus, how interested wouldyou say you are in taking medications for the hepatitisC infection during the next year?A.Y.

Results 3.1. Characteristics of the study population A total of 110 clients participated in the study. Infor- mation is not available on the number or characteristics ofthose who refused. Demographic and health-related charac-teristics of the sample are shown on Table 1 , for the total sample, by MDT and MMT status, and for the MMT clinic population. The MMT study sample had a larger proportionof African Americans, a smaller proportion of employed,and a larger proportions of HIV and HCV positive patientsthan the MDT study sample. There were no statisticallysignificant differences between the MMT subset of the studysample and the clinic MMT population on the variablesavailable for comparison. 3.2. Knowledge about hepatitis C The accuracy of respondents Tknowledge about the natural history of HCV infection varied. Nearly all (92%)believed a person could die of HCV. Forty-three percentanswered it would take bmany years Qorba lifetime Qto be- come sick from the virus. Few, however, understood the likelihood of becoming ill once infected: 38% an-swered bmostQorballQwould become sick, and 22% bdid not know. Q Knowledge of HCV transmission was more accurate and consistent. Most of the sample knew about modes of trans- mission of HCV; 97% answered that needles transmit the virus and 87% answered that sharing cookers, cottons, orrinse water was a source of transmission. However, only one third (34%) knew that there was a treatment for HCV ( Table 1 ).Table 2 shows analyses of the variables associated with treatment knowledge. Inunivariate analysis, men were more likely than women toknow about treatment (43% vs. 16%, p= 0.006). Those who were positive for HCV were more likely to know about treatment (38% vs. 14%, p= 0.037). Among ethnic/racial categories, Whites were most likely about treat-ment (54%), followed by Mixed/Other/Declined (44%) andHispanic/Latinos likely (13%; p= 0.001). Those with high school (31%) or at least some college (57%) were morelikely to know about treatment than those with less than high school (23%; p= 0.031). In multivariable logistic regression, men were five times as likely as women toknow about treatment, and Whites were over seven times,and Hispanic/Latinos were nearly six times, as likely asAfrican Americans to know about treatment. We foundno statistically significant differences between men andwomen and among ethnicities on the transmission knowl-edge questions. 3.3. Evaluation for hepatitis C treatment None of the study sample reported taking ribavirin or interferon alpha for hepatitis infection. Only 30% of thesample reported that they had been evaluated for HCVtreatment.

Interest in hepatitis C treatment After being informed about some of the risks and benefits of HCV, half (54%) were bdefinitely interested Qin treatment ( Table 1 ). Logistic regression analyses ( Table 3 ) indicate that being in detoxification treatment and reportingnegative or unknown HCV status were associated with being definitely interested in treatment. 4. Discussion Three important findings emerge from this study. First, no one in our sample was being treated for HCV and fewwere being evaluated for treatment. Three possible barriers to receiving HCV care include patients Tlack of under- standing of the seriousness of HCV and treatment options,patients Tlow interest in receiving treatment, and patients T lack of access to HCV evaluation and treatment. Whenasked directly, almost three quarters of our sample ex-pressed interest in treatment; therefore, low interest is nota barrier to treatment for this group. In terms of understanding HCV, our survey reveals that while almost all respondents believed HCV is a fatal dis- ease and understood how it is transmitted, many did notunderstand the likelihood and time course of the illness.Fewer were aware that treatment is available. Thus, knowl-edge about illness from HCV and knowledge about HCVtreatment likely are barriers. While our study was notdesigned to look at financial and institutional barriers toaccess to HCV care, significant financial barriers existed for a population with a large proportion of uninsured, and logistical barriers existed within a health system that hadwait times up to 6 months to see an HCV treatment pro-vider. The degree to which this lack of access to treatmentapplies to other methadone patients is not clear. One surveyof New York methadone programs reported that while 85%of drug treatment programs refer patients for furtherevaluation, 12% provide evaluation and treatment on site (Pratt et al., 2002 ). The second important finding is that while knowledge of transmission was high, knowledge of treatment for HCVwas low, particularly among women and African Americans.Most methadone programs educate patients about theadverse consequences of drug use and its sequelae ( Astone et al., 2003; Strauss et al., 2003 ). This education likely con- tributed to the number of correct responses to the HCV transmission questions. Education about HCV treatment should be included as part of this education and counsel-ing curriculum. Without knowledge of treatment, patientscannot advocate for themselves to obtain treatment. Theknowledge gap we noted among gender and ethnic categories may be part of underlying disparities in access to care thathave been well-described ( Krieger, 1997 ). This finding supports the need for education about treatment options among methadone patients, particularly women and African Americans. Third, being HCV negative or not knowing one Ts HCV status and being in MDT predicted higher interest intreatment. These are both unexpected findings. We anti-cipated that patients in MMT, and those who knew theywere infected, would be more stable and ready to take ona long course of treatment with significant side effects. Because preference for MMT placement was given to patients with greater medical severity, perhaps the sickerMMT patients were less interested in a treatment withpotential side effects. Another explanation is that MMTpatients may be more hesitant to embark on treatmentbecause they have lived longer, both asymptomaticallywith HCV and in methadone treatment. Therefore, theymay be less convinced about the benefit of treatment and more concerned about the side effects. Perhaps patients in MDT believed that treatment for HCV was a mechanismfor access to placement in MMT, and their interest in MMTmotivated their interest in HCV treatment. Further, thosewho were HCV-negative or with unknown HCV statuscould have been more likely than HCV-infected patientsto express interest in treatment because the questionwas hypothetical. Our findings agree with other studies of patients in substance abuse clinics, that while a high proportion ofpatients are HCV infected, few are evaluated for treatment(Murrill et al., 2002; National Institutes of Health, 2002; Pratt et al., 2002; Stein, Maksad, & Clarke, 2001 ). We conducted our study in the midst of a shift in recom-mendations about which patients should be treated. It ispossible that our subjects were considered ineligible for HCV treatment\u2014based on the earlier recommendations\u2014 because of recent drug use. Stein et al. (2001) surveyed motivation for treatment among 306 methadone mainte-nance patients in Rhode Island and found that 53% werebdefinitely Qorbprobably Qinterested in treatment after being informed of the risks and benefits. This can be comparedto 71% of the MMT subset of our sample that weredefinitely or probably interested. How well these results reflect patients Ttrue readiness to start therapy is unclear. With the majority of our sample not knowing that treat-ment existed until informed of such during the interview, itis unlikely that many had thought about treatment at all. We are aware of several limitations to our study. The sample was not selected randomly. We believe that samplingover different days and times and over a 6-month periodresulted in enrollment of subjects who were not different from the clinic population, which we confirmed for the MMT population. We were unable to confirm the self-reported HCV status or treatment history data by bloodtesting or chart review. However, in the case of HCV status,A.Y. Walley et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 28 (2005) 181-187 185previous studies of HCV prevalence among methadone patients show agreement between self-report and bloodtesting ( Best et al.,1999; Stein et al., 2001 ). Drawn from a single clinic, our findings may be difficult to generalize. Specifically, unique barriers may exist at our institution, such as wait times around 6 months for hepatology ap-pointments. However, the clinic is large, urban, and drawspatients from throughout the city of San Francisco, in-cluding patients who are uninsured. Drug treatment programs, such as methadone programs, may be fertile ground to move beyond preventing hepatitisC transmission to preventing disease progression and facilitating access to treatment ( Novick, 2000; Samet, Astone,2002 ). Methadone programs require adherence with clinic visits and regular contact with program staff, whichpotentially could facilitate adherence to HCV evaluation,treatment and side effect monitoring. Some methadoneprograms provide linkage to mental health, facilitating screening and monitoring for depression. Our findings reveal a gap between access to HCV treat- ment and interest in treatment. By increasing knowledge oftreatment, drug treatment programs may not only empowerpatients to seek hepatitis C treatment for themselves, but alsogive patients another incentive to adhere to drug treatment.

Pope, MS,II Bruce Bowen, PhD, ** and Lori Weyuker, ASAtt Background: Predicting health care.costs for individuals and pop\u00ad ulations is essential for managing care. However, the comparative power of diagnostic and drug data for predicting future costs has not been closely examined. Objective: We sought to compare the predictive performance of claims-based models using diagnoses, drugs claims, and combined data to predict health care costs. Subjects: More than I million commercially insured, nonelderly individuals in a national (MEDSTAT MarketScan\u00ae) research data\u00ad base comprised our sample. Measures: We used 1997 and 1998 drug and diagnostic profiles to predict costs in 1998 and 1999, respectively. To assess model performance, we compared R2 values and predictive ratios (pre\u00ad dicted costs/actual costs) for important subgroups.' . Results: Models using both drug and diagnostic data best predicted subsequent-year total health care costs (highest R2 '= 0.168 versus 0.116 and 0.146 for models based on drug or diagnostic data alone, respectively), with highly accurate predictive ratios (0.95-1.05) for subgroups of patients with major medical conditions. Models pre\u00ad dicting pharmacy costs had substantially higher R2 values than models predicting other medical costs (highest R2 0.493 versus 0.124). Drug-based models predicted future pharmacy costs better than diagnosis-based models (highest R2 '= 0.482 versus 0.243), whereas diagnosis-based models predicted total costs (highest R2 '= From'DxCG, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts; the [Department of General Internal Medicine, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts; the ~De\u00ad partment of Economics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts; the \u00a7Division of General Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and the ,Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; the [Program on Health Economics and Financing, RTI International, Waltham, Massachusetts; \"Multimetrics, Sisters, Oregon; and ttLW Consulting, Mill Valley, California.

Conclusions: Combined drug and diagnostic data predicts total health care costs better than either type of data alone. Pharmacy spending is particularly predictable from drug data, whereas diag\u00ad noses are more useful than drugs for predicting other medical costs and total costs. Using even slightly more recent data can substan\u00ad tially boost model performance measures; thus, model comparisons should be conducted on the same dataset. Key Words: risk adjustment, predictive models, population disease burden, pharmacy profile, actuarial prediction (Med Care 2005;43: 34-43) Medical and financial managers increasingly use current illness indicators to predict subsequent-year health care needs and costS.I,2 Predictive models commonly rely on some combination of demographics (typically age and gender), diagnoses recorded during medical encounters, and prescrip\u00ad tion drug utilization data. Models using diagnoses from claims to predict future health care costs were introduced in the 1980s.3,4 In January 2004, to better link Medicare payments to health plans to the health status of their enrolled beneficiaries, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced a claims\u00ad based Diagnostic Cost Group Hierarchical Condition Cate\u00ad gory (DCGIHCC) model to partially reimburse health plans that enroll Medicare beneficiaries. This CMS-HCC model uses demographics and a diagnosis-based medical profile captured during all clinician encounters- both inpatient and outpatient-to produce a health-based measure of future medical need.5,6 Several states also make risk-adjusted Med\u00ad icaid payments to providers.I'\" Many studies have confirmed the ability of diagnosis\u00ad based models to predict total health care costs in privately insured populations.I'<!\" However, diagnoses from multiple sites of care often accrue slowly in centralized databases, whereas outpatient pharmacy claims are generated electron- Medical Care Volume 43, Number 1, January 2005 Copvrtqht (9) Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Pharmacy claims have been studied in United States privately insured, Medicaid, and veter\u00ad ans populations. 1 5-25 Since 2003, the Netherlands has used a drug-based model to reimburse sickness funds for their mem\u00ad bers.\" Drug-based models predict future total costs well but less well than diagnosis-based modelsY,15,17,23 Accuracy may be improved by using both diagnoses and drug claims as predic\u00ad tors. 15,20 However, no studies have combined diagnoses from all sites with comprehensive outpatient drug claims to predict total health care costs. As more health plans have both diagnoses and drug claims available, it is important to assess how predictive accuracy is affected when both types of data are combined. The extensive risk adjustment literature during the past 2 decades has largely been devoted to predicting future total health care costs. Other than modeling for the Medicare program, in which outpatient drug use is not reimbursed, few studies exam\u00ad ined the predictability of medical costs excluding pharmacy costs'? and pharmacy costs alone,z7-31 Predicting pharmacy costs is particularly important in light of the recent legislation authorizing Medicare prescription drug benefits. Compared with earlier reports,l,3-4,7,9-1I,13,14,16,17,19 the predictive performance of newer predictive models has improved markedly.8,12,15,18,20,23,32 However, the data used are more recent and more complete. No study has systemat\u00ad ically distinguished improvements as the result of more refined predictive models versus newer data. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the predictive performance of different sources of data to predict various future health care costs and systematically explored whether observed improvements in predictive power were caused by newer data or more refined predictive models. Using a large, nationally representative cohort of commer\u00ad cially insured people younger than the age of 65, we exam\u00ad ined 2 widely-used families of claim-based models: Rx\u00ad Groups\u00ae Releases I and 2, which rely on pharmacy data,\" and the Diagnostic Cost Group Hierarchical Condition Cat\u00ad egory (DCG/HCC) models Releases 5 and 6, which use diagnoses.IO,32 Both models were developed by DxCG, Inc. (Boston, MA). The Society of Actuaries recently has com\u00ad pared the performance of early versions of the RxGroup and DCGIHCC models with other drug and diagnosis models to predict next year's total health care costs.V Focusing on these 2 types of models, we systematically evaluated their predic\u00ad tive accuracy across 4 dimensions: I. Model types (predictions based on drug, diagnosis or both kinds of data combined). 2. Cost outcomes (pharmacy costs, other medical costs, or total costs). 3. Model versions (previously published modelslO1 5 or newer, more clinically-refined models). 4. Sequential years (either 1997 data used to predict 1998 costs or 1998 data used to predict 1999 costs). \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins METHODS Data Source We used the Commercial Claims and Encounters Data\u00ad base ofMEDSTAT's MarketScan\u00ae Research Database, which includes inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims for individ\u00ad uals enrolled in more than 100 health plans contracting with l~ge. em~loyers, state and local governments, and public orga\u00ad mzanons m the United States. Both fee-for-service and capitated health plans that submitted encounter data are included. The 1998-1999 data include 1.3 million individuals younger than the age of 65 who were enrolled in a participating health plan for at least I month in both 1998 (year I) and 1999 (year 2), with pharmacy coverage throughout their enrollment period. The analogous 1997-1998 MarketScan data included 1.1 million individuals, and 874,000 people appeared in both the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 data. The overlap of subjects between the 2 years is a strength of our study, enabling us to assess whether changes in predictive accuracy were related to more recent data for a relatively stable population. All outcomes are year-2 costs: total, pharmacy (outpatient only), and nonpharmacy (total minus pharmacy). Costs include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and coordination-of-ben\u00ad efits payments. For partial-year enrollees, we annualized expen\u00ad ditures (actual spending divided by eligibility fraction) and used eligibility fractions as modeling weights. For example, a person leaving a health plan in June 1999 with $3000 in health care costs during the previous 6 months contributes half of an observation with annualized spending of $6000. Pharmacy Categories We classified all National Drug Codes (NDCs), mainly according to the drug's \"function\" (therapeutic indication). RxGroups differ from the \"Chronic Disease Score\" pharmacy model and its refinements, whose categorizations are keyed to \"inferred medical condition.,,16-20,25,26 The previous Rx- Group model version 1.0 (developed in 2000) mapped 58,000 NDCs into 127 mutually exclusive categories (called \"Rx\u00ad Groups\") primarily based on therapeutic indication.P Ver\u00ad sion 2.0 classified the January I, 2002, listing of more than 76,000 NDCs into 155 RxGroups. To better distinguish severity level and likely medical problems being treated, the newer system categorized NDCs along 4 dimensions: active ingredient(s), strength, route of administration, and dose. For example, the RxGroup \"lipid-lowering agents\" in RxGroup model version 1.0 was split into 2 RxGroups based on active ingredients: statin versus other. We distinguished 3 \"routes\" for asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease drugs: in\u00ad jectable, oral, and inhaled; and the inhaled category split further into 3 ingredient-based groups: beta agonist, steroid, or other. The different uses of leuprolide for men and women yielded 2 distinct RxGroups: leuprolide in men (prostate cancer) and women (endometriosis). Copvriqht @ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

To increase our model's robustness to common variations in prescribing, we imposed hierarchies among RxGroups used to treat the same medical problem. For example, when the higher-ranked RxGroup \"insulin,\" is present, the lower-ranked \"oral dia\u00ad is ignored (Fig. IA). The hierarchy for ophthal\u00ad mic problems is more complex (lB), with 6 RxGroups in 3 tiers, with the model \"recognizing\" as many groups that may be present in the highest tier. For example, a person's pre\u00ad dicted cost could be based on as many as all 3 ophthalmic categories 90 through 92, but only if no drugs in RxGroups 87 through 89 are recorded. I I Diagnostic Categories The Diagnostic Cost Group Hierarchical Condition Category (DCG/HCC) model uses age, sex, and diagnoses from both inpatient hospital admissions and outpatient pro\u00ad fessional medical services to record the presence of multiple medical problems and predict health care costs. More than 15,000 diagnoses map to clinically homogenous groups, called DxGroups, which further cluster into broader Condi\u00ad tion Categories (CCS).10.32 In updating the model from Re\u00ad lease 5 to Release 6, we incorporated all recently introduced diagnoses and increased the number (and thus specificity) of DxGroups from 541 to 781 and of CCs from 118 to 184.

We added a CC for type I Diabetes and mapped a few DxGroups, which were related to diabetes or congestive heart failure, to 2 CCs. The CCs categorize a person's recorded medical condi\u00ad tions but may contain inconsistent or redundant information. Hierarchies are imposed on the CCs (leading to an HCC profile) to address clinical and statistical concerns. A hierarchy may replace a provisional diagnosis with a more definitive one (such as a specific cancer over \"uncertain neoplasm\" or asthma over \"persistent cough\"); mark the presence of or progression to a more severe disease state (such as metastatic versus nonmeta\u00ad static cancer or myocardial infarction versus angina); or resolve an inconsistency (such as, when a single individual receives codes indicating both moderate and severe developmental defi\u00ad ciencies). Thus, individual HCC markers are more informative than CC markers, and models based on BCC profiles are less apt to interpret redundant coding as evidence of greater medical need. Figure 1C illustrates the diabetes hierarchy; except for HCC 20 (type I diabetes mellitus), each CC dominates the next lower one; any individual can be assigned to at most one of HCCs 15 through 19. In contrast, the lung hierarchy has 3 subhierarchies (Fig. lD); thus, a single person can be classified into as many as 3 lung HCCs. The complete CCs and hierarchies are listed elsewhere.F Model Development Using each classification system, we estimated models to predict each of our 3 cost outcomes (total, nonpharmacy and pharmacy only) in the subsequent year. We used weighted ordinary least squares regression; an observation's weight is the fraction of year 2 during which the person is eligible to incur costs. In all models, we added indicator variables to distinguish among 16 age/sex categories. In updating the RxGroups models, we included (interaction) terms when the joint effect of combi\u00ad nations of drugs on next year's costs was not additive. We considered all interactions explored in the earlier rnodels.P and added additional interactions that clinical advisors deemed im\u00ad portant. Twenty-seven interactions (2-, 3-, and 4-way) retained in the model pertained to at least 100 people (of 1.3million). All were statistically significant at the 0.05 level and were judged to \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copyriqht @ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

We also included interactions among coexisting medical conditions (HCCs) in the updated DCG/ HCC models. We had previously examined interactions among 6 common chronic medical conditions for the Medicare pro\u00ad gram32 : diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart fail\u00ad ure, vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and chronic ob\u00ad structive pulmonary disease. In updating the DCGIHCC model, we explored 2- and 3-way interactions among 8 medical condi\u00ad tions: the original 6 plus uncompleted pregnancy and respimtory disease. To explore meaningful cost differences by age, we further tested interactions between age (younger than age 18) and all HCCs. As above, all 28 interactions retained in the model had at least 100 people and were both clinically reasonable and statistically significant (P < 0.05). We excluded some RxGroups or HCCs from the mod\u00ad els if they had a negative coefficient (although typically only slightly so), which would reduce predictions for people with such prescriptions or diagnoses. RxGroups that do not predict future costs (based on clinical judgment) also were dropped. These groups included drugs for \"major diagnostic testing,\" drugs that are available in over-the-counter forms (ie, \"OTC drugs\"), and drugs commonly used for a range of typically minor medical problems such as fungal skin infection (\"mis\u00ad cellaneous, recognized NDCs\"). We enforced monotonicity in the models so that no HCC had a smaller coefficient than a less clinically severe HCC. This avoids \"paying less\" for a potentially more serious medical problem. For example, because respiratory arrest would otherwise have had a lower coefficient than cardiore\u00ad spiratory failure and shock, we forced the model to calculate the same coefficient for both groups. We also estimated a simple, additive \"combination\" model (Rx +DCG) for each outcome, using (in addition to age/sex indicators) both drug and disease predictors: Rx\u00ad Groups and their interactions, HCCs and their interactions, and interactions between age and HCCs. We did not explore interactions between RxGroups and HCCs for this model. Data Analysis For each population (1997-1998 and 1998-1999), we described its demographic distribution, year-1 diagnoses and drug use, and year-2 costs. We used t statistics for the statistical significance of the differences ofmeans. To correct for the nonindependence of the 2 sets of MarketScan data, all tests were adjusted for the correlation between observations for the same person in the 2 data sets (see Appendix).

To disentangle the effects of older and newer models and data, we examined the performance of both old and new models, for each model type, on both older and newer data. That is, for each model type (drug-based, diagnosis-based, and com\u00ad bined) and each of the 3 cost outcomes we applied both the older and newer versions of the model to both the older and newer datasets. The ratio of predicted costs to actual costs within selected disease cohorts is widely used to assess model accuracy.IO-12 When a model predicts well for a group, this \"predictive ratio,\" or PR, approximately equals 1.00; when it underpredicts, the PR is less than 1; PRs greater than 1 indicate overprediction. We used 1998-1999 as the valida\u00ad tion sample, and applied models estimated from 1997-1998 to generate predictions for each person and PRs for 3 kinds of subgroups as identified in 1998: cohorts defined by the presence of a relevant diagnosis from either inpatient or outpatient settings; cohorts defined by the presence of a relevant drug claim; and cohorts defined by total health care costs in the initial year. RESULTS Demographic distributions and medical care costs changed little between 1997-1998 and 1998 -1999 (Table I). \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins The later cohort was slightly older (mean, 33.4 versus 32.8 years). Total health care costs increased by 8.0%, reflecting a substantial increase in pharmacy costs (22.1%), and a smaller increase in other medical costs (4.6%). Relative variation, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV, equal to 100 times the standard deviation divided by the mean) declined for total costs (-13.9%) and nonpharmacy costs (-12.6%) but not for pharmacy costs (0.6%). In the newer data, more people had at least one diagnosis; also, there were more valid diagnoses, distinct valid diagnoses, and HCCs per person. The proportion of people with any prescription and the number of distinct types of drugs (RxGroups) per person were also larger in the newer data. The combined model (Rx+ DCG) predicted total costs best, followed closely by the diagnosis model and more distantly by the drug model (Table 2). For example, with the new models and data, the respective R2 values were 0.168 (Rx+DCG), 0.146 (DCGIHCC), and 0.1l6 (RxGroup). That is, moving from the RxGroup to the DCG/HCC to the combined model increased the R2 first by 26% and then by an additional 15%. Moving from older to newer data (while holding the model fixed) also produced striking improve\u00ad ments. Among new models to predict total cost, the switch to new data always increased R2 values by at least 25% and often by much more; the new drug model's R2 was 0.084 in Copvriqht \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

In contrast, when holding the data set fixed and moving from older to newer predictive models, R2 values always improved, al\u00ad though only minimally for the RxGroup models, and always modestly (the largest improvement was from 0.137 to 0.146, a 7% increase, for the DCG/HCC models in the new data). Models predicting nonpharmacy costs (the most variable outcome) had lower R2 values than the models predicting total costs (Table 3). The diagnosis models predicted these costs better than the drug models, and the combined models provided modestly better predictions than the diagnosis models. Models predicting pharmacy costs (the least variable outcome) had the highest R2 values, between 0.47 and 0.49 for all models relying on drug data and between 0.21 and 0.24 for the diagnosis-based models alone (Table 4). Adding diagnoses to drug claims in\u00ad creased the predictive accuracy only minimally (between I and 3%). In contrast to the findings for predicting total and nonphar\u00ad macy costs, newer data did not yield consistently higher R2 values (maximum increase was 0.7%), with the diagnosis-based models' R2 values actually decreasing by 7 to 8%. Switching from older to newer models yielded only modest improvements in R2 values (2 to 9%). Table 5 shows means and predictive ratios for 1999 total costs (new models only) for 15 groups, 5 each based on specific kinds of information from the prior year: medical conditions, drug use, and costs. The most expensive of these groups (those who had an acute myocardial infarction or who were in the top 5% of spending during 1998) incurred costs more than 5 times as high as the 1999 average of $2053, whereas spending in the least expensive group examined (those with below median 1998 spending) had costs in 1999 that were about one third of this average. All 3 models predicted these large cost differences with reasonable accuracy, with the largest deviations occurring for the RxGroup model in the most extreme cost-based groups. Specifically, the mean RxGroup prediction was $955 (= 1.36 times $702) for the below-median cost group, and $7407 (= 0.69 times $10,735) for the group with the highest 5% of prior-year costs. The DCGIHCC predictive ratios were 1.12 and 0.80, and the combined model predictive ratios were 1.00 and 0.88 for these same groups, respectively. The diagnosis-based model predicted costs very well for the diagnosis-identified groups (predictive ratios between 0.98 and 1.02), but somewhat underpredicted the groups defined by the use of drugs (predic\u00ad tive ratios of 0.81-0.90). Analogously, the drug-based model did well with the groups defined by the use of drugs (predictive ratios of 0.95-1.01) whereas underpredicting the costs of the medical condition cohorts (predictive ratios of 0.8 1-0.90). Only the combined model predicted group averages within 5% of actual costs for all diagnosis and drug-based subgroups. TABLE 4.

DISCUSSION Predictive modeling based on claims data is an important tool for managing the financing and delivery of health care. Both the drug and diagnosis-based classification systems evaluated in this study are more clinically detailed than their precursors, making them more useful for cost profiling and disease man\u00ad agement. Each model can identify and predict costs for clinically important subgroups. Using a recent, large, and nationally rep\u00ad resentative research database for privately insured individuals younger than the age of 65, this study compared the performance of models using different types of data (diagnoses, drugs, or both) and model versions (previously published models versus updated models) to predict different components offuture health care costs (total, nonpharmacy, and pharmacy costs) in older and newer data. Combining diagnoses with drug claims substantially improved predictions of future total costs but only marginally improved on the ability of diagnosis-only models to predict nonpharmacy costs or drug-only models to predict pharmacy costs. Drug costs were far more predictable than total or nonpharmacy cost. Relying only on the list of drugs ever used in a year (and not number of scripts, number of refills, dosages, or strength), RxGroup models explained nearly 50% of the variation in pharmacy cost during the subsequent year. Although it makes sense that current pharmaceutical costs and drug codes (NDCs) for a person are highly correlated with future pharmacy spending, our study is the first to quantify how accurately drug models can predict next year's pharmacy costs. It is likely that an RxGroup model that additionally tracks the number of prescriptions, or other volume measures, will provide even more robust predictions, especially among people who use drugs for chronic medical conditions. Although we studied a privately insured population that was younger than the age of 65, this finding also has impor\u00ad tant implications for recently enacted pharmacy benefits in the Medicare program. Because elderly adults often have many chronic illnesses treated with drugs, their pharmacy costs may be even more predictable than what we found in a younger population. Therefore, stakeholders who have access to current patterns of drug use will be able to identify future high-cost users of pharmacy benefits. To address the potential problem of biased selection or \"cherry picking\" of Medicare beneficiaries with low predicted drug costs, CMS will need \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 41 Copvriqht \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Zhao et al Medical Care Volume 43, Number 1, January 2005 access to the same drug utilization information that private health plans providing drug benefits have. Although updated models were more predictive than earlier models for total or nonpharmacy costs, more improve\u00ad ment came from newer data (with more diagnoses and pre\u00ad scriptions) than from more clinically refined classifications. This finding is important because models developed on more recent data typical1y perform better than models developed from older data. Thus, credible comparisons of the perfor\u00ad mance of different models require evaluation on the same data. The more recent, richer diagnostic data provided more accurate predictions, but we cannot readily determine how much of the increased coding of diagnoses reflected a true shift in illness burden or better data col1ection. Increases in drug utilization can also be affected by changes in clinical guidelines. When coding and prescribing practices change rapidly, diagnosis- and drug-based models may not reliably identify true changes in need. Current diagnosis- and drug-based models are powerful predictors of future cost. Each model captures population dis\u00ad ease burden reasonably well and can be used to monitor or allocate use ofhealth care resources. Drug and diagnosis models explain 12% and 15% of the variation in total cost, respectively, and the model combining both types of data explains 17% ofthis variation. Drug data are far superior for predicting pharmacy costs, whereas the diagnosis-based risk adjustment model better characterizes the population and more accurately predicts total and nonpharmacy cost. When more timely predictions are im\u00ad portant, drug-based predictive models can provide an attractive alternative for predicting even total and nonpharmacy costs. As claims data become richer and more informative, the previously anticipated boundary of 20% for the explanatory power of claims-based models to predict total costs in general popula\u00ad tions4,33 may soon be surpassed.

APPENDIX Because our sample contains 874,000 people who occur in both the 1997-1998 and 1998 -1999 cohorts, tests of statis\u00ad tical significance for differences in means between the 2 populations in Table 1 were calculated using the following formula, which takes into account the fact that measures are correlated between the 2 9 where X;, s., and N; are the mean, standard deviation, and sample size, respectively, of some variable of interest for year i= 98 or 99 and P98,99 is the correlation coefficient between the 1998 and 1999 samples for people who appear in both years. Because the sample sizes are large and the correlation coefficients are mostly small, tests remain powerful even after this correction. For our regression analysis developing the predictive models, we did not explicitly correct standard errors for this correlation, but instead used a higher signifi\u00ad cance threshold for deciding which variables to include. \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copvriqnt (c) Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
