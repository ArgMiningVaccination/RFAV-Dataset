There are scores of myths about Homeopathy which are circulated to discredit this all natural and highly effective healing treatment. In this article, we are going to [dispel](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/dispel-200-mg-suspension) all the popular myths relating to homeopathy so that you can judge for yourself and grasp the science of homeopathy in a better way. Myth #1: Homeopathy is just balls of [sugar](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/sugar) which comes with a placebo effect This is an absolutely erroneous idea. Homeopathic medicines are not just sugar pills- they come in various forms like dilution, tablet, ointment, pellets, mother tincture, etc. Homeopathy is becoming popular around the globe because it is gentle, non-toxic, and efficacious and a much cheaper alternative to allopathic medicine. Myth #2: Allopathic medicines cannot be taken in combination with homeopathy This is yet another popular misconception about homeopathy. As we know, allopathic medicines, when stopped altogether all of a sudden, can suddenly flare up the intensity of the symptoms. No competent homeopathy doctor would advise you to discontinue your allopathic medication abruptly. Generally, the dosage of allopathic medicine is reduced until it is stopped when steady improvement sets in. Myth #3: Intake of tea/coffee or [onion](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/benefits-of-onion-and-its-side-effects) and garlic is cut down in homeopathic treatment Though this was a popular practice in homeopathy, no modern homeopathic doctor would restrict your consumption of beverages or onion/garlic. These substances will never interfere with the medicine as long as they are consumed in moderation while maintaining a time gap between these items and the medicine. Myth #4: Homeopathic medicines take forever to bring in effects The time required for homeopathic medicine to act greatly depends on the disease itself. Acute diseases which build up quickly (such as headache, [fever](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fever) or [common cold](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-of-common-cold)) can be very quickly treated with the right homeopathic medicine. However, chronic diseases such as [asthma](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/asthma), [arthritis](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/arthritis), [migraine](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/migraine), [eczema](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/eczema), [bronchitis](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/bronchitis), etc., surely need some time to be completed cured. Myth #5: Homeopathy works only in children This is yet another common mistake most people make since homeopathy is known to work wonders for children and adults alike. When homeopathic medication is given to children or adults right at the onset of the symptoms, the disease is not only healed but the resistance of the child is also improved. Homeopathic medications would prevent the disease from becoming chronic. Myth #6: Homeopathic is herbal or Ayurvedic medicine Though Homeopathy makes use of microdoses of extracts from herbs and plants, it should never be confused with herbal or Ayurvedic medications. The science of homeopathy which had its origin in Germany is considerably different from the workings of other alternative medicines such as [Ayurveda](https://www.lybrate.com/ayurveda).
