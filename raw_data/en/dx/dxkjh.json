What is Tong Ren? Developed by Tom Tam, and an integral part of the Tom Tam Healing System, Tong Ren is a form of energy therapy for restoring health and vitality. Tong Ren is based on the belief that disease is related to interruptions, or blockages, in the body's natural flow of chi, neural bioelectricity, blood, or hormones. Blockages are very commonly found physically, rather than energetically, commonly along the spine inhibiting the natural circulation of the body's central nervous system. Tong Ren Therapy utilizes the concept of the collective unconsciousness to remove these blockages, restoring the body's natural ability to heal itself, even when illnesses are chronic, debilitating, or otherwise untreatable. Tong Ren combines western knowledge of anatomy and physiology with the ancient principle of \"chi,\" or life force energy, to create what many consider to be a powerful new healing modality. Drawing on the Jungian theory of the \"collective unconscious,\" Tong Ren is believed to access energy from this universal source and direct it to the patient. Because no physical contact is involved or necessary, Tong Ren is often practiced as distance healing. In a typical therapy session, the Tong Ren practitioner uses a small human anatomical model as an energetic representation of the patient, tapping on targeted points on the model with a lightweight magnetic hammer. The practitioner directs chi to blockage points corresponding to the patient's condition, breaking down resistance at these points. As blood flow, neural transmission, and hormone reception are restored, the body is then able to heal. History of Tong Ren Tong in Chinese means bronze; Ren means man or human. Tong Ren can be translated as 'bronze man'. In the Sung Dynasty (1023 AD), Emperor Ren Zhong Sung summoned the highest medical faculty of the Empire to write up the \"New Bronze Man's Points of Acupuncture Diagram and Note\". Dr. Wang Wei-yi was responsible for designing the acupuncture bronze man (human figure made by bronze). In 1027 AD, two identical bronze men were made, which were named Tong Ren (meaning \"bronze man\" in Chinese). Tong Ren Healing is an important component of the Tom Tam healing system. To commemorate the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) pioneers for their invaluable contribution to the world on the medical front, \"Tong Ren Healing\", an energy healing system developed by Tam was named after the acupuncture figure created by the TCM forerunners. Tong Ren Technique Tong Ren healing is becoming increasingly popular and widespread. Worldwide, and on a daily basis, people with serious illnesses are treated by Tong Ren therapists. Countless patients benefit from and are healed by Tong Ren Therapy. Each Tong Ren therapist has his/her own way of healing people. The effectiveness of the healing is high, and the cost is low. Tong Ren Therapy is extremely easy to learn. Basically there are three major techniques - with (1) the hammer, (2) laser beam, and (3) pins. Discing technique is the latest technique developed and applied in Tong Ren practices. Magnetic Hammer The magnetic hammer technique is one way of stimulating blockage points on the doll related to the patient's illness. This method is super easy for anyone to learn and practice; it does not require any serious training or experience. I always say, \"Monkey see, monkey do\". The hammer technique is the major method used in Tong Ren Guinea Gig Classes for group healing. The points for hammer hitting vary with individual cases. With the hammer technique, the first step is to locate the points on the doll. The beginner can follow the healing chart in our text book \"A Lazy Bum's Healing\", then write down the main points and support points on paper, or mark the points on the doll. On the healing chart, the main points indicate where the energy is blocked and where the root of the problem is. The support points enhance the effectiveness of the healing and are not mandatory, whereas the main points are. When we press on a patient's body following the main points from the chart, the patient will usually experience an uncomfortable or painful feeling at these points. In TCM theory these are called the Ouch Points. We need to pay attention to any Ouch Point, or any area where pain is felt. Pain is a signal from the body, which indicates that there is an imbalance or where the Chi is static. For example, when one has liver cancer, we shall find an Ouch Point at T9 on the right hand side. When a patient has breast cancer, we can easily find an Ouch Point at T4, on the same side as the tumor. Based on many years of practice and experience, I have observed that when a person is diagnosed with a specific condition or disease, they will have an Ouch Point, which corresponds to a certain designated root problem. However, please be careful not to mislead a patient by making a diagnosis according to an Ouch Point. A blockage can sometimes mean just a tight muscle - nothing more, nothing less. Making a diagnosis is the job of medical doctors using specific medical equipment and/or tests. In our healing, we only follow the doctor's diagnosis to find the blockage or reflex points. We never make any diagnosis of a patient's condition. When we use the hammer technique on the doll for healing, the general order of stimulation is from the top to the bottom, like the natural flow of water. However, when we stimulate the Sky Window area where both the common carotid and vertebral arteries are found, the order of hitting should be from the bottom to the top. This is different from when we are working on the nervous system, because the arteries carry blood upward from the heart to the brain. When we are done with all the points with the hammer technique, we should hit the doll from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet. This allows for the clearing of the Chi in the whole body before we finish the healing session. While treating cancer, we should begin by using the hammer on the head of the doll at GV22 and BL6 on both sides. After a couple of minutes, proceed to CR8s which are not on the doll. The two CR8 points are where the ears are. Do this for another couple of minutes, then move on to the points related to the specific cancer(. When treating multiple cancers, we always start with the primary cancer, even though there may not be any symptoms. Tong Ren Therapy is based on the power of our mind creating energy for healing. The source of this energy is from the collective unconscious, which is connected to the super conscious. When we practice Tong Ren, the focusing of our mind comes from our subconscious and unconscious - which means, \"Just do it\". If we make a conscious effort to focus, the focusing comes from our conscious mind, not from the unconscious mind. No one can consciously access one's unconscious mind. The unconscious mind is instinctive and cannot be controlled. Functions of the unconscious mind are automatic reactions. This use of the mind with the hammer technique facilitates the breaking down of blockages, which can then let energy pass within the body freely. With Tong Ren healing, we do not need to think or focus on the breaking down of the blockages, because the thought has already been stored as memory in our subconscious mind. Using the hammer technique, we hit points on the doll for about 10 to 15 minutes. As a rule this is enough. Patients can hit the doll for self-healing, but the best way is to ask someone else to do it because in this way the patient can be totally relaxed in order to receive the healing energy. A child's mind is purer than an adult's and without resistance. That is why children are more effective when using the hammer technique than most adults. With late stage cancer, daily use of Tong Ren healing is required. With cancer at an early stage, we can use Tong Ren two or three times a week. If the patient wants to do it or have it done on him/her more often, it is all right to do so because there are no side effects with Tong Ren healing. The more you do it, the more you benefit from it. When we see points on the spine from the Lazy Bum book, e.g. C1, T1, L1, S1, we hit the doll on both side of the points. If C1 Right is specified, for example, then we hit only the right side "}
