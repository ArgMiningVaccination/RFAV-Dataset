In this retrospective cross-sectional study, researchers examined outpatient progress notes written with and without scribe assistance across multiple specialties. They examined over 50,000 outpatient progress notes written with and without scribe assistance by 70 providers across 27 specialties. They found that scribed notes were consistently longer than those written without scribe assistance. There was significant variation in how working with scribes affected a provider's mix of typed, templated, and copied note text. AHRQ-funded; HS025141.

This study explored the role of the provider in supporting older adult (OA) personal health information management (PHIM), the barriers faced, and related implications in Health Information Technology (HIT) design. The researchers interviewed 27 providers who serve OAs in Seattle, Washington, and determined that barriers to OA PHIM included: 1) challenges in communication between providers, OAs and caregivers, 2) constraints on time and resources, and 3) limitations on tools such as secure messaging. The researchers concluded that design of HIT should consider those barriers and facilitate communication across a range of provider types, offer credible health resources designed specifically for OAs, support understanding of the home environments of OAs, and integrate caregivers and patient-generated data.

The authors sought to create and validate a simple and transferable machine learning model from electronic health record data to accurately predict clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 across institutions, through use of a novel paradigm for model development and code sharing. They determined that a model to predict clinical deterioration was developed rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at a single hospital, was applied externally without the sharing of data, and performed well across multiple medical centers, patient subgroups, and time periods, showing its potential as a tool for use in optimizing healthcare resources.

The authors sought to characterize providers involved in diagnosing and treating thyroid cancer. Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer from the Georgia and Los Angeles County Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries were surveyed. The authors found that, among thyroid cancer patients, 40.6% reported being informed of their diagnosis by their surgeon, 37.9% by their endocrinologist, and 13.5% by their primary care physician (PCP). The researchers concluded that PCPs were involved in thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment, and their involvement was greater among older patients and patients of minority race/ethnicity.

This study explored the implementation of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) in primary care. The study's two goals included exploring the implementation of lung cancer screening primary care in the context of integrating a decision aid into the electronic health record and a designing of implementation strategies that target hypothesized mechanics of change and context-specific barriers. The two phases included a Qualitative Analysis phase including semi-structured interviews with primary care physicians to elicit key task behaviors, and an Implementation Strategy Design phase consisting of defining implementation strategies and hypothesizing causal pathways to improve screening with a decision aid. Fourteen interviews were conducted and out of that 3 key task behaviors and four behavioral determinants emerged. Strategies included increasing provider self-efficacy toward performing shared decision making and using the decision aid, improving provider performance expectancy, increasing social influence, and addressing key facilitators to using the decision aid.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate clinician and staff perceptions related to medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder, particularly buprenorphine treatment, in rural primary care practices. Staff members from rural 42 practices were interviewed. Although there was almost no provision of MAT, policies and procedures to reduce opioid prescribing were usually in place and many practices expressed interest in learning more to help their patients and local communities.

This study's objective was to identify strategies associated with sustained guideline adherence and high-quality pediatric asthma care in community hospitals. Hospitals who were part of the Pathways for Improving Pediatric Asthma Care (PIPA) national quality improvement (QI) intervention were included. Clinicians (n = 19) involved in clinical care of children hospitalized with asthma were interviewed from five higher- and three lower-performing hospitals. Higher-performing hospitals had dedicated local champions who consistently provided reminders of evidence-based practices and delivered ongoing education. These champions also modified/developed electronic health record (EHR) tools. Lower-performing hospital clinicians described unique barriers, including delays in modifying the EHR and lack of automation of EHR tools. For all hospitals, barriers to sustainability included challenges with quality monitoring, decreasing focus of local champions over time, and ongoing difficulties developing around evidence-based high-quality pediatric Health Serv Res 2022 Feb;57(1):125-36. doi: 10.1111/1475-6773.13870..

Changes in health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted opioid prescribing. This study evaluated the impact of restrictions on in-person care on opioid prescribing in the outpatient setting. The hypothesis was that after restrictions to in-person care were implemented, there would be a reduction in the number of chronic and non-chronic opioid prescriptions. AHRQ-funded; HS026396.

This paper provides recommendations on how health care organizations can smoothly integrate data from person-generated data (PGD) devices into routine clinical workflows. This paper formulates the integration of PGD into clinical systems and workflow as a PGD integration pipeline and reviews the functional components of such a pipeline. The pipeline includes PGD acquisition, aggregation, and consumption. Acquisition includes both technical (eg, sensors, smartphone apps) and policy components (eg, informed consent). Aggregation pools, standardizes, and structures data into usable formats for health care settings such as within electronic health record-based workflows. Consumption is wide-ranging, by different solutions in different care settings (inpatient, outpatient, consumer health) for different types of users (clinicians, patients). The authors recommend the adoption of data and metadata standards, such as those from IEEE and Open mHealth. They illustrated the benefits of a standards-based integration pipeline for the illustrative use case of home blood pressure monitoring. AHRQ-funded; HS026883. Citation: Zeng B, Bove R, Carini S .

Only \u00bd of suicide decedents are diagnosed with a mental health condition; population-based screening strategies are needed to help identify people who are at risk of suicide, and it may be necessary for providers to consider patient life circumstances that may place them at a higher risk. The purpose of this study was to identify suicide typologies among suicide decedents and describe the alignment between medical diagnoses and life circumstances. Decedent demographics, stressful life events, perceived and diagnosed/ health issues, suicidal behavior, and suicide method contributed to the typologies. In 2020 the researchers linked North Carolina Medicaid data with data from the North Carolina Violent Death reporting System (NC-VDRS) to analyze suicide decedents from 2014-2017, aged 25-54 years of age. Researchers analyzed 6 indicators of life circumstances from Medicaid claims and 12 indicators from the NC-VDRS and developed separate models for men and women. The study found that 88.3% of the suicide decedents were White, with a median age of 41 years, and more than 70% had experienced a health care visit in the 90 days prior to suicide. The study concluded that almost one-half of suicide decedents have a typology characterized by a low probability of diagnosis of mental health issues. The authors report that screenings for suicide could be improved by using improved indicators of lived experience and mental health. AHRQ-funded; HS000032.

Keywords: Medicaid, Behavioral Health Chen MM, Hughes TM, Dossett LA Peace of mind: a role in unnecessary care? This article discusses the role peace of mind plays in unnecessary cancer preventative care, including unnecessary screenings and surgeries. For example, shared-decision making is recommended by the USPSTF for PSA-based screening but if the decision to screen is emotion-based, then shared decision-making guidelines may not be effective. A number of studies have shown that peace of mind has been implicated as a key patient-centered outcome driving the increased utilization of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). Overdiagnosis and overtreating of thyroid cancer have resulted in an accelerating rate of total thyroidectomies relative to lobectomies for small papillary cancers in the past decade even though there is no evidence showing better survival rates. Quality-of-life studies have not shown better outcomes to patients who do chose the more radical treatment. The authors recommend that clinicians undergo training in cognitive debiasing strategies and more training in empathic communication and risk communication techniques to decrease the potential negative influence of peace of mind.

Peace of mind: a role Konetzka RT, Davila H, Brauner DJ The quality measures domain in Nursing Home Compare: is high performance meaningful or misleading? The Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes a Nursing Home Compare (NHC) web site that provides information to compare nursing homes across the nation. Since NHC began reporting the percent of nursing home residents suffering adverse outcomes, the negative outcomes decreased dramatically. However, the validity of scores has been questioned for nursing homes that score well on facility-reported measures but scored poorly on inspections. The study purpose was to determine whether nursing homes with these \"discordant\" scores are better than nursing homes that score poorly across all domains. The researchers analyzed national data from 2012- 2016, conducted in-depth interviews and observations of 12 nursing homes in 2017 to 2018, and studied nursing home performance trajectories over time. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were utilized and interpreted together. The study found that facilities identified as discordant took part in more quality improvement (QI) activities than those identified as poor performers, but those QI activities were lower-resource improvements and not of the type and scope that would impact improvements across other quality domains. It was determined that the poor-performing facilities appeared to lack the leadership and staff continuity required for even low-resource improvements. The study concluded that while high performance on quality measures using facility-reported data is mostly meaningful, and the quality measures domain should continue to be utilized in Nursing Home Compare, facilities identified as discordant still have quality defects.

Researchers sought to describe factors affecting physician decision-making when care planning for complex patients with multimorbidity within the team-based, patient-centered medical home setting in the integrated healthcare system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). They found that primary care physicians described internal, external, and relationship-based factors that affected their care planning for high-risk and complex patients with multimorbidity in the Factors affecting primary care physician decision-making for patients with complex multimorbidity: a qualitative interview study.

The purpose of this study was to apply social network analysis to electronic health record (EHR) data to explore diurnal differences in the multidisciplinary teams caring for pediatric trauma patients. The researchers created an event log comprised of clinical activity metadata obtained from the EHR. The resulting event log was separated into 6 unique event logs, with content based on clinical activity shift (day shift or night shift) and location of the activities (divided by emergency department (ED), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and floor). For each event log, social networks were constructed and community overlap identified. The researchers utilized a comparison with qualitative care team data to compare and validate daytime and nighttime network structures for each care location. Validation was assessed via member-checking interviews with clinicians and qualitatively derived care team data, obtained through semi-structured interviews. The study found that of the 413 clinical encounters taking place within the 1-year study period, 65.9% began during the day shift and 34.1% began during the night shift. Multiple communities were identified in the ED and on the floor during the night shift, while a single community was identified in the ED and on the floor during the day shift, and in the PICU during the night shift. Qualitative data results indicated that the networks were accurate representations of the composition and interactions of the care teams. The researchers concluded that social network analysis was an effective method for utilization on EHR data at a pediatric trauma center to explore, identify, and describe diurnal differences in multidisciplinary care teams. diurnal differences in multidisciplinary care teams at a pediatric trauma center using electronic health record data: social network analysis.

This study examined the implementation of electronic dashboards and the key barriers that were found. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the national Veterans Health Affairs (VA) following implementation of a population health tool, and in Michigan for the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI(2) dashboard tool designed for pharmacist or nurse use to monitor safe outpatient anticoagulant prescribing by physicians and other clinicians. A total of 45 stakeholders were interviewed, 32 at the VA, and 13 at MAQI(2). Five key determinants of implementation success were identified: (1) clinician authority and autonomy, (2) clinician self-identity and job satisfaction, (3) documentation and administrative needs, (4) staffing and work schedule, and (5) integration with existing information systems. Key differences between the two contexts included concerns about IT support and prioritization within MAQI(2) prior to implementation but not VHA after implementation and also concerns about authority and autonomy.

The purpose of this retrospective, observational study was to assess longitudinal primary care organization participation patterns in large-scale reform programs and to identify organizational characteristics associated with multiprogram participation. Medicare claims were used to identify organizations that delivered primary care services. Findings showed that no program achieved more than 50% participation; 36% of organizations did not participate in any program; 50% participated in one; 13% in two; and 1% in all three. Larger organizations, those with younger providers, those with more primary care providers, and those with larger Medicare patient panels were more likely to participate in more programs.

The purpose of this trial was to compare the effectiveness of three approaches for communicating opioid risk during an emergency department visit for a common painful condition. Participants were adult patients with kidney stone or musculoskeletal back pain, randomly assigned to one of three risk communication strategies: a personalized probabilistic risk visual aid, a visual aid and video narrative, or general risk information. Findings showed that an emergency medicine communication tool incorporating probabilistic risk and patient narratives was more effective than general information in mitigating preferences for opioids in the treatment of pain but was not more effective with respect to opioid use or risk recall.

This paper describes the outcomes of a pilot study that used novel emergency medical services (EMS) protocol to expedite transfer of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs) to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC). The pilot study took place from Oct. 1, 2020 to Feb. 22, 2021 with Indianapolis EMS providers. In patients with possible LVO, the providers remained at the bedside until the clinical assessment and CT angiography were complete. This 5-month mixed methods study measured case-control assessment of the protocol, number of transfers, safety during transport, and time saved in transfer compared to emergency transfers via conventional interfacility transfer agencies. The protocol was used 42 times during the study period, with four patients found to have LVOs and transferred to a CSC. Median time from decision-to-transfer to arrival at the CSC was 27.5 minutes compared to 314.5 minutes for acute non-stroke transfers during the same period. HS026390.

This research letter describes a survey that was conducted to compare accountable care organization (ACO) awareness and perceptions among specialists versus primary care physicians (PCPs). The survey was administered in 2018 to clinicians in the Physician Organization of Michigan ACO, which was the largest Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) in Michigan and among the ten largest nationally at the time. The analysis focused on 1022 non-pediatrician physician respondents practicing within 10 provider organizations. Physician respondents included PCPs (23%) and specialists (77%). The most common specialty was internal medicine (20%), followed by surgeons (14%). Specialists were less likely to be aware of ACO participation and incentives. They were also 25% less likely to know they were in an ACO compared to PCPs. In addition, specialists were 18% less likely to know their ACO was accountable for both spending and quality or that their ACO had lowered spending in the previous year. This difference in perception may help to explain ACOs' modest impact on spending and quality. AHRQ-funded; HS025615. Citation: Markovitz AA, Ryan AM, Peterson TA .

This article described current practices and barriers met in conducting anal cancer screenings for women living with HIV (WLWH) in an urban integrated safety-net system and in a non-profit community-based HIV clinic. Semi-structured interviews with clinical and administrative stakeholders were conducted to assess their screening for anal cancer experiences, knowledge, clinic practices and procedures. Barriers included limited knowledge of guidelines by providers and system-level issues such as lack of coordination between clinics and limitations on available resources. The authors concluded that screenings and follow-up require organization and coordination between multiple care teams, as well as improved clinical information systems to facilitate communication and infrastructure for managing abnormal results.
