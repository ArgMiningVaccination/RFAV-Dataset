Lipid-AcrB nanoparticles were prepared directly from membranes without any use of detergents. A 3D reconstruction in C1 symmetry achieved a final density map at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution, an atomic model of quasi-C3-symmetric AcrB was fitted to this map, and the residual density revealed many ordered lipid molecules. Most remarkably, a central cavity between the three transmembrane domains contains a 24-lipid patch of well-ordered bilayer structure. Inner leaflet lipid chains pack in a hexagonal array like that in phosphatidylethanolamine crystal structures, whereas the outer leaflet has highly irregular packing. Protein side chains interact with both leaflets and participate in the hexagonal pattern. The AcrB export mechanism requires reorganization of the lipid bilayer structure. This system should be broadly applicable for membrane protein structural biology and structure-based drug discovery and development.

Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Chemistry, Poland Thanks to its pleasant rose flavor as well as antibacterial and antifungal properties, 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) has huge market demand. After vanillin, it is the second-most-used additive in perfumery, while also being a component in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Although nowadays most 2-PE originates from chemical synthesis, biotechnological production with yeast is becoming increasingly more attractive since it gives a final product classified as natural. The presented work is focused on microbial production of natural 2-PE. The first stage of the study was the search for yeast strains, isolated from the natural environment, that will efficiently produce 2-PE. With the best producer, we have developed a complete technology of 2-PE production - starting from the biotransformation stage and ending with pure product. In a batch culture conducted in a 5-l bioreactor, we obtained 3.6 g/l 2-PE after 72 h. As 2-PE titer of 2-4 g/l in broth is toxic for yeast, we achieved maximum concentration in a simple batch-culture. Therefore, to enhance productivity we tested extractive fermentation as one of several in situ product removal (ISPR) techniques. We showed for the first time that rapeseed oil can be successfully applied for this purpose. In addition, it is also an excellent biomaterial with promising use in the food or cosmetic industries. Recently, our work has focused on reducing the production costs and, to this end, we tested organic waste from agriculture and food processing as cheap feedstock. This approach has two advantages: lowering the price of the culture medium and better management of harmful wastes. Currently, we are working on downstream processing to combine all stages in one complete technology. This work was financially supported by the National Science Centre, Poland (2016/21/D/NZ9/01605).

Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Biotecnolog\u00eda Aplicada, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, M\u00e9xico Actually the determination and quantification of heavy metals in food has a high priority for public health, quality systems and food safety, these elements can be added to the food production system at different stages of the agri-food chain and it is essential to monitor his presence or absence through it. Until now, the methodology to perform this task is based on atomic absorption spectrophotometry that requires at least a couple of days to obtain a reliable result. The aimed of this work is develop and validate an alternative analytical method for the determination of heavy metals in several matrices, based on numerical methods and the correlation between spectrometric techniques; Atomic Force and Infrared by Fourier transform. The presence of Hg and Pb at different concentrations seem to modify the milk spectrum in the region of proteins, lipids and OH; at 1636, 1337, 550, 3300 and 3350 cm-1. The presence of As, Cd, Cr Hg and Pb at concentrations even of 0.1 ppb generate characteristic IR spectra that can help to identify their presence in water. By Principal Components Analysis (PCA), was possible have a better discrimination of the samples in the same matrix (milk). Where the cloud of points in the different regions of interest, show a good discrimination for the seven metals used in this work. Biography: Raul Delgado Macuil born in Puebla Mexico.

New England Biolabs, USA Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has caused a revolution in both research and diagnosis. NGS analysis relies on preparation of a representative, non-biased library evenly distributed across the entire genome under investigation. This critical task has become increasingly challenging since biases found in the current methods of the NGS library preparation produce uneven coverage and compromisethe quality of NGS analysis. In this report we have identified a systematic sequence bias during construction of amplification-free human DNA libraries for the Illumina sequencing platform. Our study indicates that inefficient processing of AT-rich DNA in the major steps that comprise library construction results in under-representation of the extremely high AT-content fraction in human genomic libraries. We have demonstrated a new strategy by employing DNA modifying enzymes conjugated to magnetic beads in construction of amplification-free human DNA libraries. We show that this method significantly lowers the sequence coverage bias of the libraries on Illumina sequencing platform.

Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are the pacemaker cells responsible for slow waves in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We investigated the effects of zingerone on the pacemaker potentials of ICCs to assess its mechanisms of action and its potential as a treatment for GI tract motility disorder. Methods: We isolated ICCs from small intestines, and the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record the pacemaker potentials in cultured ICCs. Results: Under the current clamping mode, zingerone inhibited pacemaker potentials of ICCs concentration-dependently. These effects were blocked not by capsazepine, a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel blocker, but by glibenclamide, a kinase C (PKC) inhibitor) did not block the effects of zingerone on the pacemaker potentials relative to treatment with zingerone alone. However, zingerone-induced pacemaker potential inhibition These results suggest that zingerone inhibits ICCs via NO/cGMP-dependent ATP-sensitive K+channels through MAPK-dependent pathways. Taken together, this study shows that zingerone may have the potential for development as a GI regulation agent.

Georgian Technical University, Biotechnology Center, Georgia Microbial diseases have been reported in the walnut orchards due to different reasons in recent years in Georgia. For the purpose of walnuts tissue cultures reproduction, it is necessary to determine the optimal type of sterilization of initial material. The aims of this study were determined optimal sterilization type to propagate walnuts cultivars 'Pedro', and 'Chandler' using tissue culture technique. The initial explants (unimodal micro cuttings with a length between 1 and 1.2 cm) of three cultivars were collected from the young 2-3 years old walnuts orchards, Dzevera, ShidaKartli, Georgia. Two sterilized types were used for in vitro propagation of walnuts: I.1-2% hypochlorite 10-15 min, followed 70 % alcohol -30 min and 3 times sterile distillate water II. 0.1% mercuric chloride 5 min and 3 times sterile distillate water. It was revealed that microbial contamination were 58.97% using 0.1% mercury chloride and relatively high by sodium hipocloride-85.12%. DKW medium was used for in vitro cultivation of walnuts cultivars supplemented with 0.1 mg/L IBA, 1 mg/L BAP and sucrose 3%. The pH of culture medium was adjusted at 5.5 before adding the gelling agent and autoclaving. Micro cuttings were kept at 25\u00b12\u00b0C under a 16 h photoperiod. Finally, optimal sterilization types of initial explants (Combination II) was determined. Walnuts cultivars: 'Pedro' and 'Chandler' were propagated using tissue culture methods first time in Georgia. This study led to develop an effective method for micro propagation of Juglansregia, which enable us to establish new walnuts orchards in Georgia.

Georgian Technical University, Biotechnology Center, Georgia The research aim was to determine optimal in vitro condition for propagation different maturity potato cultivars. Potato varieties were collected from in vitro potato collection of Georgian Technical University, Biotechnology Center according to their maturity: Early cultivars: Carola, Desiree. The influence of three types of combinations with temperature, humidity, light and photoperiod was studied on all three maturity potato cultivars in vitro development:I. Lux-5-5500, 16h;The results were evaluated after 17 days of reproduction. Best in vitro condition for all researched potato varieties was selected for their leave colors, rooting, and shoot formation. All potato cultivars morphological characterization was variable depending on the type of in vitro condition. It was revealed early maturity cultivars had maximum potential for in vitro propagation (5-6 nodes, average rooting 92% and shoot cultivars (5-6 nods, rooting 89% and shoot formation 90%). The perfect in vitro reproduction of medium late varieties (5-6 nodes, average rooting 87% and shoot formation 82%) was observed on the combination: T-27-29\u00b0 C, H-70%, Lux-5-5500, 16h. As it is known, for in vitro developments of early medium and late medium potato cultivars are necessary 22-26 days, but our results were obtained in 17 days. Finally, optimal in vitro condition for propagation different maturity potato cultivars was defined. Biography: Maia Kukhaleishvili has completed his PhD at the age of 58 years from ST.

The specific interaction with the appropriate resins requires fusion affinity tags, such as e.g. the oligo-His, the maltose binding protein or glutathione-S-transferase tag. These sequences are encoded by the plasmids used for protein expression. The affinity tags have to be cleaved off after the target protein is selectively bound to the solid support. This is performed by specific proteases. These enzmes are expensive and mostly they leave few extra amino acids at the terminus, which may interfere with the structure and function of the purified protein. Recent studies in our research group focused on the protein constituents of new artificial nucleases. Artificial DNA nucleases have provided scientists with the unprecedented ability to probe, regulate, and manipulate the human genome. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), short palindromic repeat-Cas9 system (CRISPR/Cas9) represent a powerful array of tools that can bind to and cleave a specified DNA sequence. Our ressearch focused on new type of ZFNs with intramolecular alloteric activation. The computer design of such enzymes requires the precise protein sequence to be obtained. Using the Ni(II)-affinity chromatography for e.g. zinc finger protein purification requires the complete removal of the oligo-His affinity tag. However, this was not possible to achieve by the traditional methods. We redesigned the cloning region of pET21a plasmid. The new approach is to cleave the His-tag by Ni(II) instead of proteases. Therefore, the new plasmid encodes the affinity tag with a Ni(II)-sensitive cleavage site at its N terminus. The precise gene of the protein is inserted into the cloning region by the help of BsmBI restriction endonuclease, so that the recognition site is deleted in the cleavage/ligation procedure. We performed the cloning, expression and purification procedures and will report the results on the poster.

Faculty of Food Science and Nutrition, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Poland Bacteria of the genus Desulfovibrio are gram-negative absolute an aerobic microorganisms, usually rod-shaped. They have the ability to carry out the processes of dissimilatory reduction of sulphates to hydrogensulphide taking part in the sulfur cycle in nature. A typical species of this genus is Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, occurring mainly in deeper layers of soil, sediments of water, industrial sewage, oilfields as well asanimal and human stool, sometimes causing infections of the digestive system. The aim of the work was to develop a procedure for the isolation of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans from environmental samples using various selection factors. In addition, the metabolism of isolates have been tested, including their ability to grow in substrates with various carbon sources and the utilization of diesel fuel as the only carbon source as well as the ability to reduce sulphates. The tests were carried out under relatively anaerobic conditions using soil samples contaminated with petroleum derivatives. Tests showing metabolic abilities were carried out in bioreactors maintaining sterility regimes and appropriate gas conditions. The increase in biomass concentration, substrate loss and sulphate reductions were analyzed. As a result of the work, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans monocultures were obtained using the antibiotic selection factor. The conducted culturing tests allowed for the selection of parameters allowing for an efficient biomass multiplication as well as the assessment of the influence of parameters such as pH, temperature, agitator speed and gas conditions on the metabolicconditions of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. In addition, the ability of bacteria to utilize diesel oil and to reduce sulphate was analyzed. Biography: Katarzyna Ciemniak is currently a Ph.D. candidateat the Poznan University of Life Sciences.

Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland Violacein is an organic chemical compound that is derived from indole. Microorganisms capable of producing violacein are characterized by a dark purple coloration of the colonies. As shown in recent years, this compound has antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer properties. Studies on violaceins influence on various cell lines, conducted by many independent teams, indicate that it acts on tumor lines in small concentrations, and the mechanism of its action is depended on the cell type. In some cases, violacein induces apoptosis in cancer cells without affecting normal cells. We isolated new strain, capable to violacein bioproduction. On the basis of comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA coding sequence the strain was classified as Janthinobacterium lividum (KP16). We established optimal culture conditions, as well as extraction and purification methods of this intracellular secondary metabolite: 2-fold diluted lysogenic broth (LB) as a growth medium and 5 days culture at 15 - 20 \u00b0C with shaking at 110-120 rpm. The obtained methanolic extracts were purified in the system of acetone : chloroform : ammonia (1 : 2 : 0.01) on a silica beads (Silica gel 60 with grains 0.015 - 0.040 mm). After optimizing the extraction and purification methods, the violacein was obtained with a purity of over 95%. Subsequently, studies concerning proliferative and metabolic activity of violacin-treated melanoma cell lines were performed. The results showed a clear selective effect of violacein on metastatic cells. Biography: Patrycja Kowalska is currently a MSc.Eng. student at the Warsaw University of Technology.

Poznan University of Life Sciences, Poland Lactoferrin (Lf) is a biologically active glycoprotein from the transferrin family, mainly found in milk. Lf exhibits antimicrobial, immunomodulating and anti-cancer activity. Lab-scale experiments were carried out to generate input data for simulations of an industrial plant for Lf production. Lf was purified using an ion exchange chromatography. Three ion exchange resins have been tested: Amberlite XAD761, 50WX4 and SP-Sepharose. Two different elution were employed: linear gradient and step gradient. The bicinchoninic acid protein assay method with BSA protein standard was used for further analysis of protein fractions. The composition of the different fractions was investigated by using SDS-PAGE electrophoresisto assess their purity. The conceptual project and economic analysis of a plant for production of LF were done using the software SuperPro Designer version 10. Best results were obtained when SP-Sepharose was used as an stationary phase leading to a total recovery of Lf from column. The resin capacity determined using pure Lf was equal to 60 mg Lf/ml.The linear gradient resulted in the separation of lactoferrin into Lf a and Lf b, while in the step gradient, only one peak of lactoferrin was obtained. However, the most favorable was separation in step gradient, becausein this method, higher concentrations of lactoferrin were obtained. Simulation results performed in SuperPro Designer indicate that the step method was more economical than the linear gradient method; therefore changing the Lf production method to step could reduce the cost of Lf production from milk whey.

In this work, a metagenomic survey for bacteria present in three different substrates, namely soil, compost and digestate, were carried out. Bacteria belonging to genus with agricultural importance, such as plant growth promotion (PGP), were selected for further analysis. Briefly, bacteria with putative PGP activities were isolated and cultivated toward the goal of formulating a biofertilizer. Samples from soil, compost and digestate were Lysobacter, Varioborax, Azospirillum, and Paenibacillus). A total of 152 strains were isolated, corresponding to 47, 42 and 63 from soil, compost and digestate; respectively. Then, pure bacterial strainswere assessed as PGP agents by evaluating the production of indol aceticacid, gibberellic acid, and siderophore, as well as seed germination. Forty bacterial strains that showed PGP activity were tested for antagonistic behaviors. At last, 17strains were selected for PGP effects on Dactylisglomerata L. Strains with the higher PGP activities were identified as Microbacterium sp., Enterobacter ludwigii and Rahnella aquatilis. Taken together, the combination of metagenomic information and classical lab procedures allowed to formulate a novel biofertilizer for plant growth promotion, which is the first step to improve crop productivity.

Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional/Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Biotecnolog\u00eda Aplicada, Mexico Knowing the effect of digestate that its the anaerobic digestion subproduct of solid residues of cattle, on the yield of forage grasses and legumes, is a justification to reduce the use of agrochemicals. The aim was to evaluate the effect of concentration, harvest frequency and irrigation frequency on the components of the yield of Ryegrass and White clover. To do this, evaluate digestate concentrations (20, 40 and 60%), harvest frequencies (4, 5 and 6 weeks) and irrigation frequencies (15 and 30 days) were applied. The variables were: Dry matter, weight of leaves, stems, petiole, plant height, growth rate of the crop. The digestate was acquired in Chapingo University. A factorial design with arrangement 3*3*2 was used, and mean comparisons were made by Tukey (P<0.05), by the GLM procedure of the SAS software. The results showed that the highest yield, weight of leaves, stems, growth rate of the crop and height of plant was with the treatment of 60% of digestate, harvest frequency every four week and the irrigation every 15 days in both species (P<0.01). It is concluded that the concentration, harvest frequencies and digestate irrigation frequencies affect the yield and can be used as substitute of agrochemicals fertilizer. Biography: M. C.

Skin ulcers are commonly associated with elderly, bedridden, and debilitated patients, spinal cord injury and patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Diabetes increases the risk of skin ulcers because of its association with nerve damage (neuropathy), poor circulation and infection. Current treatment of skin ulcers includes traditional wound dressings, antibiotics, and debridement to remove necrotic tissues. One major disadvantage of using excessive antibiotics in skin ulcer treatment is antibiotics resistance. Herbal antimicrobials are expected to be non-cytotoxic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory effect and will promote skin ulcer healing. Our aim in this study is to investigate various formulas of natural herbs e.g. Curcumin, and Ginsengs to enhance skin ulcer healing in animal models of skin ulcers. Our preliminary data show promising results in skin healing improvement both in Diabetic and Non diabetic pressure ulcer models. Ongoing work is verifying the healing and antibacterial potential of such formulas.

St. Marks Sec Public school, India Introduction Bacterial and fungal infection in humans and plants is an undiscriminating concern to countries worldwide. Large number of it occurs in developing countries with poor economic condition. Eichhornia crassipes, also known as water hyacinth in English, is a floating hydrophytic plant that is notorious for its invasive ability. Due to its prolificness, the plant constantly and quickly causes eutrophication and retardation of the flow of the water it lives in. This results in the need of constant removal of this plant by the people. This research has led to the discovery of using the abundantly found Eichhornia crassipes, as a cheap yet effective source of antibacterial and antifungal agent. Method and Experiment Design The experiment was conducted in two sets, each set is divided into two parts and each part was subdivided into three elements of different microbes. SET 1, Part 1 1. The ethanol extract of Eichhornia crassipes is first purified through centrifugation and pasteurisation, and then diluted into 3 different concentrations; 75%, 50% and 25%. In three trials, each of the three Eichhornia crassipes extract concentrations is tested against the three bacterias: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sobrinus and Escherichia coli, in vitro, by the cylinder plate assay method. 2. Water is used as negative control and ampicillin is used as positive control and comparison, being a representative of conventional antibacterial agents. 3. The size of zone of inhibition produced after incubation will be the measure of the antibacterial effect of the extract. SET 1, Part 2 1. The ethanol extract of Eichhornia crassipes is first purified through centrifugation and pasteurisation, and then diluted into 3 different concentrations; 75%, 50% and 25%. In three trials, each of the three Eichhornia crassipes extract concentrations is tested against the two fungi: Magnaporthe grisea, Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger, in vitro, by the cylinder plate assay method. 2. Water is used as negative control and fluconazole is used as positive control and comparison, being a representative of conventional Anti fungal agents. 3. The size of zone of inhibition produced after incubation will be the measure of the Anti fungal effect of the extract. SET 2, Part 1 A second set of experiment is conducted to test whether the extract is bacteriostatic or bactericidal. The second experiment involves: 1. The transfer of the inhibition zone liquid into a new nutrient media. 2. Presence of bacteria on the new media after 24 hours incubation will determine the type of the antibacterial activity. SET 2, Part 2 A second set of experiment is conducted to test whether the extract is fungistatic or fungicidal. The second experiment involves: 1. The transfer of the inhibition zone liquid into a new nutrient media. 2. Presence of fungus on the new media after 24 hours incubation will determine the type of the antibacterial activity. Result and Analysis SET 1, Part 1 The negative control shows no inhibition effect, indicated by the absence of inhibition zone. The highest inhibition effect is produced by the 75% concentration,. The smallest inhibition effect is produced by the 25% concentration. The Ampicillin produces higher inhibition effect than the extracts. SET 1, Part 2 The negative control shows no inhibition effect, indicated by the absence of inhibition zone. The highest inhibition effect is produced by the 75% concentration,. The smallest inhibition effect is produced by the 25% concentration. SET 2, Part 1 Presence of bacteria in the new nutrient media of the experiment indicates that the extract is bacteriostatic. SET 2, Part 2 Absence of fungi in the new nutrient media of the experiment indicates that the extract is Fungicidal. Three new molecules were derived from the extracts using Beta lactamase test, lanosterol tests and various other tests. Conclusion: The antibacterial property of Eichhornia crassipes is due to the presence of two bioactive chemicals (derived); flavonoid and alkaloid. The Anti fungal property of Eichhornia crassipes is due to the presence of bioactive chemicals (derived) similar to fluconazole. Eichhornia crassipes extract possesses antibacterial and Anti fungal is bacteriostatic and fungicidal respectively. Therefore, Eichhornia crassipes is a good and cheaper substitute of antibacterial due to its easy accessibility and abundance.

University Badji Mokhtar Annaba, Algeria Stress is a major current problem both in humans and in animals and implement strategies to limit sometimes adverse effects. In addition, exposure to stress causes behavioral and immune disorder in rodents. Experimentally, this modification is based on the intensity and type of exerted stress. The objective of this work is to study the effect of three types of stresses, acute restraint, and predation by separation to assess immune and behavioral changes in the Wistar rat. Comparison between the three types of stresses, Behavioral and adaptive changes in the rat are an attempt to identify the behavioral parameters evaluated from the open fields andmaze. Our results on stressed rats showed the following: in world population has caused an increasing demand for food, especially those of vegetable origin. Consequently, to meet this demand, farmers have used agrochemicals to improve crop yields. The objective of this work was to evaluate the growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in response to the application of two types of organic fertilizers: compost and digestate, each of them obtained from organicwaste and cowdung; respectively. Plants with untreated soil were grown as a negative control, while plants grown in the presence of a chemicalfertilizer (NPK 17-17-17) were established as positive controls. In the case of plants treated with compost, concentrations of 20%, 40%, 50%, 60% and were 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% with frequencies of 15 and 30 days. The height of the plant, fresh weight, leaf area and root were measured. The experiments showed that the best compost treatment was the 100% application, in which the height of the plants was 52% higher and the fresh weights even times higher than the negative control. The Best digestate treatment was at a concentration of 80% and a watering frequency of 15 days. In the latter case, the height of the plants and fresh weightwas 65% and 89% greater tan the negative control. In summary, it is posible to improve the growth of lettuce by applying compost or digestate; however, more experiments are needed to find the right combination.

However, even with the numerous industrial applications of lipases, there are limited studies aiming to characterize and optimize lipase activity especially that of yeast lipase-producing microorganisms. This work aims to select and identify lipase-producing yeasts isolated from Makiling Forest Reserve (MFR), Philippines and to optimize conditions to maximize lipase production. A total of 144 wild yeasts were tested for their lipase producing potential and strain B1-7 showed the highest lipase activity in both solid and liquid selection media (7.6 EAI and 0.082 U/mL-min activity, respectively). Strain B1-7 was molecularly identified by sequencing the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of the fungal rRNA operon DNA as Cryptococcus The optimum lipase activity (0.66 U/mL-min) of the putative C. flavescens strain obtained using Response Surface Method (Box-Behnken Design) were 5.0 C:N value, pH 6.0 and 0.5% inducer. Lipase activity was significantly affected by the C:N to percent inducer interaction (p= 0.010) and % inducer = 0.040). fed-batch fermentation experiment, activity was 0.115 U/mL-min. A negative correlation (R2= -0.426) was observed between lipase activity and biomass suggesting that lipase production did not depend on biomass. Moreover, no change in lactose concentration was observed suggesting that it was not used as the primary source of carbon. Hence, we can exploit the potential of producing a new strain for industrial application.

Accurate and specific non-invasive biomarkers are urgently needed for the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients and Methods: We performed bioinformatic analysis to retrieve a novel panel of circRNAs potentially relevant in HCC. We examined their expression in the sera of sixty-eight HCC patients, sixty chronic hepatitis C(CHC) patients and 36 healthy controls using RT-qPCR. We examined the performance characteristics of the selected circRNA biomarker panel in comparison to alpha fetoprotein. In addition, we performed cox regression analysis to correlate between their expression levels and patient survival. Results: biomarker biomarker potential with relatively high sensitivities and specificities. The combined panel showed superior performance characteristics to those of AFP. Conclusion: Through our analysis of this preliminary data, we believe that this novel circRNA-based biomarker panel could potentially be used in the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. 1University of Siena, Department of Life Sciences, Italy 2University of Siena, Department of Biotechnology, Italy Finding new strategies to direct drug carrying nanovesicles towards specific cellular targets is one of the major goals of Biomedical Research today. Recently, we found a fucosylated structure exclusive of high proliferative cells, which is responsible for a peculiar uptake mechanism alternative to the classic ones and dependent on alpha(1-2)fucosylation. This structure, detectable by using the fucose-binding lectin from Lotus tetragonolobus (LTL), was first observed in CVEC and then in A431 and DU145. It appears as a network of tubules extending between the perinuclear region and the cellular periphery. LTL binding sites were also found to be exposed at the cell surface in a very restricted region. The uptake capacity of the LTL-positive tubular structure was then demonstrated by testing the lectin with living cells. Other lectins tested in the same way were found to enter the cells through the classical endocytotic mechanism. In order to exploit this new uptake mechanism as drug delivery system, we constructed and tested in DU145 doxorubicin-loaded liposomes functionalized with LTL (LTL-Dox-L). We confirmed that the LTL-Dox-L enters the cells as the corresponding lectin and that by this vector the intracellular delivery of the drug was much more than that entered via unmodified doxorubicin-loaded liposomes. By electron microscopy we also demonstrated that liposomes enter the cells one by one in tiny tubules that never fuse with lysosomes. Therefore, liposome functionalization with LTL promises to broaden the therapeutic potential of liposomal doxorubicin treatment, decreasing non-specific toxicity. More recent results have indicated the actin cytoskeleton as responsible of the integrity of the tubular structure: destruction of actin filaments with Cytochalasin D gives rise to the gradual disappearance of the tubular LTL positive structure, until it remains as vesicles in the perinuclear region. The treatment with Cytochalasin D also strongly decreases the entrance in the cells of LTL-Dox-L. Biography: Domenico Nolfi was born in Sicily on the 12th of December, 1991.
