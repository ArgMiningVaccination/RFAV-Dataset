With the rising acceptance of alternative medicine, different tools for healing have become more mainstream. From acupuncture sessions to tarot card readings to crystal healing, shamanic journeys to aura interpretations, people are discovering more and more ways to find clarity and relieve various ailments aside from traditional means. Using healing crystals is one of these \"new to western mainstream society\" but not new to the world practices. Healing stones have in fact been used for thousands of years. Crystals throughout history Various crystals adorned the breastplates of soldiers in ancient battles as tokens of good luck and strength, were given as gifts to find favor among royalty and were used in antiquated medicine practices as curing stones. Healing crystals can be used during meditation or yoga practice, incorporated within a piece of jewelry or just placed within your home. Below, we'll go over some of the most popular crystals and what healing benefits they each have, but first, a little crystal 101. What is crystal healing? There are many different kinds of healing crystals and each one has its own purported benefits. In fact, some estimates say that there are as many as 45 different varieties of crystals that can be useful to heal the mind or body in various ways. So what makes a healing crystal an actual healing crystal and not just a pretty rock? Conduits for healing An alternative medicine practitioner or crystal healer would say that crystals are actually conduits for healing. By allowing positive energy to flow into the body, negative energy is then able to flow out, helping rid a person of disease, which could mean a specific sickness or simply negative vibes. However, in the end, healing crystals really are just pretty rocks. There is no scientific evidence to show that crystals can actually heal various maladies and traditional doctors wouldn't try to cure a disease by sending a patient home with a prescription for crystals. That said, while there are no official, verified benefits to using crystals, that doesn't mean they're useless. Far from it, in fact! Why are crystals so powerful? Even though science can't verify crystals' power, that hasn't stopped people from using healing crystals since ancient times.

You can also look to your zodiac sign to see which healing crystals are associated with when you were born and choose your birthstone, which will have an added significance. If you're still unsure about which stone to purchase for yourself, you can try a crystal healing session first to work on anything that's currently bothering you. A crystal healer can tell you more about the stones that interest you and show you how to use them, as well as suggest other crystals that you may have never heard of. This session can also be a great way to relax and get in touch with your mind-body connection. Finally, while crystal healing may or may not be scientifically proven as effective, these crystals truly are what you make of them. When you use crystals thoughtfully and with a clear intention, you allow yourself to go inward and focus on what's important to you. Your mind is more powerful that you can imagine\u2014by allowing yourself to be honest and vulnerable about something you want to work on, you can use your healing crystal to channel better, more mindful actions in your daily life.
