Researchers analyzed the association of a crisis standards of care (CSOC) scoring system with resource prioritization and estimated excess mortality by race, ethnicity, and residence in a socially vulnerable area during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from 6 hospitals in greater Boston, Massachusetts, they found that a CSOC priority score resulted in lower prioritization of Black patients to receive scarce resources. Also, a model using a random lottery resulted in more estimated excess deaths overall without improving equity by race. AHRQ-funded; HS024288. Citation: Riviello ED, Dechen T, O'Donoghue AL .

The purpose of this study was to analyze the mortality rate and complications associated with treatment at the COVID-19-dedicated hospitals. Findings showed that, in this cohort study, COVID-19-dedicated hospitals in Minnesota had multiple benefits, including providing high-volume repetitive treatment and isolating patients with the infection. This experience suggests improved in-hospital mortality for patients treated at dedicated hospitals. AHRQ-funded; Citation: Bergman ZR, Usher M, Olson A .

This study's objective was to determine the association between corticosteroid administration and impaired glycemic control among COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and/or veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted between March 9 and May 17, 2020 at 12 US hospitals. The primary outcome measured was days spent with at least 1 episode of blood glucose either >180 mg/dL or <80 mg/dL within the first 28 days of admission. The authors included 292 mechanically ventilated patients. Sixty-six patients (22.6%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Seventy-one patients (24.3%) received a cumulative dose of at least an equivalent of 320 mg methylprednisolone. After adjustment for gender, history of diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, sequential organ failure assessment score on intensive care unit day 1, and length of stay, administration of 320 mg methylprednisolone equivalent was associated with 4 additional days spent with glucose either <80 Corticosteroid administration and impaired glycemic control in Yoeli D, Sundaram SS Decreased access to pediatric liver transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the study was to explore and understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nationwide pediatric liver transplants. The researchers compared data for transplant waiting list additions, removals, and liver transplants during pre-COVID-19 (March-November 2016-2019), early COVID-19 (March-May 2020), and late COVID-19 (June-November 2020). The study results showed a 38% decrease in liver transplantations during early COVID-19, recovering to pre-pandemic rates during late COVID-19. White children had a 30% decrease in overall liver transplantation, while non-White children had a 44% decrease in overall liver transplantation. Additions to the waiting list decreased 25% during COVID-19, with Black transplant candidates the most affected, and children spent longer on the waiting list during early COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 (140 vs. 96 days). The study concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic decreased access to pediatric liver transplants, especially during early COVID-19. The researchers discussed that although the rate of pediatric liver transplants has resumed to pre-COVID-19 levels, racial disparities must be addressed. AHRQ-funded; HS026510.

This study's objective was to identify clinical and laboratory findings that distinguished multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) from febrile illnesses in which MIS-C was considered but ultimately excluded, and to examine the diseases that most often mimicked MIS-C in a tertiary medical center. All children who were hospitalized at the author's center with fever were evaluated for MIS-C and were compared for clinical signs and symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 status, and laboratory studies between those with and without MIS-C. The authors identified 50 confirmed MIS-C cases (MIS-C(+)) and 68 children evaluated for, but ultimately not diagnosed with, MIS-C (MIS-C(-)). Symptoms of conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, fatigue, hypoxaemia, tachypnoea and hypotension at presentation were significantly more common among MIS-C(+) patients, with MIS-C(+) and MIS-C(-) patients having similar elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP), but were differentiated by thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, BNP and troponin. Children hospitalized with MIS-C were older, more likely to present with conjunctivitis, oral mucosa changes, abdominal pain and hypotension, and had higher neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios and lower platelet counts.

The authors sought to assess changes in surgical case mix and outcomes due to restructuring during the pandemic. Institutional ACS-NSQIP data was used to identify patients undergoing surgery at a single tertiary care institution in the Deep South. They found that surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic were more often outpatient without differences in post-operative outcomes. They recommended additional analysis to determine the impact of duration of operative delay on surgical outcomes with restructuring focusing more on outpatient surgeries. AHRQ-funded; HS013852.

COVID-19, Talluri R, Camino AF Human immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted infection testing preferences for young Black men who have sex with men in the Southeastern United States: implications for a post-COVID-19 era. Study researchers used a discrete choice experiment to assess the preferences of Young Black Men Who Have Sex with Men (YBMSM) in the Southeastern U.S. regarding their preferences for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing locations, staffing, cost, and hours of operation. Between June 2018 and December 2019, 213 YBMSM between the ages of 16-35 years, located in Birmingham, Alabama and Jackson, Mississippi completed online surveys evaluating their preferences. Traditional, stationary testing locations were preferred by both groups over mobile testing vans. The most significant difference in preference was for local health departments in Alabama, and STI testing-only clinics in Mississippi. Both groups preferred clinician-performed testing over technician-performed testing or self-testing, with additional preferences for free testing and phone results notification (versus text). The most preferred combination among all participants was the $5 clinician-performed testing at the health department. The study concluded that YBMSM in the Southeastern United States prefer traditional testing locations staffed by experienced personnel. The study researchers advise that more research is needed to inform the best ways to approach HIV/STI testing services for YBMSM, especially in the post-COVID-19 era when delivery models are shifting toward health-focused strategies which are home-based and remote. immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted infection testing preferences for young Black men who have sex with men in the Southeastern United States: implications for a post-COVID-19 era.

This paper provides a review of perinatal research adaptations which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although in-person research activities ceased during the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting disease called COVID-19, the authors' team of university scientists across the United States utilized adapted methods to allow prospective perinatal research to continue. Novel approaches included using new and underutilized techniques for distance research such as: online recruitment, enrollment, and consent; data collection via videoconferencing; self-collection of biological samples; and new applications of smart phones and wearable vital signs measurement. The researchers found that these methods may improve recruitment success and the quality of the experience for the participants, as well as provide improved access to historically vulnerable populations, such as low-income, rural, and racially diverse pregnant and postpartum individuals and communities. The researchers concluded that the implementation of these research strategies resulted in broader, more inclusive, and diverse perinatal research access, and many of the strategies will continue to be used and refined long after the pandemic.

This study's purpose was to investigate associations between parent vaccine confidence and intentions to have their child with autism vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. A cross-sectional, web-based survey of 332 parents of children with autism spectrum disorder who were members of an integrated healthcare system in Southern California was conducted from May to July 2021. Approximately 35% of parents were going to vaccinate their child against COVID-19. Positive vaccine beliefs, healthcare provider trust, or parent vaccination status were associated with intention to vaccinate. AHRQ-funded; HS026407. Citation: Choi K, Becerra-Culqui T, Bhakta B .

Researchers sought to compare patient experience by visit type and before and during the pandemic. Using CAHPS\u00ae data, they found that patient experience with telehealth visits was as positive as or more positive than that with traditional office-based visits. Doctor communication on telehealth visits was viewed as slightly more positive than that of in-office or telephone visits. Telehealth visits were also slightly more positive than in-office visits for care coordination, overall rating of the doctor, and willingness to recommend to family and friends. Office staff were viewed less positively on the telephone than telehealth or in-office visits. Further, patient experience was similar before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. AHRQ-funded; HS025920.

The authors sought to create and validate a simple and transferable machine learning model from electronic health record data to accurately predict clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 across institutions, through use of a novel paradigm for model development and code sharing. They determined that a model to predict clinical deterioration was developed rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at a single hospital, was applied externally without the sharing of data, and performed well across multiple medical centers, patient subgroups, and time periods, showing its potential as a tool for use in optimizing healthcare resources.

Changes in health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted opioid prescribing. This study evaluated the impact of restrictions on in-person care on opioid prescribing in the outpatient setting. The hypothesis was that after restrictions to in-person care were implemented, there would be a reduction in the number of chronic and non-chronic opioid prescriptions. AHRQ-funded; HS026396.

This paper is a data-driven review of COVID-19 critical illness, including the extreme demand for intensive care unit (ICU) resources and the rapidly evolving understanding of the disease. Almost one-third of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experience critical illness. The most common type of organ failure experienced is acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which presents clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in three-quarters of ICU patients. Management of ARDS in COVID-19 patients is similar to that of non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. Mortality rates have decreased over the course of the pandemic likely due to increasing disease familiarity, data-driven pharmacologics, and improved adherence to evidence-based Jan 27;73:95-111. doi: 10.1146/annurev-med-042420-110629..

This study examined how state orders for social distancing to curb COVID-19 morbidity and mortality affected nursing home patients and what potential negative health consequences they may have had. The authors examined state social distancing restrictions from June to August of 2020 and their associations with the weekly numbers of new COVID cases, new COVID deaths, and new non-COVID deaths in nursing homes across the US. They found that stronger state social distancing measures were associated with improved outcomes, reduced across-facility disparities in COVID outcomes, and somewhat increased non-COVID-19 death rates. The estimates for non-COVID-19 deaths were sensitive to alternative model specifications. AHRQ-funded; HS026893; HS024923. Citation: Li Y, Cheng Z, Cai X .

This research letter describes a comparison of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prescription trends from January to May 2020. The authors identified HCQ dispensing from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and identified 66,253 enrollees with 134,417 HCQ fills during the study period. Nearly 13,000 new fillers (67.2%) did not have a diagnostic indication of lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria or Sjogren's syndrome. Among previous fillers, 15.1% had no indication. The most common diagnosis was RA among indicated users. The rate of HCQ fills per 1,000 enrollees increased substantially in mid-March among both new and previous HCQ fillers. For prior fillers, rates increased due to an anticipated shortage of the drug due to people using it for COVID-19 prevention. AHRQ-funded; HS025164. Citation: Levin Z, Chang J, Karaca-Mandic P .

The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine data from the Society of Critical Care Medicine Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study (Coronavirus Disease 2019) registry and describe the characteristics, ICU admissions, and outcomes in children hospitalized with COVID-19. The study included 874 children under the age of 18 hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 at 51 participating hospital centers from February 2020 to January 2021. The primary outcome was ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included hospital and ICU duration of stay and ICU, hospital, and 28-day mortality. The researchers found that the median age was 8 years, with 62.9% non-Hispanic and a boy to girl ratio of 1:2. A total of 28.2% of the children met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 46.2% were admitted to the ICU. A child's age, the presence of a fever, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and pre-existing seizure disorder were independently associated with a greater odds of ICU admission. The rate of hospital mortality for this group was 1.8%. The median duration of ICU stay was 3.9 days and the median duration of hospital stay was 4 days. For those patients with 28-day data, the survival rate was 86.3%. The researchers concluded that in this study, older age, fever, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and seizure disorder were independently related with ICU admission.

This study investigated the county-level impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on excess mortality among U.S. veterans. The authors queried Veterans Health Administration (VHA) administrative data on demographics and comorbidities for 11.4 million enrollees during 2016-2020. Eight mortality prediction models at the county-level were used including Poisson, Poisson quasi-likelihood, negative binomial, and generalized estimating equations. All models demonstrated excellent agreement between observed and predicted mortality. An excess mortality rate of 13% in 2020 was found, which corresponds to 50,299 excess deaths. Despite mortality risk factors of veterans, their excess mortality rate was slightly lower than the general population. AHRQ-funded; HS026395. Citation: Feyman Y, Auty SG, Tenso K .
