DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets :4 mg , round, white, film -coated tablets debossed with \"4MG\" on one side, and \"FBN\" on the other side. 3 Reference ID: 5053999 3 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Ocular Toxicity Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED) LYTGOBI can cause RPED , which may cause symptoms such as blurred vision. Among 318 patients who received LYTGOBI across clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] where ophthalmologic monitoring did not routinely include optical coherence tomography (OCT) , RPED occurred in 9% of patients . The median time to first onset of RPED was 40 days. RPED led to dose interruption of LYTGOBI in 1.3% of patients, dose reduction in 1.6% of patients , and permanent discontinuation in 0.3 % of patients . Perform a comprehensive ophthalmological examination, including OCT of the m acula, prior to initiation of therapy , every 2 months for the first 6 months , and every 3 months thereafter . For onset of visual symptoms, refer patients for ophthalmologic evaluation urgently, with follow -up every 3 weeks until resolution or discontinuation of LYTGOBI . Withhold or reduce the dose of LYTGOBI as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)]. Dry Eye/Corneal Keratitis Among 318 patients who received LYTGOBI across clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)], dry eye occurred in 15% of patients. Treat patients with ocular demulcents as needed. 5.2 Hyperphosphatemia and Soft Tissue Mineralization LYTGOBI can cause h nonuremic calciphylaxis , vascular calcification. effect of LYTGOBI [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2)]. Among 318 patients who received LYTGOBI across clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], hyperphosphatemia was reported in 88% of patients based on laboratory values above the upper limit of normal. The median time to onset of hyperphosphatemia was 5 days (range 3 - 117). Phosphate binders were received by 77% of patients who received LYTGOBI . Monitor for hyperphosphatemia throughout treatment. Initiate a low phosphate diet and phosphate lowering therapy when serum phosphate level is 5.5 mg/dL. For serum phosphate levels >7 mg/dL, initiate or intensify phosphate lowering therapy and dose reduce, withhold, or permanently discontinue LYTGOBI based on duration and severity of hyperphosphatemia [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)]. 5.3 Embryo -Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in an animal study and its mechanism of action, LYTGOBI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of futibatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused fetal malformations, fetal growth retardation, and embryo -fetal death at maternal exposures lower than the human exposure at the clinical dose of 20 mg based on area under the curve (AUC). 4 Reference ID: 5053999 6 Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LYTGOBI and for 1 week after the last dose of LYTGOBI . Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LYTGOBI and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Population s (8.1 , 8.3)]. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Ocular Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] Soft Tissue Mineralization [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to LYTGOBI as a single agent at 20 mg orally once daily in 318 patients including 145 patients with cholangiocarcinoma and 173 patients with other advanced solid tumors. Among 318 patients who received LYTGOBI , 37% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 13% were exposed for greater than 12 months . Previously Treated, Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma The safety of LYTGOBI was evaluated in Study TAS-120-101, which included 1 03patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic harboring Studies ( 14.1)]. Patients were treated with LYTGOBI 20 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 9 months (range: 0.5 - 25 months ). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39 % of patients receiving LYTGOBI . Serious adverse reactions in 2% of (2.9%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4.9 % of patients who received LYTGOBI . Adverse reactions requiring permanent discontinuation of LYTGOBI in one patient each were esophagitis, oral dysesthesia, bile duct obstruction, dizziness, and anemia . Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 66% of patients who received LYTGOBI. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in 5% of patients included hyper phosphatemia, and fatigue . Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 58% of patients who received LYTGOBI . Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in 2% of who received LYTGOBI included musculoskeletal pain, dry pain, dry skin , nausea, 5 Reference , urinary tract infection, p almar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and vomiting . The most common laboratory abnormalities (20%) were increased phosphate, increased creatinine, decreased hemoglobin, increased glucose, increased calcium , decreased sodium, decreased phosphate, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased alkaline phosphatase, decreased lymphocyte, increased aspartate increased partial thromboplastin decreased decreased albumin, decreased neutrophils, increased creatine kinase, increased bilirubin, decreased glucose, increased prothrombin international normalized ratio , and decreased potassiu m.

Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of drugs that are dual P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors with LYTGOBI . Concomitant use of drugs that are dual P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors with LYTGOBI may increase futibatinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)], which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions. Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid concomitant use of dual P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers with LYTGOBI . Concomitant use of drugs that are dual P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers may decrease futibatinib expo sure [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3)], which may reduce the efficacy of LYTGOBI . 7.2 Effect of LYTGOBI on Other Drugs Futibatinib is an inhibitor of P -gp and BCRP. P-gp or BCRP Substrates : Consider more frequent monitoring for adverse reactions associated with concomitantly administered drugs that are sensitive substrates of P-gp or BCRP and reduce the dose of these drugs per the irPrescribing Information . Futibatinib may increase exposure of drugs that are substrates P -gp or BCRP [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in an animal study and its mechanism of action, LYTGOBI can cause fetal harm or loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . There are no available data on the use of LYTGOBI in pregnant wome n. Oral administration of futibatinib to pregnant rats during the 8 Reference ID: 5053999 period of organogenesis at maternal plasma exposures below the human exposure at the clinical dose of 20 mg resulted in fetal malformations, fetal growth retardation, and embryo -fetal death (see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively . Data Animal Data Once daily oral administration of futibatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in 100% embryofetal mortality due to post -implantation loss at doses 10 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the recommended clinical dose of 20 mg based on body surface area, BSA ). Fetal survival was unaffected at 0.5 mg/kg per day; however,once daily oral administration of futibatinib at the 0.5 mg/kg dose level (approximately 0. 2 times the recommended clinical dose of 20 mg based on BSA) resulted in reduc ed mean fetal body weight and an increase in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations, major blood vessel variations, and reduced ossification. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of futibatinib or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on either the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from LYTGOBI in breastfed children , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential LYTGOBI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LYTGOBI [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)]. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LYTGOBI and for 1 week after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment with LYTGOBI and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LYTGOBI have not been established in pediatric patients. Animal Toxicity Data In 4- or 13-week repeat -dose toxicology studies in adult rats and dogs, findings included increased inorganic 9 Reference ID: 5053999 phosphorus and calcium in plasma, ectopic mineralization in various organs and tissues, and lesions in bone/cartilage at futibatinib exposures lower than the human exposure at the clinical doseof 20 mg. Findings in rats also included corneal lesions. Evidence of recovery in rats and dogs was observed four weeks after cessation of dosing except for the ectopic mineralization . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 103 patients treated with LYTGOBI in Study TAS -120-101 , 22% were 65 yearsor older. Based on available data, n o overall differences in safety or effectiveness of LYTGOBI have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients . 11 DESCRIPTION Futibatinib is a kinase inhibitor molecular mass of 418.45 g/mole . Futibatinib has the following chemical structure: Futibatinib a white crystalline powder . The solubility of futibatinib is pH dependent with decreasing solubility with increasing pH , being practically insoluble at pH 3 or higher . Futibatinib is insoluble in water and poorly soluble in common solvents . LYTGOBI is supplied as 4 mg film -coated tablets for oral administration . Each tablet contains inactive ingredients of corn cellulose, stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, coating material contains hypromellose, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide . 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Futibatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of FGFR 1 , 2, 3 , and 4 with IC 50 values of less than 4 nM . Futibatinib covalently binds FGFR. Constitutive FGFR signaling can support the proliferation and survival of malignant cells. Futibatinib inhibited FGFR phosphoryla tion and downstream signaling and decreased cell viability in cancer cell lines with FGFR alterations including FGFR activity in mouse and rat xenograft models of human tumors with activating FGFR genetic alterations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Serum Phosphate Futibatinib increased serum phosphate levels due inhibition. Serum phosphate increased with increas ing futibatinib exposure across the dose range of 4 to 24 mg orally once daily (0.2 to 1.2 times the 10 Reference ID: 5053999 recommended dose), with increased risk of hyperphosphatemia at higher futibatinib exposure. Cardiac Electrophysiology At four times the approved recommended dose, LYTGOBI does not cause clinically significant QTc interval prolong ation . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of futibatinib administered 20 mg once daily were evaluated in patients with advance d solid tumors unless otherwise specified . Futibatinib exposure (AUC ) increased proportionally over the dose range from 4 to 24 mg orally once daily (0.2 to 1.2 times the maximum approved recommended dosage ). At the recommended dosage, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) maximal concentration of futibatinib at stead ystate (Cmax,ss) was 144 AUC ss)was 790 nghr/mL (45%), with no accumulation after repeat doses. Absorption Median time to reach maximum futibatinib plasma concentration (T max) was 2 (range: 1.2to22.8) hours . Effect of Food Administration of LYTGOBI with a high -fat and high-calorie meal (900 to 1000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content from fat) decreased futibatinib AUC by 11% and C max by 42% in healthy subjects . Distribution The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) is 66 L (18%). Futibatinib is 95% bound to human plasma protein at 0.2 to 5 \u00b5mol/L in vitro , primarily to albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein . Elimination The mean (CV%) elimination half -life (T 1/2) of futibatinib is 2.9 hours (27 %) and the geometric mean (CV%) apparent clearance (CL/F) is 20 L/h (23%). Metabolism Futibatinib is pr imarily metabolized by CYP3A and to a lesser extent by CYP 2C9 and CYP2D6 in vitro. Unchanged futibatinib is the major drug -related moiety in plasma (59% of radio activity ) in healthy subjects . Excretion Following a single oral dose of 20 mg radiolabeled futibatinib, approximately 91% of the total recovered radioactivity was observed in feces and 9% in urine , with negligible unchanged futibatinib in urine or feces . Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the systemic exposure of futibatinib were observed based on age (18 - 82 years), sex, race (White, Asian, and African American ), body weight (36 - 152 kg), mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 - 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft -Gault ), or mild hepatic impairment bilirubin upper of normal (ULN) and aspartate transaminase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to ULN and any ID: 5053999 The pharmacokinetics of futi batinib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 -29 mL/min) , renal dialysis in end -stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min) , or moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bili rubin > 1.5ULN and any AST) . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Futibatinib Dual P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor s: CYP3A inhibitor ) increased single max AUC by 41% CYP3A inducer ) decreased single max and AUC by 64% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. of a P modulator (without CYP3A or a strong CYP3A P -gp modulation) on the exposure of futibatinib has not been investigated . Gastric acid reducing agents : Co-administration of multiple doses of lansoprazole (proton pump inhibitor ) had no effect on single dose futibatinib AUC Effect of Futibatinib On Other Drugs CYP3A substrates: Co-administration of multiple doses of futibatinib had no effect on single dose midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate ) AUC. In Vitro Studies Effect of Transporter s on Futibatinib : Futibatinib is a substrate for P -gp and BCRP, but not for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Effect of Futibatinib on CYP , CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Effect of Futibatinib on Transporter Systems: Futibatinib inhibits P -gp TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with futibatinib. Futibatinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Futibatinib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay. Futibatinib was not clasto genic in a rat bone marrow micronucleus assay or a rat DNA damaging ( Come t) assay . Dedicated fertility studies with futibatinib have not been conducted. 12 Reference ID: 5053999 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 multicenter, open -label, single -arm trial, evaluated the efficacy of LYTGOBI in 103 patients with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of FGFR2 fusions or other rearrangements was determined in 102 enrolled patients (9 9%) using next generation sequencing (NGS) testing . Qualifyin g in-frame fusions and other were predicted to have a breakpoint within intron 17/exon 18 of the FGFR2 gene leaving the FGFR2 kinase domain intact. Patients received LYTGOBI at a dos age of 20 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) as determined by an independent review committee (IRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST) v1.1. The trial population characteristics were: M edian age was 58 years (range: 22 to 79 years) with 22% of patients 65 years , 56% were female, race was : 50% White , 29% Asian , 8% Black or African American , 1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander , 13% unknown, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (4 7%) or 1 (53%) . Seventy -eight percent (78%) of patients had in -frame FGFR2 gene fusions and the most commonly identified FGFR2 partner was BICC1 (n=24, 23%). Twenty -two percent (22%) of patients had other FGFR2 rearrangements that may not be in -frame with the partner gene or the partner gen e was not identifiable . All patients had received at least 1 prior systemic therapy , 30% had 2 prior lines of therapy, and 23% had 3 or more prior lines of therapy. All patients received a prior platinum -based therapy including 91% with prior gemcitabine/cisplatin . Efficacy results are summarized in Table 5. The median time to response was 2.5 months (range 0.7 - 7.4 months).
