Random numbers will be prepared by an independent third-party statistician who prepared a list of random group codes for this study. Enrolled subjects will be given a subject number during the screening process and, upon formal enrolment, will be randomly assigned to either the test or control group with a corresponding random number. Interventions Treatment method Phase 1: The control group will be treated with conventional Western medicine, whereas the treatment group will receive treatment with the Chinese herbal formula. Treatment with the Chinese herbal formula will start on the 5th day of menstruation cycle. The medicines used will be Er Zhi Wan combined with Si Wu Tang (Radix et Rhizoma Ligustrum 15 g, Radix Radix 15g,eclipta 10g); which will be taken for 10-15days. Phase 2: After ET, the control group will be treated conventionally with no TCM intervention, and the treatment group will continue to take Chinese herbal medicine, changing to Shou Tai pills ( Morinda officinalis 15 g, Teasel 15gCuscutae taken for 14days. The hospital will be responsible for the decoction of 200 mL per dose, 1 dose per day, divided into 2 doses in the morning and in the evening. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be measured, and an hCG>30 IU will be considered to indicate biochemical pregnancy. Ultrasound monitoring will be performed 30 days after ET to calculate the clinical pregnancy rate. |Study Type the Short-term Intervention of Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbs in the Freeze-all IVF Cycle to Improve Pregnancy Rate| |Estimated Study Start Date :||June 15, 2021| |Estimated Primary Date :||December Chinese Medicine herbs treatment group | the treatment group will receive treatment with the Chinese herbal formula on the 5th day of the menstrual cycle and lasts to 14 days after IVF-ET. | Drug: Prescription of traditional Chinese Medicine named Er Zhi Wan combined with Si Wu Tang | The medicines used in this study including Radix et Rhizoma Ligustrum 15 g, Radix Radix will be taken for 10-15days.After the ET, the treatment group will continue to take Chinese herbal medicine, changing to Shou Tai pills ( Morinda officinalis 15 g, Teasel 15gCuscutae taken for 14days.
