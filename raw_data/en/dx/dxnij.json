A.13 Imaging And Of ................................ ............................... 71 D.12 Pronator (Median ................................ ................................ 163 NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 7 A. GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended ap plication of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatm ent required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activit ies with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must uti lize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesse s. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of m otion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognit ion, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified . Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or mod ality is not producing positive results within a well -defined timeframe , the provider should either mod ify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluat e the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter . These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inherently mental health issues , and shorter for other non - musculosk eletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the commun ity should be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related in jury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational str ategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 8 reassu ring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete with out addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of faci litating self - management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for co nducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may su bstantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this doc ument. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frame s for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on th e date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinica l judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames dis cussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those p atients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subject ive symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental h ealth issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychologic al issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient . At 6-12 weeks, alte rnate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health is sues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery . For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorde r as part of the claim at issue), r eferral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner . Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and mana gement of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatri c or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological claim. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 9 Treatment Ap proaches A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional t reatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are vie wed as a means to fa cilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorp orate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or comm unity settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by histo ry taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic spe cificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedu re over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of patient's t olerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a sec ond diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. physiatrist, sports medicine physician or other app ropriate specia list) radiologist or surgeon docum ents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imagi ng studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some c ases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the patho logy when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections w hen clinically indicated, and post - operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding serial imaging, (including x -rays, but particular ly CT scans), it must be recognize d that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and assoc iated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. There fore, prudent choice of procedures (s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 10 diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, an d promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. A.14 Surgical Intervent ions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be base d upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation o f these factors must lead to a spe cific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cas es, shared decision making with th e patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the p ros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre -Authorizati on All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Trea tment Guidelines are consider ed authorized, with the exception of the procedures list ed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must re quest pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second o r subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgica l procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre -authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric E valuations In select patients, mental health evalua tions are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental heal th professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inheren tly a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or con sequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question ; or there is a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse b y, or is impeding t he recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is a t issue in the claim in question . Tests of psychological fu nction or psychometric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associa ted psychological, personality and psychosocial issues . Although t hese instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analy sis of all availabl e data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patie nt is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpret er must be provided . NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 11 Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding th e recovery from (or both) a work -related, medical injury or illness, then a o ne-time visit for initial psychiat ric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider . If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, time for such testing should not exceed an additional t hree hou rs of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central p art of the initial claim , or in which there is a mental heal th issue that is secondary or consequential to the work -related, medical injury or illness, that is par t of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psycho social I ntervention Following ps ychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, suc h intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other t reatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral g oals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum d uration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseli ng is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: ni ne to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be r equired, and if further treatment is indicated, documentatio n of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first s ix months of treatment. For treatm ent expected to last six t o twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyon d twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. A ll parties should strive for ongoi ng and continuous communic ations, in order to facilitate seamless , continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Ev aluation (FCE) Functional capacity eval uation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of t he various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as enduran ce, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of- motion, coord ination and strength, worker habit s, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Componen ts of this evaluation may include: (a) ation; lift/carrying a nalysis; (e) job - specific activity tolerance; (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 12 screening; (h) non -material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavi oral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In mo st cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be c onsidered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, wh en the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician mus t interpret the FCE in light of th e individual patient's pre sentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose maling ering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guideline s, return to work is defined as an y work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work statu s is part of medical care , and should be included in the treatme nt and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at eve ry outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan a nd should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime g oal in treating occupation al injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain informat ion regarding the individual or specific demands of the pati ent's pre -injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repeti tive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, p sychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previou s job task s or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about mo dified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more tha n one job site evaluation may be indicated . Ideally, the ph ysician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it i s recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information , as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area . NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 13 Frequ ency: one or two c ontacts 1st contact : Patient is in a functional state where the pa tient c an perform some work. 2nd c ontact : Patient has advanc ed to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician s hall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical E vidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vett ed the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have reli ed on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigati onal and not approved for any purpose, application or indica tion by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients re cognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 14 Elbow Inju ries Effective date will coincide with the launch of OnBoard: Limited Release B. Introduction to Elbow Injury B.1 History Taking a nd Physical Examination History taking and p hysical examination establish th e foundation/basis for and dictate subsequent stages of diagnos tic and therapeuti c procedures. When findings of cl inical evaluation s and those of other diagnostic procedures a re not consistent with each other, the objective clinic al findings should have preference. The medical reco rds should reasonably docume nt the following: B.1.a History o f Present Injury Mechanism of injury: This inc ludes details of symptom onset and progression, and symptoms that may arise from postural or functional accommodation to the elbow injury; Relati onship to work: This in cludes a statement of the probability t hat the illness or injury is work -related; Prior occupational and non -occupation al injuries : To the sam e are a including specific prior treatment; Ability to perform job duties and activities of daily living ; and Exacerbating and alleviating factors for symptoms; not limited to the elbow. B.1.b Past History Past med ical history includes, but i s not limited to, neoplasm, gout , arthritis, and diabetes; Review of systems includ es, bu t is not limited t o, symptoms of rheumatologic, neurologi c, endocrine, neoplastic, and other systemic Vocatio nal a nd recreational pursuit s; Prior imaging studies ; and Past surgical history. B.1.c Phys ical Examination Examinatio n of a joint should include the joint above and below the affected area, includin g the opposite side for comp arison. Physical examination sh ould include NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 15 accepted tests and exam t echniq ues applicable to the joint or area being examined, inclu ding: Visual inspection; Palpation; Range of motion/quality of motion and p assive); Strength (wea kness/atrophy); Joint integrity /stability; Examination for deformity (including cl aw phe nomenon)/displacem ent; If applicable to injury, integrit y of distal circulation; and/or If applicable, neurological exam (i.e: sensory and motor function , reflexes) as clinically indicated. B.2 Red Flags Certain findings, \"red flags \", raise suspicion of potentially serious medical conditio ns. Assessment (history and phy sical examination) should include evaluation for red flags. In the elbow these findings or indicators may i nclude: fra cture, dislocations, inf ection or inflammation; and neurologica compartment s yndrome. Further evaluation/cons ultation or urgent/emergency intervention may be indicated, and the New York Elbow Injury Medical Tre atment Guid elines incorporate chang es in clinical management triggered by the presence of \"red flags.\" Table 1 - Red Flag s for Potentially Serious Elbow D isord ers Disorder Medical H istory Physical Examination Fracture History of significant trauma Fall on outstret ched hand Fall onto late ral elbow Deformity consistent with fra cture Reduced range(s) of motion Pain with range of motion Disturbance in the tri angul ar relationship between the olecranon and the epicondyl es Significant bruising, if subacute (unu sual) Dislocation History of fall/ trauma as above History of deformity wi th or without spontaneous reduction Deformity co nsistent with dislocation Hemarth rosis Infection Pain, swell ing, redness Diabetes mellitus History of immunosuppression (e.g., transp lant, chemo therapy, HIV) History of systemic symptoms Localized heat, swel ling, erythema Purulence Erythematous streaks, e specially from a portal of entry Syste mic signs of infection Tumor History of cancer Uninten tional weight loss Continuous pain, espec ially at ni ght Palpable mass not consistent wit h usual diagnoses NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 16 and not improved wit h rest Inflammation History of gout or pseudogout History of rheumato id arthritis History of othe r inflammatory arthritides Effus ion Localized heat, swelling, erythema, t enderness Rapidly Progressive Neur ologic Deficit History of neurologic di sease Trauma Abnormal neurologic examination Focal or global motor weakness dista l to the elbow Weakness may be limited to one nerve, such as hand intrinsic muscles Vascular Comprom ise History of diabetes mellitus Tobacco use History of fracture or disloc ation History of vascular disease of any kind Decreased or absent peripheral puls es an d delayed capillary ref ill Edema Compartment Syndrome History of trauma, surgery or extreme unaccustomed forceful activity Persis tent forearm pain and \"tightness\" Tingl ing, burning, or numbness Palpable tenderness an d tension of involved compartment Pain intensified with stret ch to involved muscles Paresthes ia, paresis, and sensory deficits Diminis hed pulse a nd prolonged capillary r efill C. Diagnostic Testing and Test ing Procedures C.1 Introduction One diagnostic i maging procedure may provide the same or distinctive informat ion as obtained by other procedu res. Therefore, prudent ch oice of procedure(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a compl ementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequentia l order in multiple procedur es will ensure maximum diagnosti c accuracy, minimize adverse effect to pa tients and promote cost effectivene ss by avoiding duplication or redundanc y. All diagnostic imaging procedures have a sig nificant percentage of specificit y and sensitivity for variou s diagnoses. None is specifical ly characteristic of a certain diagnosis. Clinical information obtained by history taking and phys ical examination should be the basis for selecti on and interpretation of imaging proce dure results. When a d iagnostic procedure, in conjunct ion with clinical information, provides s ufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, the second diagn ostic procedure will be redundant if it is perfo rmed only for diagnostic purposes . At the same time, a subs equent diagnostic procedure (tha t may be a repeat of the same procedure, when the re habilitation physician, radiologist or surgeon documents that t he study was of inadequate quality to make a dia gnosis) can be a complementary di agnos tic procedure if the fi rst or preceding procedures, in conjunction with clinical information, ca nnot provid e an accurate diagnosis. Usually, preference of a procedure ov er others depends upon availability, a patient's tolerance, and/or the treating p ractitioner's familiarity wi th the procedure. It is recogni zed that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and to follow the progress of treatme nt in some cases. It may be of va lue to repeat diagnostic pro cedures (e.g. imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 17 or stage the p athology when there is progression of s ymptoms or findings, prior to surgical intervent ions and therapeutic injections when warra nted, and post -operatively to fo llow the healing process. Regarding CT examinations, it must be r ecognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. When indicate d, the following studies can be util ized for further evaluation of elbow injuries, base d upon the mechanism of injury, symptom s, and patient history . C.2 Diagnostic Criteria and Differentia l Dia gnosis The criteria pr esented in Table 2 follow the cl inical thought process, from the mechanism of illnes s or injury, to unique sy mptoms and signs of a particular disor der. Elbow disorders, as described by the patien t, can sometimes be consistent wi th radiating symptoms from t he neck or shoulder, and the exa mining physician's diagnostic acumen is important in determining the source. For example, mid -upper -arm pain on arm elevation is most likely related to a problem o riginating in the shoulder area, not the elbow, although patients may have pain in both areas . It is important to note that lateral elb ow pain ca n be due to cervical disc disease (C6), radial nerve entrapment (including radial tunnel syndrome), synovitis d ue to degeneration, or true epico ndylitis (enthesitis). A complaint of tingling and/or numbn ess in the fourth and fifth fingers is usu ally due t o ulnar nerve impingement at the elbow, C8 cervical radiculopat hy, or impingement of the ulnar nerve at the wri st. Thoracic outlet syndrome can be co nsidered, although that condition is generally believed to be quite uncommon (see Shoulder Disord ers chapte r). For the differential diagnosis of lateral epicondylalgia, C 6 radiculopathy is believed to be the most commo n alternate diagnosis and not inf reque ntly presents with late ral elbow pain and paresthesias in the thumb. The differential diagnosis o f medial e picondylalgia similarly i ncludes C8 radiculopathy presenting as medial elbow pain and paresthesias the fourt h and fifth digits. Medial colla teral ligament problems may also present with medial elbow p ain. Concomitant existence of medial epico ndylalgia with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow frequently occurs. In cases of complaints that cannot be classified as a spe cific pathophysiological conditio n, a diagnosis of non -specif ic pain should be used. This is far preferable to specific labeling, which may not b e accurate. Non -specific or regional pain will more frequently be the most appropriate diagnosis if there are n o specific physical findings. The criteria presented in Table 2 below list the probable diagn osis or injury, potential mechanism(s) of illness or injury, symptoms, signs, and appropriate tests and results to consider in assessment and treatment. For most patients presenting with non -traumati c elbow disorders, spec ial studies are not needed durin g the first four weeks. Most patients impr ove quickl y, provided red flag cond itions are ruled out. Also, of note, a number of patients with elbow symptoms will have associated disease such as diab etes mellitus, hypothyroidis m, renal disease, and one or mor e of the arthritides which are often heret ofore undi agnosed. When medical history and/or physical examination findi ngs indicate, or other risk factors are present, testing for these or other comor bid c ondition(s) is recommen ded.

C.2.a.i Elbow A rthroscopy for Diagnosing Elbow P ain w ith Suspicion of Intraa rticular Body and Other Subacute or Chronic Mechanical Symptoms Recommen ded - to ev aluate and diagnose pati ents with elbow pain that have suspicio n of intraarticular body, and other subacute or chronic mechanical symptoms. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 21 Indications - Patients with elb ow pain with suspicion of intraa rticular body, or other subacute or chron ic mechanic al symptoms. C.2.a.ii Arthroscopy for Diagnosing Acute Elbow P ain Not Recommended - for diagnosing acute elb ow pain. C.2.a.iii Elbow Arthros copy Recommended - for di agnosis or treatment of pati ents with osteoarthrosis in the presence of a remediable mechanical defect such as symptomatic loose body . Not Recomme nded - for diagnosis or treatment of pati ents wi th osteoarthrosis in the absence of a remediable mechanical d efect such as symptomatic loose body . C.2.a.iv Elbow Arthroscopy with Chondropla sty for Osteoarthrosis Not Recommended - for treatment of osteoa rthrosis. C.2.b Bone Scans Bone scans involve i ntravenous administration of a ra dioac tive tracer medication that is preferentially concentra ted in areas of metabolic activity in b one. The radioactivity is then dete cted by a large sensor and converted into images of the skeleton. There are many causes f or abnormal radioactive uptake, i nclud ing metastases, infecti on, inflammatory arthropathies, fracture or other significant bone trauma. Thus, p ositive bone scans are n ot highly specific. Bone scans have been used for diagnosis of early osteonecrosis prior to findings on x -ray, among other uses . C.2.b.i Bone Scanni ng for Select Use in Acute, Suba cute or Chronic Elbow Pain Recommended - for sele ct use in acute, subacut e or chronic elbow pain to assist in the diagnosis of osteonecrosis, neoplasms and other conditions with increased polyost hotic bone metabolism, parti cularly where there is more than one joint to be evaluated. Indication s - Patient s with elbow pain with s uspicion of osteonecrosis, Paget's diseas e, neoplasm or other increase d polyosthotic bone metabolism. C.2.b.ii Routine Us e of Bone Scanning for Routi ne Elbow Joint Evaluations Not Recommended - for routine use in elbow joint eval uations. Rationale for Recommendations - Bone scanning may be a helpful diagnostic test to evaluate suspected m etastases, primary bone tumors, infect ed bone (osteomyelitis) , inflammatory arthropathies, an d trauma NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 22 (e.g., occult fractures). It m ay be helpf ul in those with suspect ed, early AVN but without x -ray changes. In those where the diagnosis is felt to be secur e, there is not an indication for bone scanning as it does no t alter the treatment or managem ent. It is generally thought to be infe rior to MRI. C.2.c Computerized Tom ography Computerized tomography remains an important imaging procedure, particularly for bony anatomy, whereas MRI is sup erior for soft tissue abnorm alities. CT may be useful for el bow joint abnormalities where advanced i maging of t he bones is required. CT may be helpful for evaluation of AVN an d following traumatic dislocations or arthroplas ty-associated recurrent dislocati ons. CT also may be useful t o evaluate patients with contrai ndications for MRI (most typically an implanted met allic-ferrous device). C.2.c.i Routine CT for Evaluating Acut e, Subacute, Chronic Elbow Pain Not Recommende d - for evaluation of acute, suba cute, or chronic elbow pain. C.2.c.ii CT for Evaluating Pat ients with Osteonecrosis (AVN) Recommen ded - for evaluatin g patients with osteonecrosis or following traumatic dis locations or arthroplasty -associated recurrent d islocations , or for patients w ho need advanced imaging but ha ve contraindications for MRI. Indications - Patients with elbow pain fr om osteonec rosis with suspicion of subchondral fracture(s), increased polyo sthotic bone metabolism. As MRI is generally preferable, patients should have a c ontra indication for MRI. Pat ients w ho have traumatic elbow d islocations , particularly for capit ular or trochlea r C.2.c.iii Helical CT for Select Acute, S ubacute, or Chronic Elbow Pain Recommended - for select patients with acute, sub acute , or chronic elbow pain in whom advanced imaging of bon y structures is thought to be potential ly helpful , and for patients with a need for advanced imaging but who have contraindications for MRI. Indications - Patient s with acute, subacute , or chroni c elb ow pain ad vanc ed bony structure imaging. Patie nts needing advanced imaging , but with contraindic ations for MRI (e.g., im planted hardware) are also candidates. Rationale for Recommendations - Computerized tomo graphy is considered superior to MRI f or imaging of most elbo w abnormalities where advanced i maging of calcified structures is requi red. Helica l CT scan has been thoug ht to be superior to MRI for evaluating s ubchondral fractures; however, a definitive stud y has not been reported NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 23 C.2.d Electr omyography and Nerve Co nduction Studies (Electrodiagnos tic Studies) Electrodiagnostic (ED) studies have b een used to confirm diag nostic impressions of other peripheral n erve entrapments, including all peripheral nerve s in the upper extremity. They ma y be particularly helpful to distinguish a peripheral entrap ment from cervical radiculopathy . EMG a nd NCS may be normal , particularly in some mild cases of neuropathies. If E D studies are negative, tests may be repeated la ter in the course of treatment if symp toms persist. It is als o important to recognize that ED studies are abnormal in a considerable proportion of patients who are with out symptoms. Thus, ED studies in a pat ient with a low pre -test probability of peripher al nerve entrapment may result in inappropriate diagnosis. C.2.d.i Electro diagnostic Studi es for Diagnosing Subacute or Chronic Peripheral Nerve Entra pments Recommended - to assist in the diagnosis of sub acute or chronic peripheral nerve entrapments, i ncluding ulnar neuropathies, radial neuropathie s and median n europathies. Indications - Patients with subacute or chronic paresthesias with o r without p ain, particularly with u nclear diagnosis. In addition t o segmental analysis (e.g., above - versus below -elbow conduction), patients with perip heral neu ropathies in t he elbo w region should generally have inching technique performed to localize the entrapment which assists with clin ical management. C.2.d.ii Electrodiagnostic Studies for Diagnosis and Pre -Oper ative Assessment of Peripheral Nerve E ntrapment s Recommended - to assist in securing a firm diagnosis for those patients without a clear diag nosis. ED studies are also recommen ded as one of two methods to at tempt to objectively secure a diagnosis prior to surgical release. C.2.d.iii Electr odiagnost ic Studies for Initial Evaluation of Patients Suspected of Having a Peripheral Nerve Entrapment Not Recom mended - for initial eva luation of most patients as it does not change t he management of the condition . Rationale for Recommendation - ED studies are primarily of assistance in: 1) identifying an anatomic location of nerve conduction slowing; 2 ) identifyi ng objective evidence fo r alternate diagnostic consider ations (e.g., cervical radiculopathy); and 3) qu antifying nerve function to assure the physician that an oper ative state such as CTS is prese nt. They are recommended for evaluation of select cases to a ssist in confirming peripheral nerve entrapments such a s pronator syndrome, ulnar neuropathies at the e lbow and radial neuropathies. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 24 C.2.e Magnet ic Re sonance Imagin g (MRI) Magnetic resonance imag ing (MRI) is considered the imaging test of choice for viewin g soft tissues (includin g ligamentous injuries around the elbow) . MRI is helpful for evaluating extent of biceps tendinosis and ruptures. MRI is cons idered the gol d standard for evaluating osteon ecrosis after x -rays. However, for most elbow diso rders, MRI is not useful as an imag ing procedure. C.2.e.i MRI f or Diagnosing Osteonecrosis (AVN) Recommended - for diagnosing osteonecrosis and lig amen tous elbow injuries . Indications - Patients with subacute or chronic elbow pain thought to be related to osteo necrosis (AVN) or ligame ntous elbow injuries , particul arly in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who need additional diagnostic ev aluation and staging. C.2.e.ii MRI for Routine Evaluation of Acute , Subacute, Chronic Elbow Joint Pathology Not Rec ommended - for routine evaluation o f acute, subacute, or chronic elbow joint pathology, including degenerative jo int disease. Rationale for Recommenda tions - MRI is not reco mmended for routine elbow imagin g, but is recommended for select elbow joint patho logy partic ularly involving concern s regarding soft ogy. C.2.f Roentgenograms ( X-RAYS) X-rays show bony structure and remain the initial test for evaluation of most cases of elbow pain . Two or three vi ews are ge nerally performed. C.2.f .i X-rays for Evaluation of Acute, Subacute , or Chronic Elbow Pain Recommen ded - for evaluation of acute, subacut e, or chronic elbow pain. Indications - In the absence of red flags, patients with elbow pain lasting at least a fe w weeks, moderate to seve re, and/or limited range of motion, or to evaluat e for osteomyelitis in cases of significant septic olecranon bursi tis. Frequency/Duratio n - Obtaining x -rays once is gen erally sufficient. For patients with chronic or pro gressive e lbow pain, it may be reas onable to obtain a second set of x-rays months to years subsequently to re - evaluate the patient's condition, partic ularly if symptoms chan ge. Rationale for Recommendatio ns - X-rays are helpful to evaluate most patients w ith elbow pain, both to diagnose an d to assist with the differen tial diagnostic possibilities. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 25 C.2.g Single Pro ton Emission Computed Tomography (SPEC T) and Po sitron is a 3 -dimen sional imaging technique in which r adionucleotide tracers that release gamma radiation are used to create multi planar re -formations. C.2.g.i SPECT or PET f or Diagnosing Acute, Subacute , or Chronic Elbo w Pain Not Recommended - for diagnosing acute, sub acute, or chronic elbow pain. Rationale for Recommendation - There is no quality evidence to support the use of these scans to evaluat e patients w ith elbow pain. C.2.h Ultrasound C.2.h.i Diagnostic Ultraso und for Other Elbow Disorders, I ncluding , Osteoarthrosis, Dysplasi a and Fractures Not Recomme nded - for the evaluation and diagnosis of other elbow disorders , including osteonecro sis, osteoarthrosis, dy splasia, and fractures. C.2.i Laboratory Testing Laboratory tests are rarely indicat ed at the time of initial evaluatio n, unless there is suspicion of systemic illness, infection, neoplasia, conn ective tissue disorder, or underlying arthritis or rheumatolo gic disorder based on history an d/or physical examination. Tests include, but are n ot limite d to: C.2.i.i Antibodies There are numerous antibod ies that are markers for specific rheumatic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid factor, anti -nuclear antibodies, anti -Sm, anti - Ro, -La for oid lupus erythematosus, Sjogren 's, mixed connective tissue disorde r, etc.). Patients with rheumatic disorders are at increased risk for degene rative joint disease of the elbow. C.2.i.ii Antibodies for Diagnosing Elbow Pain with Susp icion of Chronic or Recurrent Rheumatological Disord er Recom mended - to evaluate and d iagnose patients with elbow pain who have reasonable suspicion of rheumatolo gical disorder. Indications - Patient s with elbow pain with suspicion of rheumatological disorder. C.2.i.iii Antibodies to Confirm Specific Dis orders NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 26 Recommended - as a screen t o confirm specific disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Indications - Patients with elbow pain and a presumpti ve diagno sis of a rheum atological disorder. Rationale for Recommendations - Elevated antibody levels are highly useful for confirmation of c linical impressions of rheum atic diseases. However, routine use of these tes ts in patients with elbow pain - espec ially as wide-ranging, non-focused test batteries - are likely to result in inaccurate diagnoses due to fal se positi ves and low pre -test proba bilities and are not recomme nded. Providers should also be aware that false negative results occur. They are recom mend ed fo r focused testing of a limited number of diagn ostic considerations. C.2.i.iv C-Reactive Protein, Erythrocy te Sedimentaiton Rate, and Other No n Specific Inflamma tory Markers There are many markers of inflamma tion that may be measured serologicall y. These -reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin, and an elevated total pro tein-albumin gap. Non-Specific Inflammatory Markers for Screening for Inflammatory Disorders in Pati ents with Subacute or Chronic Elbow Pa in Recom mended - for screening for inflammatory disord ers or prosthetic sepsis with reasonable suspicion o f inflamm atory disorder in patients with subacute or chronic el bow pain. Indications - Patients with elbow pa in with suspicion of rheumatological disorder. Rationale for Recommendation -Erythrocyte sed imentation rate is the most commonly used systemic m arker for non-specific inflammation and is elevated in numerous inflammatory conditions including rheumatologic al disorders, as well as with infectio us diseas es. C - reactive protein is a marker of systemic inflammation that has been associated with an incre ased risk of coronary artery diseas e. However, it is also a non -specific marker for other inflammation. Other n on-specific markers of inflammation in clude ferritin, and an elevated protein -albumin gap, wh ich have no known clinical roles. They are recommend ed as a reasonable screen for syste mic inflammatory conditions especially if the elbow pain patient also has ot her pains without clear definition of a diagnos is or those wi th fibromyalgia or myofascial pa in syndrome, although the specificity is not high. H owever, o rdering of a large, divers e array of anti -inflammatory markers without targeting a few specific disord ers diagnostically is not recommended. D.

It is an acute i njury with bruising. D.1.a Medications D.1.a.i NSAIDs, Acetaminophen Recommended - s D.1.b.i Immobi lization for Elbow Cont usions Not Recommended - for elbow contusions. Rationale for Recommendation - Medical management of contusions is recommended to be directed at maintaining normal elbow funct ion. Accordingl y, treatment shoul d include anti -inflammat ory m edications with avoidance of immobilization . Early mobilization should also be encouraged . Medical management can be summarized as rest, ice, compression, eleva tion, and range -of-motion ex ercis es. D.1.b.ii Ice, Compression, and Range -of-Motion Exercises for Contusion s Criteria Lateral epicondy litis (Tennis Elbow) causes sorene ss or pa in on the outside (late ral) side of the uppe r arm near the elbow. Late ral epicondylitis is diagnos ed based on a combination of lateral elbow pain plus tenderness to palpa tion over the lateral epicondyle or tenderne ss within a couple centimeters dis tal to t he epicondyle. Most pat ients require no spe cial testing provided red f lags are abse nt. For patient s who ha ve been treated for at least four weeks and symptoms have failed to improve, additional testing may be requi red. Patients should not have ot her pote ntial explanatory condi tions such y C-6), elbow arthrosis or f ibromyal gia. Some patients will have onset after a traumatic event, usua lly a relatively mild accident such as bumpi ng the elbow on a hard surface; however, t his is not required to make a diagnosis. D.2.b Me dial Epicondylitis; Golfer's Elbo w NYS less common affecting the inner aspect of the elbow. Medial ep elbow . Treatment of medial e picondylitis is analogous to lateral epicondylitis. Evidence f or Medial Epicondylalgi a D.2.c Special and Tr eatment Consi derations Most patient s require no special testing provided red flags are absent. For patients who have been treated for at least four weeks and symptoms have faile d to improve, addit ional testin g may be required. Some pat ients require testin g to eliminat e alternate dia gnostic possibilities such as C -6 cervical radiculopathy (typically with MRI), or a rthrosis (x -ray of the elbow). EMG ma y be used for cervical radicul opathy b ut is recommended at le ast 6 weeks after sy mptom onset to allow suffic ient time for EMG changes to be mani fest (require three weeks minimum). D.2.d Medications For mo st patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other o lder generation NSAIDs are as first-line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSA IDs are as effective fo r relief of pain as op ioids (including tramadol ) NSAIDs for Subacute, Chronic, or st- operative Epicondylalgia Recom mended - trea tment of acute , or pos t- operative epi condy lalgia. Indications - For acute, su bacute, chronic, or post -operative epicondylalgia, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the- counter (OTC ) agents may suffice and shoul d be tri ed first. Frequency/ Duration - As neede d use ma y be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Disco ntinuation - Resolution of elbow pain, lack of efficacy, or de velopment of adverse effects that necessitat e discontinuation. D.2.d.ii NSAI Ds for Patients a t High Risk of Gastroi ntesti nal Bleeding. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 30 Recommended - concomminent use cytoprotect ive classe s of histamine Type receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for pa tients at high risk of gastrointes tinal bleeding. Indication s - For pat ients wit h a h igh-risk factor prof ile who also have indications for NSAIDs, c ytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly i f longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointesti nal blee ding, elderly, diabetics, and ciga rette sucralfate , H2 blockers re commended. Dose and frequency per manufactur er. There is not generally believe d to be substan tial differences in for Discontinu - Intolerance, or discon tinuation of NSAID . D.2.d.iii NSAID s e Effec ts Patients wi th known cardiova scula r disease or multipl e risk factors for cardiovascular disease s hould have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain di scussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or as pirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiov ascular a dvers e. Reco mmended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective ar e preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving l ow-dose aspirin for primary or secondary car diovascular disease prevention, to minimiz e the p otential for the NSAID t o counter act the be nefic ial effect s of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. D.2.d.iv Acetaminophen f or Treatment of E lbow Pain Recommended - for treat ment of elbow p ain, particularl y in pat ients with con traindicat ions for N SAIDs . Indications - All patient s with elb ow pain, including acute, subacut e, chronic , e. Dose/Frequency - Per manufacturer's reco mmen dations ; may be utilized on an as-need ed basis. There is evidence of hepatic t oxicity when ex ceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuatio n - Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance.

Indications - For most patients, ora l medi cations are recommended. However, for those with contraindications for oral NSAIDs or intolerance, t opical NSAIDs may be a reasonable alternativ e. Frequency/Dose/Duration - turer's recommendations . Indications for D iscon tinua tion - Resolution of elbow pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuati on. Evidence for the Use of Topic al NSAIDs and Other Agents f or Lateral Epicondylalgia D.2.d.vi Opioids Opioids are rarely used for treatment of patients with epicondylalgia . They are more frequently used br iefly in the im mediate post -operative period. D.2.d.vi.a Opio ids for Se lect Patients with Post -Operative Epicondyl algia Recommended - for select treatment of patients with post-operative epicondylalgia. Indications - For post-operative epicondylalgia, a brief course of a few days t o not mo re than o ne week of an opioid is r ecomm ended for treatment. Opioids may be helpful for brief nocturnal use after surgery. For other epicond ylalgia patients , opioids are not recommende d. Most should attempt pain contr ol with NSAIDs /acetamin ophen prior to op ioids. nuation as early as possible is recommende d. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally , patients require no m ore than a few days to not more than one wee k, of treatment with opioids for m ost epic ondylar surgeri es. Indications for Disc ontin uatio n - Resolution of elbow pain, sufficient control with othe r medications, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse eff ects that necessitate discontinuation. D.2.d.vi.b Opioids for C hronic Epicondylalgia NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 32 Not Rec ommended - for acute, sub acute, or chron ic epicondylalgia. Rational e for Reco mmendations - There are no quality studies evaluating opioids for treating epicondylalgia. Opioids cause s ignificant adverse effects - poor toleranc stipation, drowsi ness, c louded ju dgment , mem ory loss, and potent ial misuse or dependence ha ve been rep orted in up to 35% of patients. Before prescribing opioids, p atients should be informed of these potential adverse effects and cautioned aga inst ope rating motor vehicles o r machi nery. Opi oids d o not appe ar to be more e ffective than safer analgesi cs for man aging most musculoskeletal symptoms; they should only be used if needed for severe pain or for a short tim e (not more than one week) in the post-operative time. Opioids are not recommende d for treatment of epicon dylalg ia patients, except as a brief post -operative course. Evidence for U se of Op ioids for Lateral Epico ndylalg ia D.2.e Rehabil itation: Devic es / Therapy Rehabilitation req uired as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restorin g functional ability required to meet the pa tient's daily and work activities and retu rn to wo rk; striving to restore the injur ed w orker to pre-injury s tatus in so far as is feasible. Active t herapy requires an internal effort by the individual to comple te a specific exercise or task. This form o f therapy requires supervision fro m a ther apist su ch as verbal, v isual and /or tacti le instru ction (s). At ti mes, the therapist may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern, but the energy required to complete the task is predominately execu ted by the patient. Patient shoul d be instructed to continue act ive thera pies at h ome as an extension of th e treatment process in order to maintain i mprovement levels. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. Passive interve ntions, those not requiring the ex ertion o f effort on the part of the pati ent, but rather de pende nt on modal ities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate pro gress in an active therapy program with conc omitant attainment of objective fu nctional gains. Assistive dev may be include d as an adjun ctive measur e incorporated into the rehabili tation pl an to facilitate functional gains. Devices D.2.e.i Tennis E lbow Bands, Straps, and Braces for Acute, Sub acute, and Chronic Epicondylalgia Recomm ended - for the treatme nt of acute, te, or chroni c epicondyla lgia. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 33 Frequency/Dose/Duration - Devices generally worn daily, but not at night, or as -needed for more forceful exertions (discontinue for less forceful activities during daily rout ine). Indication s for Disconti nuation - Resolutio n of elbow pa in, intolera nce, lack of efficacy , or pain r adiating down the dorsum of the forearm into the hand and/or numbness o f the dorsum of the hand . D.2.e.ii Cock onic Epic ondylalgia Recommended - for the treatme nt of acute, suba cute, or chronic epicondylalgia. Indicat ions - Acute, subacute , or chronic epicondylalgia. Generally, elbow bands and straps are recommended first, with wrist braces as possible ad junctive treatmen t for either m ore severe cases an d/or suboptim al results w ith elbow bands and straps . Frequency/D ose/Duration - Device s generally worn daily (not at night ), or as-needed for more forceful exertions (disco ntinue for less forceful activiti es durin g daily routine). Indications fo r Discont inuation - Resolution of elbow pain, intolerance or lack of effica cy. Eviden ce for the Use of Epicondylalgia Supports Therapy (Active a nd Passive ) Rehabilita tion (supervised formal t herapy) required as a result of a wor k-related injury should be focused on restoring functional abi lity required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to wo rk; stri ving to restore the inj ured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exerc ise or task. Passive therapy are those interv entions not requiring the exertio n of eff ort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependen t on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally p assive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progr ess in an active therapy program with concomi tant attainment of objective functional g ains. Active interventi ons should be emphasize d over pa ssive interventi ons. The p atient should be instruct ed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistiv e devices may be includ ed as an adjunctive mea sure incorporated into th e rehab ilitation plan to fac ilitate f unctional gains. Active Therapy NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 34 D.2.e.iii Therapeutic Ex ercise - Physical / Occupational Therapy Physical or Occupational Therapy f or Acute , Subacute, Chronic , or Post -operativ e Epicond ylalgia ended - for the treatment of acute , subacute, c hronic, or post - operative epicondylalgia. Frequency/Dose/Dura tion -Total numbers of visits may be as few a s two to three for patients with mild fun ctional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more s evere def icits with docum entation of ongoing objectiv e functio nal improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated i f there is documentation of funct ional im provement towards speci fic objective functiona l goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch str ength, ra nge of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exe rcise program should be developed and per formed in conjunction w ith the therapy. Indications f or Discontinuati on - Resolution of elbow pai n, intole rance, lack of efficacy or non -compli ance including non -compl iance with home exercises prescrib ed. Evidence for Exerci se Programs for Lateral Epic ondylalgi a Passive Therapy D.2.e.iv Heat or Cold Packs Self-application of Heat or Cold for Acute , Subacute, Chronic, or Post - operative Epicon dylalgia Recommended - for the treatment of acute, s ubac ute, chronic, or post - operative epicondylalgia. Frequenc y/Dose/Duration - Heat or cold m ay be reasonable treatments as self applications, approximately three to fi ve times a day.

NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 37 Indicat ions - Chronic epicondy lalgia pa tients ; patients who fail to sufficient ly respond to treatment with NSAIDs (oral and/or topical), exercise, or pa tients who fail other treatments ( e.g., insuffi cient pain relief with elbow stra ps and activity modification) m ay be ideal candidates. Glucocor ticosteroid inje ctions are also reasonable interventi on(s) to attempt before acupunc ture. Generally, moderately t o severely affected patients are t hought to be better candidates. Overall benefi ts of ac upuncture appear modest and efficacy appears t o be transient, disappear ing after a few weeks. Frequency/Dos e/Duration - Regimens were two to three treatments a week for eight to ten treatments . Patient s should demo nstrate benefit after four to fiv e visits otherwise either the t echnique should be alte red, or acupuncture discon tinued. Indications for Di scontinu ation - Resolution of -Operat ive Epic ondylalgia Not Recomm ended - for the treatmen t of acute, subacute, or post-operative epicondylalgi a. Evidence fo r the Use of Acupuncture for Lat eral Epicondylalgia D.2.e.xiv Biofeedback, Electrical Nerve Stimulation, or Chr onic Epicondylalgia Not Recomme nded - for the treatment of acute, sub acute, or chronic epicond ylalgia. Evidence f or Biofeedback, Transcutaneou s Electrical Nerve Stimulation, Electrical Stim ulation, Subacute or Chronic Epicondy lalgia Recommended - for the treatment of highly selectiv e subacute or chronic epi condylalgia patients. Patients s hould have failed to respond sufficiently to NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 38 treatmen t with multiple different NSAIDs (oral and/or topical), exerc ise, elbow straps and activity mod ification. Patients should be cautioned the s ymptoms frequently recur after injection. Moderately to severel y affected patien ts are thought to be better candidat es, particularly those thought t o be surgical candidates who are attem pting to delay surgery in the hopes th at the pain subsides . Frequency /Dose/Du ration - All quality tr ials have performed one injectio n and assessed th e results for a positive outcome pri or to performing additional inje ction s. Indications for Dis continuatio n - Resolution of pain, intoleran ce, lack of efficacy or n on-compli ance . Lack of response should r esult in reassessment of th e dia gnosis. D.2.f.i.b Glucoc orticosteroid Injections for Acute Epicondylalgia Not Recommended treatmen t of acute D.2.f.i.c nded trea tment of subacute or chro nic epicondylalgia. Evidence fo r the Use of Glucocorticost eroid Injections for Lateral Epic ondylalgia D.2.f.ii Botulinum for Acute , Subacute, or Chronic Lateral Epicondylalgia Not Recommended - for the tre atmen t of acute, subacute , or chron ic lateral epicondylalgia. Evidence for Use of Botulinum Injections for La teral Epicondylalgia D.2.f.iii Platelet R ich P lasma Injections Recommended for Chronic Lateral Ep icondylalgia Indications Lateral epicondylalgia lastin g at least 6 months, unrespo nsive to other treatments including NSA ID(s) , straps, stretching and strength ening exercises, and at l east one g lucocorticosteroid injection. Dose/Frequency - One Injection of approximately 3mL of pl atelet-rich plasma buffer ed with NS plus - Elbow Injuries 39 Recom mended - for Chronic Lateral Epicondylalgia Indications Lateral epicondylalgia lasting at least 6 months, unres ponsive to other treatments including NSAID(s), straps, stretching and str engthening exercises , and at least one glucocorticostero id n. Dose/Frequency - Withdrawal of 2mL of autologous bl ood from a peripheral vein, then injected into the most te nder location(s). D.2.f.v Platelet-rich Plasma or Autologous Acute or Subacute Epicondylalgia Not Recomm ended - for the trea tment of acute or subacute epicondylalgia . Evidence for the Use o f Platelet -rich Plasma and Autologo us Blood - for tment of acute, subacute, or chronic epicondyl algia. Evidence for Us e Epicondylalgi a Not Recommended - for the trea tment of chronic epicondylalgia. Evidence for the Use upplementation Guided Percutaneous Tenoto my Injections for Acute, Su bacut e, or Chronic Epicon dylalgia Not Recommended - for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chron ic epicondylalgia. D.2.f.viii.b Dry P uncture T echnique (' peppering\") May Be Effective for Treatment of Subacute or Chronic Epicondylalgia Reco mmended - for the chron ic epicondylalgia NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 40 Rationale for Recomm endatio ns - There is some preliminary evid ence that either dry needling or multiple puncuture technique ('peppering') may be effect ive. D.2.g Surgical Considera tions Surgery has been u sed to treat lateral epicond ylalgia that does not respond to adequat e trial s of nonoperative ca re. There are t hree main surgical ap proach es fo r latera l - , and ar throscopic . One revi ew found no evidence of the super iority of one approach over another and concluded that the cho ice should be l eft to the individual surgeon . D.2.g.i Lateral Epicondylar Release for Chronic Lateral Epicondylalgia Recommended - for the treatment of chr onic lateral epicondylalgia. Indications - The timing of surgery should be consistent with t he degree of functional impairment a nd the prog ression and severity of objective findings. In contrast with severe entrapment neuropathi es, lateral epicondylalgi a does not generally produce uneq uivocally objective evidence of imp airment or severe dysfuncti on, thus docume ntation of adequate t rials of no n-operat ive management in spite of compliance with treatment is particularly important . Patients should generally have pain for at least 6 mo nths, although there are some limited ex ception s where as little as 3 months of no n-operative managemen t may be su fficient . There should generally be significant limitati ons, failure to improve with NSAI Ds, e lbow bands/straps, a ctivity modification, and ex ercis e programs to increase range of mot ion and strength of the mus culature around the elbow . Patients should gene rally ha ve failed glucocorticosteroid injection(s) , ideally with documented short -term re lief of injection(s) . Any of the three main surgical appro aches are acceptable . D.2.g.ii Radio frequency Microtenot omy for Chronic Lateral Epicondylalg ia Recomm ended - for the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylal gia. Indications - Same as ab ove. Evidence for the Use of Surgical Inter ventions fo r a condition associated with a generally painless e ffusion of the olecranon bursa . Acute olec ranon bursitis may be slightly warm but is generally n on-tender or minimally tender. Septic (infected) olecranon bursiti s is either a complicatio n of aseptic olecranon bursi tis or a direct consequence of trauma . Generally , to be a complicat ion of aseptic lecranon , bursitis al so require s introd uction of organisms through the skin, such as ab raded skin or an injection, NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 41 altho ugh s ystemic seeding may also occur. Signs include sw elling, pain, tenderness, and pain on ran ge of m otion. Bursiti s due to c rystal a rthropathies also tend to present with findings similar to those of septic bursit is. D.3.b Special Studi es and Diagnostic and Treatm ent C onsiderations There are no s pecial s tudies for most cases of olecranon bursiti s. If the bursa is thought to be poten tially infected, aspiration of the fluid and ana lyses including Gram stain and cu lture and sensitivity are recommended . D.3.b.i Fluid Asp iration of Swollen Bursa and Analyses for Ol ecranon Bursitis Recommended - for a clinically infect ed or que stionabl y infected bursa, including Gram stain , culture and sensitivity, and complete cel l cou nt, to determine inf ection for olecranon bursiti s. Crystal examination (light polarizing m icrosco py) should also be performed at lea st once on the aspira ted fluid . Rationale for Recommendation - Aspiration has been used for diagnosis, particularly when combined with Gram s tain, culture and sensitivit y, an d complete cell count of the aspirate d fluid are performed. Crystal examination (light polarizing mi croscopy) should also be performed at least once on the aspirated fluid. Evide nce f or the Use of Aspiration D.3.b.ii X-Rays for Olecranon Bur sitis Recommende d - to rule out oste omyelitis or join t effusion in cases of significant septic olecra non bursitis. D.3.c Initial Care Most patients with ol ecranon bursitis are treated with soft elbow padding, support or an ace wrap, are instructed to avoid elbow press ure, and require no f urther c are other than monitoring to assure resolution. D.3.c.i Soft Padding, Soft Elbow Support s, an d Ace Wraps for Olec ranon Bursitis Recommended - for olecranon bursitis . D.3.c.ii Avo id Direct Pressure Over the Olecranon Recomme nded - allowing time to reabsorb the fluid are recommend ed. D.3.d Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, nap roxen, or other older genera tion NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophe n (or the analog NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 42 paracetamol) may be a reasonab le alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candid ates for NSAIDs , although most ev idenc e suggests acetamino phen is modestly less effect ive. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less im pairing. D.3.d.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drug s (NSA IDs) NSAIDs for Trea tment of Acute, Suba cute, Chronic, - opera tive Olecra non Bursitis Recomme nded - for treatment of acute, sub acute, chronic, or post - operativ e Olecranon Bur sitis. Indications - For acute, subacute, o r post-operative Olecranon Bursit is, NSAIDs are recommende d for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice an d should be tried first. Frequ ency/Duration - As needed use may be reasonable for man y patients. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of elbow pain, lack o f efficacy, or developmen t of adverse effects that ne cessitate discontinuation. D.3.d.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointesti nal Bleeding. Recommended - conco mminent use of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, e Typ e 2 receptor blocker s, and proton pump inhibitor s for patients at high risk of gastrointesti nal bleeding. Indica tions - For patients with a high -risk factor pro file who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotectiv e medi cations should be considere d, pa rticularly if longer term treatment is contempla ted. At-risk patients include th ose with a history of prior gastro intestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cig arette e, H2 blockers recommende d. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not general ly believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointe stinal b leeding . Indications for Discontinuation - Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuatio n of NSAID. D.3.d.iii NSA IDs for Patients at Risk for Car diovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multi ple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therap y for pain discussed . Recommended - Acetaminop hen or asp irin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest r egarding cardiovascular adverse. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 43 Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferre d over COX -2 specific drugs. In p atien ts receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or sec ondary car diovascular disease pr evention, t o minimize the potentia l for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial eff ects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 m inutes after or eight hours befor e the daily aspirin. D.3.d.iv Acetaminophen for T reatment o f Elbow Pain Recommen ded - for treatment of elbow pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSA IDs. Indications - All patients with elbow pain , including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency - Per manufa cturer's recommendations; may be utilized o n an as -needed basis. T here is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceed ing four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs for Olecranon Bursitis nded - for the treatment bursitis. Evidence Use Olecranon Bursitis D.3.f Surgical Consideratio ns has been widely u sed to treat olecranon bursitis that has no t responded to activity modifications and other conservative measures inc luding but not limited to ; rest, ice , compression , elevation (RICE), heat , PT or a home exer cise program. D.3.f.i Surgica l Drainag e for treatment of olecranon bursitis . Indications Olecranon bu rsitis that is eithe r infected, clinic ally thought to be infected , or not infect ed but present for at least appr oximately six to eight weeks w ithout tr ending towards resolution while being treated with soft padding and activity modifications above. D.3.f .ii Surgical Resecti on for Chronic Ole cranon Bursitis mended - for chronic olecranon bur recurre nt drainage. Indications - Olecranon b ursitis with r ecurrent drainage. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 44 D.4 Elbow Fractures, including Non -Disp laced Radial Head Fractures Elbow fractures m ost commo nly occur fro m falls. Radial head f ractures ty pically occur from fall s onto an outstre tched hand. If the fracture is large an d displaced or comminuted (Type III) or there i s a large fracture with a dis placed fragment (Type II), su rgical referral is indicat ed. Capitella r fractures are rare a nd usually occur fr om fa lling on a n outstretched hand. Non-operative management i s sometim es attempted; however, most are believed to require surgical fixation . Surgi cal repairs are often perform ed for these D.4.a Diag nostic injury mechanism and physica tion findings of substantial tenderness particu larly focally over a bone. Fi ndings of (in)ability to use the elbow should be sought , as we ll as inspection for signs of deformity. A frac ture identified on x-rays, gener ally two o r three views, confi rms that diagnostic imp ression. The differential diagnos is prominently includes elbow sprain and dislocation. If x -rays are negative a nd clinical su spicion high, a CT is usually the next t est. D.4.b Special Stu dies and Diagno stic and Treatment Considerati ons X-rays for Elbo w Fracture Recommended - X-rays that include at least two to three views are recomme nded to diagnose elbow fra cture s. D.4.c Care Cast Immobi lizaiton/Sp lints and Slings Castin g has been long used to tr eat elbow and other fracture s. Non-displac ed radial head fractures have bee n treated with slings. D.4.c.i Elbow Slings for Non -displaced and Occult Radial H ead Frac tures Recommended - for trea tment of non-displaced and occult radial head fractures. Indications - Non-displaced ra dial head fra ctures and occult fractures. Occul t fractures are not visible o n x-rays but are suspected by including either th e lack of full extens ion of the elbow or ev idence of e ffusio n on x - ray. Frequency/Duration - Sling (or splint) use for no n-displac ed radial head fractures is for seven days. (A shorter complete immobilizati on period of as little as three days may be used for no n-displaced fra ctures that are clinic ally presen t but not visible on an x-ray.) After seven days, gentle range -of-motion exer cises within p ain tolerance should begin, followed by progressive mobilizati on. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 45 D.4.c.ii Casts and Cast Bracing for Select Elbow Fractur es Recommended - for treatme nt of non-displac ed or occult radial head fractur es. Indications - Minimally d isplaced fractures and other elbow fractures felt amenab le to casting , cast bracing, or post-open reduction interna l fixation fracture s. Frequency/ Duratio n - Casts are generall y required for six weeks or until adequate healin g is documented on x -ray. Afte r success ful healing, t hey should be follow ed by progres sive mobilization. Evidence for the Us e of Immobilizati on for Elbow Fr actures D.4.d Medications For most patients, ibu profen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recomme nded -line medications . Acetaminophen (or the a nalog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , althoug h most ev idence suggest s acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective f or relief of pain a s opio ids (including tramadol) and less impairing. D.4.d.i Non-Steroidal Acut e, Subacute, C hronic, or Post -Operative Elbow F ractures Recommended - for treatment of acute, suba cute, c hronic, or post - operative Elbow F ractures. Indication s - For acute, subacute , chronic, -operative Elb ow recom mended fo r treatment. O ver-the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried f irst. Frequency/Dura tion - There is no quality evidence one NSAID is superior to an other for these indicat ions. As needed use may be reaso nable for many patients. Indications for Discontinu ation - Resolution of elbow pain, lack of efficacy, or develop ment of adverse effects that n ecessitate disconti nuation. D.4.d.ii NSAID nded - misoprostol, h istamine 2 receptor bloc kers, and proton pump i nhibit ors for patients at high risk of gastrointesti nal bleedin g. Indication s - For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indicat ions for NSAIDs, cytopr otective medications should be considered, particularly if lon ger term treatment is c ontem plated. At -risk NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 46 patie nts include those with a history of p rior gastrointestinal b leeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency pump nded. Dose and frequenc y per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be subst antial differences in e fficacy for prevention of gastro intestinal bleedin g. Indicati ons for D iscontinuation - Intolerance, development of ad verse effects, or discontinua tion of NSAID. D.4.d. iii NSAIDs for Patients a t Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Eff ects Patients with kn own cardiovascular disease or mu ltiple risk factors for cardio vascular disease should have the risks and benefits of N SAID therapy for pain discuss ed. Recommended - Acetamino phen or aspirin as th e first-line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardi ovascular adverse. Recommende d - If needed, NSAIDs that are non-selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary o r sec ondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial ef fects of aspirin, the NSAID sh ould be t aken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours b efore the daily aspirin. D.4.d.iv Acetaminophen for Tr eatment of Elbow Pain Recomme nded - for treatment of elbo w pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications - All patient s with elbow p ain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency - Per ma nufac turer's recommendatio ns; may be utilized on an as -needed b asis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceed ing four gm/day. Indications for Disc ontinuation - Resolution of pain, adverse effec ts or intolerance. D.4.d. v Opioids for Select Patie nts with Pain from Elbow F ractures Recommended - for treatment of select patients wit h pain from elbow fractures. Indications Select patients wi th severe pain from elb ow fracture with insufficient con trol from other means, includ ing acetaminophen and NSAIDs or with contraindica tions for NSAIDs. Patients with more severe fractures or in the immediate post -operative per iod may require opioids for pa in manage ment. Consider able cautions are recommended NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 47 concerning opioids and minimum n umbers of doses should be prescribed as duration of treatment for elbow fractures is u sually limited. Freque ncy/Dose As needed . For the fe w patients requiring opioids, the major ity need at mo st a few days treatment to not mo re than one week and then gen erally have insufficien t pain for further treatme nt with opioids. Indications for Dis continuation Resoluti on of pain sufficiently to not require opioids, consumption th at does n ot follow pres cription instructions, adverse ef fects. Evidence for the Use of Opioids for Elbo w Fractures D.4.e Surgery Displaced fractures and fracture fragment s are believed to require surgical treatment wi th fixation, but there are no quality studies of disp laced fractures. Widely d isplaced fracture and/or comminuted fr agments may require ra dial head excision and/or radial head implant. Indications to surgical ly fix elbow f ractures are not well defined, an d there is a suggestion that some patients are better cand idates than others ( e.g., widely displaced fragments, or r equirement for earlier recovery such as in professiona l athletes, terrible triad pat ients). The decision to surgically treat elbow fractures is a decision between the or thopedist and patient. Surgical Fixation of D isplaced Elbo w Fractures Recommended - Surgical fixation is recommended for displaced elbow fractures. Evidence for the Use of Surgery for E lbow Fractures D.4.f Therapeut ic Exercise ( Active and P assive) Rehabilitatio n (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activ ities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive thera py are those interventions not requiring the exer tion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally pass ive interventions are v iewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy p rogram with concomitant attain ment of objective functio nal gains. Active interventions should be emphasized o ver passive interventions. The patient should be instructed to contin ue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatmen t process in order to maintain improvement levels . Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measur e incorporated into the rehab ilitation plan to facilitate func tional ga ins. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 48 D.4.f.i Physical or Occupational Therapy of Patients After Cast Remov al Recommended - after cas t removal. Frequency/ Dose/D uration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 1 2 to 15 w ith more sever e deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional defici ts, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if ther e is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional go als (e.g., increased grip strengt h, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability t o perform work activities ). As par t of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the thera py. Indica tions for Discontinuation - Resolut ion of elbow pain, intoleranc e, lack of efficacy or non -compliance including n on-compliance with home exercises prescribed. D.5 Elbow Di slocations Dislocation of the e lbow generally occur s as a res ult of significant, hig h-force trauma, and only dislocat ion of the shoulder is more c ommo n clinically. The most com mon mechanism is falling onto an outstretched hand, resulting in a posterior di slocation (98% of cases). Severe pain and inabi lity to use the elbow an d han d are typ ical presenting complaint s. Accom panying fractures and vascula r and neurological problems ar e common, and a combinati on of fracture and dislocation is called complex or co mplex instability . Radial head f ractures are pr esent approxima tely 10% of the time. A combination of dislocat ion, radial head and ulnar coronoid p rocess fractures is called the terrible triad inj ury. D.5.a Diagnostic Criteria Dislocations are diagnosed based on a combination of typic al inciting even t (usually fal l or trau ma) co mbined w ith deformity and inabilit y to us e the arm. Persistent disloca tion involves a complete inabi lity to use the arm and d eformity. D.5.b Special Studies and Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations X-Rays Recommended - at least two to three views for elbo w dislocation to rule -out fractur es. Repeat x -rays after reduc tion are also recommended. D.5.c Initial Care There a re no quality studies for evaluation or treatment of d islocated elbows. An evaluation of the motor, sen sory, and vas cular sys tem is require d to rule -out accompanyi ng injuri es. Medical management of the dislocated elbow should NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 49 include an x -ray to assu re tha t there is no fracture. If the elbow remains dislocate d, it should be reduced as soon as possible by a healt h care p rofession al expe rienced in joint relocation. Injec tion o f an anesthetic into the swol len joint space may help. The longer the elbow re mains dislocated, the higher the probability that general an esthesia will be required to suc cessfully reduce the elbow. Po st-reduct ion x -rays are necessary, as well as an e xam to be sure that the reduction i s successful and that there is no loose body pres ent. A posterior splint is to be applied for 10 days. Range -of-motion exercises are recommen ded after immobil ization. Rang e-of-motion exer cises s hould primarily involve the elbow but should also include the shoulder (to prevent f rozen sh oulder), and the wr ist. D.5.c.i General Anesthesia to Facilitate Reduction i n Select Patients Recommended - to facilitate r educt ion in s elect pat ients. Indica tions Failure to obtain r educti on, generally including use o f intraarticular anesthetic in jection. Rationale for R ecommendation - Most patients do not require general anesthesia to obtain sufficient m uscular relaxatio n for reducti on. In cases whe re redu ction is not obtained and i ntraar ticular injection with anesth etics is insufficient to obtai n reduction, genera l anes thesia is used and is therefore recommended when other measures fail. D.5.d Monitorin g Progress Patien ts sh ould be re-evalu ated seven to ten days after reduction. Range-of- motion exercises shoul d be progressed at that point. If there is failure to progre ss, additional testing is indicated, including for ruling out fracture. D.5.e Activit y Modification and Exer cise Most patie nts with a dis located elbow are treated wit h a posterior splint after reduct ion. They usually are instruct ed to perform gentl e rang e of motion exercises a few times a day to prevent pro longed rehabilitation to regain normal range of motion a fter the splint is remov ed. In addition, interventions are provided to address modification s to performance of ADLs and I ADLs. D.5.f Medica tions For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommend ed as first -line medications. Acetamino phen (or the a nalog paracetamol) may be a reaso nable alternative to NSAIDs f or patients who are not candid ates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence th at NSAIDs are as effective for relief o f pain as opio ids (including tramadol) and less impairing. Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAI Ds for Treatme nt of Elbow Dislocation or Post -Operativ e Elbow Reductio n NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 50 Recommended - for tre atment of Elbow Disloc ation, or post-operativ e Elbow Reduction . Indications - For Elbow Dislocation , or post-operative Elbow Reduction , NSAIDs are recomm ended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffi ce and shou ld be tried first. Frequen cy/Durati on - As need ed use ma y be reasonabl e for many patients. Indication s for Discontinuation - Resol ution of elbow pain, lack of efficacy, or develop ment o f adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. D.5.f.ii NSAIDs for Patients at High Ris k of Gast rointesti nal Bleeding. Recommended - concomminent of drugs: 2 receptor bloc kers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastroint estinal bleeding. Indicatio ns - For patients with a high-risk factor pro file who also have indications fo r NSAIDs, cytoprotective medi cations should be considered, particularly if lon ger te rm treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior g astroint estinal bleeding, elderly, diab etics, and cig H2 blockers recomme nded. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not gene rally belie ved to be substantial differe nces in efficacy for p revention of gastrointe stinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation - Intoleranc e, development of adverse effects, or discontinua tion o f NSAID. D.5.f.iii NSAIDS for Patients at Risk for C ardiovascul ar Adve rse Effects Patients with k nown cardiovasc ular dise ase or multipl e risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risk s and benefits of NSAID therap y for pain discusse d. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regardi ng card iovascular adve rse. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspir in for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease pre vention, to minimize the potenti al for t he NSAI D to counteract the bene ficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes aft er or eight hours before the d aily aspirin. D.5.f.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Elbow Pain NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 51 Recommende d - for tre atment of elbow pain, particu larly i n patients with contrain dications for NSAIDs. Indications - All patien ts with pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post-operative. Dose/Fr equency - Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as-needed basis. T here is evidenc e of hepatic to xicity when exceeding f our gm/day. Indications for Dis continuation - Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. Evidence for the Use o f NSAIDs and A cetaminophen for Elbow Dislocatio n D.5.f. v Opioids Recomme nded - for treatment of select patients with pain from elbow dislocations. Indications Select patients wit h severe pa in from elbow disloca tion with insuf ficient control from oth acetaminophen and NSAIDs or with contraindications for Considerable cautions a re recommended conc erning opioids and minimum numbers of doses should be prescr ibed as dur ation of treatment fo r elbow tions is usuall y quite l imited. Frequ ency/Dose As needed dosing. Among the few patients requiring opioids, most require at most a few days to not more t han one week of treatment and then generally have insu fficient pa in for further treatm ent with opioid s. Indications for Disc ontinuation Resolution of pain sufficiently t o not require opioids, consum ption that does not follow pre scription instructi ons, a dverse effects. Rationale for Recommendation - Most p atients do not require opioids. Some pat ients, particularly wi th more severe dis locat ions may require opioids. Evidence for the Use of Elbow Dislocation D.5.f.vi Anes thetic I ntraart icular Injectio ns for Pr or Post -Reduction Pain Recommended - eithe r pre-reduction or post -reduc tion for pain management. Indications Either p re-reduction to assist with pain control and facilitate reduction or po st-reduction for pain control . NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 52 Frequency/Dose Short or intermediate act ing injectable anesthetics are re commended. Generally, only on e injection is necessary, usua lly approximately 5 to 10 mL. In some cases, a second may be reasonable. Ration ale for Rec omm enda tion - Most pa tients d o not r equire intraart icular an esthetic injec tions. Some require these injecti ons to assist with obtaining sufficient pain relief to faci litate reduction an d thus avoid general anesthesia. Some require these injectio ns after re duction for pain cont rol. Gen erally, pre-reduction injection s utilize more short - term anesthetics and post -reduction injections utilize longer lasting anesthetics. Th ese injections are recomm ended to facilitate reduction and/or pain control. Evidence fo r the Use of Anesthetic Intra articular Injections D.5.g Physical Methods/ Devices Posterior Elbow Splint and Sling for Dislocated Elbow Recommende d - for treatment of dislocat ed elbows. Indication s - Dislo cated elbows a fter reduction. Duration - Poster ior splints are usually appli ed for approximately 10 -17 day s. Range of motion exerci ses are recommended after immobilization . D.5.h Surgery Surg ery may be required to repair ligame nts if there i s either sufficient lax ity that recurrent dislocations o ccur or are otherwise unstabl e. Surgery for Elbow Joints That Recurre ntly Di slocat e or Are Unstable A fter Dislocation Recommended - to repair elbow joints that either recurrent ly disl ocate or are otherwise unstable after dislocation(s). Indications Recurrent elbow dislocations a nd/or unstable elbows after dislocation(s). Rationale for Recommendation - Most patients do not require surg ical repair after elbow dislocat ion. Howe ver, so me have unstab le joints due to ligame nt and/or capsular damage and lax ity. Others have recurrent di slocations. Surgical repair is successful in some to im prove or resolve these issues and is recommended for select patien ts. Evidence for the Use of Immobilization and Surgery D.6 Elbow Lacer ations See Hand, Wr ist, and Forearm Injuries M educal Treatment Guideline. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 53 D.7 Elbow Sprain isolated elbo w sprain is relati vely uncommo n and is caused by a si gnificant high -force trauma, resul ting in a disruption of liga ment(s) about the elbow . The mo st common mechanis m is a fall. Generally, a sprain is accompanied by other pro blems such as fracture, dislocat ion, or con tusion. Potential complications need to be evaluated including the motor, sensory, and vascular system s. Such an evaluation is requir ed to rule -out acc ompany ing injury(ies). For the medical management of disloc ation of the e lbow, an x-ray sho uld be take n to assure that th ere is no fracture. Other than mild sprains, medical man agement of the sprained elbo w should generally include an x -ray to assure tha t ther e is no fracture. D.7.a Diagnostic Studies Sprains a re diagnosed ba sed on a combinat ion of typic al inci ting event (usually fall or high-force trauma) combined with charact eristic elbow pain and foca l tenderness over ligament(s). In contrast with di slocat ions and fractures, sprains generally have normal, though painful ran ge of motion. D.7.a.i Specia l Studi es and Diag nost ic an d Treat ment Co nsiderations X-rays for Elbow Spr ain Recommended - at least two to three views to rule -out fractures . Repeat x-rays are also recommended if there is failure to improve a s clinically ex pected over appro ximately a w eek. D.7.a.ii Monitoring P rogress Patien ts should be re -evaluated seven to ten days after initial eval uation to assure there is progr ess. If there is a lack of progress, x -ray and re - evaluation is required. D.7.e Medications For most patien ts, ibuprofen, naproxen, or ot her older generation NS AIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable a lterna tive to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is mode stly less effective. Th ere is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramado l) and less impair ing. D.7.e.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflamma tory Drugs (NSAIDs ) NSAIDs for Treatment of Elbow Spr ains Recommended - for treatment of Elbow Spra ins. Indications - For Sprains, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OT C) agents may suff ice an d should be tried first. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 54 Frequenc y/Duration - As neede d use m ay be reasonable for many patients. Indications f or Discon tinuation - Resolution of elbow pain, lack of efficacy, or development of ad verse effects that necessitate discontinuation. D.7.e. ii NSAID s for Patients at Hi gh Risk of Gastrointesti nal Bleedin g. Recommended - concommin ent use of e classes of drugs: histamine Ty pump inhibitors for pati ents at high risk of gas trointesti nal bleeding. Indication s - For patients w ith a hig h-risk factor profile w ho als o have indications for N SAID s, cytoprotective m edications should be considered, p articularly if longer term t reatment is contemplated. At -risk patients includ e thos e with a history of prior gas trointe stinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smoke Proton pump inhi bitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer . There is not gen erally believed to be substantial differen ces in efficacy fo r prevent ion of gastrointestinal bleed ing. Indications for Di scon tinua tion - Intoler ance, development of or discontinuation of NS AID. D.7.e.iii NSAID s for Pa tients at Risk for Cardi ovas cular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardio vascular disease or multiple ris k fact ors for cardiovascular d isease sh ould have the risks and benefits of NSAID therap y for pain discussed. Recom mended - Acetaminophen or aspir in as the first -line the rapy appear to be the safest regardi ng cardiovascular adve rse. Recommended - If nee ded, N SAIDs that are non -selec tive are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardio vascular disease p revent ion, to minimize the potentia l for the NSAID to counte ract the beneficial effects of aspirin , the NSAID should be ta ken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the d aily aspirin. D.7.e.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of E lbow Pain Recomme nded - for treatment of elbow pain, partic ularly in patients with con traindications for NSAI Ds. Indications - All patient s with elbow pain, incl uding acute, subacute, chronic, an d post-operative. NYS WCB 55 Dose/Freq uency - Per manufacturer's reco mmendations; may b e utilized on an as -needed basis. T here is evidence of hepat ic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day . Indications for Disc ontinuati on - Resolutio n of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. D.7.e. v Opioids for Select Patients with Elbow Sprains Recommend ed - for the treatment of select pa tients with pain from severe elbow sprains. Indications Select patients with severe pain from severe elbow sprains with insufficient control from other means, including acetaminophen and NSAIDs or wit h contraindication s for NSAI Ds. Considerable cautions are recommended concerni ng opioid s and minimum numbers o f dose s should be prescribed a s duration of treatment for elbow sprains is usually limi ted. Frequency/Dose As needed dosing. Among the few p atients requiring opioid s, most require at most a few days to not more than on e we ek of treatment and then gen erally have insufficient pain for further treatment with opioids. Indications for Disc ontinuation Resolution of pain sufficiently to not requir e opioids, consump tion t hat does not follow prescript ion instructions, adverse effects. Rationale for Recomm endation - Most patients do no t require opioids. Some patients, particularly with more severe sprains may require opioids. They are recommended fo r limited duration (not more than one week) use in se lect pa tients with elbow sprains. Evidence fo r the Use of Opioids for Sprains D.7.f Treatment s D.7.f / Devices Sling s for Elbo w Sprai ns Recommended - for the treatment of elbow sprains. Duration - Generally shou ld be use d for less tha n 7 to 10 days with gradual reduct ion in use. Range of motion exercises of the elbow and shou lder are recommend ed sev eral times daily while using a sling to prevent after comp lications from reduced range s of m otion. Evidence f or the Use of Slings for Elbow Sprains D.7.f.ii Activity Modification and Exercis e NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 56 Patie nts are usually in structed to perform gentle range -of-motion exercises a few tim es a day in order to ma intain normal range of motion. In addition, interventions are provided to address modificatio ns to performance of ADL s and IADLs. D.8 strain involvi ng the muscle -tendon junction of t he biceps brachii (see NY Shoulder Injury MTG for bicipital tendinitis and ruptures at the shoul der). It typically occurs in the setting of the use of high fo rce, particularly if un accustomed . Symptoms are non -radiating pain in the muscle -tendon junction and there are gen erally no paraesthes ias. Pain and/or limited weakness is a common co mplaint. Whi le frequen tly considered two dis crete entiti es of tendinosis v s. ruptur e, there is co nsiderable overlap ranging from mild t o moderate to severe rup tures. The greater the degree of rup ture, the gre ater t he likeli hood surgery may be needed to attempt to rest ore the gr eates t degree of funct ion, particu larly in ge patien ts. D.8.a Diagnostic Criteria Biceps tendinosis is diagnosed based on a c ombination of typical inciting event (usually hig h forc e exertio n such as maximal lift, or unaccus tomed stere otypical high fo rce use) combine d with charac teristic localize d elbow p ain to the aff ected myotendinous junctions as they in sert in the distal ps' tendon in the distal upper arm. Focal tendern ess is present over the affected, disrupte d junct ions. Ecchy mosis may b e pre sent and is gene rally proport ionate to the deg ree of te ar of the junc tions and/or rupture. Biceps ruptures i nvolve a larger degree of tear of the myotendinous junction s up to, and includ ing a com plete rupture of one half o r, rarely, both of the biceps brachii. These ruptu res have a gr eater degree of associat ed weakness for elbow flexion. The physical examination also includes palpable abnormal ities sometimes described a s a \"ropey\" feeling biceps in the area of the insertion . An ac compan ying hematoma is often present. D.8.b Diagnostic Studies D.8.b.i X-Rays X-rays are som etimes used to evaluate patients with b iceps tendinosis and te ars, althou gh MRI and ultrasound are more commonl y utilized. X-rays for Biceps . Rationale for Rec ommendat ion - X-rays ar e not the first imaging study for consi deration, as MRI or ult rasound is generally preferable. However, x-rays are pa rticularl y warranted if there is an acute t raumatic ev ent to help rule-out fracture. X-rays are not invasive, have l ow advers e effects, and are low cost . Therefore, they are reco mmended. ps tendinosis or ruptures . Indica tions - Patients with moder ate to severe bi ceps tendinos is or ruptures, p articular ly in whom the need for surgery is uncertain. Patient s with complete rupture s generally do not require MRI as it usually does not alter the need for surgery. Patients with mi ld tears ge nerally do not require MRI as th e test does n ot alter the trea tment pla n and the good prognosis. D.8.b.iii Ultrasound Diagnostic Ultrasound for Biceps Tend inosis or Ruptures Recom mended - for the evaluation and diagnosis of biceps ten dinosis or rupture s. Indicat ions - Patients with moderate to s evere biceps tend inosis or ruptures, par ticularly those for whom the need for s urgery is uncertain. Patients with complete ruptures genera lly do not re quire diagnosti c ultrasound as it usually does n ot alter the need for s urger y. Patients with mild tears g enerally do not r equire ul trasound as th e test does not alter the treatmen t plan and the good prognosi s. Ultrasou nd should generally not b e performed i n addi tion to M RI as it usually does not a dd addi tional information of benef it. Rationale f or Recommenda tion - After MRI , diagnost ic ultrasound is likely the second most common imagin g study to evaluate the degree of biceps tendinosis or rupture. Ultrasou nd may assist i n evaluating the need for s urgery particularl y in those patie nts with moderat ely severe tears in whom the d egree of rupture may he lp identify whether surge ry is likely t o be beneficial. D.8.c Medicati ons For most patients, ib uprofen, napr oxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as fi rst-line medications. Acetaminop hen (or the analog paracetamol ) may be a reasonable a lternative to NSAIDs for patients who a re not candidates for N SAIDs, alth ough most evidence sugges ts acetaminop hen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAID s are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tr amadol) a nd less Non-Steroidal ) for Treat ment of Biceps Tendinosis and Tears Recommended - for treatment of Bi ceps Tendinosis and Tears Indica tions - For Biceps Tendino sis and Tears, NSAIDs are recommended f or treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffi ce and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration - As needed use may be reasona ble for many patients. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 58 Indications for Discontin uation - Resolution of elbow pai n, lack of efficacy, or develo pment of adverse effect s that necessitate discontinuation. D.8.c.ii NSAID s for Pati ents at Hig h Risk of Gastrointesti nal Bleeding. Recommend ed - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs : misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blo ckers, an d proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointesti nal bleed ing. Indication s - For patients wi th a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytop rotect ive medications should be considered, particularly if lo nger term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gast rointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabet ics, and cigare tte smokers. Proto n pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recomm ended. Do se and frequen cy per manufacturer. There is not gener ally believed to be sub stantial differences in efficacy for prevention o f gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Disco ntinuation - Intolerance, deve lopment o f adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. D.8.c.iii NSAID s for Patients at Ris k for Cardiovascular Adve rse Effects Patients with known cardiovascu lar disease or multiple risk facto rs for cardiovascular dise ase should have the risks and benefits of NSAID thera py for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the fir st-line therapy appear to be the safes t regarding car diovascular adver se. Recommended - If need ed, NS AIDs that are non -selectiv e are preferred over COX -2 spe cific dru gs. In patient s receiving low -dose aspirin for primar y or secondary cardiova scular dise ase prevention, to minimi ze the potent ial for the NSA ID to counteract the beneficial effects of as pirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours b efore the dail y aspirin. D.8.c.iv Acetaminophen f or Treatment of Elbow P ain Recomm ended - for treatment of elbow pain, p articularly in patients with con traindications for NSAIDs. Indica tions - All patients with elbow pain, including acute, s ubacute, chronic, and p ost-operative. Dose/Frequency - Per ma nufacturer's recommenda tions; may be utilized on an as -need ed basis. The re is evidence of hepatic toxici ty when exceeding four gm/da y. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 59 Indications for Discontinua tion - Resolution of pain, adv erse effe cts or intoler ance. Evidence fo r of NSAIDs and aminop hen th Biceps Tendinosis Recommended - for treatment of select pa tients with pain from moderately sev ere to severe biceps tendino sis or ruptures , particularly with nocturnal sleep disruption. Post-operative patients are also candidates. Indicat ions Select patients with severe pain from moderate ly severe to severe bic eps tendino sis and ruptures with ins ufficient con trol from other means, including acetaminophen and NSAIDs or with contraindications for NSAI Ds. Post -operative patients ar e candida tes. Considera ble cautions are recommended concerning opioids and minimum nu mbers of do ses should be prescribed as duration o f treatmen t for elbow sprains is usually limited. Frequency /Dose needed dosing with nerally nocturnal dosing prefe for many patients. Post-operative patients may require scheduled dosing for the first few p ost-operative days. Most non- operative patients shoul d be weaned off o pioids within seven days aft er the event. Indications for D iscontinuation Resolution of pain suf ficiently to n ot require opioids, consumption that do es not follow prescript ion instruc tions, adverse effects. Rationale for Recommend ation - Many patients will require a few days of treatme nt to not more than one we ek with opioids in the acute p ost- opera tive period, w hile non -operative patients do not gene rally require opioids. Patients wi th moderately severe to s evere biceps tendinosis or inadequate control with NSAIDs may require opi oids. They are recommended for l imited d uration (not more than one week ) use in selec t patients. Evidence for the Use of Opioid s for Biceps Tendinosis D.8.d Treatments D.8.d.i Initia l Care Patients with severe or complete ruptures shou ld be referred to a surgeon to evaluate the need for surgical repair. Oth er patients should receiv e treatment i ncluding activity limitations an d pain management strategies gener ally centering on NSAIDs. D.8.d .i.a Monitoring Progress Patients should be re -evaluated approximately every seven to 14 days to evaluate pro gress. If t here is a lack of NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 60 progres s, diagnostic testing (see a bove) and/or refe rral for potential surgical repair should be considered. D.8.d.ii Rehabilitation : Devi ces / The rapy Rehabi litation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work- related injury should be focus ed on restori ng fun ctional a bility required to meet the patient's daily a nd work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requi res an inte rnal effort by the patien t to complete a specific exe rcise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exer tion of effort on the part of the patie nt, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. General ly passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate pro gress in an active therapy program with conco mitant attainment of objective f unctional gains. Active interv entions s hould be empha sized over passive interventions. The patient should be inst ructed to c ontinue both active and p assive therap ies at home as an extension of the treatment process in orde r to maintain improvement levels . Assistive devices may be in cluded as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehab ilitation plan to facilita te function al gains. D.8.d.ii. a Exercise Patie nts ar e often i nstructed to perf orm gent le range -of- motion e xercises within pain -free range a few times a day to maintain as normal a range of mo tion during healing as practical. Exces sive stretching however should gen erally be avoided during the acute hea ling p hase. Hea vy or moderately heavy fo rceful use should al so be avoided in the acute heali ng phase. In addition, interve ntions ar e provided to address modifications to performance of ADLs and IADLs. Thera py (Active) D.8.d.ii.b Exercises fo r Tend Rupture s, or Post - Operat ive Pati ents Recommended - strengthening exercises for trea tmen t of biceps tendinosis, ru ptures an d post -operati ve patients. Indications - All bice ps tendinosis patients are candida tes. Frequency/Dose/Dura tion -Total n umbers of visit s may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more seve re defici ts with docume ntation of ongoing objective functional improvement. NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 61 When th ere are ong oing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits m ay be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards s pecific objective functional goals (e.g ., increased g rip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing a bility to p erform work activities). As par t of th e reha bilitatio n plan a home exercise program should be deve loped and performed in conjuncti on with the therapy. . Dura tion - Varies widely de pending on severity, preinjury conditio ning and job demands. Devices D.8.d.ii.c Slings and S plints for Bicep s Tend inosis, R uptures and Post -Operativ e Patients Recomm ended - for the treatment of bic eps tendinosis, ruptures, and post-operative patients . Indications - Moderate to severely a ffected patients, espec ially for t he first week. Post-operative patients also usually treated with posterior spl ints for approximate ly two weeks (range one to six weeks). Duration - Generally s hould be used for less than seven to ten days with gradual red uction in use. Range of motion exercises of the elbow an d shoulder are r ecomme nded seve ral times daily for non -operative patients wh ile using a sling or splint to p revent after complications fro m reduced ranges of mot ion. D.8.e Surgery Biceps tendinosis may be severe enough t o involve a biceps rupture . These recommendations are for a oc curs in groove a t the sh oulder and ofte n does not require surgery. Distal bice ps tendon ruptures can be manage d non - operative ly and some authors note non-operative management continues to b e acceptable for some , particularly if there are low job demands or older patients . Howev er, distal bicep s ruptures generally occur in the setti ng of supramaximal use of force and requires su rgical r epair in most emp loyed patients . Operative or Distal Recommended - surgical repair of ruptures. Indications - Biceps ther c omplete, large patien ts with moderately s evere biceps tendinosis who fail to adequately progress with non-operat ive care with which they have NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 62 demonstrated complianc e. Patients with high jo b physical deman ds but only moderate tears are also candidates for surgery to at tempt to regain sufficient fu nction to return to those job ta sks. D.9 Triceps Tendino sis (or Ten dinitis) and T tendinitis) is mu scle involvi ng the muscle -tendon junction of the triceps. It is believed to be analogous to biceps ten dinosis, including high force me chanism of Ulnar it is possib le to entrap a nerve at any point al ong its course, there ar e two common areas for entrapmen t of the ulnar nerve at the e lbow. The first is in th e condylar groove, and the second begin s immediately distal to the elbow joint in t he true, anatomic cubital tu nnel. This tunnel commences as the ulnar nerve begins to tra verse distally beneath the apone urosis . Figure 1 - The Co urse of the Ulnar Nerve A cross the Elbow Note the five common sites of compression of the ulnar nerve: th e arcade of Struthers, the me dial intermuscular septum, the medi al epicondyle, the cubita l the de onator Reprinte d by permis sion Mayo F oundation for Medical Education and Res earch. All rights reser ved. Proper testing to localize the abnormality involves a nerve conduction study t hat includes at least sti mulation above and below the elb ow. The role for the \"inchin g technique \" to isolate t he location of the nerve conduction vel ocity decrement and inf er the precise locat ion of the entrapment, while recommended by the American Academy of Electrodiagnostic Med icine and logical for its import ance to treatment has not be en delineat ed in quality interventional studies. (Cubital tunnel syndrome should theore tically be amenable to treatment with simple deco mpression. Ulnar neuropathies in th e condylar groove should theoretically be less amenable t o simple (aka \"in situ\") decompression. ) NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 63 Aside from s urgical studies, there are no quality s tudies on which to rely for treatment of ulnar neuropathies, and there i s little quality evidence of benefi ts of treatment options. D.10.a Initial Care Initial care involves seeking potent ial causal factors that c an be changed. This is believed to incl ude hyperflexion of the elbow during sleep, work or avocational activiti es, as well as avoiding leaning on t he elbow/nerve (see elbo w splinting section below). D.10.a.i Position of Elbows D uring Sleep Recommended - that patients be taught to sleep with their elbows extended, rather than flexed. D.10.a.ii Elbow Posture D uring Work or Avocational Activities Recommended - to avoid hyperflexed (>90\u00ba) elbow postur at work (or activ ities). Diagnostic Criteria neuropathy at the elbo w particularly includes ulnar neuropathy at the wrist, C8 cervic al radiculopathies, and other neurological entrapments located between the spinal c ord and uln ar nerve in th e carpal canal including thoracic outle t syndrome, diabetic ne uropathy, neuropathy f rom alcohol, other syste mic neuropathies, stroke, other cerebro vascular events, and cen tral nervous system tumors. Most other causes may be elimin ated, or the probability reduced , by conducting a careful history , physical exam, or fo cused testing. Some have reported the vast majorit y of these patients have no apparent cause . Patients with a presumptive diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow sh ould have: 1 ) tingling or numbness in an ulnar nerve distribution , generally involving the small digit and ul nar half of the ring finger; and often have 2) symptoms that are provoked either nocturn ally or with sustained elbow fle xion. Patients with a confi rmed diagnos is of ulnar ne uropathy at the elbow should have both symptoms as with a pre sumptive diagnosis abo ve, and a confirmatory elect rodiagnostic study (EDS) interpreted as consistent with ulna r neuropathy at the elbow. To ma ke a diagnosis of cubital t unnel syndro me requires in ching technique to define the abnormali ty to the cubital tunn el (rather t han in the condylar groove, or \" funny bone\"). D.10. b.i Special Studies an d Diagnostic and Treatme Considerations D.10. b.i.a Electrodiagnostic Studies Electromyogra phy for Diagno sing Chronic Peripheral Ner ve Entrapments NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 64 Recomme nded - to assist in the diagnosis of subacute or chronic peripheral nerve entrapm ents including ulnar neuropathies, radial neuropathies a nd Indications - Patients with subacute or chronic paresthesias with o r without pain, partic ularly with unclear di agnosis. In addition to segm ental analysis (e.g., above vs. belo w elbow conduction), pat ients with peripheral neuropathi es in the elbow region shou ld generally have inching technique performed to localize the ent rapment which assists with clinical manageme nt. It has been stated that most of these patients do not requir e these tests, rather in itially require non-operative tr eatment . D.10. b.i.b EDS for sis and Pre -Operative Assessment of Peripheral Nerve Entrapments Recommend ed - to assist in secu ring a firm diagnosis for those patients without a clear diagnos is. EDS are also recomme nded as one of two methods to at tempt to objectively secure a diagnosis prior to surg ical release. D.10. b.i.c EDS for ents Suspected of Havi ng a Peripheral Nerve Entrap ment Not Recommended - for initial evaluation of most patie nts as it does not change the ma nagement of the condition a nd other int erventions are believed to be efficacious. D.10. b.i.d Ultrasound and MRI Ultrasound and MRI have been used for evaluatio n of the ulnar nerve . Diagnostic Ultrasound and MRI for E valuation and Diagnosis of Ulnar Neuropathies at the Elbow Not Recomme nded - for the evaluation and diagnosis of ulnar neur opathies at the elbow . D.10.c Medications For most patients, ibuprofe n, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommende d as first -line medications. Ace taminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reaso nable alternative to NSAIDs for patient s who are not candidat es for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests ace taminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence tha t NSAIDs are as effective for re lief of pain as for treatmen t of acute, subacute, or post operative Ulnar Neuropathi es NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 65 Indications - For acute, sub acute, chronic or post oper ative Ulnar Neuropathies, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. O ver-the- coun ter (OTC) agents may s uffice and sh ould be tried first. For patients having ulnar neuropathy surgical release, general ly treat two to six weeks post o perative. Frequency/Dura tion - As ne eded use may b e reasonable for many patients. Indic ations for D iscontinua tion - Resol ution of elbo w pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate disconti nuation. D.10. c.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Ga strointesti nal Bleeding. Recommended - concomminent use of blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointesti nal bleeding. Indication s - For patients w ith a high -risk factor profile who also have indicati ons for NSAI Ds, cytopr otective med ications shou ld be considered, par ticularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a histor y of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabet ics, and cigarette smokers. H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy fo r prevention o f gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation - Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. D.10. c.iii NSAID s for Patients a t Risk for Cardi ovascular Ad verse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular di sease or mul tiple risk factors for cardiovascul ar disease should hav e the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or as pirin as the first -line the rapy appear to be the safe st regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If need ed, NSAIDs t hat are non -selective are preferre d over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary car diovascular disease prevent ion, to minimize the poten tial for the NSAID to counteract the be neficial eff ects of as pirin, the N SAID should b e taken at least 30 m inutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. D.10. c.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment o f Elbow Pain NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 66 Recommended - for treatme nt of elbow pa in, particularly in patients with contr aindications for NSAID s. Indicati ons - All pat ients with elbow pain , including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/ Frequency - Per manufacturer's r ecommendations; may be utilized on an a s-needed basis . There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceed ing four g m/day. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. D.10. c.v Opio ids Opioids have occasionally b een used to treat pain for patients wit h ulnar neurop athies at the elbow. These medications have primari ly been us ed for a few nights in th e post-surgical timef rame . D.10.c.v.a Routine Use of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Ulnar Neur opathies Not Recommended - for the tre atment of acut e, subacute, or chronic ulnar neuropath ies at the e lbow. Rationale for R ecommendation s - There are no qual ity studies evaluating opioids for treating ulnar neuropathies . Opioids cause significant advers e effects - poor tolerance, constipatio n, drowsiness, clouded judgment, memory loss, and pot ential misus e or depen dence have b een reported in up to 35% of patie nts. Before prescribing opioids, patients should be informed of these potential adverse effects and cautioned against opera ting motor v ehicles or mac hinery. Opioids do not appear to be mor e effective than safer analgesics for managing most musculoskeletal symp toms; they should only be used if needed for severe pain or for a short time (not more than one week) in the post -opera tive time. O pioids are not recommended for treatment of ulnar neuropathy, exc as a D.10. c.v.b Use Select Post -Operative Ulnar Neuropat hy Patients Recommended - for a few days to not more than one week for select patien ts who have undergone recent ulnar neuropathy surge ry, ularly if co mplications h ave occurred. Indica tions - Select patients who have recently undergone ulnar nerve surgeries, usually transposition s and have intense pain (es pecially hav ing insufficie nt pain relief with NSAIDs) or have enc ountered com plications . NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 67 Frequen cy/Dose - Limit use to a few days up to a few weeks; primary use nocturnal to achieve post -operati ve sleep. Longer term use is occ asionally required for thos e with more significant co mplications. Indications for Discontin uation - Resolution of pain, adver se effects, i ntolerance. Rational e for Recommendations - Transposition patients have larger incis ions and frequently require post -operative opioids for at l east a few d ays, usually i n addition to NSAIDs. Some require thes e medication s for a lo nger time. Opioids are re commended for brief (not more than one week) , select use in post -operative patients w ith primary use at night to achi eve sleep post -operatively.

Adelaar 1987 RCT 1.5 N = 18 with lateral, medial or \"posterior\" epi- condyl itis 1000mg followed by diflunisal 500mg every 12 hours for a period of up to 15 days) vs. Naproxen. No statistically significant differences any categories between study drugs or pre - and post -test results at 5th lev el single tail distribution. One patient receiving diflunisal developed transient nausea and stomach cramps though both study agents generally well tolerated. \"Diflunisal and naproxen were generally effective in the treatment of mild to moderate pain assoc iated with epicondylitis; there were no significant differences between the drugs.\" Methods not well described. Open -label. Small study population. Short duration (15 days). No placebo group. OLECRANON BURSITIS Author/Yea r Study Type Scor e (0- 11) Sample Size Comparison Group Results Conclusion Comments Aspiration NYS WCB MTG - Elbow Injuries 161 Weinstein 1984 Controlled clinical trial 3.5 N=60 males with traumatic olecranon bursitis followed 31 months (range 6 - 62). Bursal aspiration vs. aspiration plus corticosteroid injection. Techn iques and doses may have varied. Final data obtained from 49 (82%). Faster resolution with steroid injection (graphic interpretation: effusions in 4% vs. 28% at 4wks). an effective treatment for traumatic olecranon bursitis, the high incidence of side effects and self - limiting nature of the condition indicate conservative therapy for most patients.\" Not randomized. Clinical trial. Many details sparse. Data suggest complications occurred in those treated with corticosteroid injecti on. ELBOW FRACTURES Author/Yea r Study Type Scor e (0- 11) Sample Size Comparison Group Results Conclusion Comments Immobilization Van Leemput 2007 Pseudo - randomized clinical trial 3.0 N = 102 allocated by date of hospital; excluded open fractures, <18 y ears, obvious signs of infection in fracture, and multiple traumas. Immobilization in below -elbow for 3 weeks vs. above -elbow for 3 weeks vs. below -elbow for 6 weeks vs compression bandage and immediate mobilization for 6 weeks; 12 weeks follow -up.
