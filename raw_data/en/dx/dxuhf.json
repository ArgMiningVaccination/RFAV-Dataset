It is used to relieve symptoms of colds: stuffy nose, runny nose, headache and / or fever. This medication should not be used in the following cases: Prolonged treatment or [overdosage] of [NSAIDs may result] in serious adverse reactions. Although it is available without a prescription, it contains a [vasoconstrictor] that can cause potentially serious cardiac or neurological adverse effects. Its use requires certain precautions, including compliance with doses and contraindications. Make sure you do not associate it with another medication containing a decongestant [vasoconstrictor] , especially [tachycardia] ) and cause [palpitations] and nausea. If these adverse effects are too severe, treatment should be discontinued. They may also be responsible for rare neurological complications ( [convulsions] , hallucinations, abnormal agitation), in particular in the case of excessive [dosage] . Respect the recommended dose. It is recommended to take medical advice in the event of [high blood pressure] , heart disease, Certain situations must lead to continuation of treatment only after a medical opinion: - severe heartburn or black and foul-smelling stools that may indicate irritation or bleeding of the digestive tract; - [rash] without obvious cause; - [asthma attack] ; - unusual and intense fatigue, or a sharp and significant decrease in the volume of urine in a person suffering from [heart failure] , dehydration or [diuretic] treatment. Taking this medicine may cause acute [glaucoma] in susceptible persons: red, hard and painful eye, with blurred vision. An emergency consultation with an ophthalmologist is necessary. NSAIDs have an inhibitory effect on ovulation and are likely to decrease fertility in women. This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. Some doctors consider that anti-inflammatories can decrease the effectiveness of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and expose them to an unwanted pregnancy risk. This risk is highly controversial. Conductor: This medication may be responsible, in rare cases, for dizziness or disturbances of vision. Sports: This medicinal product contains a substance considered as stimulant (phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine or synephrine), which is included in the 2004 monitoring program of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. It can be found in athletes' urine to detect any misuse. This medication should not be combined with: - an [antidepressant] of the non-selective [MAOI] type ( MARSILID ): a period of at least 15 days must be respected between the taking of these 2 medicines; - another [vasoconstrictor] risk of selective AIMM (moclobemide). It may also interact with other drugs, including other [non-] steroidal [anti-inflammatory] drugs, [anticoagulants] , [antiplatelet agents,] and drugs lithium or methotrexate. Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking an [antihypertensive] medication, [diuretic] or medicine containing guanethidine. Pregnancy : Adverse effects to the unborn child have been demonstrated when [NSAIDs] are used during the last 4 months of pregnancy; the risk exists even with a single intake and even if the pregnancy is over term. The use of this medication is contraindicated during this period. During the first 5 months, the effect of this medication is poorly understood: only your doctor can evaluate the possible risk of its use in your case. Breastfeeding: This drug passes into breast milk. It is contraindicated during breast-feeding. The tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water, preferably during meals. Usual dosage: - Adult and adolescent over 15 years: 1 or 2 tablets per dose to be renewed if necessary every 6 hours, not to exceed 4 tablets per day. The duration of treatment should not exceed 5 days. This medicine has no anti-infectious effect. If the condition persists for more than a few days, consult your doctor. Related to ibuprofen: Nausea, vomiting, [gastritis] . Rarely: , [haemorrhage] of the digestive tract (bloody vomiting, black stools, or mostly imperceptible blood loss, responsible for the progressive onset of [anemia] ) most often during long-term treatment duration or high [dizziness] , headache; - urinary retention. Nausea, vomiting. [Palpitations] , acceleration of the heart, insomnia, anxiety, headaches, sweating. More rarely: hallucinations, agitation. [stroke ] Brain injury due to haemorrhage or abrupt obstruction of an artery. Depending on the size of the lesion, the consequences are more or less serious: temporary discomfort, paralysis, coma. Abbreviation: AVC. [adenoma of the prostate ] Increase in the volume of the prostate gland located under the bladder of the man. This increase in volume is benign, has no relationship to cancer, but can interfere with the passage of urine into the urethra through the gland. Symptoms that suggest the presence of a prostate adenoma are: - difficulty urinating (slowness, weakness of the spray); - the need to get up several times at night to urinate; - urges to urinate imperiously and difficult to control. Certain drugs, especially atropinic drugs, may have the undesirable effect of aggravating the discomfort and may lead to a total blockage of the evacuation of the bladder. They are therefore contraindicated or should be used cautiously in men with the symptoms described above. [NSAIDs ] Abbreviation for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Family of anti-inflammatory drugs that are not derived from cortisone (steroids), and the best known of which is aspirin. [allergy ] Skin reaction (itching, pimples, swelling) or general discomfort occurring after contact with a particular substance, use of a medication, or ingestion of food. The main forms of allergy are eczema, urticaria, asthma, angioedema and allergic shock (anaphylactic shock). Food allergy can also result in digestive disorders. [anemia ] Reduction in the level of hemoglobin in the blood, which usually results in a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Iron is essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin. Iron deficiency during pregnancy, a vegetarian diet, abundant or repeated haemorrhage (menstruation) is a common cause of anemia. Other causes, more rare, are related to vitamin deficiencies of group B. [analgesic ] Medication that works against pain. Analgesics act either directly on the centers of pain in the brain or by blocking the transmission of pain to the brain. Synonym: analgesic. [antecedent ] Affection healed or always in evolution. The antecedent may be personal or family. The background is the history of a person's health. [antiplatelet agents ] Medication that prevents the platelets from clumping and therefore the clots from forming. The oldest platelet antiaggregant is aspirin taken in small doses. Anti-aggregants should not be confused with anticoagulants with a different mechanism of action. [anti coagulants ] Medication that prevents blood from coagulating and therefore prevents clots from forming in the blood vessels. Anticoagulants are used to treat or prevent phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, certain infarcts. They also prevent the formation of clots in the heart during rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or in the case of an artificial heart valve. There are two main types of anticoagulants: - oral anticoagulants, which block the action of vitamin K (antivitamin K, or AVK) and whose effectiveness is controlled by a blood test: INR (formerly TP); - injectable anticoagulants derived from heparin, the efficacy of which can be controlled by the blood assay of anti-Xa activity, Howell's Time (TH) or Cephalin Kaolin Time (TCK) depending on the products used. A regular dosage of blood platelets is necessary throughout the life of a heparin derivative. [antidepressant ] Medication that works against depression. Some antidepressants are also used to combat obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety, certain rebellious pain, enuresis, etc. Depending on their mode of action and adverse effects, antidepressants are divided into different families: imipraminic antidepressants, selective or non-selective MAOIs. Finally, other antidepressants do not belong to any of these families, because they possess original properties. The mode of action of antidepressants has two main aspects: the relief of moral suffering and the fight against inhibition which removes all will to action from the depressed. There may be a time lag between these two effects: moral suffering may persist, while the capacity for action reappears. During this short period, the risk of suicide in some depressed people can be increased. The physician takes it into account in its prescription (possible association with a tranquillizer) and it must imperatively be respected. [antihypertensive ] Medication that fights against excess blood pressure. The main ones are beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II inhibitors and vasodilators. [anti-inflammatory ] Medicine that fights against inflammation. It can be either derived from cortisone (steroidal anti-inflammatory), or not derived from cortisone (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or NSAID). [antipyretic ] Medication used to lower the body temperature during bouts of fever. [asthma ] Disease characterized by difficulty breathing, often resulting in wheezing. Asthma, permanent or occurring by crisis, is due to a narrowing and inflammation of the bronchi. [convulsions ] Involuntary contractions limited to a few muscles or generalized to the whole body. They are due to excessive pain or stimulation of the brain: fever, poisoning, lack of oxygen, brain damage. Convulsions may be due to an epileptic seizure or high fever in young children. [Crohn ] inflammation of the intestine, which can cause ulcers and narrowing. It often becomes chronic and can be accompanied by persistent diarrhea and malnutrition. [diabetes ] A general term for diseases that result in the emission of abundant urine and intense thirst. The word diabetes, used alone, is generally related to diabetes mellitus, which corresponds to a disruption in the regulation of the body's sugars by insulin. It results in increased sugar (glucose) in the blood and its possible presence in the urine. There are two types of diabetes mellitus: Type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes, which requires insulin injections, and type 2 or non-insulin dependent diabetes, which can initially be treated with oral antidiabetics. [diuretic ] Medication allowing increased kidney water removal. Most often, this loss of water follows the loss of salts caused by the drug (salidiuretic). Diuretics are mainly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, while their mechanism of action in this disease is poorly understood. They are also prescribed in acute or chronic heart failure, edema and other rarer ailments. These drugs cause loss of sodium and potassium (except for some of them called \"potassium-sparing\"). Their prolonged administration therefore requires regular blood potassium control, to avoid heart problems that may result from hypokalemia (lack of potassium in the blood). Lack of sodium is another possible but less frequent consequence of the prolonged use of diuretics; it is also detected by a blood test. [duodenum ] A part of the intestine into which food from the stomach penetrates. [skin rash ] Appearance of pimples or plaques on the skin. These lesions can be due to a food, a drug, and translate an allergy or a toxic effect. Many viruses can also cause pimple eruptions: rubella, roseola and measles are the most common. [gastritis ] Inflammation of the stomach favored by stress, tobacco, alcohol and certain drugs such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs. [glaucoma ] Disease characterized by increased pressure of the fluids contained in the eye (intraocular hypertension). This general term covers two totally different affections: - Open angle glaucoma or chronic glaucoma is the most frequent; it is generally symptom-free, detected by the measurement of intraocular tension in the ophthalmologist. It does not cause acute seizures, and treatment relies primarily on beta-blocking eye drops. People with open-angle glaucoma should not use cortisone derivatives without prior ophthalmologic advice. - Closed-angle glaucoma or acute glaucoma is more rare. Between seizures, intraocular tension is normal. But the inadvertent use of atropine medicines (especially eye drops) causes an acute crisis of intraocular hypertension which can permanently damage the retina in a few hours. It is an ophthalmological emergency that is recognized by a brutally red eye, horribly painful, hard as a glass ball, and whose vision becomes blurred. The angle in question in these two affections is the irido-corneal angle. It is indeed between the iris and the cornea that is located the system of evacuation of the liquids of the eye. A slightly open (closed) angle exposes a total obstruction of the evacuation system. This obstruction can occur when the iris is opened to the maximum (mydriasis) under the effect of an atropinic drug: the iris then comes to be attached to the cornea. Contraindications for atropine medicines are limited to those who have already had closed-angle glaucoma or who have been detected by an ophthalmologist. Those who suffer from chronic open-angle glaucoma are not affected by these contraindications. [hemorrhage ] Loss of blood from an artery or vein. Hemorrhage can be external, but also internal and go unnoticed. [high blood pressure ] Excess blood pressure (tension) in the arteries. This pressure is provided by the heart and is expressed by two digits. It is maximal during contraction of the heart, or systole (first digit), and minimal during cardiac rest, or diastole (second digit). High blood pressure is characterized by a maximum (systolic) pressure greater than or equal to 16, or a minimum (diastolic) pressure greater than or equal to 9.5. Treatment is initiated when these numbers are exceeded or for lower blood pressure in some people with cardiovascular risk factors: heredity, smoking, diabetes, excess cholesterol. Permanent antihypertensive therapy reduces damage to the heart and blood vessels due to high blood pressure. [hyperthyroidism ] Excessive thyroid hormones, including heart failure, poor heat tolerance, weight loss and chronic fatigue. [MAOIs ] Abbreviation for mono-amine oxidase inhibitor. Family of drugs used in psychiatry and neurology (depression, Parkinson's disease). These drugs are divided into non-selective MAOIs, which are incompatible with many drugs and even certain foods, and selective MAOIs (A or B), for which these disadvantages are absent or limited. [heart failure ] Inability of the heart to fulfill its function as a pump. The main symptoms of heart failure are fatigue and shortness of breath during an effort. [coronary heart disease ] Partial disability of the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries) to irrigate the heart muscle. Seizures of angina pectoris can occur, most often during an effort. [Hepatic insufficiency ] Inability of the liver to perform its function, which is essentially the elimination of some waste, but also the synthesis of many biological substances essential to the body: albumin, cholesterol and coagulation factors (vitamin K, etc.). [renal failure ] Inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste or medicinal substances. Advanced renal insufficiency does not necessarily result in a decrease in the amount of urine excreted. Only a blood test and creatinine dosage may reveal this disease. [lupus erythematosus ] Skin disease causing redness of the central part of the face. There are two main forms: discoid lupus (only cutaneous) and disseminated lupus (associated with lesions of the deep organs). [blood count ] The count measures the number of red blood cells (red blood cells), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets in the blood. The blood formula specifies the percentage of different white water or lymph causing localized swelling. [palpitations ] Abnormal perception of irregular heartbeat. [Parkinson ] Chronic disease of the nervous system related to the alteration of certain brain cells and resulting in mobility disorders and sometimes tremors. [dosage ] Quantity and distribution of the dose of a drug according to the age, weight and general condition of the patient. [allergic reaction ] Reaction due to hypersensitivity of the organism to a drug. Allergic reactions can take a wide variety of aspects: urticaria, angioedema, eczema, eruption of pimples resembling measles, etc. Anaphylactic shock is a generalized allergic reaction that causes discomfort due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. [ulcerative colitis ] Inflammatory disease of the rectum and colon, which evolves by flare-ups. Each flare is accompanied by fever, bloody stools. [overdose ] Excessive intake of a drug may result in an increase in the intensity of adverse effects or even in the development of specific adverse effects. This overdose may result from accidental or voluntary poisoning for suicide, so consult your local Poison Control Center (listed in the appendix to the book). However, in most cases, overdose is the result of an error in the understanding of the prescription, or the search for an increase in efficacy by exceeding the recommended dosage. Finally, untimely self-medication may lead to excessive absorption of the same substance contained in different drugs. Some drugs are particularly prone to this risk because they are (wrongly) considered to be harmless: vitamins A and D, aspirin, etc. Stopping or decreasing drug intake helps to remove the disorders associated with an overdose. [tachycardia ] Accelerating the rhythm of the heartbeat. It may be due to fever, hyperthyroidism, heart disease, certain medications, and so on. [transaminases ] Enzymes dosed in the blood, which rate rises during some hepatitis. They are included in blood tests as SGOT and SGPT or ASAT and ALAT. [ulcer ] Injury of skin, mucous membranes or cornea. - Leg ulcer: chronic wound due to poor circulation of blood. - Gastroduodenal ulcer: a localized wound in the mucosa of the stomach or duodenum due to excess acidity and very often to the presence of a bacterium (Helicobacter pylori). The ulcer is favored by stress, alcohol, smoking and certain medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, etc.). [vasoconstrictor ] Medication that causes contraction of blood vessels, as opposed to vasodilator. [dizziness ] Symptom that can mean an impression of loss of balance (common sense) or, more strictly, a sense of rotation on oneself or the environment (medical sense).
