Oils are used in the environment and/or on the body. Clinical aromatherapy is for healing, as opposed to esthetic aromatherapy, which is for pleasure. Clinical aromatherapy is a treatment system that is relatively young. A formal aroma-medicine practice does not exist, but clinical aromatherapy is increasingly accepted by professions including nursing, massage, naturopathy and acupuncture. Essential oils work on physiological, mental/emotional and topical levels. They are useful for relief of various physical pathologies such as respiratory disorders, hormonal balancing, and headaches. An abundance of oils exist for tailoring to issues of stress, anxiety, depression and disorders of the psyche. For skin issues of all kinds, oils are potent anti-microbials, and include properties of moisturizing, dehydrating or stimulating the skin. They help with muscle and joint problems as well. Aromatherapy is a journey to the center of the brain and beyond. At Wise Turtle Acupuncture, oils can be used on acupuncture points along with or instead of needles. Patients desiring clinical aromatherapy may be prescribed oils to use at home by various methods including topical application or in a nebulizer. Due to scent sensitivities of some people, a complete clinical aromatherapy session will have to be a private session. If someone desires just a drop or two, it can be worked into community acupuncture, unless there are sensitive patients in the group. Only the purest essential oils are in use at Wise Turtle Acupuncture. Your practitioner has studied oils under Peter Holmes, LAc, the creator of Snow Lotus Essential Oils. Their use is applied through the lens of Chinese Medicine as they are holistic by nature, treating both body and mind with their varied physiological and olfactory effects. Essential oils are the soul of the plant. Clinical Aromatherapy works first to enhance and balance. This will help prevent disease. Second, aromatherapy can aid in curing certain ailments of mind and body. Essential oils are anti-microbial, stimulating, refreshing or relaxing to the mind, help with muscle spasms, upper respiratory conditions and are useful for skin issues of all kinds. Applications range from basic hygiene and massage to biomedicine and issues of mind and spirit. Oils are used topically, in diffusers or nebulizers, in steams, baths and sprays. Aromatherapy is practiced in the fields of nursing, massage, acupuncture, and naturopathy. | | Call "}
