I dismissed it off-hand as not research based. Fortunately, trusted practitioners and friends encouraged me to be open-minded. Curiosity and exploration are hallmarks of a vibrant life. Considering there was no risk and possible benefit, I gave it a whirl. I attended a Craniosacral Therapy course in 2005. During that course, it was impossible to deny that something therapeutic was happening. So, I played, explored and allowed myself to consider the value of [ therapeutic energy work](https://www.tealcenter.com/energy-medicine/), of which there are so many types: Reiki, CranioSacral, Acupuncture, Biofield Tuning, among others. 16 years later, I am completely convinced that mind-body therapies are effective. It would be a mistake to only consider allopathic (modern medical) approaches exclusively. That would be as absurd to me as only relying exclusively on alternative medicine approaches. As a practical person, I want the benefits of both. Separating the mind from the body is an unhelpful artifact of modern life. Good news, the research world is catching up. Data on the tremendous benefits of meditation are mounting. Breakthroughs in neuroscience have well documented the positive impact of meditation on the brain. Other modes of energy work, such as Reiki, are also being evaluated and the evidence base, while not yet mature, is growing. For example, \"This family of practices, which includes healing touch (HT), Johrei, Pranic healing, Reiki, qigong and therapeutic touch (TT), is increasingly referred to as biofield therapies, a term coined during the US National Institutes of Health Conference in 1992\" Also, NIH defines biofield therapies as: \"noninvasive therapies in which the practitioner explicitly works with a client's biofield (interacting fields of energy and information that surround living systems) to stimulate healing responses in patients\" .Nov 1, 2015 My chosen energy work to practice is Biofield Tuning. Tuning forks are used on the body and in our biofield bringing coherence into our own personal energy fields. Biofield Tuning is totally outside of my PT practice (biofield tuning is NOT physical therapy). As a certified Biofield Tuner I have treated many over the past 4 years. Amazingly, it consistently creates a therapeutic effect. I accept this fascinating work as a piece of the puzzle and began offering it at the Teal Center in December 2021. Skeptic no more, I fully acknowledge energy work as a crucial piece of the puzzle in humanity's search for vitality and healing. To book a Biofield Tuning Therapy session with Karen, please visit "}
