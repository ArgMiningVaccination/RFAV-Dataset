These findings from UC San Diego, which appear Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, suggest that a medication known for stopping the growth of malignant breast tumors might also be a weapon in the fight against so-called superbugs -- including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, which kills more than 11,000 Americans each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A team of UC San Diego scientists used Tamoxifen to protect mice injected with doses of MRSA that would normally be deadly and determined that the drug boosted survival rates by one-third. They also found increased survival against two other superbugs. However, the study's results remain in the realm of basic science -- lab experiments -- at the moment. It will take more testing for Tamoxifen to make the jump from treating breast cancer to squashing especially hardy, virulent bacteria, said Dr. Victor Nizet, the paper's senior author. \"We hope that this kind of research inspires clinical trials in patients with severe infections,\" Nizet said. \"We believe this is part of the larger need that we have in medicine to move to a more holistic approach to treating infections.\" Those trials are likely to be conducted because the UC San Diego team's findings are provocative and exciting, said Guy Salvesen, a biochemist at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla whose focus areas include looking at how external signals -- like a medication -- affect cell development and death. But he added that even though Tamoxifen is already used by hundreds of thousands of women, it does not mean that doctors will quickly start using it to treat severe bacterial infections. \"The bug there is that we don't know enough about what would happen if we did that,\" Salvesen said. \"The side effects may be unexpected, because stimulating the immune system in humans does have potentially devastating consequences.\" Still, Salvesen said, the paper does shed new light on how some of the most basic parts of the human immune system work to fight invading bacteria. The study indicates that when neutrophils, the body's most common type of white blood cell, come in contact with Tamoxifen, they retain high levels of a waxy molecule called ceramide that allows them to move more quickly toward a threat. When they arrive, these cells do something strange. They spew out their innards, their very DNA, to ensnare the targeted bugs. These DNA webs -- called Neutrophil Extracellular Traps, or NETs -- are an aspect of the immune system's response that scientists are just starting to better understand. The UC San Diego paper suggests that when these white blood cells are exposed to Tamoxifen, the NETs they shoot are larger and contain more entrapping material, making it more likely that their attacks will be effective. Salvesen said this finding is promising because it shows that a drug already considered safe in humans can affect the NET-throwing activity. Until the new study, he said, it took application of relatively nasty chemicals to trigger this action. \"There is no way of inducing NET formation that we know of at the moment that would not induce horrendous consequences for the host,\" Salvesen said. He added that these white blood cells, which are pretty much single-shot organisms, come with their own set of metaphysical questions. For example: Once they spew out their insides, are they dead? \"These neutrophils can eviscerate their nucleus, and yet they can still move toward the (enemy). It's a very philosophical question whether they're still alive or not,\" Salvesen said. The UC San Diego scientists said in addition to enhancing neutrophils' ability to chase pathogens and cast a NET, Tamoxifen appears to boost their capacity to engulf and kill their targets. Why that happens is still unclear. Currently, the main use for Tamoxifen is to stop the growth of breast tumors by blocking access to the hormone estrogen. Nizet, who collaborated closely with the paper's first author, Ross Corriden, a project scientist in UC San Diego's pharmacology department, said the drug is not likely to be effective for all superbugs. Some of those pathogens have methods of escaping the NETs cast by white blood cells. He also said for bacteria like MRSA that are vulnerable to Tamoxifen, physicians might end up using a combination approach. \"I think it could work alongside antibiotics in cases where you have a severe infection,\" he said. This is not the first time Nizet's lab has come up with a novel use for an existing drug. In 2010, his team found that statins, commonly prescribed for their ability to lower cholesterol levels, enhance the ability of phagocytes, another type of white blood cell, to kill bacteria. "}
