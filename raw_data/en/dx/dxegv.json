This case is about the not knowing the knowledge of the cultural norms practiced. A traditional method of healing, in the Hmong culture, also known as Cao Gio, or \"coining. There is another type of healings also used such as \"cupping\" oil is applied to the area of interest, then a small glass cups are placed; adheres suction to the cup, light is projected onto the cups for about 10-15 minutes. Once removed they leave a symmetrical bruise on the area of interest. The purpose of this technique is to bring the blood flow to the area to help it heal. Yes, I can understand that the bruises that are left behind do look like that the individual was abused. With this being a treatment of medicine in the Hmong culture this should be dismissed as abusive, this method is not abusive at all and while the coining is administered to heal the child. If someone does report this type of case to child protective services, is doing their job as a mandated reporter, but before starting this step, they should first question the parent more about their culture of healing and check in to the procedure of coining before making any judgment calls. I think that as social workers we should be aware and respect the different cultures that we will be in contact and work together. with. I suggest including on the intake forms there Over the past 10 years, the pharmaceutical formulary for licensed Naturopathic Physicians has absolutely expanded. In many states where Naturopathic Physicians have licensure, they also have the ability to prescribe pharmaceutical drugs to help their patients. While the Physicians may not always choose to go with pharmaceuticals as a treatment choice, they have the option if that is what they and their patients think is best. The state that has experienced the most expansion has been Oregon, but each state has its own formulary which Naturopaths can work from. If I end up working in a licensure state, it will be important to have pharmaceuticals as an option to treat my patients. My main goal as a Naturopathic Physician is to help my patients Alternative health approaches to health care are analysed using a broad range of of research to get various concepts and understanding of the CAM therapies. In 1986 Aakster did a research on how CAM therapies varied fro the traditional biomedical treatments. In his conclusion he found three models that suited medical perspective as listed below; Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). Dr. Johnson and her acupuncture and magnet treatment have been a blessing to me. The warmth of Tao Wellnes Center and Melanie 's dedication made this treatment an unforgettable experience. Acupuncture not only helped me achieve hormonal balance, but it allowed me to achieve a pregnancy! DOI: 8/12/2015. Patient is a 38-year old male journeyman carpenter who sustained injuries to his right cheek/lips/jaws and shoulders/upper back when he was struck by a hook that broke from come-along pin. Complementary and alternative medicine encompass a wide scope of practice, including therapies such as music, massage, acupuncture, herbal medicine, and yoga. Chiropractic as a profession has forever been criticized for being \"outside of mainstream medical institutions\" and categorized as \"complementary and an alternative medicine,\" (Meeker, 2002). This is due to their new/unique methods (historically speaking) not educated to consumers sufficiently and also the intra-professional conflict that is present. This conflict is described as the schism that exists within the chiropractic field currently, and defined as \"a split or division between strongly apposed sections or parties, caused by differences in opinion or belief,\" (Dictionary.com). In the following essay, this schism that divides chiropractic will be discussed further including its causes, as well as how it affects the profession within Several examples of meta-analysis show very little difference between treatments. One example performed by Madsen et al. studied the effects of acupuncture on patients with various pain conditions. 13 trials were performed on 3,025 patients. There was not much difference between the sham and the real acupuncture, but a larger difference with the group that received no acupuncture. This is perhaps due to the fact that these clinical trials were not blind for the patients or the practitioners. Another systematic review looked at the effect of acupuncture on many chronic pain conditions, which included low back pain, tension-type headache, migraine, knee osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, abdominal scar pain, postoperative pain, and procedural pain during colonoscopy. This review compared the response in groups treated with true acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and no acupuncture found a small but statistically significant difference between true acupuncture and sham acupuncture when used to treat various types of chronic pain conditions in favor of true acupuncture. However the effect of placebo acupuncture varied significantly, and there was a great amount of heterogeneity when comparing placebo acupuncture to no acupuncture.4 Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic disease that affects around 20 - 30% of those that have psoriasis which is 2-3% of the total population. This disease is not preventable but is treatable. Treatment for psoriatic arthritis depends on severity but it can be extremely expensive and the medications can have bad side effects. For some people psoriatic arthritis is just a minor annoyance at times during flare ups but for others it's an everyday battle against extreme pain. Some people that suffer from psoriatic arthritis are even embarrassed or ashamed of their psoriasis causing social stress as well as intense physical pain. There are many different types, symptoms, and treatments of psoriatic arthritis making it a very complex disease. Acupuncture for back pain is proven to be an effective therapy when performed by experienced acupuncturists. Many studies have shown that acupuncture can alleviate chronic back pain and enhance well-being in general. The studies also show that acupuncture techniques provide better results in relieving back pain than physical therapies and medications. Today, the medical world recognizes two tips of medicine, the conventional medicine known as Western and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Although, they are by logic completely opposites in practice the have some similarities. The first one, is accepted in most of the advance countries. Though, the second one is having a lot of attention not just from de common people but from the biomedical system as part of their usual treatments. That is why the differences and similarities between Chiropractic as part of the CAM world and the Biomedical Model are getting smaller and closer together. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities.
