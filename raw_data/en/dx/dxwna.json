This is Part II where I am addressing common questions and answers about HPV and the newest vaccine. As I was reviewing research, it became clear that HPV infections have serious impacts to millions of people in all countries. Long term community health risks of HPV infections, development and use of HPV vaccines, and opposition are all complicated topics. Please know that as a public health issue & research focus, HPV extends well beyond our United States. The World Health Organization has published on HPV as well as Australia, France, Japan, Scandinavia, and Italy to name only a few other countries. For more detailed information about recommended ages for Guardasil-9 vaccination, please see Part I of this series at: [https://kreynoldsacupuncture.com/womens-health/what-are-the-recommended-ages-for-the-new-human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine](https://kreynoldsacupuncture.com/womens-health/what-are-the-recommended-ages-for-the-new-human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine) The topics of vaccine ingredients, legal issues of clinical research, and community responses will be discussed in Part III of this series. My hope is that you consider the information for yourself, discuss with your medical team, and make decisions which are personally best for you and your loved ones. How do you get an HPV infection? HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal or oral sex. It can be passed even when your partner has no signs of infection. Are all types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) the same? The short answer is no. There are some 200 different types of Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) and a small number of those are known causes of cancers. HPV related cancers can happen in both men and women. Specifically: HPV is linked to cervical cancer. As I've stated in Part I of this blog series: 500,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year and 250,000 die of it.1 Please know that cervical cancer is not the only type of cancer which HPV infections cause. (See below for further detail). That being the case: most people agree that HPV is a giant public health dilemma. Your body's immune system will clear most HPV viruses, most of the time. However, there are some types of HPV which lead to cancer. HP 16 is the type of HPV which is most likely to cause cancer and HP 18 is the second most risky. Therefore: not all HPV infections are the same. This is also why the newest Gardasil 9 vaccine is designed to target the 9 specific types of HPV which do most harm. Scientific research findings showed that simply vaccinating for one type of HPV does not give protection for other types. Here is a sobering quote from esteemed NIH researcher Dr. Douglas R. Lowy: \"Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are attributable to HPV infection.\" 2 At what age should you get tested for HPV? It is recommended that women start being tested at age 21. Please note that that HPV vaccination is recommended for both sexes. When do HPV related cancers develop? HPV related cancers typically develop 15-25 years after an initial infection. This means an unknown exposure during youth can have life threatening risks in midlife. What types of cancers does HPV cause? HPV infections are known to cause: cervical, throat, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers. HPV also causes genital warts, which are not cancer per se.3 Does Gardasil 9 contain HPV? No. The Gardasil 9 vaccine is made with lab technology using what are called virus-like particles (VLP). VLP are not dead HPV cells. So: the vaccine does not expose your body to human papilloma virus or the genetic viral material of HPV. Instead the laboratory made VLP particles are proteins which copycat the ones normally found on the outside (capsid) of HPV. Copycatting the \"envelope\" of the HPV stimulates your immune system to make cells (antibodies) to immediately attack anything your body sees as being similar. Having a hardy army of antibodies to crush HPV before it creates an infection is important. Why should I get a vaccine if cervical cancer, genital warts, and other HPV related problems are treatable? The short answer is this: it is far easier, cheaper and less stress to your body to prevent infection than treat it. It is preferable to prevent disease than to treat it after it has developed. Consider this: would you rather develop cancer and need to undergo surgeries and medical treatment as opposed to preventing the cancer from ever happening at all? Which possibility would you prefer for your daughter or son? An absolutely reasonable argument is that HPV vaccines are expensive and pharmaceutical companies are profiting from them. I agree. That being said: consider costs for surgical procedures, monitoring, medications, office visits, travel time, recovery time off work and all of the fall out of needing to treat an HPV related cancer. It is overwhelmingly less expensive to prevent HPV related illness than to treat cancer. Why is the vaccine recommended for males and females as young as 9 years old or a child who is not even sexually active? For most vaccines, your body responds most efficiently when you are young. Remember: your making antibodies is required to prevent HPV infections. Adolescent aged children produce higher levels of antibodies than even teens or adults. In fact, research found that adolescent aged children who had only 2 of the recommended 3 doses of the vaccine during a 6-month period had antibody levels equal or better than 16 to 23-year-old individuals who completed the recommended 3 vaccinations within 6-months. Considering the physical strength of the immune system of a young person, the HPV vaccine is best given before initiation of sexual activity. 4 Thank you for reading! In Part III of this series I will address controversial ingredients of vaccines, some legal regulations which influence development, testing and release of vaccines, as well as opposition opinions. - Please leave any questions you may have here and I am happy to answer them. - If you found this article helpful, I would appreciate liking my Facebook page at: [https://www.facebook.com/KarenReynoldsLAc](https://www.facebook.com/KarenReynoldsLAc) - All content here is written personally by me in with the goal that it is be helpful to you.
