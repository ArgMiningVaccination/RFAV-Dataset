[See more Journal specific guidelines](javascript:;) Guidelines on writing titles, abstracts & table of contents entry The title, abstract and table of contents entry (graphical abstract) are the first parts of your manuscript that editors, referees and potential readers will see, and once published they play a major part in a researcher's decision to read your article. Therefore it's important that these clearly and concisely summarise the topic of your review and its significance. Title The title should be short and straightforward to appeal to a general reader, but detailed enough to properly reflect the contents of your review article. - Keep it relatively short - between 8 and 15 words is ideal. - Use easily recognisable words and phrases that can be read quickly. - Use general or well-known terms for compounds and procedures rather than very specialised terms or nomenclature. - Avoid using non-standard abbreviations and symbols. - Use keywords and familiar, searchable terms - these can increase the chances of your article appearing in search results. Around 70% of our readers come directly via search engines. Abstract The abstract is a single paragraph which summarises the contents of your article. It will help readers to decide whether your article is of interest to them. - The length can vary from 50 to 250 words (or up to 100 words for Highlight articles), but it should always be concise and easy to read with recognisable words and phrases. - It should summarise the research area that your review covers, including why it is important. - Like your title, make sure you use familiar, searchable terms and keywords. Table of contents entry A table of contents entry (graphical abstract) is required, which should be submitted at the revision stage. This should include an eye-catching graphic and 1-2 sentence(s) of text to summarise the key findings of the article to the reader. It will appear in the table of contents and feeds - for example, RSS feeds. The graphic should: - Be simple, but informative. - Capture the reader's attention (the use of colour is encouraged). - Include a structure, scheme, graph, drawing, photograph or combination that conveys the message of the article. Please note, complex schematics or spectra should be avoided. - Be original, unpublished artwork created by one of the co-authors. Preferably, the graphic should not be reused and appear again within the article. - Be suitable for, and uphold the standards of, a scholarly publication that has a global reach. - Not contain any elements that are offensive or inappropriate, in particular words or images that are discriminatory. - Not contain large amounts of text. Text should be limited to the labelling of compounds, reaction arrows and diagrams, with long phrases or sentences being avoided. Any text should be clearly legible to a reader. - Not contain logos, trademarks or brands names. The text should: - Be concise and focus only on the key findings of the manuscript and their importance, not the processes used; think about what would grab the attention of the potential reader and would encourage them to read the full article. - Avoid repeating or paraphrasing the title or abstract. - Use easily recognisable words and phrases that can be read quickly. Table of contents specifications: - The figure should be a maximum size of 8 cm wide x 4 cm high. - Figures should be supplied as TIFF files, with a resolution of 600 dpi or greater. - The text supplied should be 1-2 sentences long, using a maximum of 250 characters.

While isolating colibactin has been problematic, efforts to characterize its biosynthesis have provided critical information that has led to a rapid increase in our knowledge of this metabolite's structure and function. Major questions and gaps remain however, and the broader lessons learned from studying colibactin underscore central challenges to be faced in the genomics era of natural product research and in efforts to understand the human microbiome. From DOI: [10.1039/C5NP00091B](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/np/c5np00091b)Deconvoluting the mode of action of natural products and drugs remains one of the biggest challenges in chemistry and biology today. Chemical proteomics is a growing area of chemical biology that seeks to design small molecule probes to understand protein function. In the context of natural products, chemical proteomics can be used to identify the protein binding partners or targets of small molecules in live cells. Here, we highlight recent examples of chemical probes based on natural products and their application for target identification. The review focuses on probes that can be covalently linked to their target proteins (either via intrinsic chemical reactivity or via the introduction of photocrosslinkers), and can be applied \"in situ\" - in living systems rather than cell lysates. We also focus here on strategies that employ a click reaction, the copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC), to allow minimal functionalisation of natural product scaffolds with an alkyne or azide tag. We also discuss 'competitive mode' approaches that screen for natural products that compete with a well-characterised chemical probe for binding to a particular set of protein targets. Fuelled by advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation and bioinformatics, many modern strategies are now embracing quantitative proteomics to help define the true interacting partners of probes, and we highlight the opportunities this rapidly evolving technology provides in chemical proteomics. Finally, some of the limitations and hallenges of chemical proteomics approaches are discussed. From DOI: [10.1039/C6NP00001K](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/np/c6np00001k) While recent breakthroughs in the discovery of peptide antibiotics and other Peptidic Natural Products (PNPs) raise a challenge for developing new algorithms for their analyses, the computational technologies for high-throughput PNP discovery are still lacking. We discuss the computational bottlenecks in analyzing PNPs and review recent advances in genome mining, peptidogenomics, and spectral networks that are now enabling the discovery of new PNPs via mass spectrometry. We further describe the connections between these advances and the new generation of software tools for PNP dereplication, de novo sequencing, and identification.
