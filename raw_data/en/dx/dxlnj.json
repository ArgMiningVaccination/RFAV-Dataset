Pterostilbene helps the CAMP gene function. This gene is the body's first line of defense to combat bacterial infection, the study outlines. It needs [vitamin D](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/01/136626/low-vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-sources)to work, though, so make sure you're getting enough, via sunlight, supplements, or food.

(Turmeric has tons of other benefits too; it may even [prevent Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150112110405.htm).) You can sprinkle the spice onto vegetables, add a spoonful to smoothies, and or try [turmeric tea](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/242148/ginger-turmeric-herbal-tea/).

If you're brave, you can even just pop some garlic into your mouth and eat it raw. 4 of 7 SpinachPopeye was on the right track. The leafy green is packed with antioxidants and nutrients like vitamin E and vitamin C that may be able to [help the immune system beat infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23830380).
