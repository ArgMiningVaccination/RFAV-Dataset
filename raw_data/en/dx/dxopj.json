Here you'll find expert-led tips for a gentle and natural liver cleanse from Pukka's herbal team. How to support the liver naturally? Your body is well equipped to naturally cleanse. The liver, kidneys, digestive system, and lungs work hard to remove wastes on a daily basis. The liver is an organ that we don't often think about, but it plays a crucial role in detoxification and overall health and vitality. It works as a warehouse, a manufacturing hub and processing plant all in one. Our modern diet and lifestyles have introduced many novel challenges for our detoxification system to meet. Some of the signs that indicate the body may need some extra support include disturbed digestion, foggy thinking, sluggishness, fatigue, hormonal imbalances, and skin imperfections. Supporting your liver cleanse holistically through diet, herbs and lifestyle techniques can be a great way to help your body naturally. By adopting some of these liver cleanse tips below and building them into your daily routine, you may find you feel more energised and rejuvenated. Day 1: Drink more water and less alcohol Staying hydrated is essential to maintaining all your body's natural functions so be mindful to keep your water levels topped up throughout the day to cleanse the liver. Drinking alcohol can place added pressure on the liver. Part of leading a healthy lifestyle is about having a bit of what you enjoy. You don't necessarily need to completely remove alcohol from your diet for a liver cleanse , but reducing the amount will decrease the level of work for your liver, accelerating the outcome of a 7 day liver cleanse diet. You can effectively manage the ill-effects of alcohol consumption and work on how to cleanse your liver by introducing scientifically proven natural herbs and [remedies that can help to support you with a hangover](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/uk/en/wellbeing-articles/9-hero-herbs-to-help-support-you-when-you-have-a-hangover) and support liver functions. Day 2: Drink two cleansing teas per day Sipping warm cleansing teas containing cleansing herbs throughout the day can provide gentle nourishment and herbal support that will keep your body in tip-top condition. Enjoy a morning cup of [Feel New](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/uk/en/products/feel-new-tea) containing aniseed, turmeric, cardamom and fennel, to naturally nourish and support optimum digestion. Turmeric helps to protect the skin from the inside out. It is a wonderful herb to promote liver function and digestive health- both key to happy hormones and glowing skin. Hydrate with [Radiance tea](/uk/en/products/radiance-tea), a refreshing blend of organic nettle, fennel, dandelion, and peppermint to help you glow from the inside out. Day 3: Eat two portions of broccoli, kale or cauliflower a day What foods support the liver function? A healthy liver requires a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of colourful organic fruits, vegetables, and proteins. Eating a rainbow of liver cleansing foods will deliver all the goodness to allow it to function optimally. Show your liver a little extra love by including plenty of protective green leafy vegetables in your liver cleanse diet like broccoli, kale and cauliflower. They're rich in fibre and contain potent liver-supportive plant compounds called glucosinolates. These plants have a characteristically bitter taste which stimulates the secretion of digestive juices to keep your detoxification system working well. This in turn will keep your hormones in balance, ensuring that you feel like your best self. [Organic](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/uk/en/wellbeing-articles/what-does-organic-mean-and-why-is-it-so-important) is always a great way to go when choosing vegetables, as they have higher levels of beneficial plant compounds and it's a better choice for the planet. Day 4: Add herbal supplements into your diet every day Super-rich supplements such as turmeric, triphala and aloe vera deliver helpful plant compounds, vitamins, minerals, and protein to support the process of liver cleansing more effectively. It's often said that your skin is a direct reflection of what is going on inside your body. Keeping your liver and digestive system in good health using gentle and [natural cleansing](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/uk/en/wellbeing-articles/benefits-of-a-natural-cleanse) is an important step to achieving happy, clear, and radiant skin. Day 5: Try tongue scraping Keep a good eye on your tongue as it reveals a lot about your overall health, digestion and indicates that a liver cleanse is working. Tongue scraping is a traditional Ayurvedic self-care practice to clear unwanted toxins. It is known to keep your mouth healthy and promote fresh breath. First thing in the morning before brushing your teeth, take a look at your tongue and see if there is any coating. A thick white or yellow coating may indicate there is an imbalance in the body and you need a liver cleanse. The tongue is at the top of the digestive tract you can think of it as a map to all that is happening within in the body. Ideally, it will be nice and pink, with only a thin clear/white coating. Day 6: Apply a castor oil pack to your liver Castor oil packs are a traditional remedy which harness the benefits of castor oil to support the lymphatic system. Castor oil is rich in fatty acids which penetrate through the skin to help cleanse, moisturise, and stimulate liver function for optimal wellness. There are innumerable benefits of a castor oil pack on liver. This topical treatment is known to clear congestion, promote effective elimination and support hormonal balance. Apply castor oil to an old flannel before placing on the liver region (under the right side of your chest), wrap in clingfilm and cover with a hot water bottle. Try to leave it there for a minimum of an hour to get the best effects. Day 7: Get a sweat on Regular, moderate physical activity improves circulation and helps to get rid of unwanted waste through sweating and breathing. Focus on activities which help raise a sweat to cleanse the liver like jogging, cycling or walking briskly uphill. These types of workouts will stimulate blood flow to the skin, improve mental clarity and help you sleep better which are all essential to the rejuvenation process. By increasing blood flow, exercise helps to nourish skin cells and improve the delivery of oxygen and vital nutrients for increasing your natural glow, you should see an improvement in your energy levels which is a sure sign that your 7 day liver cleanse is working.
