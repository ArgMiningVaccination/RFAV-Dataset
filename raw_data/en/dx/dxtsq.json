Published by:The Secretary, CBSE, 'Shiksha Kendra', Printers, 20 Road,Daryaganj, New Delhi-110002v Central Board of Secondary Education, DelhiFOREWORD The Central Board of Secondary Education has been at the forefront of introducing many fundamental reforms in school education to make it more responsive and flexible to accommodate needs and aspirations ofevery child on the one hand and on the other to deliver as per the demands of the ever evolving world. In themodern dynamic knowledge societies we need to prepare students for a life of careers rather than preparing asingle career for a life time and therefore the schools affiliated to the Board must enhance their capacity toaddress the emerging challenges. The CBSE publishes the compendium of circulars issued to school every five years. However, in view of sheer number of circulars issued during the last three years and the number of requests received from schooland other stakeholders to supply copies of the latest circulars issued on important policies, it is imperative toupdate it by including the important circulars issued on various subjects. The present compendium contains the important circulars issued by the Board during the period 2005-2011. The compendium is available in two volumes and has been divided as per the themes. The subject,number of circular and the year it was issued has been mentioned in the contents. The soft copies of most of thecirculars are available in the archives on the CBSE website ( www .cbse.nic.in). It is hoped that the compendium would serve as a useful guide for the school to implement the guidelines issued by the Board and it is recommendedthat every affiliated school must keep a copy of this important document to pursue the Board's philosophy andvision of continuous growth. I am confident that this compendium, besides being a handy reference, will also help the heads of institutions to understand some significant issues related to programmes and policies of the Board. Compilation and editingof the present volumes has been carried out under the supervision of Dr. Sadhana Parashar, Director (Training),CBSE with assistance of Shri A.H. Ahmed, AEO.

Dear Principal, Your kind attention is drawn to Board's Circular No. 12 dated 22.06.2006 on the above mentioned subject. You are thus aware of the Board's direction that it has stopped the practice of recommending the books ofprivate publishers including the Hindi medium books in different subjects at senior secondary level from theacademic year 2005-06. In spite of this clear direction, it has been brought to our notice that some unscrupulous private publishers/ agencies are making claims that their books are recommended by CBSE which is not factually correct. Theschools are thus requested to be cautious and alert and not to be moved by such claims by prescribing theirbooks. Another important aspect is regarding correct use of teminology as approved by the Standing Commission for Scientific & Technical Terminology in the Hindi medium textbooks which has already been incorporated byNCERT in its textbooks vide their letter No. 2-22/2007-08/455 dated 26.04.2007. The teachers concerned maybe advised to strictly adhere to the correct terminology as incorporated in the new NCERT textbooks. You arerequested to inform the Board immediately if any private agency/publisher is claiming that their books arerecommended by CBSE to enable the Board to take action against such agency. Yours faithfully (C. GURUMURTHY) DIRECTOR (ACAD)410 dsUnzh; ek/;fed COMMUNITY CENTRE, PREET VIHAR, DELHI-110092 NO. HOD(EDUSAT)/08 March 10, 2008 Circular No. 08 All Heads of Institutions Affiliated with the CBSE Subject: Counselling in Schools Sir/Madam CBSE has been sending guidelines to its affiliated schools periodically about providing counselling services to students. Circular No. 8 dated 10th July, 2002 highlighted this need by observing that 'exercises in buildingself-concept, self-image, acceptability, ability to withstand pressures, sense of enterprises, sportsmanship etc.have to be part of the learning process and schools were instructed to provide planned and effective counselling to achieve the above. The Board has also advised all the senior secondary schools to appoint a person on full time basis for performing the duties of a counslor. It was also expected that secondary school would also followthe above directions if the resources permit. A committee, popularly known as Raghavan Committee, constituted by the Supreme Court of India to make suggestions for prevention of ragging in educational institutions has also made a strong case for regularand periodic psychological counselling sessions for every student in the school. Though ragging is not prevalent at school level, it is necessary for schools to sensitize students about human rights, democratic values and respect for privacy and dignity of others. The right attitude is formed only at formative period of schooling.Schools are advised to create a conducive climate that is free from fear, anxiety and stress so that children canlearn joyfully and learn to work together harmoniously. The following points are reiterated in this regard withan instruction to schools to implement an effective programme of counselling for students: /circle6At secondary and senior secondary stages at least twenty sessions of psychological counselling must be provided to every student in an academic session. Parents and teachers may also be involved in such sessions. /circle6Corporal punishment should be totally banned in schools (please refer to CBSE circular dated 20thJuly, 2002). /circle6Awareness about human rights, respect for diversity and equality may be discretely grafted into thelessons and exercises right from the primary classes. Education in Life Skills can be given greater thrust in class VI-VIII to inculcate the desirable value system. Your cooperation in the matter will go a long way in creating a condcive ambience in schools for the holistic and healthy development of children. Yours faithfully, (SHASHI BHUSHAN) HOD (EDUSAT & VOCATIONAL EDUCATION)411 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION E.O. (L&T)/NIF/A/08 June 4, 2008 Circular No. 22/08 All Heads of Independent Schools Affiliated to the CBSE Subject: IGNITE 2008: A National Campaign to harness the creative and innovative spirit of school children by National InnovationFoundation (NIF) and CBSE, supported bythe Honey Bee Networkand SRISTI. Dear Principal, CBSE had made attempts jointly earlier with National Innovation Foundation to organize competitions for children's ideas and innovations and traditional knowledge learned/acquired from elders, which evoked goodresponse from the students. We are talking this initiative again this year as part of a campaign called IGNITE 2008 (Annexure 1)' through the launch of 'Honey Bee Creativity Clubs' (Annexure 2) in the schools. The campaign will be launchedin June this year and the awards will be given on 15th October 2008. Why the Creativity clubs and the IGNITE contest? Creativity among children is almost in-bom. Every child is creative, degrees may vary, but not the basic manifestation. Then what happens during the growth and maturation? Why should children stop asking basicquestions? Why do they agree to do repetitive science projects instead of being original? Why do they learn tolive with unsolved social and professional problems? We should not allow our children to live with such problemsrather urge them to come up with solutions to these. Originality, creativity and innovative spirit have to be promoted among our children so that when they become leaders of our society, they ensure an imaginative, inclusive and an innovative future for the country.The objective of the exercise is to have a network of Creativity and Innovation clubs in schools, which willproactively support and nurture creative initiatives of children. These are likely to make them more sensitive tothe problems faced by not just them and their families or neighbours but also other socially disadvantagedsections of the society. The challenge of conserving nature through creative technical and institutional innovationswill also be faced through these clubs. These Honey Bee Creativity Clubs will be student clubs that will be a permanent activity/feature of theschools and have ongoing activities round the year. IGNITE 2008 will be an annual contest that may be back next yearas IGNITE 2009. IGNITE 2008 Campaign 1 (June-October 2008): The country has been divided into twelve zones with a city representing each zone (various zones and representative city have been mentioned in Annexure 3). In412 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh second/third week of June, the campaign will be declared open following which subsequent launches will be held in each zone (June-July). The schools in the zone would be motivated to open Honey Bee Creativity Clubsand also participate in the IGNITE 2008 idea and innovation contest (the participation dates for each zone arementioned in Arurexure 3). While the submission of project dates (June-July) is open for each zone, students from the particular zone can submit their ideas/innovations/projects, through any of the following means: 1. Online registuation and project submission at www.indiainnovates.com2. Email the details at ignite08@nifindia.org3. Mail them at the following address (directly/through the Principal) IGNITE 2OO0/CBSE National Innovation Foundation, India Bungalow 1, Satellite Complex, Premchand Nagar Road, Vastrapur Ahmedabad 380015, Gujarat After the end of the submission dates for each zone, the entries would be short-listed and zone wise preliminaries would be held (August-October) in the representative city (of the zone), where the selected studentswould be invited to exhibit and present their project before an invited audience and experts. The three winners from each zone will participate in the national level finals on 14th/15th October 2008.IGNITE 2008 Campaign 2 (October 2008-May 2009): During their vacations or otherwise, the students would be encouraged to look for people who come out with innovative machines/devices or solve day to dayproblems using their creativity. Similarly they would be encouraged to document and learn traditional knowledgepractices from their elders in their family and neighbourhood. The purpose is to expose them to the rich taditionalheritage we have, facilitating its tansfer from generation to generation. The students submitting the maximum number of properly documented entries (Innovations/Traditional Knowledge) to the clubs/schools (which would forward them to NIF) would be given appreciation certificatesfrom NIF. For each innovation/traditional knowledge practice spotted and documented by the student, he/shewill be credited as being the 'Scout' for that particular innovation/traditional knowledge in records. Specific points to be noted 1. Teachers and parents are specifically requested not to be suggestive to the children and let them come up with some creative idea of their own. In case, the teachers or parents have an interesting idea(s) theycan send it to us for separate awards. 2. Simple essays, write-ups on problems like population, corruption, global warming etc. will not be accepted as well as common projects (from text books/other make yourself books) like hydel power project, rainwater harvesting, water level indicators, vermi compost/vermiwash, letter box alarm and other alarms,using turbines to generate energy, using solar energy to do various things, electricity generation throughwaste batteries/dung/transport/waves or earthquake alarm.413 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi Any queries may be addressed to NIF at email: ignite08@nifindia.org or Telephone numbers Toll Free No.: The Event Outline is as folloqws: Event Outline* Stages Activity Time Period Stage I Launch June-July Stage II Registration 1 participation July Stage III Zonal Short-listing 3lst July-l0th August Stage IV Zonal Prelimineries and Zonal Winners August-October Stage V Final Presentations Awards October 15 Zone wise details in Annexure 3 Looking forward to having your enthusiastic cooperation in our collective endeavour to unfold the creative genius of the children who are the future leaders of our society. With best wishes, Yours sincerely, (UMA SIV IGNITE 2OO8 We are mounting a two segment campaign in all the schools as a part of IGNITE 08. Campaigns 1: Creative and innovative solutions developed by the children Every student would be motivated to identify the problems, in efficiencies, drudgery in everyday life with which we should not live any more and try and develop original solutions for them and submit the same to thePrincipals soon after the schools open. Idea is to make children intolerant of inefficiency or incompetence orinadequate design or functionality of various products and services in their life or around them. Children can also submit ideas if they have not been able to convert them into physical projects. If short listed, they might be given financial and mentoring support to complete the projects. In the deserving cases,patents will be filed in their name at no cost to them. It is also possible that some of the ideas might attractentrepreneurs and these may get licensed for monetary consideration. The projects aiming to demonstrate the known concepts of science or technology without any novelty will not be accepted. Here, the emphasis is on sensitivity to the problems, that have remained unsolved. Generalproblems like poverty or environmental degradation need not be mentioned. However, specific aspect of aproblem can be mentioned (e.g. women who transplant paddy in standing water develop infections in their feet,how can we find an affordable solution for them. Many times the cooking gas gets exhausted during the processof cooking without any advance waming. Why could not there be an indicator telling in advance how long thegas will last?). Parents and teachers will be requested to submit their ideas under respective categories for separate award and not influence the children. * Patent has been filed in the nane of Atchara and Preethi, winners of IGNITE 2007 for their project 'Respirometer'. Campaign 2: Documenting traditional knowledge and Looking for the odd balls There is a tremendously rich traditional knowledge much/some of which we still use in our families. It could be related to health, child care, women's problems, clothes, cosmetics, hair care, construction, foodprocessing, etc. Some of this knowledge can even help in extending the frontiers of science or technology. Oneof the major cause of concern is that lot of this knowledge is getting eroded or lost because of lack of connectionbetween grandparents and grandchildren. The knowledge has to be documented with the identification of thesource from whom it has been collected and with their consent for sharing it with NIF. It is not enough to be creative oneself. We have to learn as a society to appreciate the creativity and innovativeness of others. It is the culture of appreciation, which ultimately will change the mindset and helpIndia become not just creative but also collaborative and compassionate. Students have to scout the innovationsand outstanding attempts to solve problems in the neighbourhood or among the nearby slums or the workshopsor any other social sphere. The innovator may be educated or uneducated. He/she could even be a schooldropout.415 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi Annexure 2 Honey Bee Creativity Clubs The Objective The purpose is to imbue in young children the Honey Bee network philosophy of crosspollinating the knowlodge rich economically poor people. Hope is to link people in one region with one set of solutions withpeople from another region facing same or similar problems. A knowledge network may thus be created, withdue acknowledgement to the knowledge holders. Essentially, following the way of a honey bee, which linksflower to flower and sucks nectar without impoverishing the flower and does not keep all the honey for itself. The Clubs will also inculcate in children the ability to blend seven Es, ethics, efficiency, equity, excellence, empathy, education, and environment, proposed by the Honey Bee Network, SRISTI (Society for Research andInstitutions for Sustainable Technologies and Institutions) and National Innovation Foundation. Idea also is to nurture the children so that they grow and excel as future innovation leaders of India. We want to invest in them at an early age so that when they grow up as sensitive, responsible and mature citizens,they are ready to lead India into an innovation age\" The Plan Each school will have innovation clubs called Honey Bee Creativity Clubs in schools. There would be two nominated teacher in-charge and any five student representatives from standard 6th to 12th. Thus, the club willbe managed by any five student representatives and two teacher representatives. The other members wouldcomprise students who have (a) submitted interesting ideas/innovations of themselves, (b) scouted innovations/ideas of others and (c) done both. The Launch During June-July, 2008, invitations would be sent to all the schools in the cities. The campaign representatives would visit personally the schools that will respond to the invitation letters and give a presentation. Finally, inthe interested schools the club would be launched. Subsequently, they would be divided in different zones andan induction program would be organised for each zone, where all the teacher and student representatives fromall the schools will be present and preferably the principals also would attend. The students and teachers would be expected to motivate other students to participate. Schools may choose to open Creativity clubs and also participate in IGNITE 2008 or may only participate in the competition withoutcreating clubs. lt would be at their discretion. Other activities have also been planned to engage the students. Walks through rural/urban areas like villages/ slums would be organised on monthly/bimonthly basis to sensitize students about the ground realities andproblems facing our society today so that they can come up with solutions to those. Also at the same time theymust be made to realize that the poor may be financially poor but are rich knowledge wise, resulting in increasingtheir respect for such people. Special guided 'Make yourself' workshops may be organised apart f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh During the summer vacations, the clubs may nominate students to attend an educational excursion (maximum seven days) wherein they would be exposed to/will undertake the following activities. 1) orientation about scouting & documentation2) methods of data collection (plant samples, building case studies etc.)3) mentored pilot field visit4) field visit for data collection5) compilation of collected data A representation from NIF would lead the team.Any idea/innovation worth scaling up would be taken up by NIF and supported through the Micro Venture Innovation Fund at NIF.417 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi Annexure 3 Tentative Time Schedule & Event Flow from launch to Finals for Campaign 1 of IGNITE 2008 Major Hubs* Launch Launch city Registration Preliminaries Finals upto Chennai 20th June Chennai 8th July 12th August (Chennai Pondicherry Maharashtra 22nd June Mumbai 10th July 16th August Gujarat 23rd June Ahmedabad 11th July 20th August Madhya Pradesh 25th June Bhopal 13th July 27th August (Chattisgarh)Delhi 27th June Delhi 15th July 1st September (Rajasthan,Uttarakhand, Punjab,Haryana and northern states) Uttar Pradesh 30th June Lucknow 18th July 6th September (Bihar, Jharkhand)West Bengal 2nd July Kolkata 20th July 11th September (North Eastern States) Orissa 4th July Bhuvaneshwar 22nd July 18th September Andhra Pradesh 7th July Hyderabad 25th July 24th September Karnataka 9th July Bangalore 27th July 30th September Kerala 11th July Cochin 29th July 4th October Tamil Nadu (other 14th July Madurai 30th July 7th October than Chennai zone) * Schools from other parts of the country (not mentioned in the list) willing to participate may consider the dates of their nearest hubs for participation.

All students study science as a compulsory subject upto grade X and a significant percentage of them continue studying Physics, Chemistry,Biology, Bio-Technologr. Home Science etc. at Senior Secondary level. This requires conduct of regular practicalwork and use of variety of equipment, instruments, gadgets, materials, chemicals, glassware etc. It is of utmostimportance that in order to ensure safety of students working in Science laboratories, every essential precautionis taken well in advance. It is not uncommon to observe that in many cases, the essential safety measures are either not given much attention or are ignored altogether. Gas fittings in Chemistry laboratory often do not fulfil the mandatory standardsand requirements. Chemicals are, in many cases, not stored in safe manner and kept under safe custody. It isalso observed that exhaust fans are sometimes not provided in Chemistry laboratory. Mandatory items such aslaboratory coats, goggles and gloves are not used while doing experimental work. Electrical fittings are at timesdone with substandard materials and components. Laboratories are not located with easy and open exits. Fireextinguishers are not installed at desired locations. First aid facilities are inadequate or missing. Medical facilitiesare also found granting on many occasions. All such negligent actions may result in dangerous and unfortunateincidents and need to be attended to urgently. In order to ensure safety of students in Science laboratories, there is an urgent need to look into its different respects and make the following provisions: /circle6Designing of all science laboratories according to necessary norms and standards. /circle6Two wide doors for unobstructed exits from the laboratory. /circle6Adequate number of fire extinguishers near science laboratories. /circle6Periodical checking of vulnerable points in the laboratories in relation to possibility of any mishappening. /circle6Ensuring gas fittings in Chemistry laboratory fulfilling desired norms and standards. /circle6Periodical checking of electrical fittings /circle6Timely and repeated instructions to students for careful handling of chemicals and equipments in the laboratory. /circle6Display of dos and dont's in the laboratory at prominent places. /circle6Safe and secure storage of all chemicals. /circle6Proper labelling and upkeep of chemicals. /circle6Proper safety and protection provisions such as fume hood, goggles and gloves while doing practicalwork. /circle6Careful supervision of students while doing practical work. /circle6Advance precautionary arrangements to meet any emergency situations. /circle6Conduct of any additional experimental work only under supervision and with due advance permission. /circle6Availability of First Aid and basic medical facilities in the school. /circle6Proper location of the laboratories. The tragic fire incident in a school at Kumbakonam in 2004 is still afresh in which nearly 100 children lost their precious lives. The Board had issued a detailed Circular no. 28/2004 dated 26th July, 2004 asking schoolsto take all safety measures for meeting adverse situations and ensuring safe custody of children in the school.

Some schools are organizing suchprogrammes by naming it as an integrated school programme that teaches both CBSE syllabus and preparestudents for various entrance examinations to mislead the students and their parents. The premises of CBSE schools should not be used for any commercial activity. Every school should ensure devotion of minimum periods for teaching various subjects as per the syllabi and course prescribed by theBoard. No coaching classes or parallel classes should be run in the school that consumes and affects the regulartime table of the school or that deviates the focus of students from regular course of study.

CBSE/ACAD/VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS/2009 14th July 2009 Circular No: 24 All the Heads of the institutions Affiliated to CBSE. SUBJECT: VIOLENCE AND RAGGING IN SCHOOLS AFFILIATED TO CBSE Dear Principal, It has been observed that ragging has raised its ugly head in schools and the recent violence reported in a prestigious institution is a matter of shock and grave concern. Ragging is any disorderly conduct whether by words, spoken or written or by an act with the effect of teasing, treating or handling with rudeness any other student. It also involves indulging in rowdy or indisciplinedactivities which is likely to cause annoyance or psychological harm or apprehension or fear in any student ordoing any act or performing something which a student will not do in the ordinary course and may cause shameor embarrassment or adversely affect the physique or psyche of one student by another. Ragging is manifested in several aspects such as psychological, social, cultural and academic dimensions. Exploiting the relationship which has an inherent power structure such as between a senior and junior studentfor any of the factors mentioned above will fall under ragging .An act or abuse by spoken words, emails, publicinsults should be considered within the psychological aspects of ragging. Any act which affects the physical,mental, emotional - health, self confidence or self esteem of a student can be categorized as an aspect of ragging. There have often been incidents of physical and sexual abuse in schools which are brushed under the carpet and not reported even to the parents as it may harm the reputation of the institute. This is a dangerous trend andneeds to be stopped immediately. Once these students are left unchecked, they will grow to plague society,hence it is imperative that any act of bullying or abuse, however small must not be allowed to go unnoticed.Moreover the traumatic aftermath of such an incident on the psyche of the victim cannot be undermined as itmay lead to irreversible damage. The onus of preventing any undesirable aspect of ragging rests jointly and individually on all stakeholders which includes the head of the institution, teachers, non teaching staff, students, parents and the local community.A concerted effort by everyone concerned is the need of the hour. The ambience and environment of a school should be warm and amiable where learning can take place meaningfully and students can engage themselves in intellectual, social, physical and cultural pursuits.429 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi What Needs To Be Done? /circle6A Committee, popularly known as Raghavan Committee, constituted by the Supreme Court of India to make suggestions for prevention of ragging in educational institutions has also made a strong casefor regular and periodic psychological counseling sessions for every student in the school. /circle6A school should preferably have a full time Counsellor at each level of schooling such as Primary, Upper-Primary and Secondary/Senior. /circle6At Secondary and Senior Secondary stages at least twenty sessions of psychological counseling mustbe provided to every student in an academic session. Parents and teachers may also be involved in such sessions. /circle6'Health and Wellness Clubs' already constituted by schools should act as monitoring cells for maintaining a constant vigil to promote preventive measures to curb violence in any form. Incase anyact of violence is reported, timely and prompt action must be taken. /circle6Manuals on Life Skills, Comprehensive School Health and Adolescence Education which contain activities on Value Systems , Human Rights , Gender Sensitivity , Self Esteem , Interpersonal Communication , Coping with Stress , Dealing with Anger , Coping with Emotions , Empathy, and Resisting Peer Pressure need to be religiously taken up in the activity periods. These can take the form of Role Plays, Street-Theatre (Nukkad Natak), Group-Discussions, Debates etc. /circle6Peer Educators and Peer Mentors need to be empowered to create awareness and monitor the sensitive zones in schools such as canteens, playgrounds, corridors, bathrooms and dormitories. Any untowardincident must be immediately reported. /circle6Counsellors in all schools and Wardens in boarding and residential schools need to be sensitized to the changing dynamics of student interaction.They should be empathetic and approachable so that studentscan confide in them. The occurrence of such acts has more probability in case of residential schools dueto the amount of time spent together by students. /circle6Role of parents in Parent Teacher Meetings, representation in various other school committees andparticipation in Health Club initiatives must be reinforced. Incase a parent needs to report in confidenceabout any act of bullying, however minor, the Head of the Organisation must put a mechanism in placewhich must also be circulated to parents. /circle6\"No Act of Violence which includes physical or sexual abuse , bullying or Ragging will go unnoticed or unpunished' needs to be clearly stated in the prospectus and other guidelines circulated by the school. Punishment to be meted out incase of a student caught in any act of ragging or bullying shouldalso be clearly spelt out. Parents as well as students need to be aware of the extent of punishmentpossible. /circle6Drastic action should be taken against the ragger without risking the identity of the victim. The victimneeds counseling which may be taken up by a peer mentor or Counselor. /circle6Punishment to be meted out must be commensurate with the gravity of the action. It may vary fromsuspension in attending classes, collective and heavy fine incase of group offenders and even go to Skills are being reflected in the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation Card . Any form of deviant or aggressive behaviour must also be recorded in behavioural terms. Any school which is found to default on any of the above directives will be penalized severely and stringent action to the extent of disaffiliation may be taken against them. In all such cases it is the Head of the Organisationwho will be held accountable. This may be brought to the notice of all the students, teachers and parents.

CBSE/AFF./CIRCULARS/2009 29th July, 2009 Circular No. 02 All the Heads of the Institutions Affiliated to CBSE. Subject: Restriction in the use of Mobile Phones in Schools. Dear Principal, The ubiquitous Mobile Phone has seeped into the lives of every individual irrespective of whether they are students, teachers, professionals or others. It is imperative for us to reflect on this over dependence ontechnological interventions which can have both positive and negative impacts. The use of Mobile Phones definitely needs to be restricted in school environments. The Board is of the opinion that all stakeholders connected with school education such as students, parents, teachers and heads ofinstitutes need to arrive at a consensus on the use of mobile phones in their schools and restricting its entry inthe school campus. This is because mobile phones can be a serious cause of distraction, lack of concentration,anxiety, fear and sometimes even misuse. Even if the mobiles are in silent mode they can be a source of disturbancewithin the classroom as students can make use of Short Messaging Service (SMS) during the class or evenduring an assignment. The cameras which are a common feature now in most mobile phones can also bemisused. There have been enough lessons that have been learnt in the past regarding the use of mobile phones and the Board strongly recommends that students should be convinced about not carrying mobile phones to the school.The principal, teachers and other staff should also not be seen using the mobile in classrooms, playgrounds,common areas, laboratories and other parts of the school premises. The school authorities may provide land line telephone/s from where the teachers and students can make calls in need and emergency, if necessary. There could be a centralized system of receiving and recording callsfor teachers and students of the school. This may be brought to the notice of all teachers, other staff, students and parents so that a more meaningful learning atmosphere can be created in the classroom which makes for a better ambience and school environment.

Dear Principals, Further to our Circular No. 45 dated 29th Oct.,2008 where schools were advised vide Annexure (enclosed) to ensure that no child with special needs is denied admission in main stream schools, it has been observed thatthere are many schools affiliated to CBSE which are not abiding by this directive. There seems to be a misconception among schools and school authorities on various issues pertaining to children with special needs. The children with special needs face challenges in learning as they may not be ableto focus on the teacher during classroom interaction or their pace of learning may vary. Moreover social skillsand emotional skills may need to be further strengthened. To overcome these problems generally an aid is given to the child. An aid is an adult sitting along with the special child encouraging and motivating the child to move alongwith the class. Schools are advised to allow parents when they make a request to provide an aid so that individual attention is possible for the child and enables the student to grow and learn alongwith the other peers in the class. Further inclusive education also needs to be done with an Individual Evaluation Program. Specific goals should be set for each child with special need based upon the appraisal. For this purpose the schoolsneed to have a special educator as has already been recommended earlier. It is being reiterated that any school which fails to provide attention to a child with special needs or makes a pretext of denying admission to any category of a differently abled child will be liable to stringent action evento the extent of disaffiliation. The Guidelines on Inclusive Education of Children with Disabilities is once again enclosed for dissemination to all stakeholders which includes parents of the school. Yours sincerely (VINEET JOSHI) SECRETARY & CHAIRMAN Encl: Guidelines on Inclusive Education of Children with Disabilities433 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi Annesure Guidelines of Inclusive Education of Children with Disabilities (IECD) each school is advised : 1.

Sharma) Consultant, CBSE439 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi CBSE SCIECNE EXHIBTION 2010 Guidelines for preparation of Exhibits and Models The importance of every sub-theme in the context of main theme and a number of suggestions for designing the exhibits/projects are give below. However, these ideas are only suggestive. Participants are free to developexhibits based on other related ideas of their choice. Sub-Theme 1: Climate change-causes and consequences Climate change is emerging as perhaps the greatest environmental challenge of the 21st century. Scientists are concerned that global warming caused by human activities has overtaken natural fluctuations in climate andthat this is having serious consequences for people and the planet earth. It can upset the delicate ecologicalbalance of the earth and its living organisms. Data of tree growth, tropical air temperature and carbon dioxideemission collected over 16 years indicate that a warming climate may cause the tropical forests to give off morecarbon dioxide than they take up. The main objective of this sub-theme is to foster awareness about the causes and consequences of climate change and to help children become environmentally and socially responsible global citizens. The exhibits/models in this sub-theme may pertain to: /circle6studies of impact of climate change on agriculture /circle6energy foot-print and methods to reduce greenhouse gases. /circle6conditions of drought, flood, famine and effective measures required to combat them /circle6activities that add/reduce carbon dioxide in atmosphere/demonstrate balancing of carbon cycle. /circle6estimating one's carbon footprint on the globe /circle6measure to control air/water pollution/various methods of air/water purification/effect of pollution onliving beings. and development of automatic weather-recording devices. /circle6use of eco-friendly and innovative devices that may help in combating climate change. Sub-theme 2: Green Energy The term 'green energy' is used for those energy sources which are considered to be environment friendly. The term is synonymous with widely accepted term 'renewable energy'. These energy sources are perceived toproduce fewer pollutants and result in lower environmental pollution and carbon emission. Some of the renewablesources of energy in India are solar energy, wind energy hydroelectric energy, Biomass energy etc. The main objective of this sub-theme is to make children feel the need to study and analyse various aspects of green energy-its generation, transmission, distribution and effective management. technologies such as solar water heater, solar lighting system, heating system of a building etc. /circle6green bricks using waste material/different innovative materials for furniture/construction/road laying. /circle6innovative designs of solar cooker/solar distiller/solar dryer for food processing/solar heated houses. /circle6solar thermal electricity/community solar project /circle6wind turbines for domestic use. /circle6various ways of harressing geothermal energy. /circle6use of tidal waves/ocean currents/salinity gradient for generating electricity /circle6production of electrical energy from mechanical energy/nuclear resources. /circle6energy from biomass /circle6improved designs of biogas/biomass plant /circle6designs/models of fuel efficient automobiles/machines /circle6innovations in mechanism of extraction storage and processing of fossil fuels. Sub-theme-3: Biology in Human welfare The understanding of biological phenomenon and principles have led to the innovations and development of a number of technologies for the benefit of mankind. The fields of agriculture, medical sciences, geneticmanipulations, study of microorganisms, all have immensely benefited from these developments leading to thebenefit of everyone. The main objective of this sub-theme is to sensitise children about the overall implications and contributions of the biological phenomenon and living organisms for the benefit and welfare of mankind.

Computers are being increasingly connected through local areas as well as global networks. Information of every conceivable topic of humaninterest is being put up on the internet by individuals and institutions. Use of fax, mobile phone, email, havebecome a common day affair in all walks of life. To live and work in information rich technological society,children should be exposed to experiences that encourage them to value the ever increasing capacity of informationand communication technology and to appreciate its role in human affairs. The main objective of this sub-theme is promoting innovations in knowledge networks involving information and communication technology in all segments of society. Children need to reason and communicate to solveproblems and to understand effective use of information and communication technology for a variety of purposes.The exhibits/model in this sub-theme may pertain to: /circle6demonstrating how the information in any of the areas mentioned above can be accessed. /circle6demonstrating the principle and functioning of modern devices of communication, such as televisionand radio, mobile phone, fax, email, internet etc. and accessing and downloading information fromthem. /circle6efficient use of multimedia in making the teaching-learning process more interesting and effective/inenhancing creativity of children and teachers. /circle6designs for making existing operation of communication more efficient /circle6showing the use of information technology for preservation and conservation of soil/water managementand mapping of water resources. /circle6developing innovative designs/models of multimedia equipments/materials and packages for childrenwith special needs. /circle6technologies in forecasting and warning of cyclones, floods and storms. /circle6use of geo-stationary satellites in providing information pertaining to meterological processes. Sub-theme 5: Mathematics and Everyday Life The world of Mathematics provides us with an unlimited scope to perceive problems pertaining to three situations visualized in the form of concrete, abstraction and intuition. It also deals with data, measurementsand observations from Science, mathematical models of natural phenomenon including human behaviour andsocial systems. As a science of abstract objects, mathematics relies on logic rather than on observation as itsstandard of truth, yet employs observation, simulation and even experimentation as means of discovering truth.The subject offers distinctive model of thoughts which are versatile and powerful, including mathematicalmodeling, optimization, logical analysis, inference from data and use of symbols. It also gives an exactness inthinking and provides a quantitative approach. To encourage and stimulate students' interest in Mathematics, some of the mathematical principles being transacted at school stage with their applications in every day life need to form the basis of projects/exhibitsunder this sub-theme.442 to: /circle6principles of sequence and series in several spheres of human activities viz., calculating the amount of money over certain period of time under given rate of simple interest or compound interest/findingdepreciated or increased value of a certain commodity over a period of time /circle6determining expenditures needed for manufacturing water tank/rectangular box/cylindrical/cone shapedobjects of a certain material provided cost of material per square/cube/unit are given /circle6determining perimeter, area of a region bounded by polygons/the circumference and area of circularregion/surface area and volume of cube/cuboid/cylinder/cone/sphere/hemisphere of solid when twobasic solids are joined together. /circle6analytical tools such as conics used in designing parabolic reflectors in automobile head lights/suspensionof cable bridges/loud speakers in radio. /circle6estimating/calculating size of windows/doors/rooms in schools and homes/estimating number of plantslying in a particular flower bed/ calculating height of a building/tree /circle6applications of linear programming in solving problems pertaining to manufacturing of goods/transport/diet issues /circle6use of triangles/making geometrical designs on a table cover (for example, in a circular table of certainradius, a design is formed leaving an equilateral triangle in the middle and finding the area of thedesign); /circle6establishing a mathematical relation by considering all possible parameters to have maximum profit inproducing certain items by a factory. Sub-theme 6: Science and Technology in Games and Sports Games and sports too have benefited from the advancements in the field of Science and Technology.

The convergence of computer, communication and contenttechnologies, being known as ICT, have attracted attention of academia, business, government and communitiesto use it for innovating profitable propositions. ICT has permeated in every walk of life affecting the fields suchas launching satellites, managing businesses across the globe and also enabling social networking. Year by yearit is becoming simpler to use devices such as desktop palm top, iPod etc. In its vision, the national Policy on ICT in School Education by MHRD Govt. of India states \"The ICT policy in School Education aims at preparing youth to participate creatively in the establishment, sustenanceand growth of a knowledge society leading to all around social economic development of the nation and globalcompetitiveness\". The policy envisages three stages of ICT implementation at school level - ICT literacy andCompetency Enhancement, ICT enabled teaching - learning and introduction of ICT related elective subjects atSenior Secondary level. The National Curriculum Framework 2005 (NCF 2005) has also highlighted theimportance of ICT in school education. With this backdrop, major paradigm shift is imperative in educationcharacterized by technology enabled instructions, collaborative learning, multidisciplinary problem-solvingand promoting critical thinking skills. Government of India has announced 2010-2020 as the decade of innovation. Reasoning and Critical thinking skills are necessary for innovation. Foundation of these skills is laid at school level. It is desirable that affordableICT tools and techniques should be integrated into classroom instructions right from primary stage so as toenable students develop their requisite skills. In CBSE circular number 07 dated 22 Feb 2010 it has been stated that the NCERT is contemplating to exploit the potential of WWW for improving the quality of Mathematics teaching in schools. The CBSE wouldlike to extend it to all subjects and all classes. At Primary and Upper Primary level, focus may be on simple access to information and trying to compile different views and analyze them to conclude in one's own way. At the Secondary level, gathering and structuringof data and computing to arrive at some reports may be taken up in any subject, not necessarily Science andMathematics. At the Senior Secondary level, when students are so exposed, they will get highly motivated to451 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi use ICT tools for taking up complex, multidisciplinary problems such as Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, Environmental Science, Forensic Science, Nanotechnology, Business Intelligence etc. This may necessitatecomputing tools and techniques of generic nature as well as domain specific. This is the time when the studentsand the teachers together will work in global competitive environment. The schools affiliated to the CBSE have been at the forefront of adopting the most modern innovations and practices to ensure there is a continuous enhancement in the overall quality of teaching and learning. The CBSEbelieves that it must bring the immense benefits of ICT and computing technology to every classroom across itsfraternity of affiliated schools to improve academic outcomes of learners and to enhance the productivity ofteachers in classrooms. This can be done by encouraging the use of technology in classroom teaching - learningand instant assessment which shall also go a long way in supporting its CCE initiative as well. CCE in the right spirit entails periodic assessments which are integrated effectively in the classroom teaching and learning. In fact all assessments must inform teaching. Using technology helps to create interest amonglearners as, e.g., a quiz may be done online as part of formative assessment. Technology can greatly assistteachers in classrooms to teach difficult and abstract subject matter concepts effectively if the right digitalinstruction materials, supporting technology infrastructure and intensive training is provided to the teachers tosupport instruction. As a note of caution, sometimes teachers are focused more on the new technology than on what students should be learning. The focus on interactivity as a technical process can lead to some relatively mundaneactivities being over-valued. One must realize that, technology is a tool to improve student learning. It can motivate and sustain student interest and reinforce learning, offer self-paced practice and create high-interest learning environment. However,technology cannot replace the teacher on quality teacher-student relationship. It cannot make a bad teacher intoa good teacher, but it can help a good teacher become an even better and more productive teacher. Setting up a classroom equipped with LCD projector and facility for computer mediated instructions of the type will aid the teacher in developing a quality teaching learning environment. Specifically such classroommust have: a. A projection or display device which can project a sufficiently large image to be viewed by every student in the classroom with causing eyestrain. b. An electronic interactive white board system c. Computer with UPS system d. Education content library mapped to CBSE curriculum topics covering all major subjects across all grades. e. Electronic Response system for each student to enable real time assessment f. Resource person to help teachers on a day to day basis to use the digital classroom systems. As a first step in this direction, all CBSE affiliated schools are advised to setup at least one classroom for each class in their schools equipped with technology to enable usage of digital instruction materials in the452 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh classroom so that students are given adequate exposure to digital materials. Schools are encouraged to progressively move to enabling each classroom with technology for usage of digital materials in the classroom. Students may be encouraged to form Creative Computing Club to try out innovative applications without any stress and compulsion. For future, schools can plan to setup every year more such classrooms prompt actionand reporting by schools in this direction will be highly appreciated by CBSE.

Thanking you, 2011 Guidelines for preparation of Exhibits and Models In order to facilitate the preparation of exhibits and models for display and the organization of State Level Science Exhibitions during 2011, six subthemes have been identified. These are: 1. Biodiversity: Conservation and Sustenance;2. Agriculture and technology;3. Green Energy;4. Transport and Communication;5. Community Health and Environment; and6. Mathematical Modeling. The importance of each subtheme in the context of the main theme and number of ideas for development of exhibits are given below. However, these ideas are only suggestive. Participants are free to develop exhibitsbased on other related ideas of their choice. Sub-Theme 1: Biodiversity: Conservation and Sustenance Biodiversity (or biological diversity) refers to variability of living organisms of terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems. Entire aspect of biodiversity can be grouped in three categories i.e, Genetic Diversity(variations of genes within the organisms of a species), Species Diversity (variation of species within a region)and Ecosystem Diversity (variation in the form of vegetation and other wild life in a broad ecosystem). Humanhas always been the greatest beneficiary of the biodiversity as it provides food, medicines and industrial products.It is estimated that the total number of species variety of different living forms are around 10 millions. Out ofsuch an enormous number, only 1.5 millions have been identified so far. Such a variety of living organisms isimportant from the point of view of sustenance of life forms on earth. All these varieties of various life formshave coevolved over the period of time since the origin of life on earth. The variety of different species, theirhabitats and ecosystem help maintaining a balance of life forms as well as resources on earth. A drastic changein the habitat or ecosystem leads to depletion in the variety of species and also extinction. Thus protection and conservation of biodiversity is not only important from the point of view of fulfillment of our need, rather it is equally or even more important for the very survival of human and other living organismson the earth. Also, we need to understand the concept of a strong, safe and secure nation. For this, we must notforget the aspects of a healthy, productive and safe environment besides food, education, economy and nationalsecurity.

Physical situation need some physical insight into the problem. Then it is solvedby using various mathematical tools like percentage, area, surface area, volume, time and work, profit and loss,differential equations, probability, statistics, linear, nonlinear programming, etc. It is a multistep process involvingidentifying the problem, constructing or selecting appropriate models, fighting out what data need to be collected,deciding number of variables and predictors to be chosen for greater accuracy, testing validity of models,calculating solution and implementing the models. It may be an iterative process where we start from a crudemodel and gradually refine it until it is suitable for solving the problem and enables us to gain insight andunderstanding of the original situation. It is an art, as there can be a variety of distinct approaches to the modeling,as well as science, for being tentative in nature. In mathematical modeling, we neither perform any practical activity nor interact with the situation directly, e.g. we do not take any sample of blood from the body to know the physiology, and still our mathematical toolsreveal the actual situations. The rapid development of high speed computers with the increasing desire for theanswers of everyday life problems have led to enhanced demands of modeling almost every area. The objectiveof this subtheme is to help children to analyse how mathematical modeling can be used to investigate objects,events systems and processes.

You are aware that class XlI & X examinations are to begin from lst March, 2008. Through this letter, I want to invite your attention to some of the critical issues that have a bearing on people's trust in ourexamination system. It is our bounden duty to sustain this trust. 2. Firstly, it is essential that the conduct of examination does not appear to be fair only but should enjoy the complete confidence and trust of the public at large. This is an onerous task. It would demand wholehearted dedication of functionaries at various levels involved in the examination. I hope, we will dischargeour responsibilities in a team spirit no matter wherever we happen to be placed. 3. Linked with the conduct of examinations are the perceptions & reactions, about the question papers administered in different subjects. These reactions are received from the diversified groups spread allover the country and also from abroad: Interest groups, more so the schools and the students have everyright to air their views on the quality of question papers administered. But this right puts an addedresponsibility on them to see that the observations and comments are not made to gain cheap popularity.Rather these should be made to strengthen the System. We should also keep in mind that duringexaminations, examinees are under heavy stress and anxiety and our adverse views on the questionpapers through different media often upset them in their preparations of future examinations. It wouldtherefore. be advisable that the schools should send their reactions and perception- direct to the Boardinstead of expressing them to the media. 4. To give a fair deal to the comments on the question papers and redress the genuine grievances of568 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh students, CBSE has developed an Observation Schedule, a copy of which is enclosed. In case you have your observations about a question paper, these may please be recorded and forwarded as per directionscontained therein within twenty four hours of the conduct of examination of the subject concerned sothat these observations could be considered by the expert group while preparing the marking scheme. 5. Careful marking of scripts and timely declaration of result is our paramount concern. To ensure this we need quality examiners in adequate numbers. It has been observed in the past that some schools underone pretext or the other do not relieve the teachers for evaluation work and the Board has to remindthem in the midst of the evaluation work. This is an undesirable practice. I would, therefore, appeal toyou to relieve your teachers for evaluation work instead of complaining about the quality of markingsubsequently. Teachers selected for evaluation work must report on the appointed date and time. This isessential because on the first day. Marking Schemes are studied, discussed and clarified to the examiners.Non-release ofteachers may compel the Board to delay the declaration of result of the defaultingInstitutions and also initiate disaffiliation proceedings. 6. I request you to participate willingly and not reluctantly. Rather advise your teachers to be regular and very serious in marking as it amounts to professional judgement on 10 to 12 years of hard work put inby the Examinees. If you happen to be the Head Examiner/Additional Head Examiner please ensurethat the sample checking of answer books of each evaluator is just not a routine. It should conform tothe Marking Scheme so that it provides academic guidance to the evaluators for objective and unifonnevaluation. 7. For 2008 Examinations, some new instructions have been provided in the Guidelines to the Centre Superintendents/Guidelines for Spot Evaluation. You are requested to kindly read these instructionscarefully, I am enclosing a compiled list of these instructions as Annexure 'A' for your ready reference.In the end, I once again request you to please extend your willing co-operation to the Board in thesmooth and fair conduct of examinations. I am sure, with your active support we shall be able to preservethe sanctity of the system and avoid criticism. Needless to mention that we all are custodian of examinees'faith and we have to preserve it at all cost. With warm regards. Yours sincerely, (M.C.

This language has to be in consonance with the overall spirit of theThree Language Formula prescribed by the Board. Besides one language, they have the option of offering anyfour of the following subjects: Mathematics, Science, Social Science, another language, Music, Painting, Home Science, Introductory Information Techlolory, Commerce (Elements of Business) & Commerce (Elements of Book Keepingand Accountancy). It has been observed that blind candidates want to study subjects like Music, Home Science etc., but these candidates are deprived of offering these subjects because most of the schools don't have affiliation for thesesubjects. In order to facilitate the blind candidates the Board has decided that subjects which are not available inthe school can be offered by the blind candidates and they can study these subjects privately as subjects ofextended learning.

Sir As you are aware in the Financial Markets Management (FMM) course, one of the 3 compulsory papers for skill building I professional competency development is titled Introduction to Financial Markets-I. One of the very strong salient features of FMM is development of ernployable skills. The success of FMM will depend upon whether students on completion of this course are able to acquire necessary competence andskills for financial markets. In Stock and Commodity Markets, both speed and accuracy are extremely important. Due to globalisation, entry of FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors), instant spread of information (impacting the share prices) throughelectronic and print media such as T.V . channels, Internet, introduction of futures and options, the share andcommodity markets have become highly volatile. This calls for executing the buy, I sell orders at high speed totake advantage of best rates (lowest while buying and highest while selling). However, while it is important to execute orders with speed, the accuracy while entering an order cannot be ignored. The loss from a wrong entry of a buy or sell order can cause very serious financial loss to the client(s)ranging from few hundreds to lakhs or crores depending upon the quantity and pice of a scrip. Therefore, stockand commodity markets require 100% accuracy while entering orders. As required by CBSE, BLB Institute of Financial Markets (BIFM) has developed a mock trading software called TiadeSense TM. The TradeSenseTM has been designed to develop practieal skills of speed and accuracy in stock market through step by step process. This will be achieved by a modular approach through 6 modules, 3each for 11th & 1st class respectively. Modules for llth Class 1. Numeric Speed Booster (NSB): To help students gain command in finger setup on Numeric Pad.2. Tiade Function Builder (TFB): To help students develop speed and accuracy without trading.3. Precision Builder (PB): To build order trading.574 f'k{kk cksMZ] feature of TradeSenseTM is a large number of user friendly reports for the students as well as school principals. It is also possible for the CBSE and NSE to monitor the progress of all the schools andstudents through TradeSense software. At CBSE Headquarters, we also monitor the progress of developrnent of practical skills through TradeSense software. It is found that the progress of some of the schools/students is not satisfactory and they are not givingadequate attention for practical. This being a skill orientecl course without devoting required time of 60 hoursof practical, FMM will fail, defeating the very purpose of launching this course. In view of the above, it is advised that school should conduct the practical examination only after each of the student has practiced at east for 60 hours. Schools can conduct the practicai exarninaticn through TradeSense TM software as per detailed procedure given in the software itself, The practical examination will consist of 3 partsas given below: S. Module Time Max. Pass No. (Minutes) Marks Marks 1. Multiple Choice Questions 10 10 3 2. Trade Function Builder 10 15 5 3. Precision Builder 10 15 5 Total 30 40 30 l.Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): Written multiple choice questicns (MCQs) of 10 Marks. This can be conducted by schools themselves. 1(a) Salient Features of the NEAT - 5 Marks /circle6 Key Functions /circle6 Buy, Sell, Order Modification (OM) & Order Cancellation (OC) 1(b) Introduction to Trading Systems - 5 Marks /circle6 BSE Tiading System: Bombay Online Trading System (BOLT) /circle6 NSE Trading System: National Exchange For Automated Trading (NEAT) /circle6 Open Dealer Integrated Network Trading system (ODIN) As per the existing procedure schools who have introduced FMM can promote students from 11th to 12th class, pending holding of online examination by NSE called NCFM Financial Markets - Beginner's Modulebetween 15th May to 30th June. During teacher's training at BLB Institute of Financial Markets, teachers haveinformed that the students could not devote required 60 hours for practical due to various reasons such as newsubject internet non availability, lack of trained manpower etc. In view of the above for proper skill development, the practical exarnination can be conducted befcre 30th Jure 2008, as in the case of NCFM examination. Students of FMM can appear/re-appear for practical examinationafter devoting a minimum of 60 hours of practical on Trade Sense.

The students who have not completed a regular course of study i.e, havenot completed 75% of attendance in Class X/XII are not eligible to appear for the Board's Examination of ClassXD([I Given below is the relevant extract of Rule l3.2 of the Examination Bye-laws.No student from a School affiliated to the Board shall be eligible to take the examination unless he has completed 75% af attenadances counted from the appearing of class IX/X/XI/XII upto the first of the monthpreceding the month in which the examination commences in the subjects of internal assessment. It is pertinent to mention here that every year in the month of February, even in the first week of March i.e. at the time of commencement of Board's Exam, the Board starts receiving requests from large number ofcandidates/schools requesting the Chairman to condone the shortage of attendance. It is further stated thatshortage up to 15% of attendance only may be condoned by the Chairman on the recommendation of thePrincipal of the School. The candidates/parents while representing the matter to the Board invariably state thattheir school has never informed them about the shortage of attendance. In view of above, I am writing to request you to bring the above essential condition of completion of 75% attendance to the notice of all the candidates and their parents whose names have been sponsored by your576 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh school for Board's Examination-2009. In those cases where students are not regularly attending the schools for various different reasons whatsoever may be, the rule position of the Board must be brought to their notice inwriting. An immediate action in the matter would be appreciated and the parents and students be informed that in the case of shortage of attendance without valid reasons, they would not be permitted to appear for Board'sexamination. We are sure that once the students are aware of the necessity of completing 75% of attendance,majority of students would certainly attend the classes regularly. This would reduce large number of requestsfor condonation at the last minute. Kind1y acknowledge receipt.

In step two, the mock exerciseis actually conducted where the students, teachers along with the non-teaching staff take part. At the end of steptwo, gaps are identified during a detailed debriefing session and follow-up action is taken. The schools which are interested in taking up this initiative may contact Brig (Dr.) B.K. Khanna, Senior Specialist (Training and Capacity Development), NDMA at bkkhanna2@gmail.com or his mobileno.09911297972.

You are aware that class X & XII examinations are to begin from 1st March, 2011. Through this letter, I want to invite your attention to some of the critical issues that have a bearing on people's trust in ourexamination system. It is our bounden duty to sustain this trust. 2. Firstly, it is essential that the conduct of examination does not appear to be fair only but should enjoythe complete confidence and trust of the public at large. This is an onerous task. It would demand wholehearted dedication of functionaries at various levels involved in the examination. I hope, we will dischargeour responsibilities in a team spirit no matter wherever we happen to be placed. 3. Linked with the conduct of examinations are the perceptions & reactions about the question papers administered in different subjects. These reactions are received from the diversified groups spread allover the country and also from abroad. Interest groups, more so the schools and the students have everyright to air their views on the quality of question papers administered. But this right puts an addedresponsibility on them to see that the observations and comments are not made to gain cheap popularity.Rather these should be made to strengthen the system. We should also keep in mind that duringexaminations, examinees are under heavy stress and anxiety and our adverse views on the questionpapers through different media, often upset them in their preparations of future examinations. It would,therefore, be advisable that schools should send their reactions and perceptions direct to the Boardinstead of expression them to the media. 4. To give a fair deal to the comments on the question papers and redress the genuine grievances of students, CBSE has developed an Observation Schedule, a copy of which is enclosed in case you have633 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi your observations about a question paper, these may please be recorded and forwarded as per directions contained therein within twenty four hours of the conduct of examination of the subject concerned so that these observations could be considered by the expert group while preparing the marking scheme.You are aware that with the introduction of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation w.e.f.2009-2011 session, the first batch of class X student will be appearing for the 2011 examination.The Board will be having two sets of students appearing for the Summative Assessment II - oneset appearing for Board conducted and the second set appearing for school conducted SummativeAssessment II. The observations on the question paper administered for Board conductedSummative Assessment II should onlybe sent to the board within twenty four hours of the conductof the examination of the subject concerned. 5. Careful marking of script and timely declaration of results in our paramount concern. To ensure this we need quality examiners in adequates numbers. It has been observed in the past that some Schools underour pretext or the other do not relieve the teachers for evaluation work and the Board has to remindthem in the midst of the evaluation work. This is an undesirable practice. I would, therefore, appeal toyou to relieve your teachers for evaluation work instead of complaining about the quality of markingsubsequently. Teachers selected for evaluation work must report on the appointed data and time. This is essential because of the first day, Marking Schemes are studied, discussed and clarified tothe examiners. Non-release of teachers may compel the Board to delay the declaration of result ofthe defaulting institutions and also initiate disaffiliation proceedings. 6. I request you to participate willinglyand not reluctantly. Rather advise your teachers to be regular and very serious in making as it amounts to professional judgement on 10 to 12 years of hard work put in bythe examinees. If you happen to be the Head Examiner/Additional Head Examiner please ensure thatthe sample checking of answer books of each evaluator is just not a routine. It should conform to theMarking Scheme so that it provides academic guidance to the evaluators for objective and uniformevaluation. 7. In order to preserve the sanctity of the system and avoid criticism, I request the principals appointed as Chief Nodal Supervisors to provide logistic and administrative support to the Head Examiners and alsoto ensure that the answer books are evaluated as per the instructions/marking scheme(s) provided by theBoard. 8. For 2011 examinations, some new instructions have been provided in the Guidelines for the Centre Superintendents/Guidelines for Spot Evaluation. You are requested to kindly read these instructionscarefully, I am enclosing a compiled list of these instructions as annexure 'A' for your ready reference. In the end, I once again request you to please extend your willing co-operation to the Board in the smooth and fair conduct of examinations. I am sure, with your active support we shall be able to preserve the sanctity ofthe system and avoid criticism. Needles to mention that we all the custodian of examinees faith and we have topreserve it at all cost.

As you are aware, the Central Board of Secondary Education has introduced Examination Reforms and Continuous & Comprehensive Evaluation(CCE) in i t s schools since last academic year 2009-10 and thedetailed scheme has already been intimated to all Heads of schools vide CBSE's previous circulars. 2. The scheme is in operation in all CBSE affiliated schools in Class IX since last year. As per the scheme, four Formative Assessments and two Summative Assessments would be held in an academic year. The first SummativeAssessment (SA-I) for this term for Classes IX and X has been conducted in the second half of September,2010. 3. Under the School Based Summative Assessment-II, the students will be tested internally based on the following criteria: a) Syllabus and Examination Question Paper Design in different subjects for Classes IX and X Summative Assessment will be the same as circulated by the Board earlier. The same is also available on CBSEwebsite www.cbse.nic.in under CCE corner. b) As was done earlier, the Summative Assessment-II will be in the form of a pen-paper test conducted by the schools themselves. c) In order to ensure standards, the Question Paper Bank in different subjects would be sent by the Board so as to reach schools well in time. d) Evaluation of answer scripts will be done by the school teachers themselves on the basis of the Marking Scheme provided by the Board. The school may use the Sahodaya School Cluster for spot evaluation sothat teachers from other schools are also involved, if they so wish.639 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi e) There will be random verification of the assessment procedures of schools by the Board officials/nominees appointed by the Board. 4. It has been decided to provide Question Paper Banks for English Communicative, English Language & Literature, Hindi-A, Hindi-B, Mathematics, Science, Social Science and Communicative Sanskrit. In respect ofother subjects/languages, the schools will administer their own question papers based on Sample QuestionPaper pattern available on the Board's website. 5. The Board will be sending separate CDs containing Question Paper Banks for Classes IX & X and the school may: i) pick up one question paper for each subject, OR mix and match the paper by using different questions/sections from different sets of question papers and prepare a question paper based on Board's sample paper, design and blue print, OR prepare their own question papers as per sample paper, design and blue print available on CBSE's website (www.cbse.nic.in). However, in case the school prepares its own question papers, the questionpapers and marking scheme so prepared should be emailed to the Board (email id: cbsecceqp@gmail.com) for verification within a week of conduct of the respective papers. ii) For Class IX, the Board plans to dispatch the CDs containing question papers to all schools so as to reach by 20t h February, 2011. iii) For Class X, the Board plans to dispatch the CDs containing question papers to all schools so as to reach by 07t h March, 2011. iv)Every School, Sahodaya Clusters or City may design their own date sheet for Classes IX and X examination accordingly. 6. The schools need to take out the print of the desired question paper (refer para 5 above) and, thereafter, the required number of prints/copies may be made at the school level. These question papers must be kept carefully. 7.The schools will conduct the SA-II for Class IX during the first half of March, 2011; the SA-II for Class-X will be conducted during the second half of March, 2011. Moreover, it may be ensured that in case of Summative Assessment-II for Class X, the dates for the subjects of English (Communicate/Language & Literature) and Science are kept after 23 rd March, 2011. 8. Another CD containing the Marking Scheme of the main subjects would be sent to every school separately in due course and wi l l reach the schools well in time. 9. The answer books should be evaluated by teachers as per the marking scheme provided by the Board.10. KINDLY NOTE THAT ANSWER BOOKS OF SCHOOL BASED SA-II FOR CLASSES IX AND X SHOULD NOT BE SENT TO THE BOARD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. However these must be preserved and kept in the safe custody at the school for at least a period of three years (in case of Class IX) andtwo years (in case of Class X) along with question papers and Marking Scheme for any verification by theBoard subsequently. 11. It may be noted again that the question papers for Classes IX and X have been designed by the Board and640 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh are being sent to schools with the purpose of maintaining standards. Depending upon the feedback and suggestions from the stakeholders, the Board may reconsider this policy in future, if need be. IMPORTANT: KINDLY NOTE THAT SCHOOLS WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE THE MARKS OF SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT - II TO THE CANDIDATES OF CLASS X UNDER ANYCIRCUMSTANCES. AS PER THE SCHEME LAID DOWN AND COMMUNICATED EARLIER, THE BOARD WOULD BE DECLARING THE RESULTS OF THE CANDIDATES OF CLASS X IN THE MONTH OF MAYALONG WITH THE RESULTS OF BOARD BASED SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT-II, AND WILL BEISSUING THE UNIFORM CERTIFICATE TO EVERY STUDENT.

In order to facilitate the schools to understand the philosophy behind the concept of MathematicsLaboratory the Board had also issued \"Guidelines to Schools for Mathematics Laboratory\". The objectives behind the introduction of Mathematics Laboratory were: 1. The fear for study of Mathematics should be diffused.2. The learning of Mathematics should be made more pragmatic and life-oriented at the school level.3. There is a need to improve the pedagogy in Mathematics to enhance analyical and critical thinking.4. The learning of Mathematics could be linked with other subjects to develop interdisciplinary thinking.5. The tools and instruments for practical verification of mathematical concepts could be locally designed by innovative methods. 6. The students could be evaluated on their mathernatical skills by continuous and comprehensive evaluation. This book brought various methods of by which the learning of Mathematics could be more pragmatic and interesting. The efforts made by the Board are only suggestive and not prescriptive. This facilitates the schoolsand teachers to make their own models and designs so that the interest and aptitude in the study and perforrnancein Mathematics could be improved. The Board recommends that all the affiliated schools should immediately make necessary initiatives to start the Mathematics Laboratory for classes III to VIII and integrate the evaluation of practical competencies inMathematics in the evaluation of the subject. The Board expects all the affiliated schools to have their MathematicsLaboratories ready by 31st March, 2005 in order that the future strategies in this regard could be put in place.The Board intends to extend the evaluation of these competencies as apart of its internal continuous andcomprehensive evaluation at the secondary stage shortly. The irnmediate initiatives taken by the schools to set up Mathenraties latroratories would give enough and669 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi adequate time for them to plant their future strategies. It will give further scope for extending these facilities to the secondary classes also so that the internal evaluation in Mathematics at the secondary stage becomes possible. Given the fact that enormous academic resources are available in the country the schools should tap the local resources in developing a meaning and tool for the concept development pedagogy and evaluation in thissubject. The Board looks forward to fresh and newer initiatives to make the leaining of Mathematics morepurposeful, integrated and pragmatic. The Board would be happy to receive short profiles of the initiatives taken by the schools in this regard over a period of time so that the experiences can be shared with the larger school community.

The schools are now requested toinform whether they have the facilities of Mathematics Laboratory or not. In continuation of the above circular, I am pleased to forward to you the decision of the Board to intoduce the concept of practical activities in Mathematics Laboratory and this will be a part of internal assessment inMathematics in secondary classes. The suggestions detailed in the enclosed circular would be applicable for thestudents of class XI from the academic year 2005-06 and for the students of class X appearing in the examinationsof March 2007. You are requested to bring it to the notice of all concerned for necessary action. Yours faithfully, G Balasubramanian Director (Academics)671 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi Introduction of Mathematics Laboratory and Internal Assessment in Secondary Classes As you are well aware, study of Mathematics has been cental to all leaming systems from time immemorial. As a vital component of the 3R's, emphasis has always been laid on the basic skills of numbers and theirextensive use in giving a form and name to several of the thought pattems of human cognition and understanding.Over the centuries, mathematics has developed as a discipline of study with a focus, a purpose and a scheme.The various inputs to learning of mathematics have aimed at developing certain basic and essential skills for itsuse in daily life as well as in furtherance of knowledge. Over the years, an apparent complexity seems to have appeared in the content and the processes involved in the learning of mathematics especially at the school level. Concepts of mathematics are seen as difficult tounderstand and appreciate, thanks to some myth associated in the transaction of the curriculum. Fear for theleaming of the subject increases the resistance to the learning process. The situation needs to be attended to. Theremedy lies in creating a right ambience for the learning of the subjeet. It lies in redesigning the transaction ofthe curriculum in which the paradigm of learning would help in developing a familiarity and ownership of thesubject. It lies in creating a conducive environntent in the classroom where the learner learns the basic andessential concepts and skills by doing simple activities. It is in this direction, CBSE has endeavored to launchthe idea of Mathematics Laboratory in schools. The Board has instructed all the schools to open a MathematicsLaboratory in their campus to facilitate the effective leaming of Mathematics. Guidelines to schools have beenprepared and sent. What could be done in Mathematics laboratory? Mathematics Laboratory should facilitate in doing simple experiments and projects that would lead to empowerment of the following skills among the learners: /circle6Numerical skills /circle6Observation skills /circle6Thinking skills /circle6Analytical of comparing /circle6Skills of interpretation /circle6Problem solving skills /circle6Decision making skills /circle6Spatial analysis and interpretation /circle6Life skills /circle6Skills of games Many similar skills could be identified and nurtured.672 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh How could the above be achicved? The Board feels that the establishment of a Mathematics Laboratory does not involve a high cost. Most of the above skills could easily be developed by using indigenous materials like paper, sticks, pins, thread, plywood,cardboards and several other simple locally available materials. It is not necessary that the schools shouldalways adopt established result-oriented practical work. The objective of the laboratory is to promote criticalthinking and ability to approach a problem in different ways. It calls for firing the imagination of the learners sothat they are creative and contributive. In all such exercises; the processes are more important than the products.It is therefore essential that our students are exposed to think differently and approach problems without anyfear. It calls for taking the concepts of Mathematics beyond the limitations of the text books. The Board believesthat such open ended approach, if carried out with a sense of sincerity of purpose among the affiliated schoolscould bring about an entirely positive leaming atmosphere in the schools. The space required for doing such exercise is quite limited. Though the schools should endeavor to establish a separate unit for the Mathematics laboratory so that it remains in focus, the absence of adequate space inschools currently should not hinder the cause. A vibrant classroom can also be a temporary MathematicsLaboratory. In case of inadequacy of classrooms, even space/corners in the floors can be dedicated to theMathematics Laboratory. It is the type of work that is being done-that matters more than where exactly it isconducted, though a rightful place for Mathematics laboratory would add a flavour to the cause and the concept. Internal Assessrnent in Mathematics As an extension of the above intent of the Board to make the learning of Mathematics a more purposeful exercise, the Board has decided to provide scope for internal assessment in Mathematics. The need for internalassessment arises from the fact that the motivation, commitnent and the imaginative faculties of the learner inany discipline cannot be evaluated through a one-shot examination at the end of an academic year. It has to beseen through over a period of time and assessed by the teacher who is a witness to the process of growth anddevelopment. It is also felt that the objective is not to merely evaluate a learner in a public examination and award marks, but a paradigm shift to self-actualized learning in the classroom and in the extended hours of schooling. Keepingthis in view the Board has decided to award 20 marks for the intemal assessment of the learners in the secondaryclasses. The distribution of Marks will be as under: /circle6Evaluation of skills 10 Marks /circle6Assessment of Record work 5 Marks /circle6Assessment through Summative and formativetests 5 Marks673 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi How would the evaluation be done? Step I : Evaluation of skills 10 Marks 1. The assessment would be on any two skills. 2. The assessment would be done during the course of a test spread over a period of an hour and a half for a group of students not exceeding twenty in number. 3. The assessment will be done at the end of the class IX as well as class X independently by the school.4. The Board would be listing different types of skills in its publication to be brought out specifically for this purpose. The type of skills would be separately listed for classes IX as well as X. However, the schools are free to identify and test similar skills or applications based on the above to testflre thinking faculties of the learners. Distibution of Marla will be as follows: /circle6Drawing a road-map or flow chart for solving the problem - 2 marks /circle6Interpretation of the concepts involved in the problem - 2 marks /circle6Assessment of the hands-on skills (how the students have used materials/sketches/other appliances) - 2 marks /circle6Recording and reporting procedures - 2 marks The schools would keep a record of the skills tested and the modus operandi of the procedures adopted for the above evaluation for verification by the Board whenever necessary for a period of six months. The evaluationwill be internal and done by a team of two teachers of the school teaching mathematics at the secondary, orsenior school level. Step 2: Assessment of the Record - work done: 5 Marks The students would be required to do at least 10 skill based activities in the course of the academic year based on the skills listed in page 1 of the circular or related skills. Suggestive activities will also be found in thebook to be brought out by the Board. However, the school would be free to suggest related activities outsidethose suggested by the board or facilitate the students to design related activities which would enhance theircreative skills and critical thinking competencies. A record of the work done shall be maintained by the student. The same will be assessed at the end ofthe academic year in Class IX and in the month of December in Class X. The skill based activities will carry five marks. The record work shall be maintainecl by the school concerned and would be subject to the inspection ofthe Board, if found necessary.674 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh Step 3: Assessment through summative and formative tests 5 Marks Continuous Assessment will be an input of the reflection of the performance of the students in their first and second terminal examinations. Five marks are allotted for the same. How could the marks be allotted?Different shategies are recommended for class IX and class X. For class IX /circle6Reduce the marks of the first term examination (Aug-Sept) to ten and work out the achievement of the student. /circle6Reduce the marks of the second term examination (Nov-Dec) to ten and work out the achievement ofthe student. /circle6Add the values of both and thus the achievement of the learner works out to their performance out oftwenty Reduce the same to the achievement out of 5. /circle6It the achievement of the candidate works out to a decimal, round it off to the next higher value if it is0.5 and above. If it is less than 0.5 then round it off to the lower number. For class X Reduce the marks of the final assessment of class IX to ten and work out the achievement of the student.Reduce the marks of the first term examinations of class X to ten and work out the achievement of the student. Add the value of both and thus the achievement of the learner works out to their performance out of twenty. Reduce the same to the achievement out of 5.If the achievement of the candidate works out to a decimal, round it off to the next higher value if it is 0.5 and above. If it is less than 0.5 then round it off to the lower number. The above exercise is intended to motivate and sustain the interest level of the student and facilitate him to link his academic performance with other related activities. The Board believes that the rich experience and ancient wisdom of this country in the field of Mathematics, as evidenced in various fields like astronomy and other indigenous technologies, was but a testimony of thekeen interest lndia had in the subject. It is necessary to revive this love for the subject by several pedagogicalreforms. It is felt that the above initiatives of the Board would go a long way in building an appropriate climalefor effective transaction of the subject of Mathematics in classrooms and its extended learning beyond thecampus of the school. The Board intends to implement the above scheme for the class X from the ensuing academic year 2005-06 and for class X for the academic year 2006-07.675 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, DELHI SHIKSHA KENDRA, 2 COMMUNITY CENTRE, PREET VIHAR, DELHI-110092 CBSE/EO(Sc.)/Maths/2006/ 29.6.2006 Circular No. 14 All Heads of Institutions affiliated to the Board Subject : Internal Assessment in Mathematics at Secondary stage Dear Principal, You are aware that the Board had issued notification vide circular no. 03/04 dated 28th January, 2004 regarding introduction of concept of Mathematics Laboratory in all its affiliated schools. The schools wereadvised to get Mathematics Laboratory ready by 31st March 2005. Another Circular No. 10 dated 2nd March,2005 in this regard had also been issued in relation to introduction of Mathematics Laboratory and Internalassessment in Mathematics at the Secondary level from Academic session 2005-06 in class IX and the subsequentsession in class X. This circular clarified that the internal assessment of 20% is to be awarded on the basis ofperformance of a student in the activity work, project work and continuous assessment as per the followingscheme: /circle6Assessment of two skins on the basis of year-endformal examination in activity work : 10 Marks /circle6Assessment of Project work : 05 Marks /circle6Assessment through formative and Summative tests : 05 Marks The Board had also published a document 'Guidelines for Mathematics Laboratory in Schools for class IX' during the session 2005-2006 which included details of all the activities to be done by a student alongwith theinformation related to project work and assessment in the same. It is hoped that all necessary steps have beentaken by your institution for effective implementation of the scheme ensuring optimum objectivity in assessment. This scheme of internal assessment of 20% in Mathematics will now be applicable for March, 2007 class X Examination. The Board has already published a document 'Guidelines for Mathematics Laboratory in schoolsfor class X' which includes details of all the activities to be done by a student during the year as well assuggested project work. Besides, the document also includes all relevant information about scheme of assessment.The contents of this document are available on CBSE website www.cbse.nic.in. It is hoped that the said documenthas been procured by your institution and the guidelines are being followed in letter and spirit. The followingaspects of the scheme deserve your special attention. (a) The scheme of assessment for class X March, 2007 Examination will comprise of two components: Theory Examination : 80 MarksInternal Assessment (Based on Activity Work and project work) : 20 Marks676 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh (b) All the activities included in the document for class X have to be done by every student during the academic year. The Board's document 'Guidelines for Mathematics laboratory in schools - class X'includes the detailed procedure for conduct of all these activities. The students are required to maintainproper record of the activity work done during the year. The Board may ask any school to produce thisrecord work, if required. (c) Every school must provide the required physical facilities and provision for time for practical work in school time-table. (d) Every student is also expected to undertake one project in the subject during the year. The project may be in the form of extended learning in the subject and related to real life situations. However, the total out-of-school time required to complete this project should not exceed 8-10 hours. The subject teacher may guide the students for its proper selection and procedure, if need be. Some ofthe projects suggested in class X Board's document include: (i) To investigate the efficiency in packing objects of different shapes in a cuboid box. (ii) To study Geometry in real life. (iii) To study the distance between different points of a geometrical figure when it is displaced. (iv) To analyse language test using graphical and pie chart techniques. (v) To appreciate that finding probability through experiment is different from finding probability by calculation. Proper report of the project work, preferably handwritten, is also to be maintained separately. This report may include objective, description, calculation, result, conclusion and remark. (e) The activity work and project work done by students during the academic session has to be assessed during the course of a formal examination at the end of the year at school level. The said examinationmay be spread over a period of an hour and a half for a group of about 20 students. Any two skills out ofa list of skills (observation, thinking, analytical, comparing, interpretation, problem-solving, spatialskills, game skill etc.) given in the Board's document may be tested through two or three activities(depending on the time needed for such activities) to be actually performed by every student in theexamination. The assessment of students in skills and project work may be done preferably by a team ofteachers in accordance with the detailed specifications given in the Board's document. The break-up of10 marks for assessment of a single activity could be as follows : /circle6Statement of the objective of activity : 01 mark /circle6Design of approach to activity : 02 marks /circle6Actual conduct of activity : 03 marks /circle6Procedure explanation : 03 marks /circle6Result and conclusion : 01 marks The break-up of 5 marks for assessment of project work could be as follows : /circle6Identification and statement of the project : 01 mark677 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi /circle6Design of the project : 01 marks /circle6Explanation of procedure adopted : 01 marks /circle6Write-up of the project : 01 marks /circle6Interpretation of result : 01 marks Continuous Assessment in the form of formative and summative tests may be carried out as per the following scheme (for class X): (i) Reduce the marks obtained by the student in class IX Annual Examination to marks out of 10. (ii) Reduce the marks obtained by the student in first term examination in class X to marks out of 10. (iii) Add the marks in (i) and (ii) above and work out for the marks out of 20. (iv) Reduce it to marks out of 05. The above marks may then be added to the project work for calculation of total marks out of 20. The list of marks obtained by every student (out of 20) is to be sent to theBoard's office as per the directions to be issued. It may not be out of place to bring to your kind notice that the Board will keep a close watch on the marks obtained by students in theory examination (out of 80) and internal assessment (out of 20) and may down scalethe marks in internal assessment in case of serious discrepancies. Every school is required to maintain proper record of the activity, work and project work for a period of six months. The same may be inspected by the Board, if need be. You will appreciate that the whole purpose of introducing the concept of Mathematics laboratory and internal assessment at secondary level is to make teaching-learning of the subject an interactive, exciting, fun-fillingand life related experience. The scheme primarily aims at helping the student learn the basic and essentialconcepts and skills by doing simple activities and projects. This is likely to promote interest for the subject andenhance academic attainment of the students. The scheme, however, demands greater focus, attention andefforts on everyone's part.

As stated in the earlier communication, the new scheme of assessment inMathematics for class X March 2007 examination will comprise of two components: Theory Examination : 80 marksInternal Assessment : 20 marksThe said circular also clarified that an intemal assessment of 20% (20 marks) is to be awarded on the basis of performance of a student in activity work, project work and continuous assessment as per the followingscheme. /circle6Assessment of skills on the basis of year -ending formal examination in activity work : 10 marks /circle6Assessment of Project work : 05 marks /circle6Continuous assessment through formativeand summative tests : 05 marks It is hoped that all necessary steps have been taken by your institution for effective implementation of the scheme ensuring optimum objectivity in assessment. The following aspects of the scheme, as mentioned in the earlier circular are reiterated and deserve your special attention: (a) A formal year-ending examination is to be conducted at school level to assess the activity work and project work done by every student during the year. (b) This examination may be spread over a minimum period of an hour and a half for a group of 15-20 students. The allotted time may be increased to even two or two and a half hours duration dependingupon the size of the group.686 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh (c) Every student may be asked to perform at least two out of the following given activities during the allotted time for assessment of any two skills. Numerical ability, observation and ability to see patterns,thinking analytically, understanding logic, skills of comparison, interpretation and drawing inference,problem solving, decision making, spatial analysis and interpretation, skills of games. (d) A team of two teachers may assess the performance of activity work in the examination. The teacher should go around the group during the time the activity is being performed and sign the answer sheetsafter observing the activity being perform by the student. (e) Every student has to maintain a proper record of activity work done during the year. Separate report of the project work, preferably hand written, is also to be prepared by every student. (f) Every school must maintain a complete record of student's activity work, project work and the procedure adopted for assessment of the same, including the answer sheets. (g) As mentioned in the earlier circular, the break-up of 10 marks for assessment of single activity could be as under: /circle6Statement of objective - 01 mark /circle6Design of approach to activity - 02 marks /circle6Actual conduct of activity - 03 marks /circle6Explanation of procedure and observations - 03 marks /circle6Result and conclusion - 01 mark (h) The break-up of 05 marks for assessment of project work could be as /circle6Identification & statement of project - 01 mark /circle6Design of project - 01 mark /circle6Expression of procedure adopted - 01 mark /circle6Write-up of project - 01 mark /circle6Interpretation of result - 01 mark (i) Continuous assessment in the form of formative .and summative tests may be carried out as under: (i) Reduce the marks obtained by the student in class IX Annual Examination to marks out of 10. (ii) Reduce the marks obtained by the student in first term examination in class X to marks out of 10. (iii) Add the marks (i) and (ii) above and work out for the marks out of 20. (iv) Reduce it to marks out of 05. These marks may then be added to the marks for project work and assessment of activity work for calculation of total marks out of 20. The list of marks obtained byevery student (out of 20) is to be sent to the Board's office as per the directions issued byexamination unit. (j) The major objective of introducing the concept of Mathematics laboratory and internal assessment at secondary level is to make teaching-learning of the subject an interactive, activity-based, life-related687 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi and fun-filling experience. The scheme primarily aims at helping the student learn the basic and essential concepts and skills by doing simple activities and projects. Every effort should be made to make the assessment process as objective as possible. Every school is required to maintain proper record of the activity work, project work and the assessment related documents for a period of six months. Any school may be asked to submit the same tothe Board, if need be. With best wishes for a prosperous New Year 2007. Yours faithfully, (C.GURUMURTHY) DIRECTOR (ACAD.)688 dsUnzh; ek/;fed Circular No. 38/08 All the Heads of Institutions Affiliated to the Board Subject: Strengthening of Mathematics Laboratory activity work in classes III to VIII Dear Principal, You are aware that the concept of Mathernatics Laboratory was introduced by Central Board of Secondary Education in its affiliated schools few years back. Every school was advised, through a detailed circular to establish Mathematics Laboratory in order to promote teaching learning of the subject through activity work and hands on experiences. It was also suggested that the concept may be introduced from class III to class X. With the objective of implementation of the concept in the right earnest, activity and project work was made an integral part of the prescribed syllabus at seeondary stage and the scheme of intemal assessment in Mathematics was introduced in class X examination from the academic year 2006-07. A detailed circular dated 18th July, 2005 including related information was sent to all the affiliated schools. March, 2007 class X examination was condueted according to the new scheme. A series of initiatives including publication of guidelines to schools on Mathematics Laboratory for classes IX and X giving detailed activities and suggestive project work, were taken by the Board during this period. Additional guidelines have also been provided in the form of circulars issued from time to time and through orientation programs for Mathematics teachers. Schools have also been asked to ensure greater objectivity in internal assessment in the subject vide circular no.02/07 dated 10th January, 2007. It is expected that every care is being taken by the schools to implement Board's policies in the true spirit and make learning of Mathematics more joyful and fun-filling. In order to strengthen the conceet of Mathematics Laboratory further, specific syllabus related activities in the subjeet have now been identified for classes III to VIII with the help of practising teachers. Latest NCERT textbooks have been kept as the base for generation often activities based on different concepts included in the syllabus for every class. Care has been taken to ensure that the teachers and students are able to perform these activities with relative ease, no expensive materials are required to perform these activities and these do not increase the curricular load in the subject. The list of all these activities for classes III to VIII is enclosed with this circular for ready reference.689 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi The same is also available on CBSE website www.ebse.nic.in. The Board expects that the listed activities will be performed by the students of respective classes from the current academic session 2008-09.

The National CurriculumFramework 2005(NCF 2005) has been developed by NCERT for providing policy guidelines for the teachingand learning of all curricular areas including Mathematics. NCF 2005 has recommended that the teachers of Mathematics have to conscientiously set about replacing the behaviorist paradigm with methods based on constructivist or other progressive models of learning. Itreiterates that the use of technology can greatly aid the process of mathematical exploration and wiser use ofsuch aids can help engage students. It further states that it must be understood that there is a spectrum oftechnology use in Mathematics education and research in this direction will be greatly beneficial to schooleducation. In keeping with the broad guidelines enumerated in NCF 2005 for teaching and learning ofMathematics, the Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM), NCERT has developed thesyllabi and textbooks for all stages of school education. NCERT is now contemplating to exploit the potential of World Wide Web(WWW) for improving the quality of Mathematics teaching in schools. In this endeavour, they would like to associate active and enthusiasticPGTs in Mathematics from schools across India to participate in this research study. As per the plan of action, initially they will provide a questionnaire to each participant teacher for their opinion and feedbacks. Subsequently, they will choose one sample content area, discuss with teachers andidentify appropriate technological tools for the development of sample material. The identified teachers from different school systems will participate in discussions on administration of sample materials and study tools will be prepared through virtual learning environment (VLE) with NCERTwebsite. Once the teacher is convinced and trained properly to handle all the tools, the developed material willbe provided to member teachers to conduct this study in their respective schools.691 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi These communications with the teachers will be conducted through emails and NCERT website so that their day to day work is not affected. You are, therefore, requested to please identify interested PGT in Mathematics from your school who would like to be associated with this research study. Dr. P.K. Chaurasia (email praveenc1@gmail.com and mobile number 09868939552) is the Principal Investigator of this study. The list of teachers with their email addresses, correspondence addresses and contactnumbers may be forwarded to Dr. P.K. Chaurasia through emails/hard copies. Also the participant teachers maybe provided the email address of Dr. Chaurasia to make the communication easy and effective. This may be brought to the notice of all concerned. Yours faithfully, (C.

The schools must have now been in the process of planning its implementation for class X in 2006 examination. For the guidance of the schools, the salient features of the scheme are being reiterated here 1. A total of twenty (20) marks have been allotted for intemal evaluationas as per the following details: /circle6Tests (formative and summative) 10 marks /circle6Assignments - school and home assignment 05 marks /circle6Project work 05 marks 2. Regarding evaluation of formative tests, the teachers are expected to give a variety of oral and written questions for recapitulation, review and diagnostic purposes. The purpose is not to assess learning butto identify learning gaps, deficiency in teaching and to bring improvement in teaching-learning process.However, for evaluation of unit tests (written), it is suggested that a record of at least three unit tests, term tests and half yearly tests should be maintained. In class IX, students can be given marks out of 10 and average can be calculated out of 10 marks. Alternatively, students can be assessed in the unit testson a five-point rating scale and Grade Point Average (GPA) can be worked out. Then, the final scores onwritten tests can be worked out of 10 marks. These grades will have the following numerical values: \u0081 Excellent - A-5, \u0081 Very D-2, \u0081 Unsatisfactory - E-l. In class X, 10 marks will be awarded on the basis of final performance of students in class IX and also on the basis of at least two unit tests held in class X. Then the average can be calculated for marks to be given out of 10. For example, if any student has got 60 per cent marks in aggregate in Class IX home examination andhas got 7 & 8 marks out of 10 respectively in two unit tests in Class X, the above can be added up inproportion to 10 which comes out 21 which will then be divided by 3 to get the average marks out of 10.693 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi In the instant case, it comes to 7. The teachers may note that too many tests increase the stess level of students. The tests should be conducted in stress free, non-threatening environment to help the studentin revising learnt concepts. 3. Regarding assignments, it is suggested that for recording purpose. every month, well-planned assignments may be given to the students. Since Social Science has components of History, Geography, Civics etc.assignments may consist of 1 or 2 questions which test the understanding of different concepts in thesecomponents. There can be 4 to 5 assignments in class IX and 3 to 4 such assignments in class X.Assessment can be made on a 5-point rating scale. Record of such 5 assignments may be kept. Based ontheir suggested numerical values, Grade Point Average (GPA) can be calculated to arrive at final awardin marks out of 5. 4. Regarding evaluation of project work, 5 marks have been assigned for the project work done by the students in the academic session. The Board had also sent detailed guidelines regarding evaluation ofproject work, vide circular no. 7/2005 dated 4th Feb.2005. For class IX, a student is required to do anytwo projects out of which one will be compulsorily on Disaster Management. In class X, the studentswill do any one project and marks will be awarded out of 5. It may be pointed out that the projectwork in no case should be voluminous and must be restricted within 9 to 15 pages of standard A-4 sizebut it should be original, creative and innovative. Break up of marks over different aspects will be asfollows: Aspects Marks Initiative, cooperativeness and participation 1 Content accuracy and research work 1 Creativity, originality 1 Analysis of different situations and different perspectives 1 Viva or written test for content assimilation 1 Marks for one project 5 Total marks for two projects (Class IX) 10 Total marks for internal evaluation in project work (Class IX/X) 5. Schools are requested to keep the records of internal assessment along with the project files which have been prepared by the students and make these available for inspection. Board will be sending its observersto the schools for the purpose. 6. It may be noted that all the schools are required to send roll number wise marks statement with respect694 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh to internal evaluation to the Board between 15th January, 2006 to 15th February, 2006. The Marks statement should clearly reflect breakup into different components of internal evaluation. I would like to emphasise here that the entire purpose of introducing internal evaluation has been to destress learning and make it more relevant useful and enjoyable for the students. The objective of entire exercise is notto increase the learning load among the students but to ensure that the students are enthusiastically involved inthe learning process.

It is reiterated that schools shouldseriously follow the laid down guidelines in evaluating different aspects of internal evaluation i.e. term/unittests, assignments and project work and maintain proper assessment records. Project Work is an important aspect of internal evaluation wherein children are helped to do and learn on their own by going through the documents, collecting relevant materials and analysing them to arrive at theirown findings and conclusions. The schools should continue to assign the projects to students based on theguidelines and topics specified. They must also ensure that the total length of the Project report should not bemore than 12-15 (size A4) foolscap size handwritten pages. Evaluation should be strictly in terms of the criterialaid down in the guidelines. Boosting of internal assessment marks should be avoided. Any such thing may leadto downscaling of internal marks or its cancellation and the result will be declared on the basis of external marksalone. The Board will be very shortly sending you the revised topics/themes for project for classes IX and X to be followed during the current academic session 2006-07.

You are requested to kindly bring it to the notice of the concerned SocialScience teachers of your school for effective implementation. Yours faithfully, (Sugandh Sharma) Education Officer (Com.)697 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi INTRODUCTION Education is a developmental process, which transforms learners. It brings about a change in the mental and physical behaviours of students. To bring about this change, teachers need to introduce their students to concepts,generalizations, issues and skills. which seem relevant to their lives. Social Science is one of the subjects which brings students closer to their envirornment, society and the intricacies of the geographical, social, economic and political processes. It enables them to understand theprocess of social change and the role that they can play towards this change. With the onset of the new millemium, many challenges have been thrown in the school education system. Information explosion and widespread use of information technology has emphasised further demands on theeducation system. It is imperative to be sensitive to changing societal needs and expectations. In Social Scienceeducation particularly there has been a felt need to make its learning interesting. motivating and participatory innature. Sensing this need of its schools, the CBSE introduced Internal Evaluation in Social Science at secondary stage since the 2004 academic session of class IX. The Internal Evaluation of 20 marks for each of classes IX and X will have the following break up:Part 1 Class tests, term tests, etc. 10 marksPart 2 Assignments 5 marksPart 3 Project work 5 marksAs each of these different types of assessment evaluate differert aspects of learning the evaluation should reflect the actual effort and performance of the learner. No changes should be made to the marks given by theevaluator to enhance overall performance of the students. Brief guidelines with respect to Internal Evaluation in Social Science at the Secondary Stage have alrearly been sent to schools. The present guidelines Part 3 pertain to evaluation of Project work. Part 3 : PROJECT WORK Need for introducing Project work in Social Science was being felt for quite sometime. Many schools had also expressed their desire to have projects in Social Science for enhancing students' understanding of differentconcepts, principles and generalizations inherent in the subject. This also introduces an alternative mode oflearning in class rooms with a purpose to increase students participation in the process of learning and enablingthem to become independent thinkers. It is expected that by introducing Project work learning will becomemore contextual, relevant. contemporary and centred on Learning to Be. A. PROJECT WORK REQUIREMENTS The project work in Social science entails the following requirements: 1. The projects will be evaluated internally and continuously.2. All the concerned Social Science teachers in consultation with each other should share evaluation of the projects.698 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh 3. Questions based on the conclusions of the project will be given as a test (oral or written) of 10 minutes duration after the submission of the project. D.

(ii) For other situations the drill will be same as mentioned in para. 4.1 (A) 6. Communication with the Parents: It is very likely that the news of such an incident will breakout very fast and parents in panic would rush to the school. In order to ensure that parents do not rush to school and create obstructions in the subsequentoperations by the police forces, they need to be informed to come to a pre-identified central place as close to theschool as possible for the briefing as well as for handing over of rescued children. This can be achieved if theschool can have a system of having the mobile nos. of all the parents of the children in a centralized database. ASMS can be drafted explaining the situation giving the necessary facts, place of their assembly for briefing etc.and the message sent to all. For this purpose, the local police should identify the place of assembly, in advanceand provide a list, locality wise to all schools and also to the District Hqrs. And State Hqrs. 7. General Suggestions: 1) School gates be kept closed immediately after the arrival of children till the dispersal of children begins, to prevent any easy intrusion. 2) The telephone numbers of nearest hospital(s), police stations and assistance desks should be displayed prominently in the school. 3) Guards should be identified for each gate and there should be a list put up to specify who has keys to which gate. All gates should be covered by guards. 4) A centralized alarm system and also a PA system, through which classes can be addressed collectively as well as individually and selected combination should be installed. 5) All teachers/ staff should be briefed properly and apprised of any possible threats. 6) There should be a list with duties specified by names like which teacher/ staff would be responsible for controlling children, which one would inform police/ hospital authorities, which one would be responsiblefor informing the parents and so on. 7) All the bus drivers to be briefed to respond quickly and drive away their buses with children if they see any commotion/ attack at the gate and directed by security guards to do so. 8) The guard at the gate should be alert to notice any suspicious person moving around or standing near the school. 9) A security check can be carried out in school by the staff to check if any object is lying unclaimed at various points such as in the classroom, at any gate, in the field and so on. 10) The antecedents of all the new staff members being employed in the school should be verified properly.724 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh 11) All labourers working in the school should be issued a temporary photo I- Card and they can be generally checked by security guards to prevent anyone of them from bringing anything (like bomb/IED) to beimplanted in the school. 12) School authorities should provide a copy of lay out plan of the school to the local police station in advance. 8. Advance Recee: Local police along with the school may carry out an advance reconnaissance of the schools to prepare the operation to deal with any such contingency in future. 9. Mock Drill: School authorities may conduct the briefing of the teachers/ students/ staff as well as the drill as per this SOP to ensure that everybody knows his/ her role in such an eventuality. They can also include local Police intheir Mock Drill.725 Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 'Shiksha Kendra', 2, Community Centre, New Delhi -110002 March 29, 2006 Circular No. 4 ToAll Head of Institutions Affiliated to the Board Subject : New NCERT Text Books for Classes IX & XI Dear Principal, Kindly refer to Board's Circular No. 01/2006 dated 16th February, 2006 through which it was informed that the new curriculum and text books will be introduced in classes I, III, VI, IX and XI from the academic session2006-2007.

'Learning by doing'- a compendium of science activities, for class VI. This was done with the objective or promoting teaching and learning of thesubject through activity-based and learner-centred approach and help the students enjoy learning and have funand excitement during the learning process. The document included wide variety of syllabus related concept-based activities including games, riddles and crossword puzzles. It is hoped that desired emphasis is beinggiven to the pedagogical requirements of the subject of Science right from lower grades and schools are providingall necessary physical facilities and sufficient time to carry out these activities for better understanding of therelated concepts. A related circular to this effect was sent to all the affiliated schools immediately for publicationof the above document. The publication of present document 'Science is doing' an activity book for class VII, is in continuation to the earlier effort and is aimed at further strengthening of the approach of providing more hands-on experiencesto the learners. The Board firmly believes that being more conceptual in nature. learning of subject of Sciencedemands active and concrete learning experiances to be given to the students, particularly during formativeyears. It is with this broader objective in mind that the present publication has been brought out and the endeavouris now being further extended to class VIII. This publication is slightly different from routine documents andhas the flavour of a story book presented in a simple form. This document includes variety of activities directlyrelated to different content units and concepts included in latest class VII NCERT Science Textbook. Theactivities include stories, poems, games, riddles, crossword puzzles and concept-based motor-coordinationexercises. An effort has been made to avoid repetition or overlapping of activities which have already beenincluded in NCERT publication. It is expected that actual participation of learners in the process will make theirlearning experience much more satisfying and pleasurable. Their memory is also likely to be further stengthenedby a higher retention quotient. That such rich dividends are realized through activities requiring only low costmaterials is an added attraction. The schools may procure desired number of copies from Board's office at Headquarters. Delhi or any of the Regional Offices on making payment in cash or in the form of a Demand Draft in favour of Secretary or744 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh Regional Officer payable at the respective place.

A NOTE ON PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING Problem-based learning is a form of learning which helps to develop individual and group skills which are relevant to people in senior management positions. Participants are put into groups. The group is presented with a problem and has to come up with a solution, and then present that solution persuasively. This work is carried out over several days, through a series of tasks.As in real life, there are rules controlling how each task is to be done. Also as in real life, some details of thetasks are only given at the time, without prior warning. In order to complete the challenge successfully, the following rules must be observed : \u0081 All members of the group have equal status.\u0081 All members of the group must make a full contribution, although the group can agree to allocate particular functions to particular members. \u0081 Decisions are to be reached by agreement.\u0081 Any disagreements are to be resolved within the group.\u0081 This solution presented must be supported by the whole group. Provided that these rules are followed, the group is free to choose its working methodss. For example, a group might decide to take turns to act as 'chairman'. A group can decide that for part of the time, they will splitup and work on individual tasks before coming together again. A group can take any reasonable steps to completethe tasks well, such as having additional meetings outside the working day, or accessing sources of information.786 dsUnzh; ek/;fed f'k{kk cksMZ] fnYyh INTRODUCING OUR TEAM Dr. Raphael Wilkins (Course Leader) Raphael Wilinks is Pro Director (International Consultancy and Knowledge Transfer) and Director of International Affairs in the London Centre for Leadership in Learning, Institute of Education, University ofLondon, and is also President of the College of Teachers.
