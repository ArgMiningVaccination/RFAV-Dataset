Citrulline Nitric oxide production in the body is increased by citrulline. As a vasodilator, nitric oxide expands the inner muscles of blood vessels, promoting blood circulation. This makes it possible for nutrition, oxygen, and blood to reach every part of the body. However, fatigue and physical weakness may result when nitric oxide production is constrained. Citrulline supplements may boost energy levels by making more nutrients and oxygen available to the body's cells because it is a precursor to nitric oxide.

Pros - Non-GMO and non allergenic - Improves memory Cons - May cause reflux Benefits of Energy Supplements Energy supplements have numerous other benefits that we shall go through. a) Boosts Metabolism One of the major benefits of energy supplements is that they boost metabolism. They do this by improving mitochondria function, the organelles in your cells that generate energy. Sometimes the mitochondria may fail to work effectively as age, toxins, and genetic diseases can debilitate them. However, when the mitochondria, coenzymes, amino acids, and cells work together, they are more likely to provide you with endless benefits. A boost in metabolism also prevents you from acquiring metabolic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. b) Reduces Stress Adaptogens are known to reduce physical and mental stress and increase energy. Lowering your brain fog lowers fatigue and stress levels, an important benefit of the supplements. c) Boosts Memory Energy supplements and vitamins support better memory and improve brain function, ensuring you focus during the day. After all, experiencing fatigue is a common feeling many adults go through. The brain sometimes refuses to keep up with everything one has to do during the day. However, with natural energy supplements, you can notice an increase in; - alertness - short-term memory - long-term memory The benefits of these supplements are more noticeable to people with mental strains. d) Better Athletic Performance You can easily improve your athletic and exercise performance by taking energy supplements. Increasing workout energy is one of the reasons many people take energy boosters. Factors to Consider When Buying the Best Energy Supplements When buying the best energy supplements, it would be best to consider a few things. Let us go through them. a) Third Party-Tested and Certified Unlike medications, [dietary supplements](https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements) are not regulated by the FDA; the body does not play any role in determining whether or not a dietary supplement is effective or safe. So it is upon the manufacturer to ensure they provide safe products. You cannot tell if a supplement is safe by looking at them. Therefore, looking for testing seals from an independent third party is important. You can expect to see seals from organizations like; - NSF International - ConsumerLab.com - U.S Pharmacopeia These organizations test if the supplements contain the ingredients listed and are safe for consumption. However, you should know that even if a dietary supplement has a third-party testing label, it does not mean they are safe for you, so speak with a care provider first. b) Know Why You Need Them Dietary supplements are not food.Therefore, before you buy your energy supplement, ensure that what you need is what you need, as the nutrients available in the supplements should correspond with your needs. Your healthcare provider should also explain how much you need to take and the duration so you do not misuse them. Also, do not diagnose yourself, as you may not know exactly what nutrients your body lacks. c) Non-GMO Always aim for organic and non-GMO energy supplements. You are more likely to avoid experiencing unexpected side effects using non-GMO products. Plus, this decision means you are more likely to consume products containing as many natural ingredients as possible. d) Avoid Large Doses and Extra Ingredients First, check the ingredients when buying a bottle of dietary supplements. Ensure that you only buy a bottle of supplements with the necessary ingredients. The extra ingredients could be a good idea, but the more they are, the more likely your supplements will have side effects. Start with only the supplement you are interested in taking to avoid experiencing many unnecessary side effects that could have been avoided in the first place. e) Free of Additives There are more than 10 000 additives approved to be used in preservation. Although these additives are suitable for shelf-life, they are not good for health. The chemicals found in these additives can alter growth and development and also affect hormones. Watch out for artificial sweeteners and coloring, and be sure that what you buy does not contain any unnecessary additives, which you can easily do without. f) Allergy-Friendly Manufacturers must clearly identify all the food allergens in the supplements. Some food allergens are likely to appear on the label, and these may include eggs, peanuts, soy, wheat, dairy, fish, tree nuts, and shellfish. People with various allergies also need to pay special attention to the labels and know that natural does not always mean safe, and even natural ingredients can cause allergies. g) Brand A brand that has been in the market for a long period is likely to offer better products. A trusted brand will always ensure it produces reliable products to maintain its reputation. So, when shopping for energy supplements, get them from a trusted brand. h) Minimal Sweeteners Most energy supplements may taste bad and turn users off. However, sometimes manufacturers add sweeteners and other additives to make them easier to swallow. Sometimes these sweeteners can be too much, so try as much as possible to get unflavored options. Look for dietary supplements with little added sugar if you can find the unflavored ones. You might wish to avoid supplements with sugar, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners. i) Price The price of your preferred energy supplement is an important factor to consider. Once you confirm the specific supplement you'll need, ensure the price is also friendly. If you can get a cheaper option from a well-trusted brand, you could spend less and still get a good product.
