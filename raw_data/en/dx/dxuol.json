Holistic medicine supports reaching higher levels of wellness as well as preventing illness. Not just with nutritional supplements, vitamins or herbs. Most important factor is your lifestyle. People enjoy the vitality and well-being that results from their positive lifestyle changes, and are motivated to continue this process throughout their lives. Holistic medicine (health) is actually an approach to life. Rather than focusing on illness or specific parts of the body, this ancient approach to health considers the whole person and how he or she interacts with his or her environment. It emphasizes the connection of mind, body, and spirit. The goal is to achieve maximum well-being, where everything is functioning the very best that is possible. With Holistic Health people accept responsibility for their own level of well-being, and everyday choices are used to take charge of one's own health. A recent positive trend has been in the medical schools, which are beginning to invite holistic physicians to lecture or to develop programs in the schools to complement their more conventional curricula. The National Institute of Health has developed an office to support and research holistic and alternative medicine practices. Some states are now passing laws to protect and support the practices of holistic providers, as they have sometimes been the subject of harassment by their more conservative colleagues, for their different orientation, techniques, and approaches to health care. With these current trends, the changing needs and perceptions by a more informed public, and the increasing scientific validation of holistic approaches, I see the holistic paradigm coming of age?the new frontier of health care and human awareness. What is alternative and what is complementary medicine? Alternative medicine: practices used instead of standard medical treatments. Alternative medicine is distinct from complementary medicine which is meant to accompany, not to replace, standard medical practices. Alternative medical practices are generally not recognized by the medical community as standard or conventional medical approaches. Alternative medicine includes nutritional supplements, megadose vitamins, herbal preparations, special teas, massage therapy, magnet therapy, and spiritual healing. Integration of complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM) with conventional medicine is occurring in hospitals and physicians offices, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are covering CAM therapies, insurance coverage for CAM is increasing, and integrative medicine centers and clinics are being established, many with close ties to medical schools and teaching hospitals. In determining what care to provide, the goal should be comprehensive care that uses the best scientific evidence available regarding benefits and harm, encourages a focus on healing, recognizes the importance of compassion and caring, emphasizes the centrality of relationship-based care, encourages patients to share in decision making about therapeutic options, and promotes choices in care that can include complementary therapies where appropriate. Numerous approaches to delivering integrative medicine have evolved. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States identifies an urgent need for health systems research that focuses on identifying the elements of these models, the outcomes of care delivered in these models, and whether these models are cost-effective when compared to conventional practice settings. It outlines areas of research in convention and CAM therapies, ways of integrating these therapies, development of curriculum that provides further education to health professionals, and an amendment of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act to improve quality, accurate labeling, research into use of supplements, incentives for privately funded research into their efficacy, and consumer protection against all potential hazards. Holistic And Alternative Medicine Holistic medicine includes an evaluation of diet, emotions, behavior, and lifestyle, in addition to the routine physical exam. Holistic Medicine is also called Alternative Medicine and is an approach that deals with the whole patient, not just the presenting complaint. The veterinarian will need to know as much as possible about your pet's environment. History taking will include your dog's living arrangements as well as past medical problems and treatments. Owners need to be prepared to answer questions concerning their pets fears, food preferences and emotions. The time of day a problem occurs is also an important factor in making a diagnosis. Vets will take extra time to discuss how to monitor results of specific therapies and how to determine whether or not certain environmental factors are influencing their pet's health. HERBALISM Using plants and herbs for medicinal purposes is an ancient practice. You can cut up fresh herbs and mix them into the food, or use the liquid \"tincture\" form, which is the most potent and the best choice in most cases. Herbs can be used externally as dips and tonics for skin problems. They also have unique properties when it comes to stimulating the immune system for diseases like cancer that are largely un-treatable by traditional methods. Certain herbs are potentially toxic at any dose and should be avoided. These include: Chaparral, Comfrey, Pennyroyal, Garlic, Tea Tree and Mahuang. HOMEOPATHY Homeopathists believe that giving an extremely dilute form of a substance similar to the one causing the symptoms, stimulates the body to overcome the illness itself. The remedies used are all natural and are derived from plants, minerals, or animal products. They are precisely diluted one part to 90 parts alcohol then vigorously shaken to become activated. The more dilute the remedy, the stronger it gets and the more intrinsic energy it releases. This energy rebalances the body's \"vital force\" or \"chi\", which stimulates the body's immune system to heal itself. You can buy most homeopathic remedies in a specific strength. The number after the name indicates the strength, for example, Arsenica album 6c. The remedies can be given as pellets or crushed to powder and given by mouth. They must be handled and given according to specific guidelines as they can easily become inactivated. Homeopathic remedies are compatible with nutritional and chiropractic therapies. However, they should not be used with acupuncture or strong herbal tintures because they can inactivate each other. Working with a homepathic vet is essential for successful therapy. OTHER ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES There are many more alternative therapies than those described here including Aromatherapy, Detoxification, Magnetic Field Therapy and Energetic Therapies like Reiki. As traditional research continues to uncover the efficiency of these treatments, more will find their way into mainstream veterinary medicine. FLOWER ESSENCES Flower essences are diluted flower preparations that are used to treat behavioral problems, fears and other psychological problems, especially those associated with stress. They help to rebalance mental and emotional well-being. Originally, Edward Bach, a British physician in the 1930's, developed 38 different flower essences, each of which was used to rebalance a different emotional situation. These essences are therefore also called Bach Flower Remedies. Rescue Remedy is one of the most popular. It is a mixture of five flower essences and is commonly used after a physical or emotional trauma or a stressful situation. For example, with a dog stressed by a major change in his or her home life, two drops in or on the mouth or tongue two to three times daily is often an effective remedy. You can also put two to three drops into the water bowl. Most dogs relax and adjust to the change more easily. ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is the insertion of needles into specific body points to stimulate the body's immune system to heal itself. It is used to relieve pain caused by arthritic conditions like Hip Dysplasia and Spinal Disc Disease as well as skin allergies, Chronic Bowel Diseases and nervous disorders including Epilepsy. The relief is generally temporary and several treatments are often needed for positive results. CHIROPRACTIC CARE Chiropractic Care involves manipulating the spinal cord to adjust misplaced vertebrae that may be impinging on nerves and impeding movement. It can be useful to relieve musculoskeletal pain resulting from trauma and arthritis as well as other degenerative processes affecting the spine, joints, and bony skeleton. NATUROPATHY Naturopaths believe that diseases are caused by a buildup of toxins in the body. They recommend a regime of good nutrition and exercise combined with bathing, massage, and sunshine. GLANDULAR THERAPY These are biologically active nutritional supplements given as treats or mixed with food. Many contain glands from hormone secreting organs, such as the thyroid, and are used to stimulate a weakened gland to function normally. These are very safe.
