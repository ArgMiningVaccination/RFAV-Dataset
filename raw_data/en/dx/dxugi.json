Read Full LicensePage 2/20Abstract Based on 1185 research articles related to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) from 2020 to 2023 retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases, a comprehensive systematic literature review was conducted with the primary aim of exploring the main contributors, research status, hot topics and research frontiers concerning the international spread of TCM against the COVID-19 pandemic through a metrical and visualization analysis. CiteSpace 6.1. R6 software is applied to visualize the publication countries, subjects, authors, institutes, publication sources, keywords and references of the literature and to draw a visual knowledge graph. PRISMA 2020 was used to evaluate the scienti\u0000city of this study itself, and the PRISMA 2020 scores generally showed good quality of the systematic review, conforming to 29 out of 37 items, partly in accordance with 2 items of TCM. The statistics of this study show that 81% of articles published are from China, followed by 8.2% from the USA and 5.3% from India. Moreover, the research hotspots of coronavirus in the articles involve molecular docking, sar, systematic review and herbal medicine. Moreover, the principal proposition of translation strategies in TCM's international spread is the combination of domestication and foreignization to maintain the originality of TCM's nature and to give consideration to the cognition of audiences. Instead of blindly merging into the Western medicine system, the international spread of TCM ought to broaden its span and to convey the theoretical framework, philosophical thoughts and traditional culture as a whole. In addition, cooperation between research institutes can be further strengthened to deliver an integrated and united research pattern. I. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic, de\u0000ned as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" by the World Health Organization (WHO), has caused hundreds of thousands of people to die globally. COVID-19 has become the largest global health crisis since the 21st century, resulting in enormous economic losses worldwide and emotional trauma worldwide. However, since the WHO recommended the development of potential vaccines and antiviral medicines at the second meeting of the Emergency Committee on January 30, 2020, there has been no con\u0000rmed effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19(Zhuang et al., 2021). Because of the advantages of TCM in the treatment of complicated diseases, Chinese medical institutes spare no effort in conducting many studies to determine the most effective prescription. The successive Chinese top leadership, especially the president Xi Jinping (2019), has attached great importance to the industrialization and modernization of traditional Chinese medicine, which has been proven to have profound universal value and unique curative effects in some epidemic situations, such as malaria, sars and typhoid, and should be well protected, developed and inherited. It is essential to give full play to the unique advantages of TCM in disease prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, especially in the global health crisis. TCM has been not only a scienti\u0000c accomplishment but also a cultural heritage for millennia. The Chinese government has upgraded the promotion and innovation of TCM since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of People's Republic of China, along with nearly 30 policies and measures. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge to the medical system in all countries globally. The treatment of coronavirus has become a major global public health concern. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic is also an opportunity to further demonstrate the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, which holds an important status in global medical treatment, while the global acknowledgement of TCM is still far from what it deserves to be. Tu Youyou, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2015, substantially boosts the popularity of TCM worldwide. However, the e\u0000cacy of TCM has always been questioned worldwide, and some people even think of traditional Chinese medicine as pseudoscience because of its lack of randomized controlled trials in terms of drug safety and e\u0000cacy(Qiu, 2007). The international communication of TCM faces obstacles, including the stereotype of \"unscienti\u0000c\" and \"empiricist\"(Chen, Tong, Ren, Yu, & Cui, 2019). Thus, based on the active countries, authors, institutions, high-frequency references and keywords involved in the research articles about coronavirus published in the WOS and Scopus databases, a systematic investigation is critical to the future promotion of traditional Chinese medicine, which helps to improve international communication in the medical \u0000eld and to make traditional Chinese medicine bene\u0000t the world in the postpandemic era and the future. II. Literature Review TCM has developed for thousands of years since the era of ancient China. It has contributed greatly to the treatment and prevention of some pandemics, such as SARS and COVID-19. Especially in this pandemic of COVID-19, the Chinese government has successively released ten editions of Guidance for Coronavirus Disease: Prevention, Control, Diagnosis and Management, recommending the characteristic treatment of TCM, among which \"three drugs and three prescriptions\" were proven to be effective through clinical screening. \"Three drugs\" refers to the Chinese herb medicin of Jinhuaqinggan Granules against in\u0000uenza A (H1N1), Lianhuaqingwen used for the prevention and control of COVID-19 and Xuebijing anti-infective injection. \"Three detoxing decoction), Huashibaidugranule inhibiting and replication of viruses, and Xuanfeibaidugranule. Qingfeipaidu decoction was derived from \u0000ve classic prescriptions from the Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases. Xuebijing injection was \u0000rst developed and marketed during SARS in 2013. Combined use with Western medicine, \"Three Drugs\" and \"Three Prescriptions\" of TCM during the pandemic can improve the rate of cure and reduce the cost of treatment. The evaluation report on TCM in the \u0000ght against COVID-19 was released after the WHO expert evaluation meeting held on 6 Apr. 2022, which a\u0000rms the contribution of TCM in the \u0000ght against COVID-19, encouraging member states to consider thePage 3/20integrated Chinese and Western medicine model (integrated medicine model) developed and applied in China.(Gaoli, Yingjian, & Fuchun, 2023) A total of 113 member countries of the WHO recognized acupuncture and other TCM diagnosis and treatment methods. TCM has already spread to over 196 countries and regions(Gaoli et al., 2023). The world witnessed an effective rate of 97.87% in the treatment and rehabilitation of patients(Liu, 2021) at the beginning of 2020 when TCM was involved in 92.41% of the treatment of COVID-19, but until now, it still lacks recognition and application on a global scale. Scholars such as Yao, C., Xueyang, Z., Fengwen, Y., & Feng, S. (2020) conducted thorough research using information visualization analysis to illustrate the knowledge map of network meta-analysis (NMA) on TCM. Chen, Y.-B., Tong, X.-F., Ren, J., Yu, C.-Q., & Cui, Y.-L. (2019) worked together to construct a bibliometric review of current research trends on TCM from 2000 to 2016 and found that despite the growth of the publications, few of them were published in top academic journals, and most-quality papers preferred medical analysis rather than pharmacology. Wang WY, Zhou H, Wang YF, Sang BS, and Liu L.(2021). introduced a detailed evolutionary course of TCM, focusing on the related policies and measures. The number of students in TCM universities, the number of TCM agencies and \u0000scal appropriation to TCM agencies all improved from 2012 to 2017. Under the prosperous surface are all kinds of di\u0000culties. Lack of international communication and recognition is one of them. Jian, D., Tianfang, W., Lilan, D., & Qing, W. (2017) and Wang, X., & Tingyu, F. (2019) also used CiteSpace to analyse Chinese research articles on Chinese medicine terminology translation. With bibliometric approaches, they provided a full and systematic view of the articles published from 1991 to 2015. In terms of speci\u0000c types of TCM, there have also been studies to prove their different e\u0000cacies. Jie Qinzhuang and Xingzhen Bai et al. conducted clinical application of Lianhua Qingwen in the treatment of COVID-19, indicating its effectiveness in improving clinical symptoms and reducing the rate of clinical change to severe or critical conditions(Zhuang et al., 2021). However, there is a lack of research concerning the performance and international recognition of TCM during the pandemic. The statistical analysis of TCM-related articles published in international journals can help researchers grasp the focus and promote the international communication of TCM. Currently, there has not been a scientometric study using mathematical and statistical methods to analyse the intellectual landscape, basic characteristics, current status and emerging trends regarding TCM research as a treatment for the pandemic. Thus, this study addresses this gap and provides a full picture of the research on TCM speci\u0000cally as a treatment for COVID-19. CiteSpace 6.1. R6 is adopted to form a visualization analysis of the research countries or institutes, authors, references and keywords in the literature about TCM related to COVID-19. III. Study Evaluation Giving full play to the original advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, promoting the life science of our country to achieve innovative breakthroughs, carrying forward the Chinese \u0000ne traditional culture, and enhancing national and cultural self-con\u0000dence, is of great signi\u0000cance to promote mutual learning between civilizations and people, to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and to carry out coordinated efforts of Chinese and Western medicine. The study was conducted under the methodological guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). First published more than a decade ago, PRISMA has become one of the most cited reporting guidelines in biometrical literature, helping authors conduct transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews(Sarkis-Onofre, Catal\u00e1-L\u00f3pez, Aromataris, & Lockwood, 2021). Among the 42 items, 7 items were not suitable for this study. The systematic review conformed to 30 out of 35 items, partly in accordance with 2 items. The PRISMA score proves the study to be a relatively complete reporting. Thus, the quality of systematic reviews on TCM was generally good. The evaluation according to the PRISMA 2020 checklist is as follows:Page 4/20Table 1 Evaluation of PRISMA 2020 checklist Section and TopicItem# Checklist item Y/N TITLE Title 1 Identify the report as a systematic review.

Data Collection All the data in this study were retrieved on February 20, 2023, from the WOS database, as the largest comprehensive information resource and most trusted publisher-independent global citation database(Chen et al., 2019), which is the world's leading citation database, containing a curated collection of over 21,000 peer-reviewed, high-quality scholarly journals published worldwide and the Scopus database, which covers the world's most extensive scienti\u0000c and medical literature abstracts, references and indexes. The topics of studies (\"TS\", which includes Title, Abstract, Keywords and Keywords Plus) in WOS are chosen as \"TS=(\"TCM\" and \"COVID-19\") and their Boolean combination. The span of the literature with a total of 1185 records retrieved is from January 2020 to February 20, 2023. Of the 1185 records, 663 are articles, 403 reviews, 40 letters, and 54 editorial materials. In the Scopus database, the TITLE-ABS-KEY (title, abstract and keywords) are limited to (traditional AND Chinese AND medicine) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (COVID-19). There were 1282 studies in total, with 841 articles, 347 reviews, 37 letters, 12 conference papers, 11 editorials, 10 notes, etc., among which 6 errata and 1 retracted article were excluded for accurate analysis, leaving 1275 results. After rough screening of the titles and abstracts of the articles, 5 articles were scanned out for their relative irrelevance to the topic, such as \"Post-COVID-19 Chinese domestic tourism market recovery: potential in\u0000uence of traditional Chinese medicine on tourist behaviour\" by Wen Jun et al, which focuses on the in\u0000uence of TCM on the tourism market rather than treatment of COVID-19. After manual screening, 1270 articles remained. The risk of bias lies in the possibility that some articles may not mention COVID-19 in their titles, keywords or abstracts and are missed out on the systematic review as a result. The research protocol is not prepared. All identi\u0000ed records were downloaded from the WOS database on February 20, 2023, and imported into CiteSpace for further studies. The document types of each database are shown in Table 2. Table 2: The document types of selected articles in WOS (left) and Scopus (right) V. Data Analysis The data analysis in this part is based on CiteSpace 6.1. R6 software. In the WOS database, the number of medical publications concerning the treatment of coronavirus has been generally steady. The data collection ended by February 20th, 2023. 2021 was a small peak in the past three years. The number of average publications on TCM as a treatment for COVID-19 is 314 each year. In the Scopus database, the number of studies decreased slowly each year, with 393 studies on average each year. 5.1 Analysis of countriesPage 7/20 According to Table 3, 960 articles were published in China, followed by 98 publications from the USA, 63 publications from India, 32 publications from England and 26 publications from Australia. The central nodes with centrality 0.1 are China, USA, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Iran, Pkistan, France, Turkey and Bangladesh. Although a larger number of articles are published in international journals by India, England, and Australia, the research is conducted comparatively independently, with less cooperation with other countries; 81% of articles are from China, followed by 8.2% from the USA and 5.3% from India. The total publications from thesethree countries cover more than 90% of the articles, which means that the study of TCM has been highly centralized domestically, lacking global recognition and involvement. The generated country analysis graph has 78 nodes and 150 lines. The country with the highest frequency and centrality is \"Peoples China\", with a centrality of 0.61 High centrality indicates the importance of the node in the text.The greater the centrality of the node is, the closer relationship between the node and the surrounding nodes is (Hu & Zhang, 2021). Page 8/20 In the Scopus database, 1006 publications are from China, 85 from the United States, 46 from India, 39 from the United Kingdom, 23 from Australia and 76 from other counties. As shown in table 3 and table 4, in both databases, China has the most contributions to TCM as a treatment for COVID-19. In the WOS database, China's publications take up the most, at 81%, and in the Scopus database, that number is 79%. The top 5 countries contributing the most are the same, with only the order of the fourth and \u0000fth countries (India and the United Kingdom) being different, showing both their research strength and interests in TCM. 5.2 Analysis of subjects Chart 2 depicts the proportion of subjects of articles about TCM as a treatment for COVID-19 in the Scopus database. As shown in Chart 2, less than half of the articles are involved in the \u0000eld of medicine, which accounts for the largest part with 886 articles at 42.8%. The second largest part of the articles with 463 is about Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics, accounting for 22.4% percent. This was followed by biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology with 185 articles, chemistry with 71 articles, agricultural and biological sciences with 65 articles, and immunology and microbiology with 62 articles. 5.3 Analysis of authors Page 9/20From the Keyword map related to the authors of the articles in Figure 4, a total of 225 nodes and 276 connection lines can be obtained. 225 nodes refer to 225 authors. 276 Connection lines indicate the collaboration network. The authors visualized in Figure 3 are those who published more than \u0000ve articles. Different colors represent different years. Purple represents 2020, blue represents 2021, green represents 2022 and red represents 2023. In the map, it is obvious that Zhang Junhua published the most articles and Zhang Ying has the highest betweenness centrality (0.21). Nodes with centrality 0.1 are called central nodes. The central nodes shown in Table 5 include Zhang Ying (0.21), Luohui (0.14), Liu Qingquan (0.13), Zhang Junhua (0.13), Lian Fengmei (0.12), Wang Yanping (0.12), and Wang Jian (0.1). Betweenness centrality is based on structural hole theory, which was originally developed for social networks. High betweenness centrality indicates a larger value in the network. 5.4 Analysis of institutes Page 10/20 As shown in Table 6 and Table 7 above, the top three most productive institutions are the same in both the WOS and Scopus databases: Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, and Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The top 10 institutions in the WOS database contributed 491 articles in total, accounting for 41%, while the top 10 in the Scopus database contributed 576, accounting for 45%, which means that the research related to TCM in the Scopus database is more concentrated in the top institutions. At the same time, the top 10 institutions in both databases are Chinese institutions, which, on the one hand, shows China's leading position in research on TCM and, on the other hand, reveals that research on TCM is still limited worldwide, with few foreign institutions participating or contributing. In Figure 4, CiteSpace 6.1. R6 has been used to draw the cooccurrence map of the published institutions of the relevant literature on the treatment of COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine. A total of 245 nodes and 427 connection lines were obtained. 245 nodes refer to 245 institutes. 427 Connection lines indicate the collaboration network between different institutes. The thickness of the ring depicts the value of the betweenness centrality. According to the \u0000gure, China Acad Chinese Med Sci and Beijing Univ Chinese Med are the institutions that published the most articles. Both contributed 77 articles in the past 3 years, with Beijing Univ Chinese Med's betweenness centrality (0.17) slightly higher than that of China Acad Chinese Med Sci (0.13). Shanghai University Tradit Chinese Med contributed 61 publications, Tianjing University Tradit Chinese Med contributed 49, Chengdu University Tradit Chinese Med contributed 48 and Chinese Aca Sci contributed 41. China Med Univ (0.23) contributed 17 articles with the highest betweenness centrality, which is used to detect boundary-spanning potentials and novel brokerage connections in scholarly publications(\"the overview of betweeness centrality,\" 2023). Moreover, Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Capital Med Univ, Sichuan Univ, hubei Univ Chinese Med, Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med, Nanjing Med Univ show a relatively higher centrality compared with the number of their publications, which indicates their higher level of connection and collaboration with other institutes during the research. In contrast, Shanghai University Tradit Chinese, Chengdu University Traidic Chinese, Fudan University, and Huazhong University Sci & Technology are more prone to develop TCM in COVID-19 on their own. To form an intensive and uniform research system for TCM, institutes in China should develop an integrated model with shared information and scienti\u0000c research achievements. 5.5 Analysis of sources Frontiers In Pharmacology is the source publication that has by far contributed the most documents about TCM related to COVID-19, with 30 articles in 2021, with CiteScore 6.6, SJR 1.143, and SNIP 1.388. Chinese Traditional And Herbal Drugs, contributing the second in the period, published 35 documents in 2020 and took the leading position. It saw a drastic decrease in 2021, similar to Medicine, which also dropped from 32 to 8 documents in 2021. Medicine United States published 29 documents in total, experiencing a slight increase in the period and reaching a peak of 13 documents in 2022, with CiteScore 2.7, SJR 0.47, and SNIP 1.009. Page 11/205.6 Analysis of key words From the Keyword map of Table 8 related to both TCM and COVID-19 research, a total of 320 nodes and 742 connection lines can be obtained. The \u0000gure in Table 8 represents the topics studied in the \u0000eld of TCM related to COVID-19. The top 5 frequently occurring keywords in the literature are traditional Chinese medicine, network pharmacology, coronavirus, molecular docking and coronavirus disease 2019, suggesting that these may be hot spots that have been extensively studied in the \u0000eld. It is worth noting that \"cytokine storm (o.11)\" is the only keyword whose betweenness centrality is over 0.1, which means that it plays a vital role in linking other keywords as a hot spot. The keywords beside traditional Chinese medicine and COVID-19 can be summarized into three types: traditional Chinese medicine (herbal medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, decoction, xuebijing injection, etc. ), medical terminology (network pharmacology, in vitro, acute respiratory syndrome, acute lung injury, cytokine storm, in\u0000ammation, NF-kappa B, ACE2, etc. ), and the outcome of treatments (e\u0000cacy, randomized controlled trial, systematic review, etc.). It is worth noting that among the key words, there are seldom any TCM terminologies except for Xuebijing injection. Chinese herbal formulas for the treatment of and capsules, and Xuebijing injection are the three TCM products that have been approved to treat patients with COVID-19 by the National Medical Products Administration of China(Xiong et al., 2021). Xuebijing injection is one of the treatments among the \"three drugs and three prescriptions\" recommended by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.Page 12/20 The top frequency keywords with the strongest citation bursts in 2020 included acute respiratory syndrome, wuhan, infection, and mers cov, and the top keywords from 2022 to 2023 were identi\u0000cation, lianhua qingwen, mechanism decoction, rat plasma and mortality. In 2020, the research topic mainly focused on the disease itself, which slightly turned to the solution, treatment, methods and results in 2022. In Figure 6, the keywords can be clustered into ten groups by the CiteSpace clustering method: drug-metabolizing enzyme, cardiovascular system, human coronaviruses, testing treatment, core outcome, systematic analyses, systematic review, traditional usage, ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and apparent discordance. 5.7 Analysis of references Page 13/20In Table 10, Huang CL obtained the highest citation rate of 197 times in the past 3 years, followed by Yang Y and Zhu N, whose articles were cited 173 times, Ren JL 166 times, Li RF 157 times, Guan W 141 times and Hu K 132 times. The references cited in articles are rather scattered, among which the article published by Hu K (0.07) obtains the highest centrality, showing its contribution to other studies. There are a total of 592 nodes and 872 links within Figure 7, indicating a rather high rate of overlapping references in the selected 1185 articles. After optimizing the layout and style of the clustering based on keywords and label clusters with indexing terms, the statistics show that there are 15 clusters of references: systematic review, clinical characteristics, natural compounds, modern medicine, meta-analysis, pneumonia, treatment, COVID-19, randomized controlled trial, fecal-oral transmission, lianhua qingwen, network pharmacology, SARS-CoV, molecular dynamics, drug, repurposing, complementary and alternative medicine. The articles cited in the cluster are closely related to each other. In 2022, treatment, modern medicine and Lianhuaqingwen became hot spots in the \u0000eld. Table 11 illustrates the 5 top references with the strongest citation bursts together with their strength and duration. Bursts mean a frequency surge of a particular type of event. Citations by Xiong XJ, Su HX, Ni LQ, Wiersinga WJ and Zhao J present a sharp increase from 2021 to 2023, which demonstrates that their research results are the frontier results during this period. 5.8 Analysis of \u0000nancial sponsor According to chart 4, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) established in the 1980s supports 224 articles on TCM as a treatment for COVID-19. For the past 30 years, the NSFC has made tremendous achievements in promoting the construction of basic disciplines. The second most productive sponsor is the National Key R&D Program of China, supporting 90 articles. The following \u0000nancial sponsors have relatively fewer articles, such as the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China with 22 articles and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation with 18 articles. VI. Discussion 6.1 The translation of TCM In the 5.6 keyword analysis, it is shown that almost all the medical terminologies mentioned in the published articles are translated with the strategy of domestication. Domestication and foreinization are two concepts of translation strategie proposed by Lawrence Venuti in 1995 regarding the degree to which translators make a text conform to the target culture. In the international communication of traditional Chinese medicine, these two strategies should be considered together during the course of translation. However, through the articles retrieved with the topic of \"traditional Chinese medicine\" in the list of high-frequency keywords, it is di\u0000cult to see any transliteration or speci\u0000c terminology used only in TCM. According to the literature about TCM published in the WOS and Scopus databases from 1989 to 2018, compared with foreignization, domestication in translation was the dominant strategy in translating Chinese medicine ingredients. For example, Wutou alkali was translated to aconitine, and Danggui acid was turned into angelic acid. Foreignization bene\u0000ts interdisciplinary research with compound analysis while losing national characteristics within TCM.(Wang & Tingyu, 2019) Overly catering to the needs of the Western medicine system would diminish the nature of TCM, which in essence holds a different theoretic system from Western medicine. TCM focuses on the harmony of the human body as a whole. There is no equivalent terminology in Western medicine. Thus, transliteration is necessary in some cases to preserve the original meaning of TCM and stay loyal to the source culture. Current translation can adopt dual translation as a transition, whichPage 14/20can preserve the culture while helping target language readers understand the content, such as translating \"Fenghuo Yan ( \u0000\u0000\u0000 )\" (drastic purgative treating method)\"(En & Sulin, 2022). In regard to the specialized concepts that only exist in TCM, domestication can preserve the particularity of TCM and build a close connection between the source language and target readers, such as translating \"Pizhu Yunhua ( \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 )\" to \"the transportation and transformation the control of spleen\" and \"Ganfeng Neidong ( \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 )\" to \"endogenous wind of liver\" (Yu et al. 2017:1468-1469). The classic literature of TCM contains a complete theoretical system that can only be fully conveyed by its own metaphors. Traditional Chinese doctors focus on the human body from a holistic view. Instead of treating the disease itself only, some traditional Chinese doctors choose to heal the body and improve the overall state. There was a huge gap between the need in the TCM translation market and the talents nurtured by traditional teaching methods. Thus, translators with rich TCM knowledge were an indispensable part of the international communication of TCM. Moreover, the translation of TCM lacks systematic research. Until 2022, only 13 out of 24 colleges and universities of TCM in China had established undergraduate English programs, and only 6 of them had built English master's degree programs (Si and Si, 2022). A talent training system in TCM universities remains to be established. Additionally, different research groups should enhance cooperation, reduce duplicate research and establish standardized translation networks. There are more than 1000 pharmacopoeia books about TCM, of which only approximately 20 books were translated(Liu, 2021). Western At present, there are only three TCM translation corpora built in China: the English-Chinese parallel corpus of traditional Chinese medicine established by Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Chinese-English bilingual corpus platform of traditional Chinese medicine established by Jiangxi Normal University and the parallel corpus of classical Chinese medicine literature created by Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine(Wang & Tingyu, 2019). The World Health Organization, World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies and International Organization for Standardization/Technical Committee are the international standards for the translation of TCM(En & Sulin, 2022). However, the existing translation standard focuses mainly on qualitative research, which lacks empirical research in general. Moreover, some medicines often appear in different translations based on different standards, which greatly undermines the spread of traditional Chinese medicine worldwide. There is an urgent need to build a comprehensive corpus for international communication, along with a standardized discourse system and terminology criteria. 6.2 Research orientation On the one hand, the development and modernization of the TCM industry has bene\u0000ted greatly from the Western medicine system. Computer- aided, structure-based drug discovery helped to narrow down a large amount of natural compounds of TCM into a relatively short time with limited resources(Ling, 2020). On the other hand, research articles on TCM presented or published in international conferences or some professional journals tend to sacri\u0000ce some traditional Chinese culuture contained in the TCM in exchange for Western recognition. To date, more than 1,500 amateur teaching institutions for traditional Chinese medicine have been established in foreign countries, which could nurture approximately 30,000 TCM medical staff around the world (Si and Si, 2022). During its merging into the Western medical system, traditional Chinese medicine has been experiencing the process of modernization and westernization to bridge the gap between eastern and western mediacal systems, even sometimes at the loss of the original theoretical framework or the expression of the original discourse. Due to discrepancies in culture, history and philosophical views of health care and medication, the possible harm of traditional or herbal medicine to the human body has been wildly exaggerated by Western governments, rather than by telling their citizens to comprehensively understand and cognize, even to utilize the eastern traditional medical system and theories that have been proven to be scienti\u0000cally useful in the long river of history. Thus, facing inconsistent or even polarized international patterns, it is necessary to spread Eastern cultures and philosophical thoughts in proper English discourse along with international communication or the process of the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine. Yin Xiong and Min Gao et al. (2021) performed research on traditional Chinese medicine or herbal medicine related to COVID-19 using the Web of Science Core Collection, MEDICINE, Current Contents Connect, and SCIELO Citation Index databases and found that among 634 records of TM/HMs, 48.9% of the data were contributed by institutes in China, compared with only 13.56% of the USA. TCM prescriptions and therapies were included and recommended in the guidelines released by the State Administration for Market Regulation and adopted in all stages of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of COVID-19. Chinese people today are accustomed to adopting \"integrative\" treatment by receiving TCM and biomedicine at the same time. In the international spread of traditional Chinese medicine, a cognitive change in the use of Chinese herbals as one of the most common interventions is of the utmost importance. Most herbal medicines sold in Western countries are marketed as food or dietary supplements rather than for medical uses. In general, Western countries lack traditional use and well-designed clinical trials(Xiong et al., 2021). Although TCM has suggested great clinical experiences and effective and applicable herbal formulas for the inhabitation and treatment of respiratory diseases, the unfavorable environment for traditional medicine in western counties cannot be changed overnight yet. Thus, for better acceptance of TCM, the spread of TCM culture, philosophy and theory should be along with the pharmacy to build a friendly foundation among the Western public. 6.3 Incompatible media imagePage 15/20Although TCM has gradually gained scienti\u0000c acknowledgement worldwide and shown a rather steady publication trend in international journals, public opinion toward TCM is still distorted by Western mass media. For example, Lianhuaqingwen was researched and developed by Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical Company, which contains Forsythia suspensa and Lonicera japonica, to treat in\u0000uenza and contributed \u0000rst in 2003 in the \u0000ght against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Developed from two prescriptions, Maxingshi Sweet decoction and Yinqiao powder, which contain at least 11 herbal components, have been authorized by the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA) to treat SARS, tape an in\u0000uenza virus, H1N1 pandemic in 2009, H7N7, H3N2 and coronavirus disease-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in 2020 and have also been widely used as treatments for common cold with wind-heat syndrome, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), amygdalities and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(Shen & Yin, 2021). Other clinical applications have also demonstrated the effectiveness of Lianhuaqingwen and other o\u0000cially recommended medicines. Kai-tao Yao and Ming-yu Liu et al. (2020) analysed the clinical effect of Lianhuaqingwen in the treatment of COVID-19 and demonstrated that Lianhuaqingwen can signi\u0000cantly relieve cardinal symptoms in COVID-19. In a retrospective study, Lianhuaqingwen reduced fever duration and improved patients' symptoms. However, despite satisfactory clinical effects, the acceptance of traditional herbal products among Western countries is still low. Some media outlets deliberately discredited TCM and made up all kinds of conspiracy theories to safeguard the interests of large Western pharmaceutical companies. The accusation was pointed out at Zhong Nanshan, the most celebrated commercial health professionals who, as an epidemiologist, was appointed to head an expert group at the National Health Commission due to his contributions after managing SARS in 2003. The Western media claimed that Zhong recommended Lianhuaqingwen because of his commercial ties with pharmaceutical factories(Primross Riordan, 2022). The spread of these kinds of rumours not only undermined the image of Chinese epidemiologists and reduced government credibility but also damaged the reputation of TCM as a whole. To date, there has been no con\u0000rmed effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the main approaches are only symptomatic and supportive treatment. Thus, because of the above reasons, the Western media frequently took advantage of the occasion to deny the e\u0000cacy of TCM, even to wage a virulent hate campaign against TCM. Therefore, in the external communication of traditional Chinese medicine, by spreading the culture, philosophical thoughts and theory of TCM, Chinese media, network platforms, Chinese students studying abroad and overseas Chinese should have international discourse power and take the initiative to spread TCM, approximately eliminating Western audiences' misunderstanding of TCM. VII. Conclusion and Future Research In conclusion, the research and development of traditional Chinese medicine worldwide is in a steay improvement in the research \u0000eld, but it is still mainly centralized in China's institutes, and the relative research and the acceptability of Chinese herbal products in Western countries remain insu\u0000cient and rather unsatisfactory in general. As a result, Chinese research institutes and meia and pharmaceutical companies should increase collaboration and scienti\u0000c connections with Western countries to form an intensive research, propaganda and sales network worldwide. The literature retrieved from the databases of WOS and Scopus reveals that the acceptability of TCM in the Western world, especially by the Western medicine system, is far less than people's expectations, which not only in\u0000uences the international communication of TCM but also worsens the health of people all over the world, especially in an emergency. At the same time, some Western media maliciously throw doubt on the Chinese government recommendation on TCM to the Western, creating obstacles for TCM to be trusted by the world, which is undersirable and a great disservice to their people. In the future, only by integrating traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine can we guarantee people's health and obtain a harmonious symbiotic environment. For the translation strategies in the international spread of TCM, the combination of domestication and foreignization in the translation of TCM should be the major consideration, which can ensure that the foreign cultural elements of the source text presented in the target text can also make the audience's reading barrier-free. In addition, the cooperation between research institutions, researchers and translators at home and abroad should be further strengthened, forming a uni\u0000ed standard for better communication.
