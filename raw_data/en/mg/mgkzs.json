Anh Bui Associated Press LOS ANGELES -They couldn't vote the day Proposi\u00ad tion 187 passed. Two days later, they became American citizens. For 7,000 immigrants who were sworn in as U.S. citizens during a ceremony Thursday , joy was tempered by sadness over the passage of a California measure that would deny schooling , welfare and most health care to illegal aliens. \"I'm feeling bad because it's not right,\" said 28-year-old Car\u00ad los Urrutia, who fled civil war in EI Salvador six years ago and took his place in the crowd to r~cite the citizenship oath before a federal judge. 'Urrutia said he had entered the United States legally but worries about a pregnant rela\u00ad tive who doesn't have permis\u00ad sion. He also worries about ille\u00ad gal aliens he has never met. \"It's harder living in this country without papers,\" Urru\u00ad tia said. Ernesto Bautista said he can do more than just complain now that he is a citizen. \"At least now I can vote,\" Bautista said. Francisco Ortiz, 42, another in the group at the Los Angeles Convention Center, was born in Mexico and sees hope in this country despite overwhelming support for Proposition 187. \"That's why I became a citi\u00ad zen,\" Ortiz said. \"There are laws we don't agree wit\\l, but we're still Americans .\u00b7 He, too, said he had entered the country legally.

A federal judge on Wednesday barred enforcement of the mea\u00ad sure for a week until a hearing. A state judge blocked enforce\u00ad ment of the sections expelling illegal immigrants from public schools. The fallout continued Thurs- day: . Cuba, which this year saw thousands of its citizens flee to the United States, condemned the measure. Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos callild it \"xenophobic and discriminato\u00ad ry.\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block reported that Immigration and Naturalization Service officials have said they don't have the money to enforce the measure and don't plan to change any procedures . In Los Angeles, where the new Americans waved flags and. hugged family members, there was a lot of talk about Proposi\u00ad tion 187. \"If they ask for my papers because of the color of my skin, I'll just show them,\" said Jorge Calderon, 44, from Mexico. \"But no vaccinations for children, taking the kids from school - that's what really bothered me.\" Santiago Rodriguez, a truck driver who illegally entered the United States from Mexico 24 years ago, said he could not care less about the measure . He said it is easy for illegal immigrants to work around the system, and Proposition 187 would not change that. \"If they put a road hazard in, you just have t:o overcome it,\" he said. \"Have they stopped illegal immigrants from coming in? No, nothing is going to change that. ~ The Federal Communications Commission Thursday adopted a plan that will allow cable systems to increase rates when they add channels to \"expanded basic ser\u00ad vices,\" which are regulated levels of service above the lowest-priced basic tier. They include an array of cable networks from,MTV and USA to CNN. Under the plan, cable operators could charge up to $1.50 a month -or a total of $18 a year -over a two-year period, FCC officials said. In return, subscribers could get at least six new channels . In the third year, operators may Systems have been permitted to charge an additional amount per channel, plus a 7.5 percent markup . The increases can be passed along to subscribers . The FCC also adopted a provi\u00b7 sion to allow cable subscribers to be charged an unregulated price for other cbannels added to their systems'lineups. These channels, which can be anything not previously carried on the system, could not be added to With the new product tier, cable subscribers will be sble.to buy new channels only if they want them. By contrast, when additional channels are added to regulated services, consumers have to pay for' them whether they want them or not. Or they could terminate their cable services, said Commissioner Susan Ness. The plan's two compo\u00ad nents, she said, give both con\u00b7 sumers and cable systems ~a lot of flexibility. \" flUJn'l.

Clinton said that he, too, would like to cut taxes, but he cautioned, \"If we do this, we need to pay for it. We don't need to explode the deficit again. We do not need to weaken the economic recovery again.\" Speaking more strongly, he vowed at another point. \"To\u00b7those .who would use this election to turn us back, let me say this: I . will do all in my power to keep anyone from jeopardizing this eco\u00ad nomic recovery by taking us back to the policies that failed us before,\" he ~aid.

It's taken lots of work and we'd .like to thank those who where patjent. For those who don't know us, we've gathered together our shop philososki: . The Spoke is owned and operated by people serious about their sports. As with cycling, there is no aspect of snow sports with which we have not experimented. We've each become devo~ed to our own choice: some choose alpine, some snowboarding; others skate and cross country, sill others telemark. We're devoted and addicted. In our mind, a shop owned or run by people who are not adamant users is not capable fo fully serving you. We're here, more than anything, to make sure you get what you need and what you want-from rentals to race. skis. If you leave the store without the knowledge you sought, we've failed. ' We're not your discount cneter. You can buy your skis at Big 5-where they are always 20% off-but you'll gel the service you deserve. The Spoke, quite simply, gives you the best prices you'll find each and every day, along with the knowledge and service of a true ski shop. We've been in business half a year, and since day one others have been trying t9 copy what we do.

It's a world where the line between entertainment and politics is quickly blurring -witness the recent political campaigns . One TV commentator said about the debates in Massachu\u00ad setts that Mitt Romney looked thinner and younger than Ted Kennedy ; apparently the waif look has punctured political cir\u00ad cles. On a recent Larry King interview with President Clinton, King asked Clinton's opinion about whether cameras should be allowed in the courtroom of the O.J. Simpson case. President Clinton and O.J. Simpson . Where's the connection? Next thing you know, we'll be hearing arguments to allow the media to find out what Judge Lance Ito is wearing under his black robe. Can you see it now? \"Robes are in and baby doll dresses ar~ out. Next, on 'Hard Copy!' \" Speaking of President Clinton, anyone who thinks he's approached them sexually can ride the wave of fame on the talk show circuit, but they better bring along some Dra~amine; those waters can get pretty rough. Somehow, though, the link between Gersldo Rivera and the credibility of the president doesn't easily pop into mind. George Bush recently appeared on an epis'Ode of \"Saturday Night Live.\" He was funny. He mocked Dana Carvey mocking him. The question on everyone 's mind is whether Bush is now a comedian or a former politician. It's not like there's much of a difference anyway. Marion Barry is mayor again. Can you believe this? Did some voters out there think they were watching an episode of \"COpSb when Barry was caught smoking crack on video? That was real life, not a TV show. Apparently , not many Washington vot:ers understood the difference. . Thankfully , Oliver North was denied his bid for senator, but just barely. Here's a man who has been badmouthed by mem\u00ad bers of his own party -some of the most visible and popular Republicans. But he still rode awfully close on Chuck Robb's heels. Maybe we'll see North touting some new book: \"Iran ... And Lost.\" .New Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich recently used the tragic murders of Susan Smith's children in South Carolina as a r~ason to vote Republican . If it's on TV, it's fair game. Let's elect Phil Donahue for president in '96 (there are. rumors), and let's get Oprah Winfrey on the Supreme Court. Watching the political candidates debate is reminiscent of v.:atching a scene from some play. TV commentators tell us who bes retained their composure under the lights and the pressure, but it's up to us to decide who is the better actor. The only thing missing is the playbill. 'The line between entertainment and politics is not just far fr;om being distinct, it's extinct. But you can make sense of all of this depending on what channel you choose to watch and who you believe will affect reality. But we still live in a sick world. It's just too bad that there isn't universal health-care coverage to cure us.

Just take a quick walk through Old Capitol Mall and You'll see the telltale signs. Christmas decorations are up in stores, holiday sale promotions are going and there is the most damning proof of all: the sign advertising the first appearance Qr Santa -in a week. ,:So far, the pace in the malls is not yet fra,ntic, but it soon will be. The day after Thanksgiving is one of the biggest shopping days of the year, and from that point on the eeason gets more 8)ld more hectic. Malls get hot and crowded, and both shoppers and store employees get irritable. This all'works to destroy the IIpirit of the holidays. ',So wqat can we do about this? ~t, if you drop something or lnock something- off a rack or shelf, pick it up and put it back l\u00a5here it was. It doesn't take that much effort and should be a ~atter of common courtesy. Also, don't put off your shopping uhtil a few days before Christmas and then get angry and com\u00ad plain when a store doesn't have what you want. It's not the .lItore's fault if you procrastinate. Finally, be patient when ftJu're irllong checkout lines. The clerks are usually doing their best, and everyone is in the same boat at this time of year. ::Another aspect. that can cause problems is the time period tight after Christmas when the returns start flowing into ~tore8. When you have a return, don't go into a store with a con\u00ad ftontational attitude. Most stores are very conscientious about keeping customers happy and are more than happy to do , rtlturns without being bullied into it by an angry customer. Wait until you run into a problem before being confrontational. Also, always keep your receipts. It's standard procedure for btost stores to require a receipt on a return, especially if you fiant a cash refund. Don't use a gift. you have received for a l\"eek or two and then return it because you decided you don't !ike it. I~s dishonest and it costs the stores money, which gets patlsed on to customers by. way of higher prices. .' These kinds of things may seem trivial, but they can make a ~erence. If we treat each other with some respect and under\u00ad ipmding, then we can keep the levels of irritability down and il]ake the holidays more enjoyable for everyQne. Maybe we can ~ven recapture some of that holiday spirit that people have ~n claiming we've lost. For no more effort than it would take, if seems like it would be worth a try. . ~ .: . . .

So perhaps the answer (certainly the only solution that seems to answer each of these contingencies) is to approach life with an eye for the middle ground, with a philosophy which would never initiate violence and would only respond to aggression in kind when no other course is available seems to be a reasonable solution in today's world,. For we still must deal with unexpected, unprovoked aggression from small-minded would-be bullies who never suc\u00b7 cessfully graduated from that third-grade mindset with the rest of us. voked violence. A debate over the concept of pacifism erupted between several friends and I recently, and their pa.cifism struck me as having two impor\u00ad tant qualities: It is very well-intentioned, and it is inadequate. The discussion has led to a great deal of soul\u00ad searching on my part. Until very, very recently I hll'Ve advocated a form of \"an eye for an eye\" philosophy which has al1\\>wed me to support such concepts as the death penalty. But I ques\u00ad tion that point of view now; it looks as though that set of beliefs on my part may have been too limited. Part of the realization leading to my recon\u00ad sideration of this position came while ponder\u00ad ing the Palestinian-Israeli attempts to main\u00ad tain peace. Some members of both communities are still looking to even up the score, in their view, for dead relatives or comrades -to col\u00ad lect their fair share of eyes, as it were.

It has always seemed common sense to me that matching punishment for the transgression was the proper route because I felt that this was the only way to communicate to an aggres\u00ad sor what they are doing to others. We must both occupy the moral high ground and be prepared to deal with random and unprovoked aggression.

That is not true in the College of Liberal Arts, where the number who receive little or no training should be nil and is extremely small. It is true that some departments in the College of Liberal Arts do a much more thorough job than others in training Teaching Assistants to teach or lead discussion sections or laboratories in their programs. In order to ensure that every Teaching Assistant receives appropriate training. the college last year began incorporating examination of the training and supervision of Teaching Assistants into-the periodic reviews of General Education Requirement courses for approval or renewal of approval. The college has also strongly encouraged a number of departments to begin more formal TA training activities and has recommended that they get advice from the successful programs about how to create such training programs, Professor Russo is quoted to have said of foreign T As, whose cultures may have different notions about how to relate to students, that \u00b7we just throw those T As in the classroom: That is not true at all: Foreign T As receive excellent teaching practices from the TAPE ITeaching Assis\u00ad tant Preparation in English) program offered by the English as a Second Language programs under the oVersight of the Department of Linguistics.

Despite being in 10th place in the Big Ten, the Hawkeyes have not given up on this season, and neither have their fans. During Iowa's last home game against Michigan State, the fans proved to be a major difference between victory and defeat. \"Thank God for Iowa fans and Kinnick Stadium,\" Hayden Fry said after the game. \"That was one of the more electrifying crowds since I've been here. It seems to be typical or traditional that the Iowa fans get into the ball game. There's no question, that inspired our players. Even on the sidelines, the guys were talk\u00ad ing about it. It's a great feeling.\" Quarterback Mike Duprey, who came all the way from the No. 4 quarterback position to lead the Hawkeyes to victory over the Spartans, knows the fan support was down a little bit towards the middle of this season, but was more than willing to accept the reversal. \"Sometimes they get a little quiet in Kinnick when things aren't going the Hawkeyes' way,\" Duprey said. \"It was a great change to hear everyone on our side yelling and giving us great support.\" Junior linebacker George Bennett will remember this year's crowd not just for the Michigan State game, but for the Michigan game as well. \"The crowd has been an incred\u00ad ible factor,\" Bennett said. \"I per\u00ad sonally have enjoyed it a lot. I remember the Michigan game was incredible. We were in front of the student section and they (Michigan) were on offense beginning to start a drive. It got so loud that you could hear the sound traveling through your whole body. It gives you a sense of pride and makes you want to go out and win, not just for your\u00ad self, but for all the people behind you. For me personally, it's been a great thing.\" That kind of support is a big reason Iowa went to a bowl game with a 6-5 record last year.

I've been here Homecoming game against for five years. We've gone to the Northwestern this season with a Rose Bowl and no bowl twice record of 5-1, managed only and the Alamo Bowl. One thing's 39,208 fans for the contest. for sure, the fans are always going to be here,\" Mady said. And according to Fry, that num- ber may even have been \"This is the only place in stretched. America where we're going to \"I talked to a guy over there and beat Michigan State and the fans he said they probably stretched are going to rush the field. I that three or four thousand,\" Fry mean, we're 3-5 and the fans are said. \"They've been averaging rushing the field. What's that aU between 33 and 34 thousand.\" .aW~ . t: beeD.lfJiIW~,t,NI.\"tl;., John Hartlieb, who grew up in the stands of Kinnick Stadium, watching older brothers Chuck and Jim play, was somewhat shocked to see the lack of support Indiana received. \"We're real fortunate (at Iowa). You see a lot of stadiums, like Indiana at Homecoming, they had around 32,000 I think, which is pretty pathetic,\" Harlieb said. \"It's just l1een a privilege to play in front of our fans for all my five years. Even this year, we may not deserve the following, but I think there was 66,000 for Michigan State even. That's incredible.\" The Hoosiers' Memorial Stadium holds 52,354 fans, a number that hasn't been reached since 1979. Indiana's largest crowd of the last 15 years is 52,133 in 1988 against Ohio State. That year the Hoosiers I went 8-3-1 and were 3-0-1 com\u00ad ing into the game. Purdue's Ross-Ade is the largest football stadium in the state of Indiana, holding 67,861 fans. Purdue barely topped 40,000 for its Homecoming game against the Hawkeyes two weeks ago. Situations like this make Hawkeye players even more grateful for Iowa fans. \"You're always going to have a good crowd here at Iowa,\" Matt Sherman, Iowa's starting quarter\u00ad back this weekend against the Wildcats, said. \"They're always going to sup\u00ad port you no matter what happens. We're going to have a great turnout on Saturday against Northwestern when most univer\u00ad sities wouldn't have the biggest turnout. That's the mainstay of our football program- the peo\u00ad ple that support us. The universi\u00ad ty has a great support system and that really helps us out.\" Duprey agrees there is no sub\u00ad stitute for a great home crowd. \"It gives you an extra boost when 70,000 people are on your side,\" he said. \"I mean it just lifts you up and makes you more emo\u00ad tional. Maybe you might be down one play, but the crowd will get you into it and it will help you out for the rest of the game.\" Most people wouldn't think Iowa's fans could compare to the IOO,OOO-plus fans that pack into Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor Saturday afternoons, hut Mady and Bennett disagree. \"The Iowa fans are fantastic,\" Mady said. \"There better than any fans stadium I've ever been to, even better than Michigan with 100,000. I think our fans here are 10 times better. They're die hard and they'll pack the stands no matter what.\" Bennett agreed. \"I don't think anybody reaUy gets into the game as much as the Iowa fans, at least not that I have seen,\" Bennett added. \"Playing at Kinnick is playing at the best place in the world.\" More than 61,000 are expcted to fill Bennett's \"best place in the world,\" Saturday for Iowa's game with Northwestern . It would be the smallest crowd of the year for ~K,wk~\u00a5es. 6C -The Daily Iowan -PREGAME \u00b7 Friday, November 11, 1994 The Iowa Memorial Union River Kootn [; 3 WU\u00a3E.LRooM ~I 0 IOWA !tIEMORIAL ~ ~ 00 '0 0 ~DO DO 009,00 *Felipe Penza, Hairstylist *University Box Office *Recreation, Center 0 ,r-- fF1 -~ Ir-j1 L-.l 0 \u00b7 Need We Say More? r I s b .

Scoa MehnkeyfThe Daily Iowan Fullback Kent Kahil. one of 19 Iowa aenlora playing his final game at Kinnick Stadium Saturday. like triplett The Daily Iowan When the Iowa Hawkeyes step onto the field Saturday, it will be more than just an annual meeting between a pair of Big Ten oppo\u00ad nents. For 19 Hawkeye players, Saturday will mark their last game in Iowa's Kinnick Stadium. Most of these seniors came to Iowa in either 1990 or '91, when the football program was at its best. For the fifth-year Hawkeye seniors, their career at Iowa began with a trip to the Rose Bowl. But times have changed since then. For the third time in the four or five-year reign of these seniors, Iowa will not be headed to a postseason bowl game. Although this is disappointing to many, it doesn't bother senior captain John Hartlieb. \"It would have been a lot better, obviously, to go to a bowl and finish out the way we started in 1990-91,\" he said. \"But this sea\u00ad son definitely won't be a sour note.\" Iowa coach Hayden Fry agreed that a sub-par Iowa season won't take anything away from what these seniors have done in their ,tenure with the Hawkeyes. -------\"You can't look at just one sea\u00ad son. You have to take the entire experience of college and college football,\" Fry said. \"They've been through more hard times and adversity , but they've fought extremely hard. They've given tremendous effort and they've had a positive atti\u00ad tude. They've still got their digni\u00ad ty and they've still got their pride. \"I'm probably as proud of these guys as any group I've had here. As far as effort and loyalty and trying to do the best, this is a spe\u00ad cial group.\" Perhaps one of the qualities that Fry finds so special is the play\u00ad ers' commitment to winning, despite the number of distractions the Hawkeyes have faced. Senior offensive lineman Hal Mady agreed and said he's glad he chose Iowa. \"I'd realIy like to win the last two games so I can leave here with a good taste in my mouth,\" he said. \"I'm satisfied with the football team and with the whole University of Iowa experience. I've met a lot of great friends and I've had a lot of good, good times.\" Senior wide receiver Anthony Dean also contentment with the time he spent at Iowa. \"I don't have any regrets. When I came to Iowa, the first thought in my mind was to get my degree and I'll do that this December,\" Dean said. \"I've met some people and opened some doors for myself. I'd say, about the whole Iowa experience, if 1 could do it all again, I would.\" Dean, Hartlieb and Mady, along with the 16 other Hawkeye seniors will be introduced in front of the home crowd Saturday for the last time. They feel some farewelI cheers would be nice, a standing ovation even better. But most of all, these Hawkeyes want a win over the Wildcats. Team captains John HartUeb: The linebacker from Woodstock, III., is the last of a dynasty. This season was the 11th consecutive with a Hart1ieb on the Iowa roster, with older brothers Chuck and Jim playing quarterback for the Hawkeyes in the past.

M r - Pregame Northwestern vs. Iowa November 11, 1994 . 9 \u00b7Getting better all the time After a frustrating 1993, Iowa's offensive line has regrouped and expects to improve further next season Patrick Regan The Daily Iowan Iowa's '94 season has mirrored last year's campaign in nearly every way, with a good start, a five-game losing streak and the makings of a decent finish. But there has been one major dilIer\u00ad ence-the play of the offensive line. \"When it comes down to the time to get things done, I just think you have to get down to the dirt of it,\" Mady said. \"I thjnk the offensive line rose to the occa\u00ad sion and I think the occasion was we had to run because we couldn't pass-bottom line.\" The starting front five of Ross Verba, Matt Purdy, Casey Weigmann, Fritz Fequiere and Brian McCullouch is one of the smallest in the Big Ten, but also one of the most effective. None of the Hawkeye starters up front weighs more T. Scott Krenz! The Daily Iowan Member. of the Hawkeye offensive line block 10 .. to Michigan Oct. 1.The Hawkeye. will return during an extra pont attempt during Iowa'. 29-14 all but two starte,. to the line next year. Last year the offensive line was blamed for the Hawkeyes' fail\u00ad ures, now it rrught be considered the s~ength of the team. \"I think the offensive line has made some big steps this year,\" senior lineman Hal Mady said. \"We've let up a rrunimum num\u00ad ber of sacks as opposed to last year and the year before obvious\u00ad ly. I think as a whole we feel pretty good about what we've done.\" The line can feel more than just 'pretty good' about what they have accomplished. They were largely responsible for Iowa's turnaround in its last two games against Michigan State and Purdue. Behind huge holes from the line, fullback Kent Kahl has put together back-to-back lOO-yard rushing games. Running back Sedrick Shaw has over 200 yards in the last two contests and Iowa is 18th in the nation in rushing offense. Down to its No.4 quarterback than 285 often. If the line can repeat their recent performance against the Spartans and Boilermakers when Iowa picked up 679 yards on the said. \"I think we're a lot stronger at this point tban we were last year. Last year we were more of a detriment to the squad and this year we're a little more positive.\" The Hawkeyes pounds. By con\u00adtrast, Northwestern boasts three players of more than 285 pounds on its offensive line. From a coaching standpoint it's so simple that al/ they needed was experience. They just needed to play and they were going to become bener and better, and they have. average 227.4 yards per game on the ground. By comparison, Iowa picked up a minuscule 108 rushing yards per game last Perhaps the most impressive season. -Hayden Fry The poor rush\u00ad ing totals combined with the high number of sacks left Hawkeye fans wondering what was wrong with the offensive line last sea-aspect of the '94 Hawkeyes is their pass protection. Ryan Driscoll, Iowa's No.1 quarterback to start the season, was not sacked in hjs six games as a starter. In fact he was rarely touched until he scrambled out of the pocket against Indiana and broke his collarbone. ground, it will help Saturday's starting quarterback Matt Sherman get the passing game going. \"I hope we can get the running game going like we did against Michigan State and keep pound\u00ad ing and pounding the ball because that will open things up for me with the passing game and make things a lot easier,\" Sherman said. Despite their success, Mady is reluctant to label the offensive line as Iowa's strength. \"When you're 3-5-1 I don't ~~S~~~~~;\"~,,, ~~,\"~ i~1.i4Q~can l . .. . .... son. According to Iowa coach Hayden Fry, the problem wasn't the personnel or the effort, just a lack of experience. \"They were all real young,\" Fry said. \"In fact (for) all of them (it) was the first time for them start. From a coaching standpoint it's so simple that all they needed was experience. They just needed to play and they were going to become better and better, and they h8\\le/\u00b7 While he doesn't normally start, Mady is the glue that keeps the line together. He has played guard, tackle and center during his career at Iowa and fills in wherever be is needed. \"I've played a different posi\u00ad tions and its really hard some\u00ad times never having a specific spot,\" Mady said. \"Its been a long series of ups and down.\" Mady is one of only three senior offensive lineman on the two\u00ad deep roster and Fry is optimjstic about the future. Freshman Jeremy McKinney switched to defensive line mid\u00ad way through the year due to injuries on that side of the ball, but will probably be back on offense for next season. Ian Davis, a 307 -pound sopho\u00ad more tackle will be ready to reclaim the starting role he lost at the beginning of the season because of a knee injury. \"They'll be better next year and we'll be better as a total football team because a lot of the guys come back and they've been through a lot of hard knocks and they've improved,\" Fry said.

Like many freshmen football players at major universities, Burger, a tight end, chose to red\u00ad shirt his first season of college football. The decision for him came pretty easy. \"The main reason I redshirted was to put on weight,\" the 6-foot- 3-inch Burger said. \"I came in at 192 pounds and that wasn't near' enough the weight they wanted me to be at. So they told me red\u00ad shirting would be the best thing. Plus it's another year of educa\u00ad tion. But that was the main rea\u00ad son-to put on weight.\" For Burger, and many other red\u00ad shirts, the hardest thing about sit\u00ad ting out his first season has been not being able to strap on his uni\u00ad form and take his hits Saturday afternoon. \"It gets a little old when you're not playing in any games, but we usually try to have those Hawk hitters before the home games on Fridays and that helps out. You get a little game action, but other\u00ad wise I don't see any disadvan\u00ad tages to it.\" You just think in the back of your mind that you're helping out the team in the best way that you can. -Mike Burger Iowa red shirt The Hawk hitters are games for players wh,o won't be competing on Saturday afternoon. Burger has yet to run out of the tunnel with the team in front of 70,000 screaming fans at Kinnick Stadium. Instead, he is one of those screaming fans. Burger and the rest of the Iowa redshirts sit in the stands either in the end zone or with their parents during Hawkeye home games. And when the team plane leaves for a road game, Burger is left behind to concentrate on other endeavors. Although some of the redshirts have traveled in case they were needed in the event of an injury, Burger has yet to take a road trip with the team. \"It gets to you a little bit, but you get used to it after awhile. You just think in the back of your mind that you're helping out the team in the best way that you can and you know that that's your role on the team right now. So really you just get used to it. You fit into that role and you just try the best you can do,\" he said. Most redshirts use the year off to adjust to to college life and being away from home, but Burger already went through the transition . His parents moved to Omaha, Neb. when he was a senior, but Photo Courtesy Chris Knipper Left to right: Iowa freshmen Tim Dwight, Jared DeVries, Chris Knipper, Mike Burger, and Steve English pose after last year's Iowa Shrine Bowl. All five will have an Impact on Iowa's future. he stayed behind to finish his high school career at Harlan High School in Harlan, Iowa, living with friends and family. In that respect, things have been a little different for Burger than most redshirts. But then again, Mike Burger is not your average college football player. In a day and age when student-athletes are the exception and not the rule, Burger is getting the best of both worlds. Along with being part of the Iowa football team, Burger is a pre-medicine major, Burger's road to the Iowa City was a glorious one. He was named to the elite all-State team as a senior in high school and his See REDSHIRT, Page 11 I Smalll-1bpping Pizza I THAT'S I SOME I Af\\tr thl14me,JI\\~ J6 \u00a3:. .... 11/1W4 I Valid Iocallons any oIner Prices YiIIY.

IOWA OFFENSE Hawkeyes needed overtime High school football has overtime .. Professional football has it. Division II college football has it, but why doesn't Division I have overtime? This is the Question many Hawkeyes were asking two weeks ago after their game with Purdue ended with the score tied at 21. Purdue could have won the game with a field goal with seven seconds left, but Brad Bobich's attempt sailed wide. Several Hawkeyes said they almost wish he had made it. \"I don't like losing, but I'd rather have a loss than a tie,\" linebacker George Bennett said. \"If you lose you can get down on yourself. If you win you're really happy. But a tie, how are you supposed to react?\" With a 3-5-1 record, the tie is haunting the Hawkeyes. Iowa has only two games remaining and fin\u00ad ishing with an even record at best is not sitting well with the players. \"A tie feels like a loss. That was the attitude in the locker room,\" Quarterback Matt Sherman said. \"A lot of people were down because we couldn't get our winning season and it was a game that we really wanted to win.\" So why end the game with the score tied? The fans don't like ties, the coaches don't and the players really don't like them. \"It's one of those things with col\u00ad lege football. The bowls don't have playoffs (either). It's just the history of the game and they don't want to change things around,\" Sherman said. Like the issue of college football playoffs, the players don't dwell on the lack of overtime. \"(The tie is) in the past and we really can't do anything about it, so we just try to learn from what we did positively and negatively because it's done,\" Bennett said. End of an era In the fall of 1984 a new dynasty in Hawkeye football began with the arrival of Quarterback Chuck Hartlieb. Since then, Iowa has not played a game without a Hartlieb on the roster. Hartlieb's younger brother Jim, also a Quarterback, followed Chuck and played for the Hawkeyes from 1988-92. John, a linebacker and the youngest of the Hartlieb brothers, joined the Hawkeyes in 1990 and will end the family's Kinnick Stadi\u00ad um playing days Saturday against Northwestern . Iowa coach Hayden Fry said the Hartllebs are the first family to have three Hawkeye football players and added John has had to overcome a lot this year to play at the level he has played. M. Scott MllhaskeyfThe Daily Iowan Iowa coach Hayden Fry reacts during the first three quarters but Iowa came back and scored Hawkey .. ' 21-21 tie at Purdue two weeks ago. The three touchdowns In the fourth quarter to earn the Boilermakers .hut out the Hawkeye. through the tie. It wa.lowa'. flr.t tie .Ince 1988. \"It's amazing that the's even been playing. He's played on one leg for at least three-fourth of the year. But he's a Hartlieb,\" Fry said. John said his parents, Jim and Chuck as well as brother Andy, who broke the Hartlieb trend by going to WisconSin in 1986, will be at Satur\u00ad day's game. Not until he's good and ready Rumors have surfaced that Fry could be ready to call it a career. At age 65, people say he might be con\u00ad sidering retirement According to Fry the rumors are wayoff. \"If you're alive and you're healthy, why shouldn't you stili be good and stili be active doing what you enjoy doing,\" Fry asked. With the Hawkeyes' recent lack of success, some fans expect Fry to get fed up and retire. Once again, he said they don't know what they are talking about. . \"I'm the type of guy you can't put your finger on. Don't ask me why, it's just my personality. I've always been like that,\" Fry said. \"So if I retire at the end of the season, you shouldn't be surprised. I'm not going to do it, but that's just the way I am.\" Fry also said age souldn't be a factor. \"That's another fallacy. That (age) 65 tag was put on way back there,\" he joked. \"\"II look forward to retir\u00ad Ing when I can't get out of my wheelchair. \" Healthy Q8 Quarterback Matt Sherman said he has recovered from a broken foot he suffered in practice after the Penn State game In September. Sherman saw his first action slnca the Inlury two weaks ago at Purdue. He completed one of two passes for 23 yards. . \"It's as good as it's going to get. It's not 100 percent yet but it's get\u00ad ting better every day,\" Sherman said Tuesday. \"I'm feeling more confi\u00ad dent on it every practice and every time I walk on it.\" Sherman, who started the season as the team's No.2 quarterback, will . start for the Hawkeyes Saturday. On the season he has completed 9-of- 15 passes for 147 yards and one touchdown and no interceptions . Quote of the week Fry to the media in reference to Iowa State coach Jim Walden's recent resIQnat\\on. \"Everybody's rested, refreshed and looking for copy. I don't have anything.

C Tt Wildcats ready to challenge Hawks Chris Snider The Daily Iowan \"Beat Iowa!\" For years, that has been the Northwestern battle cry. \"They dislike us more than any team in the Big Ten and have through the years,\" Hayden Fry said Tuesday at his weekly press conference. \"When (offensive line) coach (Frank) Verducci was on the staff at Northwestern, they had one banner in the locker\u00ad room-'Beat Iowa'. Not 'Beat Ohio State' or 'Beat Michigan.' Everything was concentrated on beating Iowa. Because of a lot of different things like that, we've always taken these people seri\u00ad ously.\" The Hawkeyes have taken them seriously enough to win the last 20 meetings between the two schools, including 11 straight at Kinnick Stadium. But this year, Northwestern has other plans. The Wildcats are 3-0 on the road this season, with vic- This is the best football team they've had. (Norhtwestern has) the best running attack they've had and the best defense they've had. They've got real quality players. tories at Air Force, Minnesota, and Indiana, and are looking for number four against the Hawkeyes. The Wildcats are coming off a pair of home losses to I1linois and Michigan State, but know that beating Iowa can salvage the sea\u00ad son somewhat. One thing beating Iowa would do is give the Cats four victories, a feat they havn't reached since 1986, when they finished 4-7. The year hasn't been all disap\u00ad pointments for Northwestern, which beat Indiana 1n Bloomington three weeks ago, 20-7. -Hayden Fry Iowa head coach Northwestern brings a 3-5-1 record into the game, identical to Iowa's record. Last year, Iowa left Evanston with a 23-19 victory. Northwestern outgained Iowa in rushing yardage, total yardage, and time of possession, but Iowa made the best of their opportuni\u00ad ties to earn the victory. This year, both teams are stronger. ''This is the best football team they've had,\" Fry said of Northwestern. \"(Northwestern has) the best running attack they've had and the best defense they've had. They've got real quality players.\" The Wildcats are led by senior running back Dennis Lundy. Lundy rushed for 141 yards last week against Michigan State to put him over the 1 ,000 yard mark for the season. He is Northwestern's all-time leading rusher with 2,949 career yards. Last year, he sprung for 137 yards on 35 carries against Iowa. Defensively, the Wildcats are led by free safety William Bennett and linebacker Danny Sutter. Sutter has ItO tackles on the season, ranking him second in the Big Ten behind lllinois' Dana Howard. Bennett is second on the team with 90 tackles. Northwestern's kicking game is one of the best in the conference. Punter Paul Burton leads the Big Ten with a 43.0 y'ard average, including a 56.6 yard average on five punts against Air Force earli\u00ad er in the season. Kicker Sam Valenzisi is 12-of-16 on field Wby Wai~? goal attempts this season, includ\u00ad ing a 52 and a 51 yarder. He is also perfect on 18 extra-point attempts. Offensive linemen Todd Baczek and Matt O'Dwyer are the first 300-pounders ever to play\",t Northwestern and are part of the Wildcats biggest offensive line ever. Despite the 20-game winning streak, Iowa will not be taking the Wildcats lightly. \"This is as big a game as Michigan for us,\" quarterback Matt Shermann said. \"We have to go in there with that attitude.\" The Wildcats are coached py Gary Barnett, who is in his third season. He is 8-22-1 at Northwestern and 16-33-2 for his coaching career. Saturday could be the Barnett's last chance to win a game this season. Northwestern rounds out its season next weekend at Penn State.

The race for No. 1 is no clearer this year than it has been in the past. The solution is pretty sim\u00ad ple. Until there is a playoff, there will not be a true No.1. College foot\u00ad ball has quite a traffic jam at the top right now Legitimate arguments can be made for at l:iiiiiiiiiiiiii~ least three teams to be No. 1. Auburn hasn't lost a game since the 1992 regular season. The Tigers are currently on probation, but that shouldn't disqualify them as the nation's top college football team. -Penn State has one of the top offenses in the country. The Nittany Lions are waltzing their way through the Big Ten this year and will continue to do so all the way to Pasadena. The Big Ten isn't exactly stocking the Top Ten this season, but it is quality from top to bottom. -Nebraska is rolling through a weak Big Eight schedule en route to yet another undefeated regular season. The reason the Cornhuskers hold the top position in the polls is they manhandled their one quality opponent of the season; Colorado. As for the three contenders, Auburn will not be considered. The probation factor eliminates the Tigers from any postseason play. This includes the SEC championship as well as any bowl games. Cheaters never pros\u00ad per, especially with the AP. Penn State could be in an even more frustrating situation . The Nittany Lions can challenge any team in the country, but have only had the chance to prove it once this season. Their 31-24 win Not Only Are We BeCOming Famous for Our New Dinner Entrees ... We Are Creating the Ultimate Dining Experience for Kids! 1402 S. Gilbert I.C. 337\u00b77696 900 1st 2208 at Michigan was the Nittany Lions' last chance to sway voters. Joe Paterno's squad is on the road at Illinois Saturday, but unless the Nittany Lions completely dis\u00ad mantle the lllini defense, they probably won't draw any voters to their cause. What's frustrating for the Lions is they should win the rest of their games, but the final one will be in the Rose Bowl against a less-than challenging Pac-lO champion . Going undefeated through the Big Ten is impressive, but beat\u00ad ing a Pac-lO team isn't. Penn State's non-conference schedule of USC, Rutgers and Temple probably isn't helping the cause . Nebraska is in a position oppo\u00ad site to Penn State.True, the Cornhuskers also played a lack\u00ad luster non-conference schedule. Facing UCLA, Wyoming and Pacific as well as regular-season opponents Iowa State, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma isn't quite enough to qualify the Huskers' schedule as remotely difficult. Apparently the voters think other\u00ad wise. Nebraska will have the chance to prove it is the best in the Orange Bowl, where the Cornhuskers will probably face Miami. A win over the Hurricanes in Miami would more than likely give Osborne the undisputed title. Although Nittany Lions won't playa great team in the Rose Bowl, The they deserve at least a share of the national title. I'm not a big fan of splitting the polls, but under the current system it seems like the fairest option. Neither team had a schedule significantly more difficult than the other. They both beat the teams they needed to beat. Maybe if they had a chance to face each other, the polls would have a real champion ... This is where the bowl coalition is a factor. I was really excited when it was introduced a few years ago. Finally the bowls were trying to make New Year's Day football games mean something. I'm not as excited\u00b7today. The bowl coalition voters have a ten\u00ad dency to vote for who they want to rather than who is deserving. Any doubters of this need only to look to last year. As much as it pains me to admit it, Notre Dame had a legitimate gripe and should have been voted No. I. The bowl poll looks to be well on its way to making a similar mistake this season. With the Big Ten champion lockeO into a Rt9se Bowl bid, that team is virtually taken out of contention.

Healthy Iowa too strong to lose, at home Coming into the final home game of the season, Iowa has three big things going against it. For starters, the Hawkeyes are coming off a bye week. While it's good in that it gives some injured players an extra week to get healthy, a week off for the Hawkeyes often leaves them rusty. Iowa's last bye week came at the end of September last season. The Hawkeyes were coming off a 31-0 loss at home to Penn State. Iowa had the following week off and proceeded to drop its next four games. This year the Hawkeyes' momentum coming out of the bye isn't much better. Iowa's 21-21 tie at Purdue two weeks ago was more disappointing to some play\u00ad ers than a loss. It shouldn't have the same effect as a loss, but it's far from a win. The final factor going against the Hawkeyes is that Northwestern has improved . The Wildcats are no longer the peren\u00ad nial cellar dwellers of the Big Ten -Minnesota has taken over the dubious honor. Coming into Saturday 'S game Northwestern (2-4 in Big Ten play) has one more conference win than Iowa and the two tearns have identical overall records of 3-5-1. Iowa has not been setting col\u00ad lege football on fire lately. Injuries have plagued the Hawkeyes throughout the season and played a big role Iowa's five\u00ad game losing streak earlier this season. The Hawkeyes broke the streak against Michigan State last month and came from behind to tie Purdue, but momentum isn't going to carry them to wins in their last two games. What will carry them is a healthy quarter\u00ad back who has shown he can throw the ball. Matt Shennan should be the dif\u00ad ference Saturday. Sherman began the season as the Hawkeyes' No. 2 quarterback. He would have taken over as the starter after Ryan Driscoll broke his collar\u00ad bone against Indiana, but he had broken a bone in his foot during practice in September. Sherman said his foot is close to 100 percent and he is ready to lead the Hawkeyes. Although Saturday will be his fU'St start, the redshirt freshman is as experi\u00ad enced as any of four remaining quarterbacks. numbers aren't spec\u00ad tacular, but he has shown poise and confidence when he's been called upon to throw the ball this year. Facing the Wildcats' defense, which gives up an aver\u00ad age of more than 227 passing yards per game, could establish Sherman as the front runner to start next season. Adding a revised passing game to the Hawkeyes' already-estab\u00ad lished rushing attack should enable the Hawkeyes to roll. . On the other side of the ball, Iowa's defense should be more than a little bit excited to face Northwestern . The Wildcats currently rank last in the Big Ten in total offense as well as scoring offense. They rank 'second to last in rushing and passing offense. The Hawkeye defense has given up too many points this season and they should turn things around against the Wildcats. Playing at home should also give the Hawkeyes a boost. Iowa has only lost two games at Kinnick Stadium this year and the Hawkeyes were within range of winning both late in the sec\u00ad ond half. No team in the Big Ten is an absolute pushover . The Hawkeyes know this and are not taking Northwestern lightly. Although they are inconsistent, the Wildcats are capable of seof\u00ad ing a lot of points and upsetting some teams. Fortunately for the Hawkeyes, the Wildcats' rise to the top of the Big Ten is far from complete and Iowa should hang on to close out its home season with a win. -DougAlden e NEVER A COVER The ......

With remaining games against Northwestern, Michigan State and a lackluster bowl opponent, the mini (6-3, 4-2 in the Big Ten) could be the only thing standing in the way of an undefeated sea\u00ad son for Penn State (8-0, 5-0). While the Nittany Lions boast the top offense in the country, the llIini will counter with the No. 4 defense. No team has been able to shut down Penn State's Heisman Trophy candidates IG-Jana Carter and Kerry Collins, but they have yet to face Big Ten sack leader Simeon Rice or tackles leader Dana Howard. A win for the Fighting Illini would solidify their position as the No.2 team in the conference, as well as aid their Citrus Bowl hopes. But Penn State has more than a Rose Bowl bid on the line. A shot at the national champi\u00ad onship hinges on the Nittany Lions' performance, as they learned last week losing ground in the polls after a 35-29 win at Indiana. The voters sent a mes\u00ad sage to all title contenders: It's not winning that counts, but by how much. Penn State destroyed Ohio State 63-14 two weeks ago. Look for a similar result Saturday in Champaign. Purdue at Michigan State George Perles will coach his last game at Spartan Stadium Saturday after being fired on 'IUesday. Perles would like nothing more than to go out on a winning note. Both Michigan State (4-5) and Purdue (4-3-2) have bowl game aspirations, but a loss would eliminate either team from win\u00ad ning the necessary six games to qualify. Both squads are tied for fifth in the conference with Wisconsin and are trying to crack the first division of the Big Ten. That's a major turnaround from a year ago when the Boilermakers went win\u00ad less in Big Ten play. Despite Purdue's improvement, Saturday will belong to Perles and the Spartans. Michigan State fans won't soon forget the bowl appearances and Rose Bowl championship the Spartans eamed under Perles. The Spartan fans will carry Michigan State to an emotional win. Ohio State at Indiana The Hoosiers (5-4) are seeking that elusive sixth win that would qualify them for a bowl game, but they might not get an invite -even with six or seven wins. Indiana's bowl potential has plummeted in the midst of a three-game losing streak. Meanwhile, Ohio State has its sights set on bigger and better things. At 7-3, the Buckeyes are tljt fighting for a New Year's Day bowl. But more important than a bowl for the Buckeyes is next week's game with Michigan. A win against the Wolverines would get John Cooper off the snide in Columbus. Ohio State may be looking ahead to Michigan and Indiana could jump out to an early lead, but it won't last. The Buckeyes simply have too much talent for the Hoosiers to handle. Minnesota at Michigan The Gophers are in the base\u00ad ment of the Big Ten and their sta\u00ad tus won't change after Saturday. But Michigan is not as invinci\u00ad ble as it once seemed. The Wolverines appeared ready for a national title run after a win at Notre Dame, 'but Kordell Stewart sent Michigan reeling with his Hail Mary touchdown pass. The Wolverines never recovered and have lost three games in Ann Arbor already this year. Michigan has nothing to play for in this game except maybe fear of embarrassment. Minnesota could call.jts season a success with an upset. Realistically, the Gophers have no chance. This one will be over at halftime. Cincinnati at Wisconsin Cincinnati has no business play\u00ad ing on the same field as Wisconsin, and the Badgers should be ashamed this game is on their schedule. At 1-7-1, the Bearcats should be proud if they are within three touchdowns after the first quarter. What's sad is they probably won't be. Brent Moss' recent arrest for possession of cocaine will not be a factor. The Badgers have won this season while he was out with injuries, they should be able to play through this incident. -Patrick Regan River City Dental Care\u00ae GENERAL DENTISTRY '1St,!

But even getting in the game was somewhat of a minor miracle for Burger, who played with a broken wrist. \"It was in the semifinals in the first half.\" Burger explains. \"The play was basically over, but the whistle hadn't blown yet. I was going to get up, and the guy piled on. My wrist hyperflexed and I broke it. I didn't think I was going to get to play the next game, but they popped me full of some pain killers and I just went out and did the best I could.\" The best he could was one of his greatest games ever. \"In his final game, he played an excellent game with only one hand,\" his high school coach Curt Sladt said. \"Most people wouldn't even have attempted to play, but he did and had one of the most outstanding games of his career.\" In his prep career, Burger totaled 2,374 yards on 110 catch\u00ad es with 30 touchdowns. He owns school career records for receiv\u00ad ing yards, receptions, and receiv\u00ad ing touchdowns at Harlan High School. He also rushed for 1,479 yards in three years. But tight end was where he wanted to play and that's what brought him to Iowa. \"I came here because Iowa has great tradition of tight ends. In one position, you get to block, you get to catch the ball and you get to run-all the components of football you could want,\" he said. His list of college choices ranged from Notre Dame to every small college in Iowa, but his final three came down to Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa. In the end, it was Iowa coach Hayden Fry who kept him in the Hawkeye state. \"The other thing that brought me to Iowa was probably Coach Fry and growing up in Iowa. I always wanted to be a Hawkeye,\" he said. \"(With) tight ends like Marv Cook, AI Cross, Mike Flagg, and Scott Slutzker -who GRAB A SACK Huge variety from which to choose! Call ahead for fast pickup- 89 2nd St. On the Coralville Strip Coralville, IA 52241 354-1272 is going to be a great tight end - I just want to follow in their foot\u00ad steps and hopefully come out a success like thoy did.\" Fry believes, through hard work, Burger wiII have success at the college level. \"He's done an exceptional job. He's so intelligent and catches on so quick. Unfortunately, he's been wounded. He's back now, he's got a brace on his knee, but when he's been at practice, he's an exceptional youngster,\" Fry said. \"He's going to have to put on probably 20-25 pounds to be heavy enough to be an impact player at tight end, and that's the posi~ion he wants to play. He only goes 195-200 pounds, so he's going to have to gain a lot of weight, but he will. He's that dedicated.\" Putting on the weight is his main football responsibility right now. It's not easy, but he knows he can do it. \"I try to eat anywhere between 5000 and 7000 calories a day. Sometimes it's hard to gain the weight so I just drink a calorie shake. It's just hard to eat some\u00ad times, but it's getting there. It's a slow process, but hopefully by next year I'll put on about 10 pounds.\" Burger gives a lot of credit to his high school coach for helping him excel on the field. \"My coach was probably one of the biggest role models that I've had. He knew that I had talent and he basically just let me use it. That's what I liked about him. He's probably one of the best coaches that I'll ever have. He's really a personable type of guy. He makes practices fun and I think that is why our program is so successful,\" he said. Burger hopes that success will continue through college. With Iowa's strong nucleus of young talent, it very well ~ay. \"Our class is so excited about what is going to go on. We keep talking about how we want to win. That's all we talk about. I think we're going to be a very close class. They say we're one of the best recruiting classes Iowa has ever had. Hopefully we live up to that.\" Burger is just as goal-oriented away from football as he is on the field. \"He was all-stat~ football, ) played in basketball, exceptional in track,\" Fry said. \"Mike's done' it all. He was valedictorian of his class, 4.0 GPA. He's just a great young man, and a super student.\" Deciding whether football of school comes first is a selection Burger has had to make. \"That's a tough question, but I have to be a student first. One of my ambitions is to get into medi\u00ad cal school here, so I've got t~ really push my grades. Grades have to come first and football has to come second, but football is a really close second, really close.\" For now, Burger has to concen\u00ad trate on getting ready for next season and prepare to run out that tunnel in front of 70,000 fans, for the very first time ..
