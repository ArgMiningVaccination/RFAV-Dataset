I love to remind clients that they were born to heal. If we cut our finger our body automatically jumps into action to repair the damage. Providing we are willing to get out of the way of the innate healing process, that cut will heal in no time. We're all on the healing journey back to wholeness and for some the focus is physical health and healing and for others it's about the mind, emotions or spirit. It is an understatement to say that we are living in a complex time. Whether we like it or not, our body, mind and heart are under the pump like never before. If you are wanting to de-stress, improve your health or change gear, then you're in the right place. Around the turn of the 21st century we entered a new world age - the Age of Aquarius - heralded as a time of great change. All that isn't build on firm ground is becoming apparent, making way for new levels of awareness and the improved health and wellbeing that come with it. It is time for us individually and collectively to feel, think and do differently now. The new world is to be built on principles that authentically serve not only our own life but that of others including this beautiful planet on which we live. Keywords for the Aquarian Age that will guide us forward, include: Nature ~ the return to and respect for the land including greater use of plant-based foods and herbal medicine Individuality ~ the celebration of each others individuality and our unique path to wellness Self-responsibility ~ the ability to participate in our own healing and health outcomes, and the sense of empowerment that comes from this Vibration ~ understanding that everything is energy including ourselves and the ability to think and feel from a different wavelength. I assist my clients to understand the nature and potentials of this new time. The better we understand the drivers of this Age, the quicker we can lean into and direct a new reality where we are authentically happier and healthier. Two levels of service are offered here at The Medicine Woman: Naturopathy ~ supporting the return of essential health and wellbeing for people of all ages. With a holistic approach and the support of plant medicine, the body has an innate ability to heal symptoms and chronic modern conditions. Soul Work ~ for individuals wanting to deeply transform their life to live with greater vitality, clarity and purpose. Our innate design means we are growth orientated beings and never given more than we can handle. If you would like my assistance to improve the quality of your life, I would love to help. May you find your good medicine in these pages and beyond. Arohanui. Cat Neale Naturopath | Medicine Woman | Life Mentor "}
