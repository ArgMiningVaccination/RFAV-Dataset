These prestigious positions honor our most accomplished physician and nurse-scientists and clinicians. They celebrate those who demonstrate extraordinary achievement in advancing scholarship, science, and human health. And perhaps most importantly, they nurture innovation, discovery, and the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge. As we seek to shape the future of health and health care at Duke Health, we are making endowed professorships a foundational priority. Philanthropic gifts to establish endowed professorships are gifts that last forever. Once inaugurated, they continue in perpetuity, passing in time from one exceptional faculty member to the next. Every endowed professorship is both a profound honor for the faculty member who holds it and a meaningful legacy to the visionary benefactor who establishes it. That legacy is evident in the pages that follow, as we profile our philanthropic partners who have generously invested in endowed professorships at Duke Health. They have demonstrated their commitment by empowering our acclaimed faculty, our sharpest minds, and most visionary researchers and educators to take on the most pressing health challenges and pursue promising scientific opportunities here and around the world. Great universities succeed on the strength of the partnerships they form with their supporters and benefactors. Everyone who establishes an endowed professorship at Duke Health joins with us in our mission to deliver tomorrow's health care today, accelerate research and its translation, and create education that is transforming. We are deeply grateful for these partners, who, as you will read, have propelled our professors and our institution to even greater heights of excellence and impact.

As evidenced by the faculty profiled in this book, Duke is home to individuals recognized for their efforts to transform medicine and health through pioneering scientific research and the translation of breakthrough discoveries to the most advanced care for patients. It is home to the most skilled and compassionate physicians and to passionate educators and mentors who guide our students and trainees. At Duke, we aim to be the destination of choice for the nation's most talented leaders and promising young faculty in biomedical sciences. Endowed professorships are perhaps the most valuable tool for the recruitment and retention of these high caliber individuals. As you see in the faculty profiled here, endowed professorships provide the brightest minds with the dedicated support needed to achieve boundary-pushing science, care for our patients and the community, and educate and train the next generation of leaders. These professorships are among the most far-reaching philanthropic investments one can make. We are profoundly grateful to the many donors who have joined with us to advance the bounds of knowledge. With thanks, Mary E. Klotman, MD Dean, Duke University School of Medicine Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs, Duke University School of Medicine Robert J. Lefkowitz , MD James B. Duke Professor of Medicine Awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for ChemistryRobert J. Lefkowitz, MD, was on track to spend his career as a clinical physician when the call of the laboratory became too insistent to resist. After his first six months as a senior resident at Massachusetts General Hospital, he broke from the customary path and returned to research, which he had gotten a taste for during two years at the National Institutes of Health. While he has spent the majority of his 45-year professional career in the lab at Duke, he continued to make clinical teaching rounds for decades and still holds an active medical license. His research on cell surface receptors earned him the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the first ever awarded to a Duke faculty member. Lefkowitz won the Nobel Prize for his seminal discoveries on G protein-coupled receptors, which detect a huge variety of stimuli outside the cell membrane and transmit signals to a G protein inside it, allowing the cell to respond appropriately. Because this process is involved in numerous diseases, G protein-coupled receptors are a target for more than a third of all modern pharmaceutical drugs. In addition to his research, Lefkowitz is renowned as a mentor. More than 200 graduate students and post- docs\u2014including Brian Kobilka, now at Stanford, with whom he shared the Nobel Prize\u2014 have learned under Lefkowitz's tutelage. And they still do, as he continues to explore the secrets of receptors because, as he once said, in science \"there's always a new detail to discover. It's like peeling an onion.\" Nobel Laureates6 DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPS DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINESee page 37 for Lefkowitz's professional profile.7 DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPS DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINEPaul L. Modrich , PhD James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry Awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize for ChemistryRobert J. Lefkowitz , MD James B. Duke Professor of Medicine Awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for ChemistryWhen Paul L. Modrich, PhD, was growing up in New Mexico, his father, a local high school biology teacher, told him, \"You should learn about this DNA stuff, because it's really interesting.\" Rarely has a father's advice been so thoroughly embraced: Modrich has spent his entire career studying \"this DNA stuff,\" and he's done it so exceptionally that in 2015 he was one of three researchers to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Modrich came to Duke in 1976 from the University of California at Berkeley and says he felt at home right away in a small department with an exceptional and collegial faculty. He carried on his research and won the Nobel Prize for some four decades of investigation into how cells repair errors that occur in DNA as chromosomes replicate. Errors in the genetic code frequently transpire during replication within the body's 10 trillion cells. These errors are recognized and corrected by mismatch repair (MMR), and Modrich showed how this works. His basic science research turned out to have significant implications for human health, as Modrich and others showed that defects in the MMR system are the cause of one of the most common forms of hereditary cancer and play a central role in the development of certain sporadic tumors as well. \"Science moves in little steps,\" Modrich says, \"and you don't always know where you'll end up when you set out.\"See page 32 for Modrich's professional profile.

Chen and his wife, Alice, have generously supported medical genetics research in the Department of Pediatrics with gifts including a professorship, an associate professorship, a fellowship, and an endowment to launch and operate the Y.T. and Alice Chen Pediatric Genetics and Genomics Research Center at Duke. \"Pompe disease is what is called an 'orphan disease,' one that affects fewer than 200,000 people worldwide,\" says Chen. \"In some ways, pediatrics is like an orphan department. While you find many endowed professorships in other departments at medical schools, there are very few in pediatrics. So I thought it was very important to establish one HONORING A FAMILY CONNECTION Y.T. Chen, MD, PhD, HS'78-'79, had offers from several medical schools when it was time to do his residency, but it was an easy decision. His father, C.L. Chen, had fallen in love with Duke in the early 1950s when he served in the Department of Pediatrics as the School of Medicine's first visiting fellow from Taiwan. His counsel was unequivocal. \"He said, 'Don't even think about anywhere else. Just go to Duke,'\" Chen recalls. He did, completing his residency and soon thereafter accepting About the Donors in pediatrics at Duke, especially in the medical genetics division.\" In 2011, the Chens marked his parents' 70th wedding anniversary by renaming the professorship in their honor. Their connection to Duke, initiated by Chen's father, is strong and lasting: both of their sons\u2014 Jerome, T'99, MHS'10, and Gerald, T'03, L'11\u2014graduated from Duke. And there are signs that more Chens may follow the same path; when their first granddaughter, Olivia, was born, then-President Richard A. Brodhead sent a letter congratulating them and welcoming Olivia to \"the Class of 2033.\" \"We now have three generations with links to Duke, and the fourth may be on the way,\" Chen says. \"So with all those connections, when we started to think about how we could give back, this was the first place we thought about.\"Y.

His research seeks to understand the role of the genes responsible for these genetic syndromes and the pathology of these disorders. The first step in Marchuk's approach is to identify the genetic loci underlying these disorders, providing the basis for molecular biological studies on the role of the mutant protein in the disease pathology and on the role of normal proteins in vascular development. Subsequent investigations require an in vivo model, usually a genetically modified mouse, which serves as a more tractable system to facilitate understanding of the biology of the gene product in vascular morphogenesis.

But like anyone who has received an organ transplant, her life has been forever changed. Adjusting to a new regimen of immunotherapy medications, following new diet and exercise guidelines, and facing the constant risk of organ rejection have become a part of everyday life. Haller and her family wanted to do something to make all these experiences easier for others. Though Shannon received the transplant elsewhere, she never forgot the kindness of some of the doctors she had initially consulted with at Duke. Through the Henry E. Haller Jr. Foundation, they made gifts to Duke to support patient education both before and after transplant, as well as specific CHANGING LIVES After learning in 2016 that her adult daughter, Kelly Shannon, had renal failure and needed a kidney transplant, Linda Haller of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, says her first reaction was to get her on every waiting list possible. \"When you read about it, that sounds quite easy, but it's really not,\" Haller says. \"I've looked back on that so many times and thought, how do people that don't have the resources we have do it? It's got to be incredibly difficult.\"Linda HallerAbout the Donors research projects to better understand and prevent transplant organ rejection. In 2020, the family, including Shannon's brother Kevin Boyce, who serves on the family foundation board, wanted to continue their giving to support scientific innovation, and they wanted to have a long-lasting impact. They decided the best way to do that was by endowing a professorship. The Boyce Haller Professorship in Nephrology will attract or retain a renowned faculty member involved in the study, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney disease. By providing dedicated time for a scholar to devote to the most pressing challenges in the field, the professorship will support innovation for many years to come. \"The ultimate goal is to just try to help more and more people,\" Haller says. \"We knew if we were going to give philanthropic support to any teaching institution, we really wanted it to become an essential tool in recruiting and providing resources that would guide the leaders to make greater impact on society, and so that we could in some small way make things better for other families in the same boat.\" The Boyce Haller Professorship in Nephrology is vacant.

Keith M. SullivanDUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPS DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF NURSINGDUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF NURSING It is a dynamic and important time of change in the field of nursing. The landscape of health care, including nursing practice, is undergoing significant transformation and is demanding more from the nursing profession. Accordingly, the Duke University School of Nursing is preparing future generations of nurses and nurse leaders to address today's greatest health challenges and set new standards for health care delivery. Nurse leadership in the coming decade will require a diversified and equipped nursing workforce prepared to address the social determinants of health with new multi-level health interventions and nurse-led models of health care delivery. Towards these ends, the professors you find in these pages are reimagining health care delivery with greater attention to prevention, overall wellness, disease management, use of technology in health care delivery, and locational preferences of individuals and groups. They are designing, evaluating, and disseminating practical and applicable nurse-led models of health care aimed at reducing health disparities and expanding health equity, and they are conducting critically important research and testing interventions to improve health outcomes. At this critical juncture, we must seek out and seize the opportunities that reduce health inequities and improve health care access and outcomes. We do this by seeking to recruit the very best nursing educators and researchers committed to equipping and empowering current and future generations of nurses to embrace leadership roles and implement approaches for addressing the social determinants of health. This could not be achieved without our extraordinary faculty or without the support of our most generous and dedicated philanthropic partners who enable us to attract and recognize the most accomplished scholars.
