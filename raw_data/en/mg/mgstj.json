Stoto, Director, Division of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Kathleen R. Stratton, Project Director Cynthia J. Howe, Program Officer Dorothy R. Majewski, Project Assistant Michael K. Hayes, Project Editor Tamar Lasky, Consultant Hanaa Elhefni, Consultant Preface Few would question the profound importance of vaccines to public health. Not only have deaths from the most common childhood infections been almost eliminated, but so have the devastating morbidities of diseases like measles, paralytic polio, and congenital rubella. This revolution has occurred within the life spans of middle-aged Americans, and it has led to major savings in medical costs and gains in work productivity, as well as to reductions in death and suffering. In the United States this success has been achieved through increased public awareness, continued support of basic and applied research, the capacity of the pharmaceutical industry, and the dedication of the public and private health care workers responsible for administration of the vaccines. In the 1980s, however, a few concerned citizens in this country began to raise questions about the risks of vaccination. In fact, although the benefits to society were obvious, the risks to individual infants and children had not been well defined. Some parents considered not having their children immunized, and manufacturers threatened to shut down vaccine production because of an increasing number of lawsuits. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in 1986 and the Vaccine Compensation Amendments in 1987. This legislation established a federal compensation process for persons judged to be injured by a vaccine. In addition, Section 312 of the Act mandated that the Institute of Medicine should conduct a scientific review of the possible adverse consequences of pertussis and rubella vaccines. The re- sults of that review were published in 1991. Section 313 of the Act mandated that a second Institute of Medicine committee review possible adverse events associated with the other vaccines commonly given in childhood. This report comprises the deliberations and conclusions of that committee, the Vaccine Safety Committee. The principal purpose of the committee's work was to describe as precisely as possible, on the basis of all available evidence, the relationships between the vaccines under review and specific adverse events. This led the committee to ask with each vaccine-adverse event pair, \"Can administration of the vaccine cause the adverse event?\" All available sources of information were analyzed, from epidemiologic studies to unpublished case reports. Final decisions on causality were made by consensus after group discussion of all of the available evidence. In pursuing its conclusions, the committee adopted a neutral stance and maintained that stance consistently through each step in the process, assuming neither the presence nor the absence of a causal relation between the vaccines and the adverse events until the evidence indicated otherwise. In reaching a conclusion that the evidence favored rejection of a causal relation, the committee used only epidemiologic studies (controlled observational studies and controlled clinical trials). In reaching conclusions favoring acceptance of a causal relation, however, the committee most commonly relied on case series and individual case reports. This required that the nature and timing of the adverse event were appropriate for causality and that there were no likely alternative explanations for the event. Biologic plausibility was weighed in the overall balance of the determination but was not in itself considered sufficient evidence to accept or reject a causal relation. As this report describes in detail, it was possible with some of the vaccine-adverse event pairs to reach a conclusion one way or the other\u2014either that the evidence favored rejection (category 3) or that the evidence weighed more or less heavily for acceptance (categories 4 and 5) of a causal relation (see [Chapter 2](19.html#p2000645b9970019001) for explanations of the five categories). With the majority of vaccine-adverse event pairs the evidence was considered inadequate to accept or reject causality. In some instances, the relation has not been well studied and the data are scarce; in others, the data are abundant but the evidence, on the whole, was not conclusive. Category 2 does not distinguish between these two situations, since the conclusion is the same. It could be argued in these cases that since the body of available evidence did not support causality, a causal relation does not exist. It could also be argued that in the absence of evidence favoring rejection of causality, it is possible that the vaccine could cause the adverse event. Both of these interpretations are possible. The committee regrets that this uncertainty may not make it easier to resolve litigation centered on individual instances of putative causality. However, the stringency of our charge precluded statements beyond what the evidence allowed. Concern about this unfortunate condition of uncertainty has led the committee to urge that more definitive research be done on possible adverse events during the development of new vaccines or vaccine combinations and to urge that efforts to sharpen current postmarketing surveillance systems be accelerated. This report represents the product of long hard work by committee members and Institute of Medicine staff. The Acknowledgments section lists a large number of other people who contributed to the effort in an important way, including parents who had the courage to remind us that public health measures affect the lives of individual human beings. In addition, the committee has recognized that it owes a special debt to its predecessor, the Committee to Review the Adverse Consequences of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines. That committee developed a logical system, on the basis of the available evidence, of classifying\u2014and thereby communicating\u2014the nature of the causal relations between vaccines and adverse events. The committee has also recognized that the quality of this report could not have been achieved without the work of the extraordinary staff assigned to us by the Institute of Medicine\u2014Kathleen Stratton, Cynthia Howe, Michael Stoto, and Dorothy Majewski. In particular, Kathleen Stratton, the Project Director, with intelligence, infinite kindness, and untiring persistence, kept the committee to its proper task; and we are deeply grateful. Whatever its commissioned intent, in the end, the work of the Vaccine Safety Committee will have succeeded if this report contributes to present worldwide efforts to protect children from preventable infections using vaccines that incur the lowest possible risk.
