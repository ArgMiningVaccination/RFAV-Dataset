Imojev contains the active ingredient Japanese encephalitis virus (live, attenuated). Imojev is a vaccine for persons of 9 months of age and over that helps to protect you or your child against Japanese encephalitis. When an injection of Imojev is given, the immune system (body's natural defences) will protect against Japanese encephalitis infection. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed. In adults, Imojev will generally begin protecting against Japanese encephalitis 2 weeks after the injection. In children, Imojev will generally begin protecting against Japanese encephalitis 4 weeks after the injection. Imojev will not prevent Japanese encephalitis if you or your child is incubating the disease before vaccination or if the encephalitis is caused by another virus. 2.

The vaccination should be postponed until after you or your child has recovered, - If you or your child has lowered immunity due to treatment with medicines such as corticosteroids or other medicines used to treat cancer (chemotherapy) (see Taking other medicines section), - If you or your child has lowered immunity due to diseases including HIV / AIDS or cancer, - If you are pregnant, - If you think you may be pregnant, or if you intend to become pregnant within four weeks of vaccination, - If you are breast-feeding.

Some medicines may interfere with Imojev and affect how it works. If you or your child is taking medicines that may reduce your immune response such as corticosteroids (for example prednisone), medicines used to treat cancer (chemotherapy), radiotherapy or other medicines affecting the immune system, be sure to tell your doctor.

In adults, Imojev may be given at the same time as the yellow fever vaccine using separate syringes, and injected into separate limbs. In children, Imojev may be given at the same time as vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella using separate syringes, and injected into separate limbs from 12 months of age. For children living in or travelling to areas where risk for measles is high, Imojev may be given at the same time as vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella from as early as 9 months of age. Tell your doctor if you or your child has had any vaccine in the last 4 weeks. Tell your doctor that your or your child has received Imojev if another vaccine is to be given within 4 weeks after vaccination.
