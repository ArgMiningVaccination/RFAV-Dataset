Natural skincare brands can be just as effective as other brands. In fact, oftentimes the natural ingredients mean fewer reactions and better results when you choose to use organic skincare brands. These are some of my favorite natural skin care brands that solve skin issues, are easy on the planet, and aren't tested on animals. Shop these sustainable skincare brands the next time you run out of product! Table of Contents sustainable skincare brands When I first started trying to reduce my waste in 2014, there weren't many organic, zero waste skincare brands on the market. If you've been following my blog for a while, you know one of my favorite spots in San Francisco has been [Credo Beauty](https://www.goingzerowaste.com/blog/my-favorite-zero-waste-skin-care-products/). While I've been impressed by their clean, organic skincare, and makeup offerings - I haven't been blown away by a lot of the packaging options. Packaging cosmetics, makeup, and skincare is tough businesses. It's not that they didn't care about their packaging, but there wasn't a collective conscious around the dangers of single-use plastics. Consumers weren't asking for plastic-free and zero waste products so brands weren't providing them. Thankfully, that has changed! A LOT. In fact, there are so many awesome clean, low-waste, plastic free, sustainable, all-natural, organic skin care brands on the market that I had a really hard time trying to narrow it down to just 20. All of these brands offer natural paraben free skincare products! Don't be surprised if I add to this list as time goes on because there are so many awesome natural skincare brands out there doing amazing things. In this post, I'm sharing a few of my favorite eco luxury skincare brands as well as some new ones I've recently discovered and want to try. If you're interested in eco-friendly and organic skin care, be sure to check out my post on [zero waste make up for a sustainable glow](https://goingzerowaste.com/blog/10-zero-waste-makeup-brands/).

Not all inorganic skincare brands are bad for your skin. However, your chances of avoiding harmful chemicals and allergens are much higher when you choose natural skincare brands. This is especially vital if you have sensitive skin (like I do!). Plus, you'll know your sustainable products are helping your skin as well as the planet. what are the benefits of using natural skincare products? The first is reducing the amount of toxins in your skin. Many organic products use powerful, natural antioxidants that support anti-aging, skin clearing, and anti-inflammatory efforts. They do all this without any of the harsh or harmful ingredients other companies use to 'fast' (but potentially harmful) results. So, would you give these natural paraben skincare products a shot?
