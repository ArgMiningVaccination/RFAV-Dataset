What is the mind-body connection? The mind-body connection is an important component of holistic wellness and health. It's a link between your thoughts, feelings, mindset, behaviors, attitudes, and physical health. Scientific studies are constantly revealing that the hormones and neurotransmitters associated with our emotions can also have physical effects. They can affect our blood pressure, energy levels, heart rate, sleep patterns, and even our appetite. How Emotions Impact Our Health When we feel stressed, our body releases two hormones: adrenaline and cortisol. Known as the \"stress hormones,\" they're supposed to give us a short-term energy boost (aka an adrenaline rush) so we can flee from a dangerous situation quickly. Often, as with anxiety, we can feel like we need to flee from danger when there is no real threat of danger. Releasing the stress hormones too frequently, due to anxiety, chronic stress, or overwhelm, can have negative long term impacts on the body including: Weakened immune response Digestive problems Healing more slowly While the connection between stress and health is easy to understand, it's harder to imagine that what we think about (or our mindset) and what we believe can affect our health, also. Negative thinking patterns, including assuming the worst, jumping to conclusions, and self-criticism, can also relate to health problems. For example, if you think \"I'll never be healthy because my family is very unhealthy\" then you may not make the steps to work on your health through therapy, exercise, nutrition, etc. Gut-Brain Connection According to [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection): The brain has a direct effect on the stomach and intestines. For example, the very thought of eating can release the stomach's juices before food gets there. This connection goes both ways. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person's stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause or the product of anxiety, stress, or depression. That's because the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system are intimately connected. Mind-Body Therapies Mind-body therapies are treatments that promote relaxation and encourage mindfulness. These therapies use the body to affect the mind, and the mind to affect the body.
