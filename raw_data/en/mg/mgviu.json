As a committee, we believe the documented algorithm is thought to be the most up to date, comprehensive and scientifically current treatment algorith m. The committee supports the adaptation of the algorithm prepared and approved by the Chief Medical Officer approval board . Sincerely, COVID -19 Scientific Committee Alric Simmonds, MD, Chair Ariel Watson, OTR/L, CAPM, Project Manager Rizwan Ahmed, MD Nancy Aldrich, MLIS -West, PhD, MPH, CPH Fortune Bhatheja, MD Carr, IDP Christopher Cooper, MD Cherie Danielson, BS Benita David, DBA Ensor, BC CCP, FCCM Daniel Lupu, PhD Frederick Mansfield, MD Sarah Minor, PharmD, BCPS ID Alberto Richard Pratley, MD Patricia Robinson, PhD, APRN, NE -BC Steve Smith, MD Jason Sniffen, D O Chief Medical Officers Neil Finkler, MD Vincent Carfi, MD John Davidyock, MD Dennis deLeon, MD Victor Herrera, MD Michael Keating, MD Jennifer Keehbau ch, MD Omayra Mansfield, MD Sanjay Pattani, MD David Sinclair, MD Joe Smith, MD Alric Simmonds Jr., MD 2 Updated 8/5/2021 12:21 PM AdventHealth Treatment Algorithm for COVID -19 in Adult Patients Disclaimer : The Scientific Re search Committee ensures timely review of emerging experimental therapies, therefore, off -label use of therapies with only published in vitro data should NOT be implemented until reviewed and sanctioned by this committee. The recommendations below are subject to change based on emerging data or drug shortage information. The m edications listed below (outside of treatment table) have been reviewed , but due to lack of evidence , these medications are not currently recommended for the treatment of COVID -19. All patients should receive supportive care (IV fluids, anti -pyretics, anti -emetics, etc.). ACE I/ARB: o The HFSA, ACC and AHA emphasize the lack of experimental or clinical data on these class of drugs in COVID -19 and recommend that patients currently taking t hese medications for known beneficial indications (HF, HTN, or ischemic heart disease, for example) be advised to continue. They advise against adding/removing beyond what would be done in standard practice and urge individualized treatment decision s based on patient's clinical presentation and hemodynamics. NSAIDs : o There is no evidence for or against the management of fever with NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is preferred for management of fever, but each clinical scenario should be carefully evaluated. Nebulized respiratory medications for patients: o Nebulized respiratory medications should be avoided in non -intubated patients unless otherwise indicated in patients with bronchospasms to prevent the spread of the COVID -19. For COVID -19 negative non -intubated patient s, nebulized respiratory medications are preferred over MDIs. o If indicated, inhalers (MDIs) with spacers are preferred for non -intubated patients . o If indicated, nebulized medications with a closed circuit may be used in intubated patients . Azithromycin : o Based on current evidence demonstrating lack of benefit in preventing invasive mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalize d patients, use of azithromycin for treatment of COVID -19 is not recommended. Ivermectin : o At this time, ivermectin not recommended for COVID -19, but this recommendation will be re -evaluated when results of ongoing randomized controlled trials are available. o Current evidence for benefit of ivermectin is weak and does not support the use of ivermectin for COVID -19; however, no significant risk of harm has been identified. o International COVID -19 Guidelines & Statements on the Use of Ivermectin for the Treatment of COVID -19: Merck Statement on Ivermectin use in COVID -19 IDSA Guidelines for Treatment of COVID -19 - Ivermectin Statement on Ive rmectin | COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines Micronutrients (Vitamin C and Zinc) o Adjunctive use of micronutrients in COVID -19 patients beyond the recommended daily allowances for supplementation is not supported by scientific evidence . o If utilization is necessary for the treatment of nutritional deficiencies, a once daily dosing strategy should be employed . 3 Updated 8/5/2021 12:21 PM Lopinavir /ritonavir: o Use of lopinavi r/ritonavir is not recommended because of unfavorable pharmacodynamics and negative clinical trial data . Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine : o Based on studies demonstrating harm and little clinical benefit, the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID -19 is NOT recommended outside of a clinical trial . Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) o Widespread use of tPA in critically ill COVID -19 patients is not supported by the currently published studies and, therefor e, is not recommended . Therapeutic options should be based on severity using the following scale: 0 = Patient on room air 1 = Patient requires supplemental O2 via NC up to a max of 6L 2 = Patient requires supplemental O2 in addition to 1 of the following : o Dyspnea or staccato speech at rest or after minimal activity o RR > 22 on 6L o PaO2 <65 mmHg with 6L o Worsening infiltrates preferred ) 3 = Patient requires HFNC, CPAP, or NIV 4 = Patient intubated with minimal support PaO2/FiO2, or using PS 5 = Patient intubated with PaO2/FiO2 > 150 mmHg 6 = Patient intubated with PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg 7 = Patient intubated with PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg AND requiring vasopressor support 8 = Patient intubated in prone position or ECMO Severity Score Treatment for Hospitalized Patients *^ 0 Supportive care only - If clinically stable, consider discharge for self -quarantine 1 Remdesivir (based on criteri a) Dexamethasone 6 mg po or IV daily for up to 10 days 2 Remdesivir (based on criteria ) Corticosteroids If patient cannot tolerate or does not respond to corticosteroids, consider Baricitinib\u00a5 Tocilizumab may be considered in cases of progressive hypoxemia (increasing oxygen requirement) with CRP>75 mcg/mL a fter receiving corticosteroids for at least 24 hours. Tocilizumab is not recommended for use in patients on low -flow oxygen with a stable clinical course. 3 Corticosteroids \u00b1 Tocilizumab or \u00b1 Tocilizumab *Patients can be discharged whenever clinically indicated. Full duration of therapy does not need to be completed if patient is suitable for discharg e to home . Isolation should be maintained at home if patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation. ^The decision to modify the recommendation for Convalescent Plasma was based on the RECOVERY study result s indicating lack of mortality benefit when compared to placebo in hospitalized patients ; however, immunodeficient patients were not included in this study and may still derive a benefit with convalescent plasma for severity score 2 or 3. \u00a5Because both bar icitinib and tocilizumab are potent immunosuppressants, there is the potential for an additive risk of infection. Use of baricitinib in combination with tocilizumab is not recommended. 4 Updated 8/5/2021 12:21 PM Recommended Laboratory Monitoring for all Hospitalized Patients with COVID -19: Daily CMP, magnesium, and CBC with differential Procalcitonin (PCT) at baseline and then every 2 days as needed CRP at baseline and then every 3 days D-dimer at baseline and then every 3 days Recommended Therapies for Hospitalized Patients (Click Here for Outpatient Recommendations) Drug Dosing Formulations Monitoring Adverse Effects Notes Remdesivir Criteria for use (see below) *Use beyond 5 days requires CMO approval 200 mg IV x 1 on day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily Duration: Up to 5 day s or until hospital discharge, whichever is first IV infusion Infuse over 30 minutes using dedicated IV line Prior to 1st dose: eGFR, hepatic laboratory, and prothrombin time During therapy: as clinically appropriate Increased Risk of Transaminase Elevations Bradycardia Hypotension Risk of reduced antiviral activity when co - administered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquin e Dexamethasone (or alternative, see corticosteroid below) 6 mg po or IV daily Duration: U p to 10 days Oral tablet, liquid IV infusion Glucose Minimal with low - dose and short- term use Safe in pregnancy Tocilizumab Restricted to infectious diseases or critical care providers See below 8 mg/kg IV (max 800 mg) x1 Duration: 1-2 doses If clinical signs/symptoms worsen or do not improve after the first dose, dose may be repeated once at least 8 hours after the initial infusion.

Refer to RDV Prescribing Information & RDV - Dear Healthcare Provider Letter . Emergency Use Authorization for RDV to treat hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg to <40 kg or pediatric patients <12 years of age weighing 3.5 kg with suspected or laboratory -confirmed COVID -19. Refer to RDV - EUA for Pediatric Patients or RDV - Fact Sheet for HCP (Pediatrics) . Criteria for Use*: Based on the available scientific evidence, the Scientific Review Committee supports the use of remdesivir in patients requir ing supplemental oxygen; however, the FDA approval for RDV permits trea tment for adults and pediatric patients (12 years older and weighing 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID -19 requiring hospitalization . For patients who are not requiring supplemental oxygen due to hypoxemia (SpO2<94%) and for patients who require mechanica l ventilation/ECMO, current data has not demonstrated a reduction in time to clinical recovery or mortality. Treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID -19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease. Severe disease is defined as: Requiring supplemental oxygen Requiring non -invasive ventilation or high -flow oxygen ( supplemental oxygen through a high -flow device) Remdesivir should not be initiated routinely in the patients with the following at baseline : Patients on room air Patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO Patients with known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of remdesivir Those expected to expire within 24 hours or in hospice care Patients with hepatic impairm ent, defined as ALT 10x ULN Post-marketing reports have identified bradycardia, including severe and even fatal bradycardia, in patients with COVID -19 receiving remdesivir. The frequency of this potential adverse event is not known at this time. Prescribing information states \"Remdesivir is not recommended in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min.\", however, expert consensus i s that the benefits of RDV may outweigh the risk for m ost patients with impaired renal function. (Reference: J Am Soc Nephrol. 2020 Updated 8/5/2021 Tocilizumab FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization for Tocilizumab in combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID -19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age requir ing supplemental oxygen, non -invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. Tocilizumab EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers In addition to patients with Severity Score 3 (high -flow oxygen or non -invasive ventilation) or Severity Score 4 (Mechanical Ventilation or ECMO), tocilizumab may be considered in cases of progressive hypoxemia (increasing oxygen requirement) while on low -flow oxygen (Severity Score 2) with CRP75 mcg/mL a fter receiving corticosteroids for at least 24 hours. Tocilizumab is not recommended for use in p atients on low -flow oxygen with a stable clinical course. Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV (max 800 mg/dose ; rounded to the nearest vial size - 200 mg or 400 mg ) Use restricted to infectious diseases or critical care providers If clinical signs/symptoms worsen or do not improve after the first dose, dose may be repeated once at least 8 hours after the initial in fusion Not recommended in patients with: ANC <1000/mm3 Plts<50,000/mm3 ALT or AST >10xULN Because both baricitinib and tocilizumab are potent immunosuppressants, there is the potential for an additive risk of infection. Use of baricitinib in combination with tocilizumab is not recommended. An increase in serum IL -6 levels is the expected physiologic response to treatment with tocilizumab. There is no role for monitoring of serum IL -6 levels to assess clinical response or to guide decision for a second tocilizumab dose. CRP level serves as a good indicator of the inflammatory status prior to and during tocilizumab treatment. Caution: Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportuni stic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab . some studies have reported no difference in secondary infection rate, other studies have reported a higher prevalence of secondary infection in patients receiving tocilizumab compared with patients who received placebo. 7 Updated 8/5/2021 12:21 PM Baricitinib FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization for Baricitinib for the treatment of COVID -19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. Baricitinib EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers . July 28, 2021: The EUA for baricitinib no longer requires baricitinib be used in combination with remdesivir. Scientific evidence suggests potential benefit of baricitinib + remdesivir only in hospitalized patients requiring high -flow oxygen support.

(BMJ. 2021 Feb 11;372:n311. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n311 .)*** *Higher intensity of anticoagulation must be weighed against the risk for bleeding. Currently, the National Institute of Health and American Socie ty of Hematology are awaiting publication of 3 platform RCTs to finalize therapeutic anticoagulation recommendation, which will be included on the algorithm after the update. Evidence for intermediate dose anticoagulation is based on an observational study cited below, therefore it is of low-quality evidence, use clinical judgement when prescribing. If higher intensity dosing is utili zed, consider ordering diagnostic tests to rule out VTE. Heparin preferred in AKI, dialysis, or when unable to reach anti -Xa targets with enoxaparin. \u00b6Patients with BMI 40, compelling indication (eg confirmed VTE, (if available, monitor anti -Xa after 3rd dose & target 0.6 -1 units/mL) or IV high dose UFH Intermediate dose: **expert consensus based on low level J Hematol . 2021 Jan 21. 0.5 mg/kg subQ q12h (if available, monitor anti after 3rd target 0.4-0.6 5000 subQ q8h yes yes yes no no no 10 Updated 8/5/2021 12:21 PM Outpatient Anticoagulat ion for COVID -19 patients Patients receiving chronic anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy for existing conditions should remain on their current regim en if positive for COVID -19, unless a new clot has developed, or ICU level of care requires a switch to p arenteral/SubQ therapy.

While t he RECOVERY trial did not demonstrate a mortality benefit with CCP in hospitalized patients when compared to placebo, immunodeficient patients were no t included and may still derive a benefit from this therapy. If, based on clinical judgement, a provider wishes to use CCP, patients must meet the EUA criteria for use and ordering physician must attest to the criteria via Cerner PowerPlan. Per the FDA, th is authorization is limited to use of only high titer plasma. Guideline Recommendations for use of CCP in Hospitalized Patients with COVID -19: NIH (Updated April 21, 2021) : The panel recommends against the use of high titer or low titer CCP in patients hospitalized with COVID -19, except those enrolled in a clinical trial IDSA (Updated April 7, 2021) : Among hospitalized patients with COVID -19, the panel suggest against the use of CCP. AdventHealth Transfusion Consent must be obtained from the pa tient/LAR prior to CCP administration (following routine SOP). Nurse must give patient/LAR CCP fact sheet prior to CCP administration. Note: Availability of CCP is dependent upon collection and distributi on of donated plasma from individuals who have recov ered from COVID19 and may not be readily available. **Orlando Campus : If patient is being considered for enrollment in COVID -19 clinical trials, be aware that prior or concomitant use of convalescent plasma may exclude patient from participation. Contact clinical trial research coordinator for detailed information about restrictions with each clinical tri al. ** Criteria for Use 1. Patients hospitalized with COVID -19, early in the disease course, and those with impaired humoral immunity a) FDA defines early course as prior to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation b) Transfusions administered late in the course of COVID -19, defined as requiring intubation or mechanical ventilation, has not been associated with clinical benefit Treatment Timing 1. As soon as possible, ideally within 3 days of admission or new oxygen requirement Administration 1. Treatment with CCP consists of one unit of high titer plasma, approximately 200 mL given over 1 hour 2. Premedicate with acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg PO 30 minutes prior to start of CCP. May repeat x1 if >12 hours from premedication administration and CCP transfusion not yet complete. 14 Updated 8/5/2021 12:21 PM Treatment for Non -Hospitalized Patients Colchicine Colchicine is a commonly utilized anti -inflammatory medication with antiviral properties that may attenuate the effects of cytokine storm. Recently, a large, randomized, controlled trial (COLCORONA) demonstrated a benefit in reducing hospitalization and de ath with use of colchicine in patients > 40 years of age with certain risk factors . Currently, the data is insufficient to recommend for or against routine use of colchicine in hospitalized patients ; however, colchicine may be considered for non -hospitalized patients with documented COVID -19, plus one of the following risk factors: advanced ag e ( 70 years old), obesity, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, fever ( 100.4\u00ba) within last 48 hours, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities (pancytopenia, high neutrophil count, low lymphocyte count) . Dose: 0.6 mg orally twice daily x 3 days, then 0.6 mg daily for up to 30 days Common adverse effects: diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain , vomiting Monoclonal Antibodies (Outpatient only) Based on current level of SARS -CoV-2 variant penetrance in the U.S. , particularly the P.1/Gamma variant and the B.1.351/Beta variant, distribution of bamlanivimab/etesevimab has been paused nationwide. C asirivimab/imdevimab or Sotrovimab are the recommended MAB s in the U.S. as of June 25, 2021 . The distribution of local variants will continued to be closely monitored via the CDC website , thus changes to this recommendation will be adjusted accordingly. Guideline Recommendations on MABs for COVID -19: NIH (updated August 4 , 2021) : According to The National Institutes of Health COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines , the panel recommends using anti-SARS-Cov-2 MABs to treat outpatients with mild -moderate COVI D-19 who are at risk of clinical progressi on. Therapy should be initiated as soon as positive result and within 10 days of symptom onset . IDSA (June 16 , 2021) : According to the Infectious Diseases Society for America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID -19, the panel suggest use of casir ivimab/imdevimab OR sotrovimab rather than no neutralizing antibodies among ambulatory patients with mild-moderate COVID -19 at high risk for progression to severe disease. Local variant susceptibility may be considered in the choice of the most appropriate neutralizing antibody. *No comparative data exists to guide treatment decisions; thus, preferred MAB should be based on local variants and access to certain MABs As of June 25 , 2021, t wo MAB options are being distributed in the U.S. under an FDA EUA : casirivimab/imdevimab and sotrovimab . On June 25 , 2021, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the FDA announced that distribution of bamlanivimab/etesevimab will be paused nationwide based on increased rates of variants displaying reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimab/etesevimab. immunoglobulin G -1 (IgG1) MABs that bind to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS -CoV- 2, thus preventing attachment of the virus into human cells. 15 Updated 8/5/2021 12:21 PM In addition to us ing the monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of non -hospitalized patients, the EUA for casirivimab/imdevimab has been updated as of July 30, 2021. This updated EUA now authorizes casirivimab/imdevimab for post -exposure prophylaxis ( see section below ). \"In order to mitigate the risks of using this unapproved product under the EUA and to optimize the potential benefit of casirivimab/imdevimab or sotrovimab, the following items are required.
