Qi gong - pronounced \"chee goong\" - is part of Chinese medicine. \"Qi\" means vital energy and \"gong\" means work. Qi gong combines movement with controlled breathing and meditation. It may be considered both a [body-based practice and an energy therapy](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/key-questions/complementary-therapy-categories/). Why use it Movements performed in qi gong are said to keep the flow of energy running through the body's energy channels. This can help improve quality of life, including mental and physical wellbeing. What to expect Wear comfortable clothes. The session starts with warm-up exercises to loosen the body. The instructor then guides you through a series of slow movements, which help you become more aware of your energy. Classes might also include meditation while you are lying down, sitting, standing or walking. What is the evidence? Clinical studies suggest that qi gong improves quality of life and reduces fatigue, pain and anxiety. Anecdotal evidence shows that it helps to improve general fitness. Qi gong was very calming and made me more aware of the energy in my body. I found it easier to learn than tai chi so I was able to do it at home as well as going to classes.Margaret (breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) Meditation and Relaxation Podcast [Listen to more of our meditation and relaxation podcast for people affected by cancer](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/podcast-meditation-and-relaxation/) Key resource Download a PDF booklet on this topic.
