The primary mission of the TCIM is to improve health outcomes for patients with chronic medical conditions. The TCIM strives to integrate evidence-based, multidisciplinary therapies into conventional care plans for chronic disease prevention and treatment in order to provide the highest quality of clinical care to patients. The Center has a tripartite area of focus: Chenchen Wang, MD, MSc Director, Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine Chenchen Wang, MD, MSc is a Professor at Tufts University School of Medicine and Director of the Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. She holds strong leadership and mentoring roles in the Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute research environment, collaborating actively with multidisciplinary teams in the United States and across the world in Complementary and Integrative Health disciplines. Dr. Wang completed her rheumatology and clinical epidemiology training at McGill University in 1999. Her research focuses on clinical and epidemiological studies of Complementary and Integrative Medicine and their applications to treatments in chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, especially osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Currently, Dr. Wang serves as the principal investigator on a number of NIH-funded clinical trials evaluating mind-body therapies on chronic conditions and publishes extensively in this field. She has received the privileged NIH Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research to protect her time to exclusively train the next generation of integrative medicine scientists in innovative, multi-method, multidisciplinary clinical and translational research programs for chronic diseases. In addition, Dr. Wang holds many advisory roles, including serving as a Featured Expert for the New England Journal of Medicine Group Open Forum and membership of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches at the National Institutes of Health in the United States. She was also elected Vice Chairperson of the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies. We are currently seeking candidates for a post-doctoral research fellow and a research assistant/coordinator. These positions will conduct supervised research in the fields of rheumatology and CAM.
