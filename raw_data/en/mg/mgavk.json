(a) Other vaccines that are universally or routinely recommended should be given if not contraindicated. An exception is patients with B-cell deficiencies receiving immunoglobulins, who should not receive either live or inactivated vaccines, due to safety (live vaccines) and efficacy (live and inactivated vaccines) concerns. (b) OPV is no longer available in the United States. (c) This table refers to contraindications for nonemergency vaccination (i.e., the ACIP recommendations); emergency response recommendations are addressed in the clinical guidance for smallpox vaccine use in an emergency. (d) Children 12-59 months: if unimmunized or received zero or only 1 dose, and that dose was administered before 12 months of age, should receive 2 Hib doses, 8 weeks apart; if received 2 or more doses before age 12 months, and none after 12 months, should receive 1 Hib dose 8 weeks after the last dose; if completed a primary series and received a booster dose at age 12 months or older, no additional Hib doses are recommended. (e) There are no data to support IgA deficiency as a contraindication for yellow fever vaccine. (f) Live bacterial vaccines: BCG and oral Ty21a Salmonella (smallpox). Nonemergency smallpox vaccination is not recommended for children younger than 18 years or the general public. (h) Regarding T-lymphocyte immunodeficiency as a contraindication for rotavirus vaccine, data exist only for SCID. (i) Symptomatic HIV infection or CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of <200/mm3 or <15% of total lymphocytes for children aged <6 years is a contraindication to yellow fever vaccine administration. Asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 200-499/mm 3 for persons aged 6 years or 15%-24% of total lymphocytes for children aged <6 years is a precaution for yellow fever vaccine administration. Details of yellow fever vaccine recommendations are available from CDC. (j) Patients 5-18 years of age who have not received a Hib primary series and a booster dose or at least one Hib dose after 14 months of age. (k) HIV-infected children should be considered for varicella vaccine if CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 15% and should receive MMR vaccine if they are aged 12 months and do not have 1) evidence of current severe immunosuppression (i.e., individuals aged 5 years must have CD4+T lymphocyte [CD4] percentages 15% for 6 months; and years must have CD4+percentages 15% and CD4+200 lymphocytes/mm 3 for 6 months) and 2) other current evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity. In cases when only CD4+cell counts or only CD4+percentages are available for those older than age 5 years, the assessment of severe immunosuppression can be based on the CD4+values (count or percentage) that are available. In cases when CD4+percentages are not available for those aged 5 years, the assessment of severe immunosuppression can be based on age-specific CD4+counts at the time CD4+counts were measured; i.e., absence of severe immunosuppression is defined 6 months above age-specific CD4+count criteria: CD4+count >750 lymphocytes/mm 3 while aged 12 months and CD4+count 500 lymphocytes/mm3 while aged 1 through 5 years.

(l) Withholding inactivated vaccines also is recommended with some forms of immunosuppressive therapy, like anti-CD20 antibodies, induction or consolidation chemotherapy, or patients with major antibody deficiencies receiving immunoglobulins. Inactivated influenza vaccine is an exception, but consideration should be given to repeating doses of any inactivated vaccine administered during these therapies. (m) Persons younger than 60 months undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy who have not received a Hib primary series and a booster dose or at least one Hib dose after 14 months of age; HCT patients of any ages, regardless of Hib vaccine history. (n) Persons older than 59 months who are asplenic and persons 15 months or older who are undergoing elective splenectomy who have not received a Hib primary series and a booster dose or at least one Hib dose after 14 months of age. (o) Indicated based on the risk from dialysis-based bloodborne transmission. Adapted from Table 8-1, ACIP General Best "}
