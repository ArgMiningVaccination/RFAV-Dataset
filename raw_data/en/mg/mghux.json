IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 10 The 2019 IHV Lifetime Achievement Award for Scientic Contributions Warner C. Greene, MD, PhD Dr. Warner C. Greene is a physician-scientist who has worked in the area of HIV pathogenesis for the past 30+ years. He is currently the Director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research, the Nick and Sue Hellmann Distinguished Professor, and Professor of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Greene is Co-Director with Dr. Paul Volberding of the federally funded UCSF-Gladstone Center for AIDS Research. He is also the founding and emeritus director of the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, an institute he directed for 28 years. Dr. Greene received his BA degree with great distinction from Stanford University and his MD and PhD degrees with honors from Washington University School of Medicine. He completed his internship and residency training in Internal Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital at Harvard. Next, he served as a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute from 1979-1986 where he started his own laboratory. In 1987, he became Professor of Medicine at Duke University Medical Center and an Investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Greene's studies focus on HIV pathogenesis including new insights into how CD4 T cells die during HIV infection and new approaches to curing HIV infection. He has authored than 380 scientific papers. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and the National Academy of Medicine, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a past president of the Association of American Physicians. Dr. Greene is most proud of having mentored more than 130 students and fellows during his career. Dr. Greene's laboratory helped decipher the mechanisms of action of the HIV Nef, Vif, and Vpr gene products. His laboratory also showed that HIV Vif thwarts the antiviral action of APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase by inducing its degradation in the 26S proteasome and by decreasing its synthesis. They also identified endogenous SINE/Alu retroelements as natural targets of human APOBEC3G. In other work, the laboratory has delineated how the NF-kB transcription factor is regulated by stimulus-coupled degradation of IkBa and dynamic nuclear phosphorylation and acetylation the RelA subunit and how NF-kB antagonizes HIV latency. In his initial phase of his career, Dr. Greene's and colleagues cloned the IL-2 receptor- alpha chain and showed that this receptor was expressed in a deregulated manner in HTLV-I infected cells. This was the first cytokine receptor to be characterized at a molecular level. These studies led to the examination of the Tax and Rex gene products of HTLV-I. Studies of this virus naturally led Dr. Greene's laboratory to the study HIV-1 in the mid 1980's. In 2007, Dr. Greene expanded his work to include global health activities in sub-Saharan Africa in his role as president and executive chairman of the Accordia Global Health Foundation. Accordia's mission was to overcome the burden of infectious diseases in Africa by building centers of excellence and strengthening medical institutions. It helped create the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda which is caring for nearly 50,000 HIV-infected people in its extended network of clinics, has trained over 28,000 physicians, nurses, laboratory personnel, and health care professional from 26 countries, published over 650 papers, and launched an active outreach program now impacting 65% of people living in rural Uganda. In 2016, Accordia merged with Africare.

Giroir, MD , Assistant Secretary for Health, US Department of Health and Human Services Special lecture. A-102 HIV in 2019: Optimizing the HIV Treatment and Prevention Toolkits Anthony S. Fauci, MD , Director, US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Much has been accomplished in HIV research, notably in the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) that has averted millions of AIDS-related deaths and saved the global economy > $1 trillion. Combination ART, frequently administered as one pill, once a day, prolongs and improves the lives of persons with HIV and prevents HIV transmission to their uninfected sexual partners if the level of virus in the blood is maintained below the detectable level. Antiretroviral drugs used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by uninfected individuals at risk for HIV also are highly efficacious in preventing acquisition of HIV. Therefore, theoretically, if we accessed and put on antiretroviral therapy everyone who has HIV and provided PrEP for all at high risk of HIV infection, we could rapidly end the global pandemic. Unfortunately, proven HIV treatment and prevention tools have not been scaled-up sufficiently to make a significant impact on HIV incidence, which has declined only slightly over the past decade. These implementation gaps must be closed if we are to end the HIV pandemic. We can look to examples of cities that have maximally implemented existing tools and dramatically cut incidence (e.g. San Francisco) for approaches that could be scaled-up more broadly. As we optimize the implementation of existing tools, we also must develop new and improved tools. Such optimized treatments would allow for the durable control of HIV without the need for daily ART. Several approaches will be discussed including efforts toward the eradication of virus, i.e. a classic \"cure\", that might be achieved by gene editing approaches such as using CRISPR-Cas9 to excise integrated proviral DNA. Long-acting ART dosed once-monthly or even less frequently has shown promise, and many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that might require infrequent infusions are in various stages of clinical development. In the realm of prevention, large studies of treatment as prevention (TasP) indicate that substantially increased use of PrEP together with TasP likely will be required to dramatically reduce HIV incidence at the community level. Current PreP formulations have reached only a small fraction of people who need them and often adherence to prescribed regimens is poor. PreP needs to be more broadly implemented and made more user friendly as scientists develop the many new PreP approaches in the \"pipeline.\" These include new oral drugs, long-acting injectables and implants, monoclonal antibodies, topically applied products and others. The development of an HIV vaccine, even a moderately effective one, together with optimal implantation of existing treatment and prevention modalities, could contribute greatly to ending the HIV pandemic. In this regard, efforts to build on the RV144 vaccine trial, which showed modest efficacy in the absence of bNAbs and cytolytic T cells, represent an important area of vaccine research. Three large efficacy trials are underway to build on the results of RV144, with a total \"n\" of ~12,000. In addition, structure-based and lineage-based vaccine design have been employed in the development of immunogens aimed at the induction of bNAbs. In conclusion, the end of the global pandemic will be hastened if we optimize our treatment and prevention toolkits by both maximal implementation of existing interventions and discovery of new and improved interventions.

To achieve this goal, it is important to consider the currently available tools as well as determine what additional tools and technologies are needed that can be used domestically as well as globally. Ease of use, acceptability, and availability are key if we want to achieve successful implementation. Aside from a safe and effective HIV vaccine, the focus should revolve around enhancing HIV testing and diagnosis, treatment of HIV-infected individuals for durable viral suppression and HIV-negative individuals to prevent HIV infection (pre- exposure prophylaxis), and overall support for patients on ART in order to achieve high adherence. Researchers will also need to critically evaluate what areas of research need additional progress in order to develop the next generation of new and more effective tools and technologies that can help us achieve durable epidemic control. Dr. Carl W. Dieffenbach is the Director of the Division of AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. Under his leadership, the Division supports a global research portfolio to advance biological knowledge of HIV/AIDS, its related co-infections, and co-morbidities. With the ultimate goal of creating an \"AIDS-free Generation,\" the Division develops and supports the infrastructure and biomedical research needed to: 1) halt the spread of HIV through the development of an effective vaccine and biomedical prevention strategies that are safe and desirable; 2) develop novel approaches for the treatment and cure of HIV infection; 3) treat and/or prevent co-infections such as tuberculosis, and co-morbidities of greatest significance; and 4) foster partnerships with scientific and community stakeholders to develop and implement effective interventions. Dr. Dieffenbach received his bachelor's degree in biochemistry from the University of Maryland in 1976 and his Ph.D. in biophysics from The Johns Hopkins University in 1984. B-101 Syringe Service Program: Venues for Comprehensive Harm Reduction John Brooks, MD , Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention A summary of research data will be presented to make the case that efforts to prevent the infectious complications of injection drug use should be better integrated with efforts to address substance use disorder. Syringe service programs are among the many opportunities where efforts to scale up such integration are needed. Dr. John T. Brooks currently serves as the Senior Medical Advisor to the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention where he leads the division's activities related to the new national \"Ending the HIV Epidemic\" initiative. His primary area of expertise is prevention and treatment of HIV infection. Dr. Brooks has led teams during CDC emergency responses to anthrax, SARS, Ebola, and Zika. He was the CDC Incident Commander for the agency's response to the 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in Scott County, Indiana. Dr. Brooks came to CDC as an EIS officer in 1998 after completing medical school, residency in internal medicine, and a fellowship in infectious diseases through Harvard Medical School. He continues to see patients at the Atlanta Veterans Administration Hospital's HIV clinic. Speaker Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 26 B-102 The Next Generation of HIV Prevention Strategies: Getting Closer to Zero Myron S. Cohen, MD , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill HIV prevention is broadly divided into vaccine and non-vaccine strategies. Non-vaccine prevention strategies involve integrated combinations of harm reduction (e.g. safer sex, needle exchange) and biomedical tools. Development of ever better tolerated antiretroviral treatment (ART) led to recognition that suppression of viral replication greatly reduces vertical (mother to baby) HIV transmission and eliminates the sexual transmission of HIV in both heterosexual and MSM couples. These observations led to the worldwide policy of \"universal test and treat\", a far cry from earlier rationing of ART. Broader and earlier ART is now directly linked to falling HIV incidence in several sub-Saharan countries, although the population level benefit may not be as great as expected. Antiviral agents can also be used as pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. Oral tenofovir-FTC (Truvada) has demonstrated reliable prevention of HIV acquisition. Topical antiretroviral agents (ARVs) appear to offer more modest protection from infection. Clinical trials are exploring the potential for an every eight-week injectable agent-cabotegravir (HPTN 083, 084). in long-acting implants and microneedle patches. The latter devices can combine contraceptive agents and ARV PrEP. Several broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) also offer potential as PrEP. The proof of concept Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) studies using the bnAb VRC01 are underway, anticipating that a broader bnAb combination will be developed. As the HIV pandemic recedes more localized epidemic and endemic spread of HIV can be seen in defined \"at risk\" populations (especially vulnerable young men and women) who will benefit from \"precision prevention\" of HIV.

He has worked extensively in North Carolina, and Malawi and the People' s Republic of China. B-103 HIV Prevention 2019: What will it take to get to zero? Ken Mayer, MD, FACP , The Fenway Institute The demonstration that HIV-infected individuals effectively treated with antiretrovirals do not transmit HIV, and that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing HIV acquisition, are the basis for optimism that wider access to medication can effectively arrest epidemic spread. However, current treatment and prevention paradigms are based on the assumption that all people living with HIV (PLHIV) will know their status, have access to medication, and remain adherent to daily dosing, and that at risk individuals will readily access, and be adherent to, PrEP. Although most PLHIV are aware of their status and > \u00bd have initiated antiretrovirals, many are not virally suppressed, and PrEP remains significantly underutilized. Best practices are emerging which address significant challenges, ranging from social/structural (e.g. drug and care costs) and individual behavioral concerns (e.g. substance use and depression). Peer health system navigators and conditional cash transfers have been evaluated to facilitate engagement in treatment and preventive services. Other creative approaches include involvement of non-traditional providers, such as pharmacists, as well as the use of tele-medicine for patients residing in rural areas. The use of algorithms embedded in electronic health records to identify at risk patients may increase the likelihood of conversations about risk and PrEP, and enhanced education of primary care providers through academic detailing has also been evaluated. Given the heterogeneity of the global HIV epidemic, it is clear that \"Getting to zero\" will require diverse approaches, tailored to the realities of the different populations that are infected with, and affected by, HIV. Ken Mayer, MD Speaker Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 27 B-104 New Approaches to Antiretroviral Therapy Michael Saag, MD , University of Alabama at Birmingham Many novel options are emerging for ARV Therapy (ART). With the remarkable success of ART worldwide, clinicians and patients are looking for simple, long-acting options for ART administration that can reduce the risk of regimen non-adherence and potentially eliminate the need for oral therapy. Several novel medications have been developed and evaluated in Phase I - III clinical trials. The advantages of long-acting, injectable formulations of ART include the assurance that drug levels will remain above the IC90 for extended periods of time with a single administration, the opportunity for monthly (or longer) directly observed therapy, assurance of medication adherence (and potential improved efficacy), and potential reduced risk of emergence of drug resistant variants. Disadvantages include pain at the site of injection, large volume injections (in some formulations), injection site reactions, inability to 'remove' the drug following injection once an IM injection is given, and the potential for emergence of resistance if follow-up injections are not administered (during the 'tail' of the PK curve). Long-acting oral therapies are also being developed as well as novel mechanisms of drug delivery through novel cutaneous platforms. On balance, the development of long-acting formulations will provide subpopulations of patients the opportunity to avoid daily oral therapy and creates the opportunity for DOT in settings of high-risk populations of patients. The option of long-acting ARV drug formulations may be especially useful as PrEP therapy. Dr. Saag received a B.S. in chemistry with honors in 1977 Tulane University, earned his medical degree with honors from the University of Louisville, and completed his residency and infectious disease and molecular virology fellowship training at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. During the last 6 months of his fellowship, Dr. Saag conceived the concept of a comprehensive HIV outpatient (1917) clinic dedicated to the provision of interdisciplinary patient care in conjunction with the conduct of high-quality clinical trials, translational science, and clinical outcomes research. Through the clinic, Dr. Saag has participated in many studies of antiretroviral therapy as well as novel treatments for opportunistic infections. He has published over 450 articles in peer reviewed journals, including the first description of the use of viral load in clinical practice (Science, 1993), the first description of the rapid dynamics of viral replication (Nature, 1995), the first guidelines for use of viral load in practice (Nature Medicine, 1996), the first proof of concept of fusion inhibition as a therapeutic option (Nature Medicine, 1998), and directed the 'first-in- patient' studies of 7 of the 30 antiretroviral drugs currently on the market. Dr. Saag Co-Edited a textbook entitled AIDS Therapy (now in its 3rd edition), serves as an Editor of the Sanford Guide for Antimicrobial Agents and the Sanford HIV Guide, and is Chair of the IAS-USA Antiretroviral Therapy Guidelines panel. In 2014, he was the Castle-Connolly National Physician of the Year and was inducted into the Alabama Healthcare Hall of Fame.

C-101 Population-based HIV Impact Assessments: Using the survey data to precisely target response Man Charurat, PhD , Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine The objective of the population-based HIV impact assessment survey (PHIA) is to describe the HIV epidemic in specific priority countries globally and to build capacity by strengthening the workforce and infrastructure needed in targeted countries to design, conduct, analyze, and disseminate results. Precision public health is a new paradigm to use these data to guide interventions that benefit populations more efficiently and increase equity in outcomes. National (or even subnational) averages from the survey can hide important local health variation. This presentation gives an overall review of the global HIV epidemic using the PHIA and one or two case examples from the Nigeria AIDS Indicator Impact Survey (NAIIS) on how precision public health approach can be used.

The attached trimers, ~20 per particle, retain antigenicity as judged by reactivity with NAbs and non-NAbs and are coupled predominantly via free lysine residues exposed on their base. Various different genotypes of trimer were attached to IO- NPs trimers carrying a PADRE T-cell helper epitope and attached them to IO-NPs. We then immunized mice with B41 soluble or type two immunizations, and the PADRE-tag independently and substantially increased anti-trimer antibody responses, but differences among the groups waned after two further doses. Autologous NAbs to the N289-glycan hole epitope were consistently induced in mice given soluble B41 trimers but not in ones immunized with IO-NP trimers. We found that recombinant mouse mannose binding lectin (MBL) bound to the IO-NP trimers in vitro, but only poorly to the corresponding soluble trimers. Moreover, both MBL and mouse serum (but not mouse occluded the N289-glycan hole epitope on the IO-NP trimers in vitro, which may explain why it is poorly immunogenic in vivo. MBL also impeded a subset of bNAbs from accessing their epitopes on IO- NP trimers, an outcome that could impair their immunogenicity and thereby influence how nanoparticles are used as Env immunogen delivery devices. John Moore, PhD C-103 How would you like your PrEP? The fit of new HIV prevention tools to lived sexual lives Chris Beyrer MD, MPH , Desmond Tutu Professor, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD Presented by Andrea Wirtz, PhD , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health The science of primary and secondary prevention of HIV has made profound advances in the last decade. The results of several large treatment as prevention (TasP) trials have confirmed that persons living with HIV who are sustainably virally suppressed do not transmit to sexual partners, and these studies have included both heterosexual and male same sex status different partnerships. This has led to a social advocacy movement: Undetectable=Untransmissible, or U=U. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis with Tenofovir-Emtricitabine (Truvada and its generic formulations) has shown remarkable effectiveness in primary prevention of HIV for men who have sex men (MSM), since this oral formulation has high penetration and efficacy in the gut, protecting receptive anal sex partners\u2014the highest risk exposure for unprotected sex. Data support the use of PrEP in MSM for both daily and on demand regimens. Effective use of TasP and PrEP can reduce HIV transmission and acquisition probabilities between men who have sex with men to virtually nil. How have these dramatic changes affected sexually active gay and bisexual men? Findings from a number of qualitative studies suggest that there is a sea change underway in many communities where TasP and PrEP are available, MSM have access, and community uptake and use has been widespread. Men are reporting declines in anxiety, in fear of infection, and in self and enacted stigmas associated with HIV status. Many are reporting increased communication, and enhanced intimacy, as concerns over HIV status differences decline. A \"status neutral\" future may be emerging, with profound consequences for individuals, couples, and communities. Yet there remain concerns over access, over adherence, particularly among younger and more marginalized MSM, and there are concerns around other sexually transmitted infections (STI) as condom use changes. Gay and bisexual men have been both heavily burdened by the HIV pandemic, and in the vanguard of uptake of advances in science. The prevention revolution underway is again, being used, adapted, and experienced by MSM. Andrea Wirtz, PhD is an epidemiologist with expertise in infectious disease. Dr. Wirtz is dedicated to the field of epidemiologic assessment of infectious disease, violence, and health among marginalized populations with specific interest in developing measures and methods to assess risks, outcomes and effective health interventions for these populations. Dr. Wirtz's interests include epidemiological and intervention research related to violence, stigma, disparities in healthcare access, and infectious disease, particularly HIV infection; implementation science methods for key populations; and capacity building among local community-based partners. She is a Principal Investigator of the LITE cohort, which aims to develop and follow the first cohort of transgender women in six US cities to assess incidence of HIV and other health outcomes. She is a co-investigator of several domestic and international studies which aim to develop and assess the impact of HIV prevention and care interventions for men who have sex with men, transgender women, and others in high risk contexts. Dr. Wirtz has received a faculty development award from the Center for AIDS Research to assess the impact of intimate partner violence on engagement in HIV care in Rakai, Uganda. She has collaborated on multiple international studies to estimate population prevalence of gender-based violence victimization and perpetration and to develop interventions to identify cases of violence for referral and care in humanitarian settings.

Public health agencies are now using data routinely collected through surveillance to prospectively identify clusters for public health response. This new strategy comprises one of four pillars of the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. Cluster detection can use various approaches. Analysis of case surveillance data can identify time-space clusters\u2014increases in HIV diagnoses in a localized area or population. Analysis of HIV molecular data generated through routine drug resistance testing and reported to surveillance can identify molecular clusters\u2014groups of HIV genetic sequences that are very closely related, suggesting that transmission has occurred rapidly, without time for the virus to evolve. Clusters can also be reported by providers and community members. CDC has supported health departments by developing analytic tools for both time-space and molecular clusters. Once clusters are identified, response efforts aim to identify gaps in prevention efforts and address them to strengthen prevention programs. This includes ensuring that people with and at risk for HIV, particularly those in populations experiencing rapid transmission, have access to the services they need, including HIV testing, HIV care, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and syringe services programs. Recent clusters and outbreaks, whether detected through time-space or molecular analysis and whether related to sexual transmission or injection drug use, offer opportunities to understand the promise this approach holds and identify lessons learned to be applied to cluster detection and response moving forward.

Speaker AbstractsIHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 31 D-102 New Compound with Novel CNS Mechanism Blocks Craving and Drug-Seeking in Addiction Ivan Diamond, MD, PhD , Amygala Neurosciences ; University of California, San Francisco Preclinical and human studies indicate that craving and drug-seeking behavior is driven, in part, by abnormally excessive CNS surges of dopamine (DA) in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens (NAc). DA is then oxidized to dopamine aldehyde (DOPAL), a substrate for ALDH2 that is co-expressed in these dopaminergic neurons. Thus, ALDH2 immediately clears DOPAL. We have discovered and developed ANS- 6637, a highly selective reversible ALDH2 inhibitor that is believed to divert DOPAL to combine with excess DA to form tetrahydropapaverine (THP). THP is a negative feedback inhibitor of activated tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate limiting step in dopamine metabolism. In pre-clinical studies we find that ALDH2 inhibition reduces excessive DA synthesis and restores DA homeostasis. We also determined that ALDH2 inhibition prevents craving and addictive drug-seeking behavior. Here we present data illustrating the efficacy of ALDH2 inhibition in preventing addictive self administration of and relapse to alcohol, nicotine, cocaine and opioids. Encouraged by these findings we completed Phase 1 human studies confirming safety and we examined the interaction of ANS-6637 with alcohol, commonly used by all addicts. A dose response to ANS-6637 was carried out in experienced non- alcoholic male drinkers given 5 drinks in 2.5 hrs. The most common adverse reaction was flushing. Pharmacological agents for CNS disorders usually occupy receptors often with 24/7 side effects. By contrast ANS-6637 only targets a specific pathophysiologic mechanism driving craving and drug- seeking behavior. This would be expected to avoid serious side effects. Ivan Diamond, MD, PhD, I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. At 16, after my sophomore year at Abraham Lincoln High School, I took a special Ford Foundation examination which enabled me to attend the University of Chicago (U of C) (1951). I credit my education at U of C with teaching me how to think. After attending the U of C School of Medicine (1957 - 1961), and a medical internship at the New England Center Hospital (Tufts University), I completed a Neurology residency with Richard Richter at U of C (1962 - 65). As a resident in Neurology and as a postdoctoral fellow at U of C (1964 - 1967), I had the opportunity to train with Rudi Schmid, who was an awe-inspiring role model academic medicine and and a superb medical scientist. Rudi kindled my devotion to translational medicine. I elucidated the pathogenic mechanism by which unconjugated, unbound bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier to cause bilirubin encephalopathy in jaundiced babies (kernicterus), particularly in premature infants. This body of work became my PhD thesis with Ruth Rhines at U of C (1967). As the pathogenesis of bilirubin encephalopathy became clear to physicians, the use of albumin infusions and phototherapy to prevent this condition became widespread in newborn nurseries. I decided to further my education in basic science and was fortunate to be accepted as a postdoctoral fellow by Eugene P. Kennedy, Chair of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School (1967 - 1969). Gene Kennedy was one of the most brilliant, formidable scientists at Harvard at the time. He taught me how to think as a scientist, to identify scientific challenges, to design definitive experimental studies and most important, how to learn from failed experiments. Here I described carrier-mediated uptake of choline at synapses. This work solved the puzzle how acetylcholine was re-synthesized after release from nerve terminals, vital to understanding the function of cholinergic synapses, and highly relevant to the CNS and neuromuscular disorders. I was recruited to the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1969 by Robert Fishman and Melvin Grumbach with a joint appointment in Neurology and Pediatrics. Each had set out to build the best departments in the country, and they succeeded by all accounts. I was lucky to be surrounded by exciting faculty in medicine and science at UCSF and was able to extend work on phototherapy for bilirubin encephalopathy to develop an entirely novel photodynamic therapy for malignant tumors. We used hematoporphyrin (known to be taken up by cancer cells) as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen to selectively destroy malignant cells when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. Photodynamic Therapy is now widely employed for a variety of disorders in many medical disciplines. Similarly, advancing my prior work on cholinergic synapses, my laboratory described phosphorylation of the acetylcholine receptor. This was the first description of phosphorylation of any receptor in situ, a covalent modification now known to regulate a variety of receptors. The most exciting experiences in my career occurred in 1980, when I was appointed to direct the newly established Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center (EGCRC) at UCSF. The EGCRC was founded to develop therapies for alcoholism and drug addiction. The EGCRC became an important contributor to addiction research in two major ways. First, my group introduced cell biology to ethanol research, which we used to define CNS responses in vivo. We identified and characterized adenosine A2A receptor cAMP signaling and phosphorylation to regulate neuronal responses to alcohol and other addicting substances. This opened new avenues for pharmacologic therapy. Second, the Gallo Center was able to support dozens of new investigators and many more trainees who made pioneering contributions to alcohol and addiction research at UCSF and other universities. After 22 years of directing the EGCRC, I was recruited to Cardiovascular Therapeutics (CVT) to became Vice President for Neuroscience (2005). The surge in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens during drug seeking behavior contributes to abnormal craving in addiction. I developed a novel addiction therapy based on restoring normal dopamine homeostasis in the nucleus accumbens to prevent abnormal craving. Our new medication does not affect basal dopamine levels, but appears to only eliminate the surge in dopamine which occurs during episodes of drug-seeking behavior. I now am a Senior Advisor at Gilead Sciences (which acquired CVT 2009), to bring this novel therapy into the clinic. Successful Phase I clinical trials were completed in 2014. Consequently, colleagues and I have established a new company, Amygdala Neurosciences, for further clinical development. A successful outcome will be a wonderful cap to my career to develop a medical treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction, and to prevent relapse.

Fentanyl appears to differ from other opiates as having a very rapid onset and transport in and out of the central nervous system. Fentanyl is therefore widely distributed in the CNS. Furthermore, a high range of systemic levels of fentanyl have been observed in overdose victims. Taken together, we believe it is very likely that higher doses of naloxone are needed to combat this new era of overdoses. We examined the bioavailability of an investigational 5 mg intramuscular naloxone compared to 2 mg intramuscular naloxone (current approved dose) in a crossover design which included 14 healthy subjects. Overall, both doses were well tolerated with no adverse events noted during the trial. The Pharmacokinetic results showed that a higher dose of intramuscular naloxone hydrochloride increases Cmax, AUCs, and t1/2; however, Tmax was similar for both treatments. Statistical analysis indicated that there were statistical differences between the test and reference treatments for Cmax, AUCs, and t1/2 with ratios of test These results are consistent with the study rationale that indicated higher doses of intramuscular naloxone hydrochloride would result in higher Cmax and AUCs. These PK characteristics may be desirable for reversing opioid toxicity caused by the higher, more potent synthetic opioids.

E-101 Injection drug use and HIV in Baltimore City: Trends and future projections Shruti H. Mehta, PhD, MPH , Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health The dramatic reduction in HIV incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) over the past three decades is one of the great success stories of HIV. In the early years of the HIV epidemic in Baltimore City, injection drug use was the major driver of new HIV diagnoses and AIDS cases in the city. Rates increased steadily from 1985 on peaking in 1992 at 865 new diagnoses, representing 65% of all new HIV diagnoses in the city. The number of new diagnoses remained stable throughout the 1990's declining thereafter with current estimates at only 23 diagnoses per year, representing only 10% of new HIV diagnoses in Baltimore city. Indeed, this decline in HIV incidence in Baltimore mirrors national trends and is likely due to a combination of expanded access to harm reduction including opioid agonist therapy (OAT), syringe service programs (SSP), behavior change and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). While new infections have declined, people who inject drugs represent nearly 30% of the total burden of HIV cases in Baltimore city with disproportionate burden among African-Americans. However, despite two decades of downward trends in HIV incidence among PWID in Baltimore, there are several reasons to be concerned about resurgence of HIV among this group. First, while overall engagement in care and HIV viral suppression have improved over time among PWID and conferred substantial survival benefit, retention remains a challenge and so sustained virologic suppression is still at less than optimal levels. Second, over the past decade there has been a major shift in the epidemiology of drug use in Baltimore which necessitates new approaches to delivering harm reduction and HIV services. Both the nature of use and the populations affected are changing. Individuals are increasingly initiating with prescription opioids, polysubstance use is more common and the introduction of synthetic opioids including fentanyl and carfentanyl has led to unprecedented increases in drug overdose with the risk of overdose mortality higher among those infected with HIV. Finally, a broader segment of the population is affected by substance use, one that is younger, more racially diverse and that expands to include individuals who come to Baltimore city from the surrounding counties. Efforts need to continue to monitor and tailor services to this changing context in order to maintain the gains that have been made with respect to HIV among PWID over the past decades. Shruti Mehta is a Professor and the Deputy Chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research focuses on the epidemiology of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the US and in India with a particular interest and focus on identifying and overcoming barriers to access care and treatment for HIV and HCV .

The last time this happened, we had a worldwide flu pandemic (without antibiotics) and World War I. We now have a devastating opioid epidemic that is claiming more lives than AIDS at its peak. The natural history of opioid addiction, or what we now call \"opioid use disorder\", in the US typically leads to involvement with the criminal justice system. Most American prisons and jails still do not offer effective treatment for opioid use disorder. In 2016, as part of the Governor's Overdose Prevention and Intervention plan, Rhode Island became the first statewide correctional system (unified prison and jail) to screen all incoming people for opioid use disorder and offer all three available FDA approved medications (methadone, buprenorphine, depot-naltrexone) with linkage to treatment in the community after release. In 2018 preliminary results were published demonstrating a 61% decrease in mortality in the year after release from incarceration. In the intervening year, the landscape is rapidly changing with litigation, legislation and correctional systems independently developing programs across the nation. Lessons learned from the AIDS epidemic, including the need for the combination of advocacy and research and multidisciplinary approaches to address a complex problem, are invaluable in the face of this ongoing epidemic.

E-103 Keeping PWUD Safe and Alive Mark Eisenberg, MD , MGH Charlestown Health Care Center We are in the midst of an unprecedented drug overdose epidemic. At the same time, we are seeing increased rates of infectious complications of injection drug use including HIV, HCV and bacterial endocarditis. The illicit drug supply is contaminated with fentanyl and its analogues. People who use drugs are increasingly turning to methamphetamine with its chaotic use. To turn the tide of this epidemic, we need to listen to the voices of people who use drugs and consider dramatic new public health approaches including safe consumption spaces and prescription injectable opioids. Dr. Eisenberg is originally from Baltimore. He is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and Harvard Medical School. He performed his clinical training in primary care internal medicine at the University of Rochester and in infectious diseases at Stanford Medical Center.

The impact of concurrent and collocated initiation of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) on HCV treatment and drug-use outcomes is unknown. We performed a prospective, open-label, observational trial at a harm reduction organization drop-in center in Washington, DC, where 100 patients with chronic HCV infection, opioid use disorder, and ongoing injection drug use were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks and offered buprenorphine initiation. In this talk, I will discuss the ways that collocation of HCV treatment and OAT can result in high uptake of buprenorphine, and that concurrent initiation of OAT with HCV treatment in active PWID with OUD can result in high rates of SVR while reducing risks associated with drug use.

E-105 Integrating care for Opioid Use Disorders to Tackle Infectious Disease Epidemics Carlos del Rio, MD , Emory University The opioid use disorder (OUD) and other illicit drug epidemics in the United States have resulted in coalescing infectious disease epidemics among persons who use drugs (PWUD). The relationship between infectious diseases and substance use is not new. Early on in the HIV epidemic it was realized that injection drug use was associated with HIV acquisition. Infectious diseases related to OUD as well as co-occurring stimulant use disorders include HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), invasive bacterial and fungal infections including Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, endocarditis, skin and soft tissue infections, and bone and joint infections among others. There is now an opportunity to integrate treatment of OUD in places that take care of infectious diseases and to also integrate infectious diseases care in places that provide treatment for OUD. Providing evidence based treatments for OUD including medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) like buprenorphine, methadone HIV; and harm reduction services like needle syringe exchange programs at infectious diseases clinics could be important ways to address the OUD epidemic. Carlos del Rio, MD Speaker Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 35 E-106 The opiate epidemic-how we got here and how do we get out Glen Treisman, MD, PhD , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine The current opiate epidemic has caused tens of thousands of deaths annually and hundreds of billions in economic losses. From 1979 to 2015, accidental opiate related deaths increased by 4250%. Despite its magnitude, the driving forces remain poorly understood. We have published a comprehensive timeline of factors that promulgated the opiate epidemic between 1979 and the present. The faddish postulate that \"pain medications\" can treat all pain resulted from the confluence of consumerism in medicine, cost reduction, an emphasis on profits and the over-simplification of medical practice. The response of policies to decrease opiate prescribing has been equally simplistic, resulting in a shift to heroin and other illicit drugs with a corresponding increase in fatalities. An understanding of the factors that drive the epidemic is needed for a successful solution. Withholding appropriate opiate therapy for acute pain in patients with a high \"opiate risk score\" is medically unacceptable, and chronic opiate therapy for chronic pain in patients with a low \"risk score\" has little evidence for utility. Patients with greater risk for opiate misuse require greater vigilance (as with any medications with high risk). Treatment of patients with chronic pain is complicated, expensive, and takes time and expert evaluation. Inadequate education and support for the medical community has hampered the effective treatment for chronic pain, An alternative approach to the treatment of chronic pain and opiate dependence is the development of integrated treatment programs with expertise in psychiatric disorders, addictions, pain, and infectious diseases.

Data from the FL Department of Health indicates drug overdose deaths more than doubled from 2014 (2,175 deaths) to 2016 (4,672 deaths). To mitigate this trend, FL passed several important laws including the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and the Pill Mill Law. In addition, FL recently legalized syringe services programs through the Infectious Disease Elimination Programs bill. Currently, only three syringe services programs in FL have been named with only one site currently providing comprehensive support. Each site has to be individually funded from private sources without state or county support which is a significant barrier. Current efforts are focused on future sites being \"full- service\" to include syringe exchange, testing for infectious diseases as well as medical infrastructure to deal with related comorbidities. Recently, South Florida had an outbreak of new cases of HIV and HCV among homeless PWID that was investigated by the CDC and Miami continues to have the highest annual rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections. In addition to HIV and HCV, the opioid epidemic has resulted in a recent Hepatitis A outbreak in over 2,400 individuals that is almost four times the number of individuals diagnosed in 2018. Data on HIV and HCV testing from a single site syringe services program will also be presented along with efforts for HIV and HCV screening in emergency departments.

Leonard, MD , Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and the Immunology Center, US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH The common cytokine receptor chain, c, is shared by interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, which together regulate the development, survival, and function of lymphocytes. The gene encoding c is mutated in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), and mutation of JAK3, encoding a kinase activated by all c family cytokines, phenocopies XSCID. Defective signaling by IL-7 and IL-15 explain T-cell and NK-cell development in XSCID and JAK3-deficient SCID, whereas defective IL-21 signaling substantially explains the defective B cell function in these diseases. IL-2 and IL-21, which signal in part via STAT5 versus STAT3, respectively, can have opposing actions; the balance of their signals influences the biological response and provides a mechanism for fine-tuning cytokine signals. For example, IL-2 promotes T helper 9 but represses T follicular helper cell differentiation, whereas IL-21 has opposing effects. Moreover, the ability of IL-2 to use both STAT5 dimers and tetramers and of IL-21 to use STAT3 represent additional physiological mechanisms for fine-tuning cytokine signals. Furthermore, cytokine signals can be amplified by the physiological use of STAT-based super-enhancers present in highly inducible genes. From a therapeutic perspective, there are an increasing range of approaches for fine-tuning cytokine signaling, including IL-2 partial agonists and antagonists. Such molecules can either attenuate or abrogate IL-2R-c dimerization and thus inhibit IL-2- and IL-15-dependent gene expression. Some of these molecules can function as cytokine receptor \"signaling clamps\", and one antagonist can prolong survival in a model of graft-versus-host-disease and inhibit proliferation of cells from patients with the chronic/smoldering form of adult T cell leukemia. Our increasing understanding of physiological and pharmacological ways to fine-tune signaling by c family cytokines have not only elucidated molecular mechanisms but also have led to modulators of the immune response, with potential therapeutic utility as well.

F-102 Impact of combination HIV interventions on HIV incidence in Uganda: a prospective cohort study Thomas Quinn, MD , National Institute of Allery and Infectious Disease, NIH Targeting combination HIV interventions to locations and populations with high HIV burden is a global priority, but the impact of these strategies on HIV incidence is unclear. We assessed the impact of combination HIV interventions on HIV incidence in four HIV hyperendemic communities in Uganda. From November 2011 to February 2017, data were collected from five open, population-based cohort surveys of persons aged 15-49 years residing in four fishing communities on Lake Victoria. We evaluated trends in HIV testing coverage among all participants, circumcision coverage among male participants, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage and population viral load among HIV-positive participants, and sexual behaviors and HIV incidence among HIV-negative participants. Overall, 8,941 participants were surveyed and contributed 20,721 person visits; 52% (n=4,619) were male. HIV prevalence was 42% in the 2011-2012 baseline survey. A total of 3,222 initially HIV-negative participants with at least one repeat visit contributed 9,546 person-years (pys) of follow-up and 230 incident HIV infections. Over 5 years, HIV testing coverage increased from 68% to 95% (p<0.001); male circumcision coverage increased from 35% to 65% (p<0.001), ART coverage increased from 16% to 82% (p<0.001), and population HIV viral load suppression in all HIV-positive persons increased from 34% to 80% (p<0.001). Overall, HIV incidence decreased from in 2011- 2012 to 1.55/100 rate ratio (aIRR) 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.79). While incidence remained above HIV epidemic control targets, rapid expansion of combination HIV interventions in HIV hyper-endemic communities was associated with substantial declines in HIV incidence.

Dr. Greene is most proud of having mentored more than 140 students and fellows during his career. Dr. Greene's laboratory helped decipher the mechanisms of action of the HIV Nef, Vif, and Vpr gene products. His laboratory also showed that HIV Vif thwarts the antiviral action of APOBEC3G cytidine deaminase by inducing its degradation in the 26S proteasome and by decreasing its synthesis. They also identified endogenous SINE/Alu retroelements as natural targets of human APOBEC3G. In other work, the laboratory has delineated how the NF-\u0000B transcription factor is regulated by stimulus- coupled degradation of I\u0000B \u0000 and dynamic nuclear phosphorylation acetylation subunit and how NF-\u0000B antagonizes HIV latency. In his initial phase of his career, Dr. Greene's and colleagues cloned the IL-2 receptor-alpha chain and showed that this receptor was expressed in a deregulated manner in HTLV-I infected cells. This was the first cytokine receptor to be characterized at the molecular level. These studies led to the examination of the Tax and Rex gene products of HTLV-I. Studies of this virus naturally led Dr. Greene's laboratory to the study HIV-1 in the mid 1980's. In 2007, Dr. Greene expanded his work to include global health in sub-Saharan Africa in his service as president and executive chairman of the Accordia Global Health Foundation. Accordia established the Infectious Diseases Institute at Makerere University in Uganda, which has trained thousands of African health care workers, is caring for 30,000 HIV-infected patients, and has brought health care to nearly 500,000 people living in remote rural regions of Uganda.

In order to explore the potential of the Guinean plant remedies against HIV/ aids, an ethnopharmacological investigation has been initiated since 2002. This research led to the recruitment of 418 traditional healers involved in the treatment of Sexual Transmitted Diseases (STD). An ethnobotanical survey led to a collection of 190 recipes containing 218 plants. From these, biological testing, one plant species has shown the most in vitro significative effect against HIV1 and HIV2, with IC50 of 0,250 and 0,0519 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Through an ethnotherapeutical screening, an increase in CD4 counts (166 \u00b1 66 to 235 \u00b1 78 / mm3) was recorded in 5 \u00ab na\u00efve \u00bb patients treated during 4 to 7 months. Bio-guided fractionations of the active extract led to a series of fractions of which four showing IC50 of 0.866 - 7.670 and 0.539 - 0.065 against HIV1 and HIV2, respectively. Repetitive fractionations of these led to a series of sub-fractions which were more or less biologically equivalent to their mother fractions. Phytochemical investigations on the most active fractions led to the isolation of more than ten metabolites from which a macrocyclic sterols and some triterpenes have been identified.

Here, by flow cytometry, we evaluated the reconstitution CXCR5+ T-cells in stem cells. The CXCR5+ T-cells play an important role in viral chronic infections (LCMV and HIV) and tumor control, as well as in modulating humoral responses. Furthermore, circulating CXCR5- expressing CD8 T-cells are associated with low-level HIV replication, making them a possible novel correlate of protection, and potentially useful in the eradication of HIV reservoirs. CXCR5+ CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were detectable particularly in spleen and lymph nodes. These cells exhibited a follicular-like phenotype, with expression of Programmed Death (PD)-1, and absence of T-cells had a higher expression of IL-21 and a higher cytotoxic potential compared with CXCR5- cells. HIV infection did not affect the frequencies of CXCR5+ T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Finally, taking advantage of the high proportion of na\u00efve T-cells in huNSG mice, we evaluated the in vitro of splenic T-cells to the follicular profile- polarizing cytokines Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-\u00df1 and interleukin (IL)-23. After in vitro treatment, there was an increase in CXCR5+ T-cells, which exhibited high levels of PD-1, CD40L and low expression of CCR7. Thus, there is a reconstitution of CXCR5+ T-cells in uNSG mice, supporting the use of this model for exploring the biology and role of this cell population in healthy and diseased conditions. Juan Zapata, PhD Poster Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 39 PA-103 Immunocytochemical Labeling of CXCR4 in the HIV-1 Transgenic Rat Brain is Associated with Cell Types Displaying Oxidative/ Nitrative 1Morgan State University, Department of Biology, Baltimore, MD 2Institute of Human Virology, School of Medicine University of Maryland, Baltimore MD Introduction: Animal models are important for gaining insight into the Pathophysiology of disease and treatment development. One such model for HIV/AIDS is the HIV-1 Transgenic Rat (1). Over one hundred papers have been published using this model. But, since its introduction, the AIDS epidemic has evolved due to the use of very effective antiviral medications. Indeed, according to some, the disease might be viewed as a chronic treatable condition. But, as the longevity of the patients has increased, many go on to develop noninfectious comorbidities. These comorbidities can effect vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidney. As a result it is now necessary to develop treatments to protect these organs. The brain is particular problematic as its comorbidities can seriously influence the quality of life of the patient. One hypothesis is that viral reservoirs continue to produce low levels of viral proteins and that this initiates a cascade of events that leads to oxidative stress and cell death. Discussion: Analysis of the HIV-1 Transgenic rat brain at the immunocytochemical level did not reveal many cells producing GP-120, TAT or NEF. On the other hand previous studies reveal that GP-120 can be found in sera and CSF. Referring to the rat genome data base reveals a CXCR4 gene of close homology to the human gene. This raises two questions, 1. Can the HIV-1 Transgenic rat CXCR4 bind to the transgene GP-120, and 2). Can the HIV-1 Transgenic rat CXCR4 be detected using antibodies to the human gene? At present we investigated that later as we wished to see if the markers to cellular oxidative stress and premature ageing were in the same neural cell types. Conclusion: Using an antibody to human CXCR4 it was possible to immunochemically label different cell types in the HIV-1 Transgenic rat brain. The antibody labeled neurons in the hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and interneurons in the caudate/putamen. Each of these neural types displayed a subset of cells that were positive for oxidative/nitrative stress as reveled by immunocytochemistry to Nitrotyrosine. revealed by Beta-Galactosidase enzyme histochemistry. A subset of cells from each group also stained for this marker. Further work on HIV receptors in the rat may yield insights to the nature of comorbidities, and work is needed to clarify of there is a link between the viral transgene products and the rat CXCR4 HIV receptors. 1Reid W., Sadowska M., Denaro, F. , Rao S., Foulke J., Hayes N., Jones 0., Davis H., Sill A., O'Driscoll P., Huso, D., Fouts T., Lewis, G., Kames-Lowis R., Wei C., Ray P, Gallo, R., Reitz, M., and Bryant J., An HIV -1 Transgenic Rat that Develops HIV -1 related Pathology and Immunological Dysfunction.

Poster Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 40 PA-104 A Meta-Analysis of Neurometabolite Changes Associated with HIV Infection Lydia Chelala, Erin O'Connor , Peter Barker and Thomas Zeffiro , Laboratory of Translational Neuroradiology, University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD Introduction: HIV infection can adversely affect performance in cognitive and motor domains, possibly related to early involvement of basal ganglia nuclei or their axonal connections. Numerous studies have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure HIV effects on basal ganglia metabolite levels. While many have reported changes aspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), Myo-inositol (MI), and Creatine (Cr) following HIV infection, quantitative inconsistencies observed across studies are substantial. To investigate the potential clinical utility of using MRS in measuring HIV disease effects, we evaluated the consistency and temporal stability of serostatus effects on brain metabolic measures, including NAA, Cho, MI, and Cr. Methods: The meta-analysis sample included cross-sectional studies between 1993 - 2019 reporting HIV infection effects on cortical and subcortical metabolites. Because structural and functional changes have been repeatedly reported in the basal ganglia, NAA/Cr (21 papers), Cho/ Cr (21 papers) and MI/Cr (17 papers) ratios were a focus of the analysis. Random effects meta-analysis using inverse variance weighting and bias corrected Cohen's d standardized mean differences (SMD) was used to estimate individual study SMDs and study heterogeneity. Meta-regression was used to examine effects of study publication year and data acquisition techniques. Results: Meta-analysis revealed basal ganglia for Cho/Cr and 0.63 (p<0.01) for MI/Cr. Similar, but somewhat stronger effects, were observed in gray and white matter. Nevertheless, estimates of between study heterogeneity suggested that the majority of the observed variance was between studies. Many studies pooled participants with varying durations of treatment, disease duration and comorbidities. Image acquisition methods changed with time. Conclusions: While published studies of HIV effects on brain metabolism exhibit substantial variations that may result from measurement technique variations or changes in HIV treatment practice over the study period, quantitative metabolic measures showing decreased NAA/Cr, increased Cho/Cr and increased MI/Cr are consistent and can reliably detect the effects of HIV infection during treatment, serving as practical biomarkers. PB-101 Involvement of HLA-C binding stability to 2-microglobulin in HIV-1 infection Simona Mutascio, PhD student , by HLA/2-microglobulin/ peptide. HLA-C binding to 2-microglobulin is weaker compared and -B. The HLA-C gene encodes different allotypes classified in stable and unstable clusters based on their binding stability to 2-microglobulin. Unstable HLA-C molecules release more 2-microglobulin than stable variants. The ratio of complete heterotrimers and HLA-C free chains at the cell surface is involved in controlling HIV-1 infection. We recently reported that HIV-1 Env associates with HLA-C during viral budding, increasing viral infectivity and spreading. We aimed to address how the binding stability of different HLA-C allotypes to 2-microglobulin influences HIV-1 infectivity. We showed that HIV-1 virions produced in PBMCs with unstable HLA-C variants are more infectious then those produced in PBMCs with stable ones. To deeply investigate the role of each HLA-C variant in HIV-1 infection modulation, 293T HLA-C-/- packaging cells were developed using CRISPR/Cas9. The different HLA-C alleles were then restored, developing cell lines expressing specific HLA-C allotypes. To analyse the binding stability to 2-microglobulin of each HLA-C variant, an acid wash treatment will be performed to assign a binding stability score ranking. Moreover, to investigate how HLA-C variants modulate HIV-1 infectivity, the homozygous HLA-C cells will be employed to produce HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses to evaluate their infectivity through a luciferase infectivity assay. This study will allow us to stratify the HLA-C alleles according to their binding stability to 2-microglobulin. Furthermore, these analyses will be fundamental to clarify the relationship among HLA-C allotypes binding stability and HIV-1 infection progression.

Poster Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 41 PB-102 Differences in the genetic pathways of resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors depend on HIV-1 strain and receptor levels on target cells Paul W. Keller, PhD1; Lu Teng, PhD1; Russell Vassell, MS1; Carol D. Weiss, MD, PhD1 1Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD Our group identified two genetic pathways of resistance to HR1-based HIV- 1 peptide fusion inhibitors (FI) that target fusion intermediate conformations of Env in an R5 virus (JRCSF). These pathways are anchored by resistance mutations in either HR1 or HR2 of gp41. Different gp120 compensatory mutations in each resistance pathway suggested regions of crosstalk between gp41 and gp120. Here, we examined the effects of receptor level and coreceptor usage on FI peptide resistance. Selection for FI resistance in JRCSF on cells with high receptor/coreceptor levels resulted in only the HR2 pathway being selected. In addition, the gp120 compensatory mutations selected differed from those selected in cultures using target cells with low levels of receptors, suggesting a need to balance of receptor usage, Env trimer opening, and FI resistance. To further investigate coreceptor usage and gp41-gp120 interactions, we carried out FI resistance selection using the LAI X4 virus. LAI selected the same two genetic resistance pathways as JRCSF, as well as a unique third pathway that results in alteration of gp41 glycosylation. The X4 virus also selected unique gp120 compensatory mutations. These findings suggest that the long-range interactions between gp41 and gp120 that mediate conformational changes in response to receptor/coreceptor binding differ between these X4 and viruses and depend on receptor levels.

Poster Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 42 PB-103 HCV Reinfection Not Associated With OAT Engagement, Drug Use, Or Sexual Risk In Persons With Opioid Use Disorder And Injection Drug Use: Data From The of Clinical Care and Research, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States 2DC Partnership for HIV/AIDS Progress, Comorbidities Program, Washington DC, United States Background: People with HCV, opioid use disorder (OUD), and ongoing injection drug use (IDU) who achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) remain at risk of reinfection. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and needle and syringe programs (NSP) are evidence-based strategies to reduce harms associated with IDU, including HCV reinfection. We sought to evaluate the rate of reinfection in a cohort of patients with access to OAT and NSP. Methods: ANCHOR is a single-center study evaluating treatment of HCV in PWID with chronic HCV, OUD, and IDU, set in an NSP. Patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) were tested for reinfection, defined as a genotype switch or detectable viral load after SVR. Patients were administered surveys to assess for ongoing risk behaviors and OAT status. Results: 81 individuals achieved SVR and were followed after treatment completion for a median of 413 days (83-608days). Subjects were Six a median of 409 days (range 147-517) after week 12, a rate of 8.4/100 person-years. Reinfection was not associated with post-week use(p=1.0), injection drug use(p=0.7), sexual activity(p=1.0), condom use(p=0.3), or OAT engagement at last visit (p=1.0). Of the 6 reinfected subjects, 4 reported ongoing IDU at follow-up visits, and 1 reported sharing needles. Of 34 patients who initiated collocated buprenorphine 1 year prior to analysis, rates of negative urine drug screen(31%) and time retained on buprenorphine (74%) were equivalent in those with and without reinfection. Conclusions: In this cohort of high-risk PWID recently cured of HCV, we found moderate rates of HCV reinfection regardless of OAT engagement, drug use, or sexual risk. These data highlight the risk of transmission through non-needle drug paraphernalia, and reinforce the need for serial re-testing and risk modification counseling regardless of engagement in harm reduction strategies.

High Interest in SIF among PWID HIV/AIDS Progress, Washington, DC, United States 2Division of Clinical Care and Research, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States. 3Critical Care Medicine Department, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States Background: Approximately 9,000 people who inject drugs (PWID) live in Washington D.C. representing 1.8% of the city's population. Supervised injection facilities (SIF) could facilitate harm reduction and HCV treatment in this population; however, acceptability of SIF among PWID in Washington D.C. is unknown. Methods: ANCHOR is a single-center study evaluating treatment of HCV in PWID with opioid use disorder (OUD) and IDU within 3 months. A semi- structured interview assessing SIF interest was administered after the end of HCV treatment. Fisher's exact test was used to determine associations with SIF interest. Results: Of the 83 survey respondents, the majority of participants were male (77%), median 57 years, and black race (94%). At baseline, 65% had ever experienced an overdose. The majority of respondents want a SIF in Washington, D.C. (73, 88%) and in their neighborhood (50, 60%). SIF interest was associated with experiencing an overdose within 1 year of screening. No associations were found between SIF interest and witnessing an overdose, previous naloxone use, injection frequency, or HCV treatment factors (p>0.05, n=83). Among forty-seven (57%) individuals who reported IDU within 3 months of survey administration, 36 (77%) reported they would go to a SIF to inject drugs, and 31 (66%) wanted additional medical services on-site, including HCV services. From qualitative interviews, patients expressed that using SIF would improve safety for PWID (40%) and decrease concerns regarding overdose (28%). Among 57 (69%) who identified any issues with establishing a SIF, their main concerns were negative public perceptions of SIF (23, 40%) and stigma (11, 19%). Conclusion: Despite concerns regarding negative public perceptions of SIF, PWID with HCV, especially those with recent overdose experience, express high interest in SIF and collocated medical services. SIF may be an acceptable strategy among PWID to reduce harm while engaging PWID in HCV treatment.

Poster Abstracts IHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 44 PB-105 Liver Fibrosis assessment by Transient Elastography and Thrombocytopenia among HIV/HBV co-infected and HBV-Mono infected Patients of Microbiology, University of Jos, Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2HIV Care and Treatment Center, Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 3Department of Medicine, University of Jos and Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 4Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, USA Background: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in Nigeria with a national prevalence of 14 % of it is the leading cause of hepatic fibrosis. Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are precursors of the hepatocellular cancer 5th most common cancer in men and the 9th in women, and 3rd leading cause of cancer related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Accurate evaluation of fibrosis and prompt initiation of therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with tenofovir is a key intervention that halts progression of fibrosis and associated with fibrosis reversal and improvement in mortality in patients on treatment. The staging of liver fibrosis in CHB patients is necessary to predict long-term clinical outcomes. Thus the detection of liver fibrosis is vital in management of the liver disease and for prognostication. Liver biopsy is considered to be the \"gold standard\" for the evaluation of liver fibrosis in CHB patients, is an invasive technique and associated with complications that may be life threatening if not identified early. Non- invasive methods such Fibroscan and platelet count are available and easy to apply. The study aimed to assess liver fibrosis using Fibroscan (Transient Elastography) and platelet count in HIV/HBV and HBV-mono infected patients on antiviral therapy in Jos, Nigeria. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted on HIV/HBV and HBV- mono infected patients who are on antiviral for 12 months, at Jos University Teaching Hospital, Plateau Specialist Hospital and Faith-alive Foundation from February 2018 to April 2019, after obtaining Ethical approval from the IRBs and informed consent. The patients' HBV DNA, platelet count and other hematological, biochemical parameters were assessed and liver stiffness measured by Fibroscan and score quantified in kilopascals x109/l), and severe fibrosis as 42.6% males and 57.4% females. median (IQR) years was of liver fibrosis and thrombocytopenia in patients on HAART. This result suggest that complications of CHB can be reduced by initiation of tenofovir based cART (HIV/HBV) and tenofovir (HBV) infected patients respectively. A further larger sample size is needed to better understand the relationship among CHB, liver fibrosis and HAART in Nigeria.

They experience both internal and external factors that inhibit HIV disease control. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"the context of people's lives determines their health,\" including biological, personal, familial, social, community, health care system and policy factors. Syndemics Theory emphasizes the role of sustained harmful social conditions, neighborhood disorders and other noxious factors co- occurring and interacting synergistically to contribute to an excess burden of disease in a community or population. Recognition that context itself merits attention as a cause for ill health; moves the responsibility for health outcomes beyond the sole efforts of the individual. Methods: We used a quasiexperimental design at two urban HIV outpatient clinics, with similar care delivery models required by federal funding, to compare the impact, on patient engagement in care, of providing iterative educational training on integrating early use of a palliative approach (ePA) to multidisciplinary outpatient staff. The CASA (Care and Support Access) ePA educational program was delivered to the outpatient staff at one clinic over an 18-month period. The training also included resiliencebuilding and self care strategies to enable staff to cope with the stress of caring for a difficult patient population, Insights from HIV stakeholders were incorporated to ensure study activities were responsive to ySGLM. Findings: There were no statistically significant differences between the Intervention and Control Clinic patients at baseline. 136 ySGLM patients were followed for 18 months, completing three waves of data collection. 64% of enrolled patients were 1830 years old; 87% AfricanAmerican, nonHispanic and 26% reported a prior incarceration. Regarding disease control, 62% had viral suppression at baseline. During the study, once daily therapy was introduced, the treatment regimen itself was highly associated with viral suppression. Other factors that highly impacted viral suppression were symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss; ability to take medication as directed; and overall quality of life. Findings were suggestive of an improvement in patient outcomes over time. The viral suppression rate at the end of the follow-up period for the 136 participants who completed all three waves of data collection was 59% at the Intervention Clinic and 41% at the Control. Living conditions can be a source of chronic stressors and an impediment to treatment adherence. Adequate, safe housing was a problem for a substantial minority of the participants. Fifteen percent self-identified as marginally housed; 9% reported being homeless, living in a shelter or SRO, moving from place to place, or \"staying\" with friend(s); 4% were living in \"someone else's\" house or dwelling with friends or family; 4% were in an institutional setting (HIV housing, hospital, nursing home); just over half, 53%, were living in a place they owned or rented. Perceived satisfaction with medical care and treatment by enrolled ySGLM was highly associated with pain relief and whether the provider took a full history of symptoms present. The Intervention Clinic staff were consistently positive in their assessment and evaluation of the ePA education, training and coaching sessions they received. positive. The theoretical model that guided our investigation and directed our analysis of the impact of education and training on integrating an ePA with standard outpatient HIV care was informed by Syndemic Theory. Despite the existence of effective HIV management strategies, young SGL men living with HIV remain at risk for poor disease outcomes as their lives are complicated by various factors that impede engagement in HIV care. Our investigation documented that a sizable proportion of the patients acknowledged experiences in keeping with growing up and living in a syndemic environment in which one is exposed to an ongoing and high incidence of crime, violence, drug use, poverty, and associated trauma. Discussion: In this feasibility study, multidisciplinary outpatient HIV staff members were able to appreciate and integrate an ePA in outpatient disease management. This research adds to an increasing body of work documenting the potential impact of growing up and living in disordered and deteriorating neighborhoods in which the syndemic environment exposes one to an ongoing and high incidence of poverty, violence, vandalism, serious crime, and substance abuse. Cumulatively, these living conditions and events leave many residents in a perpetual state of traumatization, poorly equipped to handle life in general, let alone the additional responsibilities and emotional work required to manage a potentially serious illness. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrated that ySGLM patients are at risk for poor disease outcomes, multiple symptoms and variable survival as their lives are complicated by various factors, consistent with the Syndemics Theory, that impede their engagement in HIV care. We observed further that the external environment itself may interfere with the ability of outpatient staff to \"connect with\" ySGLM with HIV. Our research has demonstrated the unmet need and potential health care utility of a patient-centered approach that fully incorporates into care delivery the life circumstances and stresses endemic to a disadvantaged population that is also burdened by a specific disease/condition. The study provided an opportunity to test the ePA in a US HIV setting to better inform key elements and plan for subsequent implementation. Our analysis suggests that a longer lead-in period is necessary for the implementation of ePA to meaningfully impact patient engagement in care, given the engrained nature of the social stressors present within this patient population.

To this end, dolutegravir (DTG), a potent integrase strand-transfer inhibitor with a unique resistance profile against human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) infection, was modified into nanoformulated lipophilic ester prodrugs to extend the apparent drug half-life, improve efficacy and facilitate access to viral replication sites. Discussion: We aim to create a once every six-months DTG formulation to improve preventative and treatment strategies against HIV-1 infection. DTG was either reacted with stearoyl chloride or stearoyl dichloride to form SDTG and by high-pressure and retention were tested in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Antiretroviral activity was evaluated by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and HIV-1p24 expression in MDMs. The nanocrystals were characterized by average particle sizes of 300 to 400 nm, narrow polydispersity indices of less than 0.3, negative surface charge and drug loading greater than 70%. The formulations were readily taken up by MDMs with sustained drug levels up to 30 days after a single drug treatment. Notably, these sustained drug levels directly paralleled sustained antiretroviral activities for both NSDTG and NDi18DTG for up to 30 days following a single drug treatment, as measured by RT activity and HIV-1p24 expression, whereas native NDTG was eliminated from MDM after a single day. Conclusions: NSDTG and NDi18DTG significantly improved the apparent drug half-life and antiretroviral activity in MDM. Ongoing pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and pharmacodynamic studies will evaluate the potential of NSDTG and NDi18DTG as once every six-month injectable.

This study aimed to assess the success of the Option B + program, through determination of HIV-1 MTCT prevalence and the associated risk factors. During October 2017-March 2018, 110 infants from mothers under Option B+, aged 6 to 48 weeks were sequentially sampled at the military hospitals of Douala and Yaounde; in addition 20 0-8 days' newborn babies from mothers who were screened HIV positive just at childbirth (drug-na\u00efve population) at the Bertoua regional hospital served to observe the shortcomings of the program. The HIV-1 RNA was detected from infants dried blood spots (DBS) at the Military Health Research Center. HIV-1 prevalence was 0.9% in B+ population and 0% in drug-na\u00efve population. Home delivery (p <0.01; OR 1,64), absence of nevirapine prophylaxis to the newborn (p = 0.01; OR 0,935) and the HIV-Positive mother's absence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy (p = 0.02 ; OR 1,057) were statistically signifiant predictors of HIV-1 MTCT. The implementation of the option B + can eliminate the HIV-1 MTCT and achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets by 2020 in Cameroon, if the tracking and enrollment of all HIV pregnant women is strengthened, home pregnancy monitoring canceled and the program extended nationwide, both in rural and urban settlements.

When a PI drug is used successfully in combination with other anti-HIV drugs, HIV can often be suppressed and kept below the detectable level thus prolonging patient's lives. Although currently there are about a dozen of FDA-approved HIV-1 PI drugs, the rapid emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance especially in the developing world calls for the development of new drugs with higher genetic-barrier to drug-resistance, and/or drugs that battle drug resistance. The objective of this study was to develop a novel and simple fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cell-based system that is suitable for high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules against wildtype and/or drug resistant HIV-1 PRs. Methods: Fission yeast SP223 strains that carry either an integrated HIV-1 wildtype PR gene or an integrated drug resistant PR gene at the Ura4 gene locus of the yeast chromosome were generated. The HIV-1 PR gene expression is under the control of an inducible nmt1 promoter. As the control, a green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was also expressed under the nmt1 promoter to eliminate potential transcriptional nmt1 inhibitors. Upon gene induction, both HIV-1 wildtype and drug resistant PRs induce cellular growth arrest that can be quantified by an absorbance-based measurement. The GFP expression was measured by a fluorescence-based assay. Results: Both absorbance-based HIV-1 PR assay and the fluorescence-based GFP assay were optimized for HTS. Upon completion, a small-scale pilot drug screening was performed using a drug library mixed with known PI drugs and transcriptional nmt1 inhibitors. With empirically adjusted and clearly defined selection criteria, we were able to correctly identify the PI drugs and excluded all hidden nmt1 suppressors. Conclusion: We have successfully developed and validated a fission yeast cell-based HTS platform for the future screening and testing of HIV-1 PR inhibitors.

PB-110 HIV-1 Viral Protein R (Vpr) Induces Human Brain Neuroinflammation Microbiology-Immunology 5Institute of Global Health 6Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine *, co-corresponding authors There are about 37 million people currently living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Successful treatment with antiretroviral therapies can eliminate all active replicating viruses and prolong patients' lives. However, the new challenge faced by more than half of those HIV-infected patients is chronic neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in the central nervous system, which leads to various HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Chronic HAND often persists resulting in high rates of delirium, dementia or depression that could lead to suicide. Nevertheless, the mechanism of HAND-associated neuropathogenesis is not well understood. Interestingly, the severity of some HAND does not always correlate with the levels of HIV, but rather with glial activation, suggesting other HIV-associated factors, not the whole virus per se, may also contribute to HAND. Our data show here that HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) might be one of those viral factors. The objective of this study was to delineate the specific role(s) of Vpr in activation of host neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, as well as its contribution to HAND. We found significant correlations between HIV expression and activation of proinflammatory markers (TLR4, TNF, and NF-B) in astrocytes of HIV-infected postmortem human and transgenic mouse brain tissues. We further show that Vpr alone activates the same set of proinflammatory markers in an astrocytic cell line SNB-19. Moreover, Vpr- induced host cell proinflammation results in apoptotic cell death. Together, our data suggest that HIV-1 Vpr induces human brain proinflammation and apoptotic cell death in astrocytes. We hypothesize that Vpr contributes to HAND by TLR4/MyD88- and/or TNF- mediated NF-B activation, which in turn lead to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Future experiments will be designed to test this hypothesis.

Poster AbstractsIHV2019 Progress in HIV/AIDS: Challenges in 2020 48 PB-111 Regulation of inflammatory activity in a murine model of Division, Institute of Human Virology bDepartment of Neurology, University of Maryland Baltimore cVA Medical Center, Baltimore, MD Background: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) collectively describes the cognitive impairment that results from neurologic involvement of HIV. Although the severity of HAND has significantly decreased after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, it is now far more prevalent due to persistent chronic infection of HIV in patients. In HIV infection, the abundance of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 contributes to the neuroinflammation that characterizes HAND. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a modulator of neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation prevents neurotoxicity during HIV infection by downregulating CXCR4 and CCR5 through the activation of TrkB. Furthermore, it has been shown that BDNF is downregulated in patients infected with HIV; therefore, the administration of BDNF has been gaining relevance as a possible adjunct therapy for HAND. However, systemic administration of BDNF is impractical because BDNF has a brief half-life, large molecular size, and poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. To address these issues, 7, 8 Dihydroxyflavone (DHF) can be used as a TrkB agonist that can cross the blood brain barrier and mimic the effect of BDNF. Objective: To study the effects of DHF, we investigated inflammatory activity in the hippocampus and cortex, the brain regions responsible for memory and cognition, of Tg26 mice, an animal model of HAND and analyzed the potential therapeutic effects of DHF treatment with respect to the inflammation in HAND pathology. Methods: 3-month-old mice were divided into three groups: Tg26. Mice euthanized after 28 days and 7 m thick paraffin sections of the brain of each mouse were prepared. Immunohistochemical staining of the tissue was used to detect one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni Comparison post-hoc test was performed to analyze the data. Results: Tg26 mice exhibited significantly higher levels of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5, and DHF-treated mice exhibited closer to normal levels. P-TrkB, P-Akt, and P-STAT3 activity was lower than normal in Tg26 mice and closer to normal in the DHF treated mice. Pro-inflammatory proteins NF-kB, TLR4, TNF- and IFN- were significantly upregulated in Tg26 mice compared to normal mice, and significantly downregulated in the DHF treated TG26 mice. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory IL-10 was downregulated in Tg26 mice compared to normal mice and was expressed in increased levels in DHF treated Tg26 mice. Discussion: Many studies suggest that genes regulating inflammatory responses of immune cells may profoundly affect CNS pathologies. In HAND, neuro-inflammation plays a pivotal role in the impairment of synaptic plasticity, as inflammation may cause neuronal degeneration. The results of our study show that We propose that the mechanism behind this was restored activation of the TrkB downstream signalling pathway by DHF, which in turn also downregulates the expression of HIV coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5. The results of the current study indicate a new application for DHF in the management of HAND with effects comparable to those of the standard neuroprotective drugs. Joseph L.

Nigeria is second only to South Africa in the global HIV prevalence, with a national prevalence of 3.4% {(National HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Survey of 2012, (NAIDS_Global_Report_2014)}. The free highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), has increased the survival of infected children. Adherence to HAART dwindles as apparently healthy children question the rationale for routine medications. Disclosure of their HIV infection status has been shown to improve adherence to HAART thereby improving their quality of life. This study was done to document the disclosure rate of HIV diagnosis to children in Uyo, Nigeria and to determine the factors influencing disclosure or non-disclosure to HIV infected children. Methodology: This was a prospective study using a semi-structured questionnaire administered to consenting parents/caregivers of children living with HIV/AIDS, aged 6 to 17 years, at the Paediatrics Infectious Diseases Unit of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo. The hospital is the only tertiary health facility the state and its paediatric infectious diseases unit, established in 2005, provides care for clients the State and neighbouring states of Cross River, Imo, Abia and Rivers states. There were 40 questions and it took an average of 15 minutes to complete. Parents/caregivers were interviewed in a different room, on clinic days, and their \"waiting\" children/wards were entertained and given some snacks. Interview room was not within earshot of waiting area to prevent any unplanned disclosure. Data obtained included socio-demographics, relationship with the child, disclosure status, person(s) who disclosed and child's reaction. Disclosure was strictly limited to children who were told specifically of the diagnosis of HIV. Reasons for non-disclosure, and expected time of disclosure were also obtained from participants. The study was carried out between January and June, 2015. Data storage and analysis were done with SPSS software, version 20. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies; means with the standard deviation were computed for continuous variables. Associations between categorical variables were tested with Chi-square or Fisher exact test and p < 0.05 was significant. Results: Participants were 140, with 21 males and 83 females, (male to female ratio of 1:4) aged 19 to 60 years. Forty eight (55.8%) of them had post-secondary education. Disclosure rate was 11(10.6%). Age at disclosure ranged from 9-17 years with a mean of 12.8 \u00b1 2.4years. Age of the children and their level of schooling positively affected disclosure. Also, caregivers in their third and fourth decades who were less educated were more likely to disclose the HIV status to their children. The commonest reason for non-disclosure was that child will be sad (25.8%). Other reasons were blaming the parent as a source of the infection (21.5%), the children not understanding the import of the diagnosis (10.8%) and 7.5% feared the child disclosing to others. Thirty-two (34.4%) did not give reasons for non- disclosure. Forty eight (51.6%) of the caregivers who are yet to disclose gave ages 10-14 years as the appropriate age for disclosure while 45 (48.4%) of them chose 15 years and above. Discussion: The disclosure rate of 10.6% was relatively lower in this study in comparison to other studies: 13.5%, Brown et al, 2011, Zambia; 42%, Cohen et al, United States of America and 67.0%, Cluver et al, 2015, South-Africa. Our rate is however slightly higher than the 9.0% reported by Moodley et al, in South Africa. The differences in rates of disclosure could be due to inclusion of children < 10 years, as Myer et al, 2006, had reported the usual age of disclosure as 10 years. The higher rates could be due to sampling of older children; and or inclusion of partial disclosure as was done in the study in Thailand. The mean age of disclosure in our study was 12.8 years. This is much higher than the mean age from most studies (Brown et al, 2011, Moodley et al, 2006, Mumburi et al, 2014, Oberdorfer et al, 2006, Tadesse et al, 2015 and Atwiine et al, 2015). This further reflects the difficulty of paediatric HIV disclosure in a country without national guidelines on the subject. Higher level of child's education was a predictor of disclosure and this probably relates to assumed maturity of the child to accept and react to disclosure. The commonest deterrent to disclosure was child's negative reaction of sadness or depression, others including fear of unapproved disclosure to others, anger against parents and shame on the parents as being responsible for transmission of infection have also been reported in previous studies. About 34.3% of participants were not forthright on reasons for non- disclosure; while the majority of those who will disclose suggested 15 years and above as appropriate time of disclosure. Psychosocial issues surrounding HIV/AIDS should be given an important attention in the same way concerted effort was made towards the provision of antiretroviral drugs for the management of the disease. Conclusion: A well-structured national protocol and guidelines for Paediatric HIV disclosure for use for on-going communication among children, caregivers and health care providers is most needed, so as to make the process of disclosure easier and more acceptable.

Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA 4Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA 5Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA 6Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA Introduction: Most efforts for preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub-Saharan Africa have focused on anogenital infections, with less emphasis on oral STIs. Previous studies indicate oral sex activity is high among MSM, but prevalence measures of oral sex practices in sub-Saharan Africa are inconsistent and mostly obtained from small heterosexual populations. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of oral sex practices among a cohort of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected MSM in Nigeria. Methods: From March 2013 to November 2018, TRUST/RV368 study recruited MSM into HIV/STI care and treatment at community-based clinics in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria using respondent-driven sampling. Structured survey instruments and laboratory testing for HIV and STIs (Neisseria gonorrhoeae [NG] and Chlamydia trachomatis [CT]) were conducted at each visit. All men who had an HIV diagnosis at baseline and completed questions about oral sex practices with men were included in the analysis (n=1342). Differences in demographics and behavioral characteristics were compared using Pearson's chi-square test. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using logistic regression models. For those with complete oropharyngeal STI testing (n=665), the crude association between oral sex practices and oral STIs was evaluated. Results: Oral sex prevalence was 69% and 58% (776/1342) were HIV- infected. In the adjusted analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with a 40% increased odds of oral sex practices with men (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.8) as compared to those who were HIV-uninfected. Other independent correlates of oral sex behavior included religion, female gender, owning a mobile phone, prior HIV testing, receptive anal sex, and number of sexual partners (all p0.01). As male sexual partner number increased, the likelihood of oral sex practices increased (2-4 partners vs. Oral sex practices were inversely associated with two or more female sexual partners (aOR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9). Prevalence of any oral STIs was higher in those reporting oral sex practices as compared to those who did not (crude OR: 2.5, 95% CI:1.2- 5.3). Conclusions: Oral sex practices are high among this study population, supporting the need for regular screenings for oral STIs to prevent further transmission. Indicators such as receptive anal sex and increasing number of partners highlight those most at risk for acquiring asymptomatic oral STIs, reinforcing the need to increase communication and education about the use of condoms during oral sex.

Test kits vary in their sensitivity to detect infection, both epidemiologically and analytically. A test that has a higher analytical sensitivity will detect more infected persons, especially during early infection. Our objective was to compare a number of rapid tests for their ability to detect low quantities of antibodies to HIV. Methods: Eight rapid test kits from seven different manufacturers were included. Their analytical sensitivity was evaluated using serial dilutions of 10 known HIV-positive serum samples. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined as the highest dilution yielding a positive result. Results: The LOD ranged from 1:4 to 1:524,288. No one test had the highest sensitivity for all 10 samples. Results indicated that: One test had the highest sensitivity for 7 samples, and another had the highest for 6 samples (equal sensitivity on 3). No test exhibited a higher sensitivity than those two tests on any samples. Three tests exhibited the lowest sensitivities, one test was lowest on 9, another on 6, and a third on 4 samples. For one of the samples, detection was at 1:1024 by one test while another was at 1:524,288, indicating quite variable sensitivities among rapid tests. Conclusion: Although no one test was clearly more sensitive for detecting antibodies in all the samples, two tests were clearly more sensitive on most samples, and a few tests clearly had lower sensitivities overall.

A 6 year longitudinal default tracking program of HIV exposed infants in Western Jamaica Shelly-Ann Williams, BSc Nursing , Western Regional Health Authority; Tracy Evans-Gilbert, DM, MPH CTropMed\u00ae , Cornwall Regional Hospital); Gail Reid, Bsc Social Work Regional Health Authority; Dianne Campbell-Stennett MBBS, MPH, DrPH , Western Regional Health Authority The sero-positive rate for HIV-exposed infants in Jamaica was 4.7% during the years 2005-2012. The purpose of this study was to assess outcomes in a cohort of HIV-exposed infants after implementation of a default tracking program for mother-infant pairs in 2012 in Western Jamaica. We report default tracking of the HIV exposed infant. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted from 2012 to 2017 among HIV- infected mothers from Western Jamaica. Defaulters were HIV-exposed infants who did not return for assessment of their infection status at 6 weeks, 4 months and 18 months. Default, linkage to care and laboratory outcomes were assessed as the default tracking program matured over 6 years. Analysis was censored at death, transfer, HIV positive test and default. Stillbirths, intrauterine and neonatal deaths were excluded. During the period 2012-2017, there were 454 live-births born to HIV- infected mothers. There were 25 transfers and 21 perinatal and 1 neonatal death and 8 HIV infected cases. Of the transfers, the first PCR was negative among 22 (88%) tested, and the second PCR was negative among the 16 (64%) that were tested. Of the 21 deaths, there were ten stillbirths or intrauterine deaths, ten perinatal deaths, one of which was syphilis exposed. Of the 454 live-births one died at 2 months, 8% defaulted at 6 weeks, 4% defaulted at 4 months and 8.5% defaulted at 18 months. Among the 65 defaulters who were not returned to care, 74% had a negative PCR at 6 weeks and 34 among 48 (71%) had a negative PCR result at 4 months. Of the 8 HIV-infected infants, 4 were identified at 6 weeks (with 1 death), 1 at 4 months and 3 were defaulters who were returned to care. Two new cases of HIV infection were identified after their mothers who were diagnosed at delivery, one of whom had a negative ELISA during pregnancy. All cases are in care and on HAART. The HIV infection rate declined from 5% to 0% (p=0.003); and retention in care increased from 77 % to 96% (p=0.0001) in 2012 and 2017 respectively. A dedicated team trained in default tracking of mother-infant pairs can contribute to the achievement of elimination targets in HIV exposed infants. Identification of high risk mothers during the antenatal period could facilitate implementation of earlier interventions.

Despite decades of research and development of this complex drug regimen, which is effective in the prevention of new infections, myeloids with an integrated HIV-1 genome have leaky transcription, leading to the production of viral RNA and proteins. These viral products can then be packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs) and released from the infected cell. EVs, specifically exosomes, produced from HIV-1 infected T cells and monocytes contain viral mRNAs and incubation of these exosomes with uninfected T cells and monocytes caused a significant increase in the production of the proinflammatory cytokines, implicating EVs as a possible mechanism for the chronic inflammation observed in the CNS of people living with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy1-4. Previous studies have shown that marijuana use in people living with HIV is associated with a lower viral load and higher CD4+ T-cell count, suggesting a potential therapeutic application. Here, we investigated the effects of cannabinoids, CBD and THC, on viral transcription in HIV-1 infected myeloids and resulting changes in EV release. Our data suggests CBD and THC can act as viral transcription inhibitors, potentially through two independent mechanisms. Additionally, our results show a significant reduction in EVs released from infected myeloids. Furthermore, we propose a three-state HIV-1 mathematical model, which can be used to predict how CBD and THC may potentially alter HIV transcription, from latency to activation. These studies are significant in that marijuana may provide a protective effect by alleviating the pathogenic effects of EVs in HIV-1 and CNS-related infections. References 1 Narayanan, A. et al. J.

PE-102 Collocation of hepatitis C care continuum with MAT for high- prevalence, high-risk population Shivakumar D'Amore, Sarah Kattakuzhy , Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of medicine Background and Aims: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the United States disproportionately impacts people who inject drugs (PWID) with a high prevalence of infection, who are responsible for 80% of new HCV infections. Baltimore City has the highest case rate of HCV in the state of Maryland with over 25% of new cases occurring in the city. Only 10% of PWID have access to this therapy and are cured of HCV. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) is currently offered in isolated facilities with limited access to other specialty care. In this study, we collocated HCV care continuum in a MAT facility offering therapy and psychosocial interventions. Methods: Collocation of HCV care was initiated in a MAT (Methadone and buprenorphine) clinic, the University of Maryland Drug Treatment Center (UMDTC) serving over 700 patients, for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in Baltimore City (Figure 1). Screening for HCV was expanded through health education sessions for patients and staff, and HCV antibody positive patients were linked to care with an experienced HCV provider or referred to hepatologists (decompensated cirrhosis). Results: Most of the attendees were African-American with average age of 52 years. 354 out of 701 clients attending clinic for methadone/suboxone (50.5%) were screened for HCV. Of the 251 patients who were hepatitis C antibody positive (70% of tested), 54 had undetectable HCV RNA. 46 had no HCV RNA labs available. 151 of the remaining HCV Ab positive patients who had a detectable HCV RNA result were evaluated for treatment (Figure 2). At initial assessment, 45 (48%) with liver fibrosis staged greater than F3, including 25 (27%) with cirrhosis. 64 patients initiated DAA therapy. 54 patients completed treatment (84%). 40 patients achieved sustained virologic response (100%) and 14 patients who completed treatment await SVR labs. Conclusion: Collocation of HCV care continuum in MAT setting is an effective way to achieve micro elimination of HCV. The follow up of this marginalized population still remains challenging given the high rates of homelessness and incarceration. In this regard, coordinated care between MAT settings and prisons are likely to demonstrate successful elimination of hepatitis C. Poster Abstracts "}
