[[1]](#cite_note-1) It is offered as a [complementary therapy](/wiki/Complementary_therapy) or as a form of [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine). [[2]](#cite_note-2) [[3]](#cite_note-Macmillan_Cancer_Support_2014-3) Fragrances used in aromatherapy are not approved as [prescription drugs](/wiki/Prescription_drug) in the United States. [[4]](#cite_note-fda-4) People may use blends of essential oils as topical application, massage, inhalation, or water immersion. [[5]](#cite_note-mayo-5) There is no good [medical evidence](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine) that aromatherapy can either prevent, treat or cure any disease. [[6]](#cite_note-6) There is disputed evidence that it may be effective in combating [postoperative nausea and vomiting](/wiki/Postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting). [[7]](#cite_note-acs-7) [[8]](#cite_note-Hines2018-8) History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aromatherapy&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] The use of [essential oils](/wiki/Essential_oil) for therapeutic, spiritual, hygienic and ritualistic purposes goes back to ancient civilizations including the [Indians](/wiki/Indian_people), [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language), [Egyptians](/wiki/Egyptians), [Greeks](/wiki/Greeks), and [Romans](/wiki/Roman_people) who used them in cosmetics, perfumes and drugs. Oils were used for aesthetic pleasure and in the beauty industry. They were a luxury item and a means of payment. It was believed the essential oils increased the shelf life of wine and improved the taste of food. Oils are described by [Dioscorides](/wiki/Dioscorides), along with beliefs of the time regarding their healing properties, in his [De Materia Medica](/wiki/De_Materia_Medica), written in the first century. [[9]](#cite_note-9) Distilled cedarwood oil was used by the ancient Egyptians, and the process of [distilling](/wiki/Steam_distillation) essential oils like rose essence was refined by the 11th century Persian scholar [Ibn Sina](/wiki/Ibn_Sina). [Hildegard of Bingen](/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen) used distilled lavender oil for medicinal treatments in the 12th century, and by the 15th century, oils were commonly distilled from various plant sources. [[10]](#cite_note-10) In the era of modern medicine, the naming of this treatment first appeared in print in 1937 in a French book on the subject: Aromath\u00e9rapie: Les Huiles Essentielles, Hormones V\u00e9g\u00e9tales by [Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9](/w/index.php?title=Ren%C3%A9-Maurice_Gattefoss%C3%A9&action=edit&redlink=1), a chemist. An English version was published in 1993. [[11]](#cite_note-11) In 1910, Gattefoss\u00e9 burned a hand and later claimed he treated it effectively with [lavender oil](/wiki/Lavender_oil). [[12]](#cite_note-12) A French surgeon, [Jean Valnet](/w/index.php?title=Jean_Valnet&action=edit&redlink=1), pioneered the supposed medicinal uses of essential oils, which he used as [antiseptics](/wiki/Antiseptic) in the treatment of wounded soldiers during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II). [[13]](#cite_note-13) Choice and purchase[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aromatherapy&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a Aromatherapy products, and essential oils, in particular, may be regulated differently depending on their intended use. [[14]](#cite_note-14) A product that is marketed with a therapeutic use in the US is regulated by the [US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration); a product with a cosmetic use must meet safety requirements, regardless of their source. [[4]](#cite_note-fda-4) The US [Federal Trade Commission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission) (FTC) regulates any aromatherapy advertising claims. [[4]](#cite_note-fda-4) There are no standards for determining the quality of essential oils in the United States; while the term \"therapeutic grade\" is in use, it does not have a regulatory meaning. [[4]](#cite_note-fda-4) [[15]](#cite_note-15) Analysis using [gas chromatography](/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [mass spectrometry](/wiki/Mass_spectrometry) has been used to identify bioactive compounds in essential oils. [[16]](#cite_note-16) These techniques are able to measure the levels of components to a few parts per billion. [[17]](#cite_note-17) This does not make it possible to determine whether each component is natural or whether a poor oil has been \"improved\" by the addition of synthetic [aromachemicals](/wiki/Aroma_compound) but the latter is often signalled by the minor impurities present. For example, [linalool](/wiki/Linalool) made in plants will be accompanied by a small amount of hydro-linalool whilst synthetic linalool has traces of dihydro-linalool.[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aromatherapy&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] There is no good [medical evidence](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine) that aromatherapy can prevent or cure any disease. [[7]](#cite_note-acs-7) [[18]](#cite_note-Barrett-18) However, for cancer patients, aromatherapy tests showed mixed results in lowering anxiety and depression symptoms. [[19]](#cite_note-Aromatherapy_With_Essential_Oils-19) In 2015, the [Australian Government's Department of Health](/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Australia)) published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [health insurance](/wiki/Health_insurance); aromatherapy was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. [[20]](#cite_note-aus17-20) Evidence for the efficacy of aromatherapy in treating medical conditions is poor, with a particular lack of studies employing rigorous methodology. [[21]](#cite_note-21) [[22]](#cite_note-22) A number of [systematic reviews](/wiki/Systematic_review) have studied the clinical effectiveness of aromatherapy in respect to pain management in labor, [[23]](#cite_note-23) the treatment of [post-operative nausea and vomiting](/wiki/Post-operative_nausea_and_vomiting), [[8]](#cite_note-Hines2018-8) managing challenging behaviors in people suffering from [dementia](/wiki/Dementia) [[24]](#cite_note-24) and symptom relief in [cancer](/wiki/Cancer). [[25]](#cite_note-25) However, some studies have come to the conclusion that while it does improve the patient's mood, there is no conclusive evidence on how it works with pain management. [[26]](#cite_note-26) According to the National Cancer Institute, no studies of aromatherapy in cancer treatment have been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal as of August 2022. Results are mixed for other studies. Some showed improved sleep, anxiety, mood, nausea, and pain while others showed no change in symptoms. [[19]](#cite_note-Aromatherapy_With_Essential_Oils-19) Safety concerns[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Aromatherapy&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Aromatherapy carries a number of risks of [adverse effects](/wiki/Adverse_effects) and with this in consideration, combined with the lack of evidence of its therapeutic benefit, makes the practice of questionable worth. [[27]](#cite_note-27) Many studies exploring the concerns that essential oils are highly concentrated and can irritate the skin when used in undiluted form often referred to as neat application. [[4]](#cite_note-fda-4) [[28]](#cite_note-28) [[29]](#cite_note-29) Therefore, they are normally diluted with a carrier oil for topical application such as [jojoba may occur with many cold pressed [citrus](/wiki/Citrus) peel oils such as lemon or [lime](/wiki/Lime_(fruit)). [[30]](#cite_note-30) Many essential oils have chemical components that are [sensitisers](/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)) (meaning that they will, after a number of uses, cause reactions on the skin and more so in the rest of the body). [[4]](#cite_note-fda-4) All cosmetic products and ingredients must meet the same safety requirement, regardless of their source.Chemical composition of essential oils could be affected by [herbicides](/wiki/Herbicide) if the original plants are cultivated versus wild-harvested. [[31]](#cite_note-iufh-31) [[32]](#cite_note-vhet-32) Some oils can be toxic to some domestic animals, with cats being particularly prone. [[33]](#cite_note-33) Most oils can be toxic to humans as well. [[34]](#cite_note-34) A report of three cases documented [gynecomastia](/wiki/Gynecomastia) in prepubertal boys who were exposed to topical lavender and [tea tree oils](/wiki/Tea_tree_oil). [[35]](#cite_note-35) The Aromatherapy Trade Council of the UK issued a rebuttal. [[36]](#cite_note-36) Another article published by a different research group also documented three cases of gynecomastia in prepubertal boys who were exposed to topical lavender oil. [[37]](#cite_note-37) Persistent exposure to lavender products may be associated with premature breast development in girls and \"that chemicals in lavender oil and tea tree oil are potential [endocrine disruptors](/wiki/Endocrine_disruptors) with varying effects on receptors for two hormones - [estrogen](/wiki/Estrogen) and [androgen](/wiki/Androgen)\". [[38]](#cite_note-38) Essential oils can be toxic when ingested or absorbed internally. Doses as low as 2 ml have been reported to cause clinically significant symptoms and severe poisoning can occur after ingestion of as little as 4 ml. [[39]](#cite_note-39) A few reported cases of toxic reactions like [liver](/wiki/Liver) damage and seizures have occurred after ingestion of sage, hyssop, thuja and cedar oils. [[40]](#cite_note-40) Accidental ingestion may happen when oils are not kept out of reach of children. As with any [bioactive](/wiki/Biological_activity) substance, an essential oil that may be safe for the general public could still pose hazards for pregnant and lactating women. [[41]](#cite_note-41) Oils both ingested and applied to the skin can potentially have negative interactions with conventional medicine. For example, the topical use of [methyl salicylate](/wiki/Methyl_salicylate)-heavy oils like [wintergreen](/wiki/Wintergreen) may cause bleeding in users taking the [anticoagulant](/wiki/Anticoagulant) [warfarin](/wiki/Warfarin). In late 2021, an aromatherapy spray was recalled after it was found to be contaminated with [Burkholderia pseudomallei](/wiki/Burkholderia_pseudomallei), the bacteria that causes [melioidosis](/wiki/Melioidosis), which led to four cases of the disease and two deaths.
