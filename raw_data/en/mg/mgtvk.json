Opole, MD, PhD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents About Low Platelets Food and Platelets Dietary Strategies Foods to Eat Foods to Avoid Supplements for Low Blood Platelets If you have a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), eating certain foods may help increase your count. While there is no \"low platelet diet\" per se, good nutrition plays a central role in the synthesis, production, and function of these blood-clotting cells. Increasing your intake of vitamin C, folate, iron, and other essential nutrients may improve your platelet count and help your platelets (thrombocytes) function more effectively. Low platelet treatment foods include whole grains, fresh fruits, nuts, legumes, and vegetables\u2014especially leafy green ones, which are excellent sources of vitamin K. This article explains how diet factors into your platelet count and lists the foods you should eat and avoid if you have thrombocytopenia. Verywell / Theresa Chiechi What Does It Feel Like to Have a Low Platelet Count? About Low Platelets A low blood platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, occurs when your blood platelet count is less than 150,000 platelets per microliter. Platelets are tiny blood cells made in the bone marrow that play an essential function: They stick together to form a blood clot and seal a wound. If you have thrombocytopenia, you may have trouble stopping bleeding, which can be life-threatening. What Causes Thrombocytopenia? Low blood platelet levels can occur when the body does not make enough blood platelets or platelets are being destroyed in the bloodstream, spleen, or liver. Thrombocytopenia can be inherited, idiopathic (of unknown origin), or caused by medications like blood thinners, antibiotics, and chemotherapy. It can also be caused by various health conditions, including: Anemia Autoimmune diseases Blood cancer Exposure to toxins Heavy alcohol use Malnutrition Viral hepatitis Signs of Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia typically does not have obvious symptoms, though it can cause excessive bleeding. This can appear as: Bleeding from your gumsBlood in your urine or stoolCuts that bleed for a long timeHeavy menstrual periodsNosebleedsSevere bruising (purpura)Small, flat red spots under the skin (petechiae) Relationship Between Diet and Platelets Nutrition plays a vital role in producing blood platelets. By improving nutrition, you may be able to reverse low platelet counts and improve platelet function. Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that are important for the development of healthy blood platelets include: Folate: This is a B vitamin that aids with the repair and growth of blood cells. Folate deficiency is associated with low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. Vitamin B12: This is another B vitamin that the body needs to make platelets and other blood cells. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a key contributor to low platelet counts. Iron: Iron powers the \"energy cells\" of platelets (called mitochondria) and makes them more efficient. Severe iron deficiency can lead to thrombocytopenia. Vitamin C: Vitamin C helps absorb iron. It also helps platelets clump together and function efficiently when clotting. Vitamin D: Vitamin D helps make bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside bones that produces platelets and other blood cells. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to platelet dysfunction and the formation of potentially harmful clots (thrombus). Vitamin K: Vitamin K is a nutrient needed for blood clotting. It may not increase your platelet count, but it may improve platelet function. Probiotics: Probiotics are \"good\" bacteria found in fermented foods and supplements that may prevent the formation of clots. Other studies suggest that probiotics may stimulate blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP): The human body produces this amino acid from L-tryptophan. Tryptophan, found in foods and supplements, may help increase serotonin levels in the body. Serotonin is a hormone that helps platelets clump together and causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow) to reduce bleeding. Chlorophyll: This is the green pigment found in vegetables and algae that studies suggest may increase platelet counts. However, other research indicates that a chlorophyll-rich supplement, called chlorella, might cause thrombocytopenia if used in excess. Dietary Strategies for Low Platelets Much of the current research into nutrition and platelets is focused on people with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). This is a condition in which the body's immune system spontaneously attacks its platelets. Among the proposed dietary strategies for ITP are the Mediterranean and macrobiotic diets. The Mediterranean diet is nutrient-dense and includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and olive oil. Macrobiotic diets focus on high fiber and complex carbohydrates in whole grains and vegetables. In both cases, adherence to these diets helped people with ITP achieve and maintain healthy platelet levels compared to those who didn't eat the diets. (Note that there is no evidence that either diet can prevent ITP or treat ITP on its own.) According to guidance from the Platelet Disorders Support Association, ITP and other forms of thrombocytopenia may benefit from the following eating strategies: Increased intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grainsIncreased intake of leafy green vegetables that contain high amounts of vitamin K, calcium, and other mineralsHealthy fats, such as olive oil and canola oilOrganic foods that are not treated with pesticides, herbicides, or insecticides Foods to Eat Meeting the recommended daily intake of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients is key to good health. This includes the nutrients vital to the production of platelets. Here is a list of foods to help meet those needs (categorized by nutrient): Folate: Spinach, black-eyed peas, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, romaine lettuce, avocado, broccoli, mustard green wheat germVitamin B12: Clams, bluefin tuna, bluefin, fortified nutritional yeast, Atlantic salmon, lean ground meat, egg, turkey, tempehIron: Breakfast cereals fortified with iron, oysters, white beans, lentils, spinach, tofu, kidney beans, sardines, chickpeas, baked potato, cashew nutsVitamin C: Colorful fruits and peppers, peppers, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, cantaloupe, cabbage, cauliflower, sweet potato, spinach, green peas, mangoesVitamin D: Rainbow trout, sockeye salmon, UV-light-exposed mushrooms, fortified nondairy milk, fortified ready-to-eat cereal, sardines, egg, light tuna fish, portabella mushrooms, chicken breastVitamin K: Fermented tofu or natto, collard greens, turnip greens, spinach, kale, broccoli, soybeans, carrot juice, edamame, pumpkin, pomegranate juice, okra, pine nuts, iceberg lettuce, chicken breast, cashews, carrots, olive oil, dried figs, chicken liver, hard-boiled eggChlorophyll: Kiwi, spinach, collard greens, mustard greens, alfalfa, parsley, broccoli, green cabbage, asparagus, sea vegetables (seaweed, chlorella, spirulina, and algae)Melatonin: Tart cherries, eggs, fish, Yogurt, fermented foods like kimchi, kefir, tempeh, miso, sauerkraut, pickles, supplementsTryptophan: Turkey, chicken, salmon, eggs, spinach, seeds, tofu, tempeh, nuts Foods to Avoid Some foods and drinks can negatively affect platelet production. If you have a low platelet count or a platelet disorder, it is best to avoid the following foods: Alcohol: Wine, beer, and spirit can all suppress the bone marrow, especially when consumed in excess. High glycemic index (GI) foods: These are foods made with refined grains or simple carbohydrates that increase blood sugar. High blood sugar can interfere with the clumping of platelets and increase the risk of bleeding. Certain fruits and vegetables: Quercetin, an antioxidant found in blueberries, kiwi, grapefruit, grapes, garlic, onions, tomatoes, turmeric, and ginger, can interfere with blood clotting. Saturated fat: These are fats in red meat, dairy, fried foods, and processed foods that increase inflammation and interfere with platelet production. High-sodium foods: Foods high in sodium (salt) can promote platelets' abnormal clumping and blood clots' formation. Artificial sweeteners: There is evidence that the high consumption of artificial sweeteners like aspartame can lower platelet counts. Supplements for Low Blood Platelets If you are unable to get adequate nutrition through diet, talk to your healthcare provider about taking supplements. Folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin K supplements are particularly beneficial, according to the Platelet Disorder Support Association (PSDA). Other supplements that may positively influence platelet counts or function include: Chlorophyll: Found in plant-based green supplements such as algae and seaweed, chlorophyll may improve thrombocytopenia but should be used in moderation. Cows' colostrum: The first secretion of the mammary glands before milk is produced, cows' colostrum contains immunoglobulins that may help with autoimmune forms of thrombocytopenia. Melatonin: This is a naturally occurring hormone sold as a supplement for people with sleep problems. Some studies have shown that it can stimulate the formation of platelets and temper some of the inflammatory responses that can contribute to thrombocytopenia. Noni juice: A popular Polynesian folk remedy, noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) juice is rich in antioxidants and other compounds with potent anti-inflammatory properties. While more research is needed, noni may benefit people with autoimmune forms of thrombocytopenia. Before taking supplements, speak to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Some supplements can interact negatively with medications. Supplements to Avoid Some herbal supplements can interfere with blood clotting and should be avoided by people with thrombocytopenia. These include: EchinaceaEphedraGinkgoGinsengGingerKavaSaw palmettoSt. John's wortValerian Summary While no diet is guaranteed to increase a low platelet count, eating foods rich in folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, and iron may help. Probiotics and melatonin, 5-HTP, or chlorophyll supplements may also be beneficial. If you have a low platelet count, focus on eating fresh, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Also, try to limit your intake of alcohol, sugar, saturated fat, and high-sodium foods.
