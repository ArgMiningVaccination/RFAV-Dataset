The relationship between a teache r and a student is defined as a formalized interpersonal association between an author ity figure and a subordinate who interact on nearly a day to day basis. A cross-case analysis of five individual case studies of elementary grade classroom teachers teaching in a 500 stude nt preschool through fifth grade predominately Caucasian middle-income small town school locat ed approximately an hour from a large Midwestern metropolitan city was used to inve stigate the following research questions: (a) What teacher and student behaviors do teachers p erceive contribute most directly to developing and maintaining positive and supportive teacher- student relationships? (b) To what extent do teachers perceive their interacti ons with students influence the academic and behavioral success of students in their classrooms ? (c) How do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence their students' future academic and behavioral success? (d) How do teachers perceive school culture affects student behavior and academic performance and achievement? Through analysis of teacher int erviews, classroom observations, and participant journals, four predominate themes were de termined: iv (a) relationships; (b) culture; (c) high quality instruction; and (d) behavior ma nagement. The data from this study showed that these teachers believe that there is value i n forming and maintaining positive and supportive relationships with their students in providing for thei r students' academic achievement and behavioral success. The data also showed t hat these teachers feel the classroom and school culture influences academics and behavior and believe it is important to understand and respond to individual student cultures. These teachers al l spoke of and wrote about the importance of planning high quality instruction in providing for academic and behavioral success and high quality instruction was observed in ea ch teacher's classroom. These teachers felt a system-wide positive behavior manageme nt plan and classroom management procedures that taught students how to behave and supported positive behavior through student accountability also was important in providing for academic and behavioral success. - v APPROVAL PAGE The faculty listed below, appointed by the Dean of the School of Education, have examined a dissertation titled \"The Power of Teacher-Student Relationships in Determining Student Success,\" presented by Michael David Camp, candidate for the Doctora te of Education degree, and certify that in their opinion it is worthy of acceptance.

It was the one place where I could visit with and get to know each and ever y one of the approximately 500 students that came through the school doors each morning. With that many students we celebrated a lot of birthdays. It rarely failed that when w ishing a child a happy birthday some curious youngster would ask me how old I was. It was quite entertaining to get the kids to debate my age. \"I think he is 28 because my dad is 28... \" or, \"He is a principal so he is old, like my grandpa...my grandpa is 52.\" Sometimes I would tell them the year I was born and we would figure it out together as a \"group project.\" My fundamental belief as a school leader was that students had the right to enjoy lif e and learning and we as educators had the responsibility to preserve that right. As a child of the sixties, ours was a typical working middle income family...sort of. I was the first born. My brother came along eleven and a half months later. A yea r later my sister was born, and the following year brought another brother. My parents stopped re nting and bought a house for their ever-growing family. My father worked full time i n retail and my mother, while an x-ray technician by profession, stayed home to raise us kids. Two years later, five days before my sixth birthday, siblings five and six were born. My new twin sisters meant my parents had six children under the age of six years old. Growing up the oldest of six kids who were so close in age I didn't get a lot of attention. My first brother needed glasses and couldn't say his r's. My sister ne eded leg braces to correct her stance. My youngest brother's vision required surgerie s and for him to wear eye patches. With the twins there were two of them and they were the babi es so they xv got a lot of attention. I was the normal one...except that I was constantly getti ng corrected for wiggling around and I seemed not to learn as fast as my classmates. I was in trouble quite a bit and had to stay after school to catch up. When I was in fifth grade my family moved to a new city. My fifth grade teacher changed my life. He was my first male teacher and was unlike any teache r I had known before. He was funny and he told stories and showed he cared. I still had a hard time concentrating and learning the material but this was a different breed of teache r than what I had experienced before. He worked with me and encouraged me to learn. Junior High was still academically tough but I was developing my own coping strategies and began to experience success. I still had some struggles but made huge gains academically. By the time I reached high school I had defeated the obstacl es that stood in my way of learning and enjoyed much academic success. My most influential teach er was my junior and senior English teacher. She was serious but used humor effectively and though she demanded excellence she did so with care and support and I wanted to do well in her class. I graduated fifth in my class of 165 with a 3.95 GPA and earned a college scholarship. Posi tive and supportive relationships with teachers made the difference. These teacher s inspired me to look to public education for my life's calling. In my various administrative roles I have been responsible for student discipline a nd teacher evaluations. It seemed apparent, even without conducting a formal study, t hat the most highly rated teachers had the fewest discipline issues. Likewise, the t eachers who seemed to have the most behavior concerns with students also seemed to struggle mor e with teaching pedagogy. These were also the teachers who generated the most student and parent xvi complaints regarding their treatment of children. The teachers I found mys elf spending the most developmental time with were the teachers who had the frequent discipline is sues. Teaching in an elementary school is not a job. It is a life calling and requir es a strong commitment to kids. Teachers must be empowered to form and maintain positive and supportive relationships with their students so that their students may grow and devel op into successful and contributing members of the adult society. It was the goal of this study to explore the characteristics of effective teachers and to investigate how t hese teachers perceive their relationships with their students positively affects their b ehavior and academic success. 1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY Purpose Statement The purpose of this ethnomethodological exploratory descriptive case study w as to investigate and understand teacher perceptions of the relationships between teachers and students and how teachers perceive those relationships affect student acade mic performance and behavior in a pre-school through fifth grade small town elementary school . For this research, the relationship between a teacher and a student was generally d efined as a formalized interpersonal association between an authority figure and a subordi nate who interact on nearly a day to day basis (Larson, Wilson, Brown, Furstenberg, & Verm a, 2002; Bartlett, 2005). In the past two decades classroom management has gone from a recognition-and - punishment intervention based paradigm to a focus on prevention through the development of classroom communities in which norms are established and academic routines pr omote constructive work (LaPage et al., 2005). Early classroom management practi ces included Pavlov's theories of behavior conditioning and reinforcement suggesting this was the m anner in which to elicit desirable behavior. Many new teachers find their energies focused on classroom management and discipline. According to Bransford, Darling-Hamm ond, and LaPage (2005), research demonstrates that effective teaching begins wi th a meaningful curriculum and motivating and engaging instruction. In my various roles in sc hool administration I have observed some tremendously empowering and engaging cla ssrooms, 2 too many teachers still rely on the authority of their teaching positions to g et through the day rather than putting effort into getting to know and serving the needs of their indi vidual students. According to Horace Mann (as cited in Mondale & Patton, 2001), the primary goal for public education is to \"serve all boys and girls\" and \"give each student an equa l chance in life\" (p. 29). Shapiro (2006) agrees declaring: ...the first job of the school is to help all young people become effective citizens in a democracy. Democratic citizenship, in any era, is a complex task but it seem s especially difficult at this time when international conflict and growing economic and social inequality are the rule and not the exception. (p. 1) Education must have moral purpose. Schools must teach core values and the necessary pedagogy to prepare our children to become democratic citizens a nd to lead a productive life. The current accountability pressure of No Child Left Behind has unfortunately resulted in a greater focus on preparing students to take a test tha n on moral development (Storey & Beeman, 2006). Driven by high stakes testing regimes and m andated curricula, if schools do not carefully and purposefully attend to moral and democratic development, there is a real danger of regressing to scientifically mana ged factory schools of Taylor's efficiency era (Callahan, 1962). With increasing empirical attention, the teacher-student relationship has been identified in the literature as a significant factor influencing academic and behavioral success in school. In their work with Love and Logic, Fay and Funk (1995) found that students who do not feel they enjoy positive relationships with their teachers are more dis ruptive, are less likely to be academic engaged, and are more likely to drop out. Other researchers il lustrate 3 significant behavioral and academic improvement (Eccles et al., 1993; Bak er, Terry, Bridger, & Winsor, 1997) and motivation to learn (Steinberg, Brown, & Dornbusch, 1996) when students enjoy caring and supportive relationships with teachers. Problem Statement As a middle school assistant principal for four years in the early 2000s in an urban 600 student middle school and as the principal of two 400-500 student elementary schools, one urban setting for four years and one small town school for two years, in two Mi dwestern states, one of my responsibilities was to observe, develop and evaluate probationary t eachers and tenured teachers on the evaluation cycle. When these teachers were aware t hey were to be observed most would prepare elaborate and wonderfully detailed lessons. It was evident from student response for some of these teachers that this was not the norm. The les sons would look wonderful on paper but the teaching would appear awkward and the teacher nervous and students would often passively sabotage the lessons. It would become apparent that students were not accustomed to these types of lessons and even those who wished to support the teacher would not know how. It was also obvious the teachers who prepared and delivered the same high quality lessons daily as they prepared and delivered for f ormal evaluations. Students were actively engaged, the lesson would progress smoothly , and there was a sense of comfort in the student and teacher interaction. More frustrati ng were the teachers who did not seem to care that they were being evaluated. Some seemed to s ee the observation as a nuisance with no real fear of consequence due to tenure. These teacher s who did not plan for maximum learning opportunities, but technically met the requireme nts for continued employment, certainly did not serve the best interests of students. 4 While serving as an assistant principal, I was responsible for student disci pline. I worked daily with adolescents who rebelled against the school system and who were wha t most educators would consider at risk for failure. I usually encountered these s tudents as a result of discipline referrals and a typical referral would involve a student show ing disrespect to a teacher. While not as prominently encountered in my elementary principalshi ps, I still responded to many respect-based discipline issues and it was as clear with e lementary students as it was with middle school students that many of these students were struggling in their interactions with their teachers. As these students progressed through t heir school years, their records typically demonstrated an increase in behavior issues as the ir academic achievement declined. In conversing with these young people a thread that often appe ared was a dislike or distrust for teachers. I began to question whether some of these teachers were in fact disrespecting their students. A few of these students with who I was a ble to develop trusting relationships shared that they felt their teachers had been treatin g them unfairly for years. A review of several cumulative records of students showed early primar y teacher reports with encouraging comments and positive marks for behavior. A common pattern would be a negative change in such comments and a record of disciplinary incidents increasing in the intermediate grades. Also typical would be a decline in grades a nd performance during these years. These were the students that stood out. What about the students who were underserved but less obvious in their reaction? Did they also fail to benefit from pos itive relationships with teachers? Knestrict (2007) reflects on his life in school s haring: I am struck by the times teachers failed to connect with me on any real hum an level. I am a professor of education now, and I am still struck by the lack of emphasis on this 5 human connection in education. We spend so much of our time as teachers worrying about the standards, giving tests, and focusing entirely on content that the child a s a person seems to disappear. (p. 786) I do not pretend that all teachers treat all students fairly. I do not pretend that al l teachers are genuinely nice people. It is easy to understand why these teac hers encounter problems with students. Many teachers, however, do try to be fair and are kind and gener ous. Still, they face resentment and disenfranchisement from many students who once appeared to be on the road to success. What makes these students whose early records show such promis e rebel against such giving and compassionate adults? I have observed a correlation that students who perceive they do not enjoy a positive and supportive relationship with their teacher tend to struggle academically a nd behaviorally in school. In my experiences as a teacher and as an administrator developing and evaluating teachers, positive and supportive relationships between teachers and students ar e essential for creating an effective learning environment. Jones (1987a) states that near ly every poll of parents and teachers lists discipline as the number one concern in most classrooms . According to Wickham, Britten, and McCart (2001), the single most common request f or assistance from teachers is related to behavior and classroom manageme nt. First year teachers frequently cite difficulties in classroom management as thei r most significant problems (Polloway & Patton, 1993). In the mid 1990s, public schools were reporting all- time highs in violence and vandalism, alcohol and drug problems, and problems of discipline and disruption (Barr & Parrett, 1995). More recent data suggested that even though ex treme violence was stabilizing and historically low, the rate of disruptive problem behavior was escalating and classrooms contained an increasing percentage of students who were at risk of 6 failing, dropping out of school, and disconnected from society. Besides affecting educ ational performance and achievement, school behavior problems affect society. No Child Left Behind. In the United States, The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, officially registered as Public Law 107-110, became law on January 8, 2002 (107th Congress, 2002). This law, commonly referred to as NCLB, reauthorized a number of fed eral programs aimed at improving performance in United States public schools through meas ures of state, district, and school accountability. The stated purpose of the No Child Le ft Behind (NCLB) act is to address the diverse needs of public school students nationwide by identifying achievement gaps between White middle income students and lower income students of color and motivating schools to close those gaps through an accountability syst em of graduated sanctions (Olbrys, 2004). To make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), all students and all subgroups must score at or above state determined levels of proficiency. Subgroups are composed of the diffe rent racial and ethnic groups, students with disabilities, economically disadvanta ged students, and English language learners. Schools that do not make AYP as a whole or in any subgroup for two consecutive years are said to \"need improvement\" and are subject to increa sing sanctions (Owens & Sunderman, 2006). By disaggregating student performance by race and c lass, NCLB effectively identifies long-standing inequalities between groups, a nd this identification could ideally prompt efforts to serve the needs of these students histor ically neglected in many schools (Darling-Hammond, 2007). The result of this mandate has bee n to create a pressure cooker environment where teachers are feeling the str ess to make Adequate Yearly Progress. Adequate Yearly Progress is a level of proficiency , determined by each 7 state, which a specified percentage of the state's students must achieve as determined by state assessment in a given year (\"Adequate Yearly Progress,\" n.d.). NCLB requires every student to score at or above \"proficiency\" on standardiz ed assessments of math, reading, writing and science by 2014. This has never been done bef ore and is likely to never happen ever especially considering the fuzzy definitions of \"proficiency.\" For many reasons, not every student experiences success in school. NCLB does not want excuses. NCLB demands results from all students in every subgroup and t hey are expected to all perform at their grade level, regardless of their diverse abilities (Shannon, 2005). This pre-qualifies most schools for eventual failure. According to Street (2007) , \"A 'good-performing school,' by the dominant definition, is one with high and/or rising standardized test scores\" (p. 1). Street says this to make a point. I once served on a district improvement committee where the directive from the S tate was to develop a SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, research-based, a nd time-based) goal to help our district's students make academic achievement as measured by the state assessment test so we might make \"Adequate Yearly Progress, get off of \"Improvement\" status, and avoid the graduated sanctions that were looming above us. In discussing the SMART goal, our assistant superintendent said, \"Our goal is to make AYP.\" A few people laughed. She wasn't joking. I knew this district leader quite well and I did not fee l this was what she believed in her heart but the pressure to perform well on this test caused t his district administrator to put her belief in a well rounded and personalized education for all st udents on the back burner and concentrate future district professional development on test score improvement strategies. For her, the pressure to improve test scores was an ine scapable reality. Educators must struggle with this conflict and determine for thems elves what is right 8 for kids. Many teachers and schools that once strived to incorporate the child's voic e democratically into the planning process have had to silence and dismiss those voic es greatly because their ideas might not fit the tested curriculum. As Knestrict (2005) s ummarizes: We know that human connection is crucial to child development, but our schools fail to manifest this knowledge in practice. Classes get bigger and bigger, and test scores matter more and more. Our cultural obsession with measurement and testing often serves to sort students, not help them. (p. 786) The Achievement Gap. The standardized testing occurring in today's diverse schools is clearly the antithesis of democratic accountability and perpet uates the achievement gap. According to Beane (1998), test scores are the false idols of education. Bur eaucrats allege that a one-size-fits-all testing paradigm is the only reliable me asure of academic proficiency (Johnson, 2007), and school systems, principals, and teachers are being forc ed to adopt measures they know will not produce a fair or accurate analysis of student pe rformance but will instead assign inaccurate and unfair performance data to underprivi leged students who are underserved and assaulted by an antidemocratic system of accountabilit y. Mullen and Johnson (2006) suggest these standardized tests are biased and serve to sort and sociali ze children to fit a racist and capitalistic culture. Research shows children of poverty typically perform below middle and upper- income students. Similarly, research indicates that African America n students perform considerably behind their White counterparts (Kalmijin & Kraaykamp, 1996). Table 1 shows the percentages of 4th and 8th grade students by achievement level as they perf ormed on standardized reading achievement tests in 2009. These gaps are persistent and ex ist 9 throughout the country and correlate with increased dropout rates and a disproportionate assignment of special education labels (Nieto, 1999; Barton, 2003). Table 1 Reading Achievement Gaps: 2009 Grade 4 Grade 8 At or above Basic At or above Proficient At Advanced At or above Basic At or above Proficient At Advanced Total 67% 33% 8% 75% 32% 3% Male 64 30 6 71 28 2 Female 70 36 9 79 37 4 White 78 42 10 84 41 4 Black 48 16 2 57 14 <1 Hispanic 49 17 3 61 17 1 Asian/Pac .Isl. 80 49 16 83 45 6 Am.

Achievement levels define what students should know and be able to do: Basic indicates partial mastery of fundamental skills; Proficient indicates de monstrated c ompetency over challenging subject matter; and Advanced indicates superior perform ance. The percentage of students at or above Proficient includes students at the Proficient a nd the Advanced achievement levels. Similarly, the percentage of students at or above B asic includes students at the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced achievement levels. Adapt ed from \"2009 Reading Assessments.\" U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. NAEP Data Explorer. Frutcher (2007) suggests while purported to decrease the achievement gap between majority students and those of minority sub-groups, this NCLB/AYP plan is defecti ve and dangerous and forces many schools and teachers to divert their efforts from \"good pr actice\" 10 and what they know is best for kids to meeting a state-determined number of proficient- or- above student scores on standardized imposed standard is humiliation assessments without regard for the uncontrollable and many times invisible nuances that exist in man y schools. Dropout Rates. Regardless of socioeconomic status, students who do not feel valued and cared for or cared about must feel disenfranchised and deprived of educational opportunities. It is likely that these students do not clearly recognize they ar e not having their educational and personal needs met but they know they are uncomfortable in the school setting and many seek escape. Likewise, students who do not experience academic s uccess in school or struggle to fit the ideal mold behaviorally often have little motivation t o persevere through what can be years of negativity and feeling of poor self-efficacy. According to Pytel (2006), \"The traditional high school format does not meet the needs of many students living in today's society,\" and they fail to see the rele vance between \"what they are learning and the need in the world for the information\" (p. 1). The Mat h and Reading Help authors (\"The Importance of Teacher-Student Relationships,\" 2010) s uggest, \"Most students dropping out of high school have had problems throughout their entire educational careers\" (p. 1). The decision to drop out of school is not typically made at the spur of the moment but results from years of academic struggles, behavior issue s, and social problems. Drop out prevention strategies do little good when targeted at high school ag ed students for the damage has likely already been done. Attention instead needs to be foc used on students as they begin to experience struggles in school, often in the earliest gr ades. According to the Alliance of Excellent Education Fact Sheet (\"High school dropouts in America,\" 2009), approximately 71% of our nation's children complete high school and graduate with a standard diploma. Almost half of African American and Hispanic s tudents 11 complete high school and graduate with their classmates. In some states th e gap between White and minority graduation is as much as 40 to 50 percentage points.

The status dropout rate is the percentage of 16-24 year-olds are not enrolled in school and not earning a high school credential. Adapted from \"Dropout rates in the United St ates,\" by L. Laird, S. Lew, M. Debell, and C. D. Chapman, 2006, U.S.D.E, National Center for Education Statistics. Individuals who do not complete high school are more likely to receive government assistance and to stay on government assistance longer than those with at least a high school diploma (Boisjoly, Harris, & Duncan, 1998). Female high school dropouts are more likely to join the growing welfare dependent underclass, have children at younger ages, use more illicit drugs, and become single mothers then female high school graduates (E gemba & Crawford, 2003; Grant & Sleeter, 2005). LuPont (2010) suggests, \"Pre-adolescence and 12 adolescence are high-risk years for alcohol and drug abuse,\" (p. 1) and cites e arly drug and alcohol use as primary risk factors for dropping out of school. Numerous studies have explored the relationship between dropping out of school and the use of illicit substances a nd noted a correlation of higher rates of substance use among dropouts than among adolescents who stay in school or graduate. Bruno and Doscher (1979), for instance, documented the higher levels of drug use in Hispanic dropouts. Fagan and Pabon (1985) conducted a study where they found that 54% of dropouts reported using illicit drugs compared to 30% of thos e still in school. Guagliardo, Huang, Hicks, and D'Angelo (1998) reported that early age dr ug use was a predicting factor for dropping out of high school or being old for a given g rade. Further, high school dropouts are more likely to become involved in crime. High school dropouts represent disproportionately high percentages of prison and death row inmates. \"Failure to graduate from high school,\" according to Harlow (2003), \"i s associated with a tripling of the likelihood of being imprisoned,\" p. 10). In the twelve years betw een 1983 and 1995, more jails were built in the United States than schools or hospitals (Zukin, 1995). This imprisonment has historically not been equitably distributed among the races and ethnic groups. According to Chanse (2002), from 1977 to 1985, \"when prison populations almost tripled, 70% of new inmates were African American, Latino, or other nonwhite minorities\" (p. 3). Research shows that high school dropouts commit 82% of crimes in the United States (Wickham et al., 2001) and over 80% of the inmates of America's prisons are high school dropouts (Barr & Parrett, 1995). The United States Department of Justic e estimates 50% of death row inmates dropped out of high school (Lochner & Moretti, 2004; Laird, Lew, Debell, & Chapman, 2006). Between 2006 and 2007 time period, 1.4% of American 16-24 year old men and women were institutionalized. Of these incarcer ated 13 young people, 0.1% held bachelor degrees, 0.7% had completed one to three years of colleg e, 1.0% were high school graduates, and 6.3% were high school dropouts without a GED certificate. Sixty three times more high school drop outs were incarcerated t han prisoners with bachelor degrees (Sum, Khatiwada, McLaughlin, & Palma, 2009). High school dropouts are more likely then graduates to live in poverty and be unemployed as they typically lack the minimum skills and qualifications to compet e in today's technologically complex society (Caspi, Wright, Moffit, & Silva, 1998) . According to Sum et al. (2009), There was an average jobless rate of 54% for young (16-24 year old) high school dropouts during 2008 which was 22% higher than the jobless rate of high school graduates. Table 3 compares the national jobless percentage by educat ion status for 2008. Table 3 Jobless Rates, 2008 Education Status Jobless Percentage High School Dropout 54 High School Graduate 32 1-3 years College 21 4 year College Degree 13 Note . Adapted from \"The consequences of dropping out of high school: Joblessness and jailing for high school dropouts and the high cost for taxpayers,\" by A. Sum, I. Khatiwada, J. McLaughlin, and S. Palma, 2009, Center for Labor Market Studies . Students of color are far more likely than White students not to finish high school. According to Orfield (2004) approximately 75% of White students graduate with a standard diploma in four years compared to only 50% of Black high school students. This discr epancy also translates to the unemployment market. In 2008, Sum et al. (2009) point out, Black 14 dropouts were unemployed at a rate of \"69% followed by Asians at 57%, Whites at 54% a nd Hispanics at 47%\" with the \" above average employment rates of Hispanic dropout s primarily reflect[ing] the sharply higher employment rates of young Hi spanic immigrants, many of whom were undocumented immigrants\" (p. 3). Need for the Study We are first and foremost economic creatures. America is not so much a culture as it is an economy, and our sense of worth and purpose is to be found in our capacity to secure material benefits (Postman, 1996). This is dominant in society and can be seen in schools through the focus and emphasis on standards, testing, and accountability. Schools are bureaucratic and social institutions. No matter how democratic we may wish f or schools to be, with few exceptions schools today look much like schools of a century past, resembling mechanistic factory model assembly lines, in form and function (Darling-Ham mond, 1997). As almost any school is a microcosm of the society in which it exists and schools a ccordingly represent the ideologies of the greater society, the purpose of school becomes to t rain and produce contributing members to the greater society\u2014cogs in the machine. The reali ty is these kids will one day be running our society and they must be prepared to do so. Accordingly, the function of school must be to combine both ideals and prepare our children democratically to take their places in society. The haves, for the most part , will continue to have, and the have nots, will continue to have not, or at least to have far less than the haves. Teachers may want to practice democratic learning but when the bell tolls it is the teacher who is called to defend the choices made and the lessons learned. The teacher is expe cted to keep the order and to make most of the decisions. Accordingly, the teacher must str uggle to 15 represent democratic practices in the classroom and take care not to impart pe rsonal ideological sentiments and the capitalist ideologies of the dominant society. When teacher candidates are asked about their future classroom concerns, most express anxiety about dealing with potential student disruptions and misbehavior (La Page et al., 2005). Bernard (2003) suggests when students are asked what they want and need in a teacher, they unequivocally want \"a caring teacher who accepts \"no excuses\" a nd who refuses to let them fail\" (pp. 115-116). According to Trumbull, Greenfield, and Quiroz (2003), most teachers in the twentieth century were prepared using a \"Piaget ion approach to developmental psychology, which saw development primarily as an individual rather t han a social matter\" (p. 69). Today, we know much more about teaching and learning. Resea rch, according to Marzano (2003), has demonstrated that teacher actions have twice the influence on student achievement as do school policies regarding curriculum, assessment, staf f collegiality, and community involvement. School is one of the first places where beh avior and future success is shaped. Teachers have the power to provide positive or negative experiences for their students. Brendro, Brokenleg, and VanBocken (1990) asser t the school is the only institution that provides for the development of long-term relationships w ith all of our children. There are many kinds of teachers and some are more effective than others. Through my life I had some teachers who were well prepared and others who did little mor e than show up. I had some teachers who treated students fairly and others who seemed to enjoy holding court over their students. Teachers can make or break a student's ability to enj oy academic success. This is an awesome power that must be taken seriously. Wi th this in mind, the purpose of this case study was to investigate teacher perceptions about the relationships 16 between teachers and students and to determine the qualities of those relationshi ps that teachers perceive contribute to student success. This study investigated fiv e successful teachers who had been determined through professional evaluations to consistently form and maintain positive and support relationships with their students. In collecting the da ta of this study, many of the nuances of these relationships were observed, discussed, and analyz ed. These observed teacher attributes indicate both academic and behavioral succe ss in and beyond these teachers' classrooms. Accordingly, the resulting data from stud ying these teacher behaviors should be used to inform teacher training programs, professional development in schools, and professional teacher evaluations. If our students are our fut ure, then our teachers must understand how they either support or thwart their success. Research Questions The specific questions this study intended to address were: 1. What teacher and student behaviors do teachers perceive contribute most directl y to developing and maintaining positive and supportive teacher-student relationships? 2. To what extent do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence t he academic and behavioral success of students in their classrooms? 3. How do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence their s tudents' future academic and behavioral success? 4. How do teachers perceive school culture affects student behavior and academic performance and achievement? To answer these questions, exploratory descriptive case studies of five gener al education elementary classroom teachers were designed and conducted. 17 Theoretical Framework The purpose of this ethnomethodological exploratory descriptive case study informed through the lenses of narratology and portraiture was to investigate teacher perceptions of the relationships between teachers and students and to determine the qualities of those relationships that teachers perceive influence students behaviorally and acade mically. A theoretical framework is a collection of interrelated concepts that guides the research. These teacher-student relationships were examined by considering the critical characteristics that influence and can be influenced by public schooling. These characteristics are introduced here and are explored in detail in the literature review. As I have personall y experienced the pressures of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) initiatives, I began by expl oring and examining their affect, positive and negative, on school culture and student achievement. While touted as an educational reform with its purpose to raise the math and reading l evels of American students through school level accountability, NCLB has had a great nega tive impact and has prompted the complete and detrimental restructuring of many s chool programs. As a counterpoint to the negative pressures of NCLB, democratic schooling, especially as an agent of social justice, was studied and the positives of thi s movement and the obstacles that exist in its implementation were considered. In a democr atic school, the child is at the center and is much more a part of the decision making process. The go al is to aid the child in developing the skills necessary to become a productive democratic ci tizen. My experience has been that democratic education faces resistance beca use it runs counter to what most people know. People are drawn to their comfort zones and too many people find comfort in traditional schooling. Social justice is concerned with fairness a nd equal 18 opportunities for all students. This considered, the literature was examined for thr eats to social justice and movements and methods to counter systematic inequality. A prominent concern faced by the field of education during my leadership career has been the achievement gap between students of color and poverty and White students. I endeavored to explore possible causes for this achievement discrepancy and any p roposed solutions. I especially considered teacher perceptions and expectations or l ack of expectations for minority students. I also reviewed the literature regar ding the possible reasons for the achievement differences I have observed between genders. Culture is a major component of this literature review. I considered culture i n society and in school and I also studied hegemony and how cultural forces work to maintain the status quo. Counter to the status quo, I explored opportunities for school improvement and obstacles against school reculturing. In consideration of how students learn, I inve stigated the constructivist literature and also took a close look at individual student culture and how unique cultures fit in the culture of school and society. For teachers to work effe ctively with students of diverse cultures, I felt it was important to examine what it is to be culturally competent and how multicultural education serves to maximize learning and opportuni ties for all students. The balance of the literature review examined the components of teacher-student relationships and the specific elements of the teaching pedagogy that teach ers can and do influence and that research demonstrates affects academic and behavioral suc cess. If our students are our future then teachers must understand how they either support or thwar t this success. In my career, I have observed that students who do not feel they have a positive and supportive relationship with their teachers often tend to struggle academical ly and 19 behaviorally in school. Some teachers form positive and supportive relationships with students and listen to their needs and empower them to become successful while other teachers intimidate students and keep them in their place and seek to fit these stude nts into conformist molds from which they have a difficult time ever breaking free. Ac cordingly, it was my intent to examine critically the power and influence of teacher-st udent relationships because to not properly prepare students to do more than serve a productive role in societ y is to perform a great disservice. The specific elements of the teaching pedagogy that I researched were selected because, as a school administrator evaluating teachers, I believe these components are critical to student successes or struggles academically and behaviorally. It has be en my experience that teacher effectiveness and effective teaching strategies have be come increasingly popular topics of professional development since the work of Robert Marzano became broadly known during the early 2000s. Accordingly, I included a review of teacher effect iveness and the components Marzano and other researchers find critical for teaching to be e ffective. I also reviewed the literature about student motivation to evaluate the methods and te chniques that motivate students to perform well and behave appropriately. Constructivism, democratic schooling, multiculturalism and just about any educational design beyond lecture understands the important of student engagement. Students who are actively involved in the learning process achieve at higher l evels and behave in productive and appropriate manners. Considering this, I evaluated the student engagement literature for connections between engagement and academic and be havior success and for strategies for increasing active student engagement. Learning is not complete unless students receive feedback regarding their efforts. My experience h as been that 20 feedback that is swift, specific, and positively stated typically results i n higher achievement than feedback that is general, negative, or delayed. I searched the litera ture for connections between feedback and student success and for strategies and practices teacher s can use to improve the feedback they provide for their students. Children learn in different ways and at different rates and all students have t heir own interests and preferences. Accordingly, I included a review and discussion of the literature related to differentiated instruction and how differentiation affects student a chievement. Classroom management is critical to enjoying positive relationships with st udents. Students know when a teacher is not organized or does not have control of the classroom. Some students may respond in negative ways and disrupt the environment even further. Others ma y not react so obviously but may become frustrated and give up trying. Accordingly, I included a thorough analysis of classroom management in the literature review and how cla ssroom management or a lack of classroom management affects student success. Si milarly, effective discipline practices are necessary for student success. Students need to know w hat to expect and that they will be held accountable but treated fairly. I searched the lit erature for connections between discipline procedures and student achievement and behavior and look for methods and strategies to maximize the benefits of an effective disciplin e program. Overview of Methodology This qualitative research consisted of an ethnomethodological exploratory de scriptive case study supported through the lenses of narratology and portraiture designed to e xamine teacher perceptions of the relationships between teachers and their students to determine how teachers perceive their relationships with their students affect acade mic performance and behavior. 21 Theoretical Traditions. As ethnomethodology is considered excellent for seeing how individuals make sense of the social world for themselves (Gingrich, 2003), thi s tradition permitted me to explore fully the relationship dynamics of elemen tary teachers and their students. Similarly, using narratology to interpret stories and to expl ore and expose the intricacies of teacher-student relationships further served to inform this s tudy (Patton, 2002). Finally, since the goal of portraiture is to investigate fully and to illustra te those being studied, using portraiture to create a portrait of an elementary school teach er substantially aided in telling the teacher's stories (English, 2000). Ethnomethodology investigates the norms, understandings and assumptions that are taken for granted by people in a setting because they are so deeply understood that pe ople do not even think about why they do what they do (Patton, 2002). Ethnomethodology is purported in the literature to be a very good method for seeing how individuals make sense o f the social world for themselves. In view of that, this tradition permitted the f ull exploration of the relationship dynamics of teachers and their students. According to Yin (1994) , a case study often serves as the primary design for qualitative inquiry as it provide s for a detailed assessment of a person, group, or setting under study (Yin, 1994). Lincoln and Guba (1985) and Patton (1990) offer two purposes for employing a case study approach: (a) incr easing understanding of the phenomena being studied; and (b) investigating the attributes t hat permit themes to emerge. Stake (1995) suggests an \"instrumental case s tudy...is expected to catch the complexity of a single case...coming to understand its activity wi thin important circumstances\" (p. xi). Stake (2000) further emphasizes the value of a single ins trumental case study is what specifically can be examined to offer insight into an iss ue or reinforce a generalization. \"In a single ethnographic case study,\" Bernard (1995) ass erts, \"there is 22 exactly one unit of analysis\u2014the community or village or tribe\" (pp. 35-36). Within a single case study, Patton (2002) suggests a researcher may study several partic ipants. In this qualitative study, case studies were conducted that explored and chronicled t he complexities of five general education elementary school teachers as they interact ed with and related with their students. Narratology, according to Patton (2002), \"strives to understand the lived experience and perceptions of lived experience\" (p. 115). Patton (2002) further suggests narratolog y focuses specifically on the interpretation of \"stories, life history narra tives, historical memoirs, and creative nonfiction to reveal cultural and social patterns through the lens of individual experiences\" (p. 478). Patton (2002) suggests \"stories and narratives offer especially translucent windows into cultural and social meanings\" (p. 116). Accor dingly, the five teacher participants agreed to keep participant journals specifica lly around issues of student relationships. Narrative analysis was used with the participant journ als which served as data to reveal information about teachers and students and their environment. The da ta from the participant journals was therefore analyzed to develop narratives to aid in t elling the stories of these teachers and their relationships with the children they teach. Interviews and observations were analyzed using a generic coding process to identify themes. Portraiture is a way of capturing the \"essence\" of people (English, 2000). Si milar to narratology, Lawrence-Lightfoot and Davis (1997), suggest portraiture \"blur s the boundaries of aesthetics and empiricism in an effort to capture the complexity, dynamics , and subtlety of human experience and organizational life\" (p. xv). As the purpose of portraiture is to investigate and illustrate subjects being studied, this technique proved helpf ul in telling the stories of the five elementary classroom teachers in this case study . 23 Qualitative analysis commonly centers on specific cases and analysis ac ross cases (Patton, 2002). Case study methodology, by investigating in real-life context, ca n shed needed light on how students and teachers interact in the classroom. Five general educ ation classroom teachers were selected based on specific criterion of high eva luation ratings regarding teacher-student relationships and collected data from three source s\u2014interviews, observations, and participant journals\u2014to inform this study. Setting. The research setting for this study was a 500 student middle-SES predominantly Caucasian elementary school in a small town located approximate ly an hour from a large Midwestern metropolitan area. Participants. These case studies began with an overview of teacher evaluations in search of records that indicate superior rating in the areas related to st udent relationships. From this overview, five teachers were identified as the focus of these cas e studies. Sampling Techniques. Selection of the participants was accomplished using purposive criterion-based sampling. According to Maxwell (2005), purposeful cr iterion- based sampling \"is a strategy in which particular settings, persons, or acti vities are selected deliberately in order to provide information that can't be gotten as well from ot her choices\" (p. 88). The reason for making purposeful criterion-based selections is to exami ne select cases critical to the goals of the research study. These selections were made based on document analysis of teacher evaluations seeking teachers with superior ra tings in areas related to student interaction. Data Collection. Data was collected through interviews, participant journals, and observations. The purpose for conducting interviews was to capture teacher perceptions and lend validity to the research. Maxwell (2005) suggests interviews \"can provide addi tional 24 information that was missed in observation, and can be used to check the accuracy of the observation\" (p. 94). Semi-structured, open-ended, in-depth interviews were used to m ake certain specific questions were asked that were believed would inform the study and to provide for exploration in greater depth. Threats to validity and reliability were addressed by following a standardized interview protocol including an interview guide with topi cs for exploration (Patton, 2002). The five teacher participants were also asked to keep participant journals around the issues involving their relationships with their students. Journal prom pts were provided that were designed to provide information and ideas related to teache r-student relationships. Observations of the selected teachers were also conducted i n the classroom setting and in other areas while the teachers were interacting wit h students. Observations, according to Maxwell (2005), allow the researcher a direct and insightful wa y to learn about behavior and the context in which the behavior occurs. Care was taken to record concre te instances by capturing direct quotations and noting unembellished descriptions as t he interactions between teachers and students were observed. Data Analysis. In qualitative data analysis, researchers examine and interpret patterns to generate meaning from the collected data. In this case study, intervie w, observation and participant journal data was analyzed through the constant comparative method (CC M) to investigate the characteristics of five elementary teachers inter acting in positive and supportive manners with their students (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Data from participant journals was analyzed through the narrative analys is process while interviews and observations were analyzed using a generic coding process. Throug h the constant comparative method, the data was unitized into individual ideas and then thes e units 25 were sorted into categories (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Data was arranged in a Microsoft Word table and rearranged as themes were determined and refined. Summary Chapter 1 has provided an overview of this case study of five elementary class room teachers and the nuances of their positive and supportive relationships with their st udents and how those relationships influence academic performance and behavior while in and bey ond their classrooms. The current problems facing these and most other public school t eachers were discussed including the No Child Left Behind initiative and the achievement ga p between low-income minority students and students of affluence. The theoretic al framework for this study was provided as well as an overview of the literature review to be further explored in chapter 2. The balance of this chapter provided an overview of the study methodology. Chapter 2 consists of a thorough overview of the professional literature that provide s a structural foundation for this study. Included in the literature review is a thorough discussion of the No Child Left Behind laws and democratic schooling with a focus on soc ial justice. Examining the literature around the achievement gap, this review spec ifically examined the minority achievement gap including teacher perceptions and expec tations and the gender achievement gap. Culture was a major component of this chapter and include d school culture, hegemony, reculturing school, constructivism, student culture, cultura l knowledge and competence, and multiculturalism. The balance of the literature revie w examined teacher-student relationships including teacher effectiveness, s tudent motivation, student engagement, teacher feedback, differentiated learning, classroom manag ement, and effective discipline. 26 Chapter 3 presents the methodology for this study in depth. Included in this chapter is the rationale for qualitative research, an exploration of case study, ethnomet hodology, narratology and portraiture, a description of the study setting, data production pr ocedures, the data collection process, and the steps followed for data analysis. Chapter 4 is the a nalysis of the data collected through interviews, participant journals, and observations and is pre sented by research question. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the trustworthines s of the findings. Chapter 5 concludes this dissertation with a presentation and discussion of the discoveries, implications, conclusions, and recommendations for educators and research ers for continuing research about the influence of teacher student relationships. 27 CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW John Goodland (1976) said, \"Winning becomes increasingly attractive and absorbing. Frequently, purposes beyond winning are lost to view. Children invariably are the lose rs\" (p. 70). He was addressing the eventual reality that often greets the voice of educator s in the struggle to improve schooling. He could just as well make this assertion today. Winning seems to be everything. In this era of No Child Left Behind, a paradigm shift has oc curred in too many schools away from teaching and preparing kids for the future toward drill ing and preparing kids for state assessments. We must win. We must reach that line dr awn on that page and we must win. Those mighty scores, after all, are how successful schools are measured and reaching that magic line each year has become \"increasin gly attractive and absorbing.\" There is so much pressure to prepare for the state assessments tha t many teachers get bogged down in attempting to address the stuff and \"children invariably are the lose rs.\" Until the late 1970s, the majority of our political leaders were satisfied wit h our schools. There was no pressure to fix what did not seem to be broken. Then, very suddenly, politicians became aware that not nearly enough students were getting good enough grades or scoring well enough on achievement tests. This awareness led to the present hue and c ry to improve our schools. The pressure to improve achievement so that no child will be left behind and every school will make adequate yearly progress continues to fail in too ma ny schools because, as Glasser (1993) asserts, most of the \"suggested improvements a re tied to the old teach, test, reward, and punish, boss-managed system\" (p. 5). 28 This literature review began by evaluating the empirical literatur e describing and informing teacher-student relationships and the effect of these relationships on student learning and behavior by perusing text books and professional journals in my home, office and school district library for each topic and subtopic included this review. Keyword searches in WilsonWeb's Education Full Text, Illumina's ERIC, and EBSCOhos t's professional publication databases were also performed. The purpose for conducting s earches through three databases was the differing results each produced. Some of the ent ries between the databases were duplicates but most were unique. When a search of one database w ould provide few or no relevant articles or other documents, another would offer ample direc tion for investigation. When a search produced an abundance of material, key words were a dded to narrow the focus to yield a more manageable selection. Many of the publicat ions were of direct benefit and often those that were of little or no direct relevance offered sugge stions through in text citations or end of chapter or article reference lists of wher e to look to gather more significant information. What follows is a brief overview of this search. As the main topic of this study is \"teacher-student relationships,\" this revie w began with a keyword search of that topic. WilsonWeb's Education Full Text yielded 3,126 entri es compared to ERIC's more manageable 372 sources, and EBSCOhosts's overwhelming 15,946 unique publications. Narrowing the search to \"teacher relationships\" and \"student motivation\" provided 193, 400, and 369 yielded 1,293, 38, and schooling\" and \"social justice\" together produced 52, 3, and 3 docume nts. Sufficient empirical research was found to inform this review on the broader topic s but fewer resources were found for some of the subtopics. Searching \"achievement ga p,\" for example, 29 produced 860, 1,628, and 1042 results and adding \"minority,\" or \"Black,\" or \"African American\" produced hundreds of review. \"Achi evement gap\" and \"teacher perception,\" however, produced only 8 publications in the WilsonW eb Education Full Text data base and no results in the other two databases. In cases such as this, related terms such as \"achievement gap\" and \"expectations\" were sea rched which produced 7, 68, and 0 results, and \"achievement gap\" and \"expectations\" yielded a more informat ive 57, 99, and 4 documents. Some subtopics, while sufficient resources appeared available, failed to inf orm adequately this review and therefore seemed to be lacking in the literature . Wanting to review the literature on how teachers perceive their relationships with st udents affect their academic achievement and behavior, a search of \"teacher relationships\" and \" teacher perception\" provided 483, 13, and 117 results. While this seems sufficient, many entrie s looked at parent relationships, student relationships with each other, perceptions of t eachers about student relations, and many other directions that did not inform this review. A few relevant sources were found which lead to others. Still, the available litera ture seemed slight and this further encouraged the need for this study. The purpose of this ethnomethodological exploratory descriptive case study wa s to explore teacher perceptions of the relationships between teachers and students and to consider the qualities of those relationships that teachers perceive influen ce student success. According to Leit\u00e3o and Waugh (2007), \"Positive teacher-student relationships a re characterized by mutual acceptance, understanding, warmth, closeness, trust , respect, care and cooperation\" (p. 3). Teacher-student relationships provide an essential foundati on for effective classroom management and classroom management is a key to high stude nt 30 achievement. Teacher-student relationships must not be left to chance or be permitt ed to be dictated by the personalities of those involved. Instead, by using strategies s upported by research, teachers can influence the dynamics of their classrooms and build st rong teacher- student relationships that will support student learning. Whether democratic or authoritarian, everything that happens in school influences school culture. Danielson (2002) suggests the culture of a school is defined by the norms a nd values that prevail in the school setting. Often the culture of a school represent s and is influenced by societal factors outside of the school and the school culture serves to ma intain the status quo and promote separation between more affluent and minority groups resul ting in an achievement gap (Hale & Rollins, 2006). Teacher relationships with students are critical because teachers have the power to build students up or to tear them down (Jame s, 1994). Myers (2007) agrees that every teacher affects the attitudes of the st udents in the classroom. Teachers can nurture or negate the innate curiosity these students bring with them into the classroom. Ultimately, it is up to the teacher whether the students see s chool as a place in which to thrive or as a place to be feared. Effective teachers know their students and their unique needs and have a proactive plan to address those needs (Stronge, 2002). Many students do not enjoy school or see it as a positive opportunity and expend little positive energy toward academics. In order to develop positive relationships, te achers must first understand their students before they can expect their students to understa nd and follow them. Understanding the needs and the beliefs of students is crucial to finding ways to increase their motivation to learn (Jones & Jones, 1981). Danielson (2002) asserts that students must be genuinely engaged and active participants for maximum learning to occur. Such engagement typically refers to behavioral engagement and involves parti cipation in 31 group activities, following rules and routines, and putting forth appropriate effor t (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004). For students to understand what they are doing well and what needs revision the teacher must also provide specific and meaningful feedback (Hatt ie, 1992). Classroom success and student engagement is increased when teachers pla n to accommodate the unique differences in students and differentiate instructional c ontent, process, products, and the learning environment (Lezotte, 1992; Stronge, 2002). All of these facets of schooling are supported through positive proactive classroom management and positive discipline. Behavior is a living and dynamic entity, which is learned, modele d, observed and copied every minute of the day. Good and Brophy (2000) suggest the relationship between the teacher and the student is the most significant factor in maintaining a positive classroom culture. Effective discipline is not punitive, and is a process of t eaching, not of coercion. Effective discipline programs seek to involve students in social responsibility and self control (Brendro et al., 1990). No Child Left Behind In the United States, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) (107th Congre ss, 2002) marked the beginning of an accountability era with an emphasis on increased stude nt achievement and holding schools accountable for learning as never before (Andrews & Ridenour, 2006). NCLB requires schools to disaggregate achievement data by gra de in racial, demographic, and socioeconomic subgroups and focuses attention on the achievement gaps between minority and White students (Storey & Beeman, 2006). This has resulted in ef forts to align the curriculum with national standards and meet the individual needs of students while still increasing scores for all students on state-mandated tests ( Barnett & Aagaard, 2007). 32 The resulting emphasis on business-style efficiency bears an uncanny resemblance to the Frederick Taylor-inspired traditions that dominated the field from the 1920s t hrough the 1940s (Brooks & Miles, 2006). This focus on standards, assessments, and adequate yearly progress has certainly created challenges for the building principal as ext ernally imposed definitions of academic excellence adds to traditional leadership and managem ent responsibilities. The paradox, according to Shapiro (2006) who cites McNeil (2000) and Kochan and Reed (2005), is that \"the barrage of accountability measures aimed at schools has caused educators to focus on varied and questionable purposes, such as teaching to the tests and \"dumbing down\" the curriculum rather than preparing students to become useful and productive citizens\" (p. 4). While NCLB has encouraged schools and districts to align more closely teachi ng and learning with the state's curricular standards, and while test scores in reading and math are improving, social studies, science, music, art, and many other subjects are almos t being viewed as intrusions on the tested curriculum. Accountability, at this extreme, can onl y hurt students as there seems to be little room or desire for democratic According t o Shannon (2005), many scholars and educators see NCLB as reactionary legislation that i s only pretending to be concerned with closing achievement gaps, seeking instead to impose bureaucratic control and maximize and spotlight the achievement deficits of poor , minority, immigrant, and physically and mentally disabled students who the elite view as \"drains on American prosperity\" (p. 26). Owens and Sunderman (2006) suggest: When NCLB was enacted, researchers and state education officials projecte d that a high percentage of schools would fail to meet the law's tough accountability 33 provisions, creating a crisis in public education and overwhelming the capacity of state education agencies to help low performing schools. (p. 1) Amrein and Berliner (2002) point out: Twenty-five states distribute financial rewards to successful or improved s chools, and 25 states have the power to close, reconstitute, or take over low performing schools... In 17 states low average class scores may warrant the displacement or rem oval of teachers or administrators. (pp. 5-6). Mullen and Johnson (2006) suggest the real intent of NCLB and the attached sanctions is to eliminate or modify drastically public schooling through cove rt \"racism and classism, sorting and socialization, and punitive ideologies leading to correcti ve courses of action\" (p. 9). Owens and Sunderman (2006) found that highly segregated schools with disproportionate enrollments serving disadvantaged and minority students are most li kely to be identified as needing improvement and to receive corrective sanctions. According to Street (2007), standardized testing results are regularly provi ding: ...empirical justification for the closing and privatization of \"failing\" publi c schools and the related rollback of teachers' collective bargaining rights and gu arantees. Low test scores have become a marvelous vehicle for shaming public schools, teachers, and teacher unions and advancing the corporate educational privatization agenda partly encoded in the reactionary, bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act. (p. 4) Echoing these thoughts, McKinzie (2003) offers that: Lurking behind this NCLB program is an educational VIRUS or WORM much like the Sobig.F virus that recently struck computers globally. The hidden agenda of NCLB is to shut down urban public schools and send their clients into the brave new 34 world of corporate schooling, even though there is no convincing evidence that these free market alternatives will reverse the long established patterns of poor school performance. (p. 1) Mullen and Johnson (2006) suggest that accountability systems have always been used for political gain but add that the NCLB accountability system goes blatantly be yond historic practices by restrictively defining educational proficiency and using \"disaggregated test scores\" as \"the focal point for hiring, firing, rewarding, and punishing school administrators and staff\" (p. 12). By the time many students reach the intermediate elementary school grade s our present system of teach-to-the-test skill-and-drill public education has e ffectively killed-the- thrill of learning and rendered our once curious and excited youth into mechanized sit -and- get-and-test-and-forget victims of the NCLB and AYP disease. The ide a that the only one right answer is the answer to a test question is ludicrous and leaves a school system vulnerable to authoritarian rule. If the only acceptable answer is the one on the test then there is no purpose in thinking about options or debating the truth. Teaching that there is only one right answer breeds compliance and complacency. According to Stafford-Johnson and Dill (2007), \"as of June 2006, seven thousand children in our nation drop out of school every day\" (p. 1). These are students that math and reading dominant curriculums are failing to serve. How does such a curriculum s erve the needs of the artist, the scientist, the social activist, or the musician? How doe s it even serve the needs of the journalist or the mathematician? It does not and it cannot. It is fa r too limiting. Such a restrictive curriculum only serves the goals of those who wis h to impose their will on our nation's youth and perhaps to illuminate and exacerbate the defic iencies of 35 what has typically become a reactionary school system. While it is certainl y important to study Language Arts and Mathematics, even more critical for many stud ents is the need to develop competencies in social justice. Banks (2005b) stresses the importance of educating for social justice in today's society and world. A narrowly defined education bas ed on reading and math will do little to prepare today's students to become contributing soc ially just and democratic citizens. The problems in society rarely relate to an inability to read and multiply. Whil e important skills, in order to truly succeed, students need to be well versed in cooperative learning and problem solving skills. Democratic schooling serves the needs of all s tudents as it allows for all voices to be heard. The limits of the reading and math based cur riculum threaten to choke the life out of the love of learning born into our youngest citizens. Too often this love of learning is effectively amputated before many of our childre n outgrow their first sets of school clothes. Clearly, the No Child Left Behind initiatives pose a serious threat to democratic schooling and social justice. Darling-Hammond (2007), argues, \"we need...something much more than and much different from what NCLB offers. We badly need a national policy that enables sc hools to meet the intellectual demands of the twenty-first century\" (p. 1). The Adequat e Yearly Progress system of evaluation should be replaced by a model of multiple measur es that looks for continuous improvement, assesses higher order thinking, and assesses special educ ation students and English language learners appropriately. Rather than imposing sanct ions on schools that serve our neediest children, NCLB should concentrate its efforts towa rd providing low performing schools with whatever supports are needed to maximize the potential for all students to succeed (Owens & Sunderman, 2006). Darling-Hammond (2007) 36 suggests schools should have their improvement comprehensively measured by factor s such as \"student progress and continuation, graduation and classroom performance on tasks beyond multiple-choice tests\u2014and gains should be assessed by how individual students improve over time\" (p. 5). For students to learn at high levels they must benefit from effective teaching, a quality curriculum that considers their interests, and a dequate and appropriate resources. Testing and punishing students and schools will not guilt or threat en them into sustaining higher levels of achievement. Such tactics instead ser ve to limit severely the most vulnerable students and schools. It would be much more beneficial to schools and school systems if NCLB would evaluate the instructional programs of schools and det ermine shortcomings and offer assistance in addressing identified deficiencies . This is not the current focus of NCLB and as schools have no control over its focus, schools and teachers must instead focus on factors on which they do have considerable influence. Democratic Schooling The modern system of education began in the early 20th century and was influenced by Frederick Taylor's (1923) theory of Scientific Management. Ellwood C ubberley's (1929) factory model schools were the norm and were not designed to be democratic as, acco rding to Darling-Hammond (1996), they were defined by \"highly developed tracking syst ems that stressed rote learning and unwavering compliance for the children of the poor... \" (p. 6). Darling-Hammond (1996) further explains, \"Like manufacturing industries, [ schools] were designed as highly specialized organizations-divided into grade levels and subje ct-matter departments, separate tracks and programs-to facilitate the use of routines and procedures\" (p. 13). According to Lieberman, Wood and Falk (1994), teachers were perceived as technicians to be trained to accept and adopt the \"right ideas\" (p. 30). 37 America's early focus was on corporate management and business style leaders hip in schools and this focus with the exception of a few largely unsuccessful attempts at restructuring remains prevalent in education today. Shields (2004) warns that chil dren who do not enjoy a sense of belonging in schools are excluded and marginalized in systems that \"perpetuate inequity and inequality rather than democracy and social justice \" (p. 122). Johnson (2007) contends: Children are born positive, curious, confident, physical beings. They want to learn, they want to succeed, they want to build independence and they want approval. Children learn best when they are actively engaged and appropriately challe nged. They learn best when they are having fun. They need to feel safe and apprecia ted. They need to physically experience skills and knowledge. They are not machines. They are not preprogrammed insects. Being forced to sit at a desk for hours on end, completing a series of worksheets which may or may not be at their level onl y destroys their natural enthusiasm for learning. (p. 1) Mundane instructional practices are nothing new. Wyett (1998) quotes Albert Einst ein as recognizing the shortfalls of education in his time: \"It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curi osity of inquiry\" (p. 151). Education, according to Meighan (2002), is basically authoritarian, since one person, or a very few people, determine \"what to learn, when to learn, how to learn, how to asse ss learning, and the nature of the learning environment\" (p. 1). While society looks to sc hools to develop common values in its citizens, private and public goals are always in confli ct and as long as private industry rules the marketplace, private interests will carr y great sway 38 (Dworkin, Saha, & Hill, 2003). Schools are too often held responsible for social and economic disparities, and that can make teaching awfully hard to do. While schools are certainly obligated as agents of social justice to strive to provide opportunities for those who are economically disadvantaged to gain the knowledge and skills to succeed, schools have not been designed or enabled to be the great equalizer. Winchester (2003) suggests \"most schools, most times, nearly everywhere a re not democratic places\" (p. 2). We deny our students the freedom to choose by imposing ritual s and structures and by mandating their curriculum and the design of their day. Apple and Beane (1995) argue that healthy societies provide for freedoms that demons trate mutual respect, and our society is in real danger of losing those freedoms. While tradit ional schools are bureaucratic institutions and assume a hierarchy of power with the teac her stationed above the student, in democratic schools this hierarchy is deemphasized and vast opportunities exist for negotiating all operations of the school. Traditional teach ers' power is in their authority over students while democratic educators have power in their ex pertise. There is a fundamental difference between the concept of democratic schooling and the school structures that dominate capitalistic markets. According to Giroux (1998), \"Growing up corporate has become a way of life for youth in the United States\" (p. 12). While it is clear the market plays an important role in shaping American identities, it is a sad commentary that when asked to provide a definition for democracy, many of our youngest citizens, according to Wright (1997), refer to \"the freedom to buy and consume whatever they wish, without government restriction\" (p. 182) . Beane (2002) suggests \"as free market economies are glorified and public se rvices privatized, the meaning of democracy is evolving almost exclusively as a m atter of personal 39 choice and self-interest, and the complementary notion of a public or common good is disappearing\" (p. 25). Moffatt (2008) defines a free market economy as \"an econom y in which the allocation for resources is determined only by their supply and the demand fo r them\" (p. 1). Moffatt (2008) further suggests \"this is mainly a theoretical conc ept as every country, even capitalist ones, places some restrictions on the ownership and excha nge of commodities\" (p.1). According to Grace (1997), whether an unchecked free market or one that is somewhat regulated, our capitalistic economy is certainly and effe ctively eroding our ideal vision of democracy in its shift from a \"democracy of citizens [to] a democracy of consumers\" (p. 315). The corporate influence on educational practice promises to serve we ll those privileged enough to have the power and the ability to make their choices matter w hile leaving those who lack the influence of power struggling to participate in our ec onomy driven society (Giroux, 1998). Nearly a century ago John Dewey pondered how educators could claim to believe in democracy if they did not practice it in schools as the practice of democracy i n schools is far more than an intellectual expression of beliefs and requires the persistent i nteraction of people which is a much more complex task (Rusch, 1995). Dewey's vision of education was to prepare children for active citizenship in a participatory democracy (\"Ed ucation for democracy,\" n.d) because, as Miller (2007) argues, \"all those who are affected by social institutions must have a share in producing and managing them\" (p. 1). According to Mil ler (2007), the term \"participatory democracy\" was used in the 1960s \"as a way of re claiming the essence of democratic idealism in a society some believed had grown over-orga nized, hierarchical and authoritarian\" (p. 1). Dewey (as cited in Tyack, 1997) argue d, \"We need not only education in democracy, but also democracy in education...for the welfare of the y oung, 40 thoughtful citizens must participate in the politics of public schooling\" (p. 22). Simil arly, according to Wilms (2007), Dewey claims \"in order to promote a nation that truly [ values] democratic principles, all of its citizens must be empowered to engage in a democ ratic discourse in order to be advocates for themselves as well as to be able to advocate fo r others\" (p. 1). It would seem to make sense then that a nation that prides itself of democrati c freedoms would embrace democratic systems of education. In reality this se ems furthest from the truth. Throughout the literature there are many descriptions and definitions of democrat ic education and democratic schools. According to Dewey (1916): A democracy is more than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of ass ociated living, a conjoint communicated experience... An undesirable society is one which internally and externally sets up barriers to free intercourse and communic ation of experience. (p. 87) A democratic society, on the other hand, \"makes provision for participation in its good of all its members on equal terms\" and \"secures flexible readjustment of its institutions through the interaction of different forms of associated life\" (p. 115). Dewey vi ewed schools as places where students could and should learn how to change their societies. Schut z (2001) asserts that public schools in a democratic society were intended to promote a nd support the public good. . It was not critical that what happened in the school mimic greater so ciety. What was important was that the lessons learned would aid in active democratic pa rticipation outside of school. Horton (1990) suggests democracy is an ideal where \"people are r eally free and empowered to make collectively the decisions that affect their live s\" (p. 169). Horton's Highlander Folk School was built on principles of democracy. Horton wanted to 41 create a public space where people could learn from each other and use educati on as a means to challenge the unjust social systems affecting their lives. He felt a ll citizens should live in a flexible and adaptive society where their voices are heard and affect the dec ision-making process. According to the 16th International Democratic Education Conference (Lofli n, 2008), democratic schools generally share most or all of the following characterist ics: (a) shared decision-making among the students and staff; (b) a learner-centered a pproach in which students choose their daily activities; (c) equality among staff and student s; and (d) the community as an extension of the classroom (p. 4). For Patrick (1995) democratic sc hools share three common components: (a) core concepts that denote essential knowledge ; (b) intellectual and participatory skills that enable practical application of civic knowledge; and (c) virtues that dispose citizens to act for the good of their community (p. 1). Accor ding to Shields (2004), \"Democratic education requires empowering children to participa te in, and take responsibility for, their own learning\" (p. 124). Checkley (2003) asserts, \"Sc hools that are democratic are naturally caring places... When students have an equal v oice in the governance of their school and its classrooms, they develop the ability to genuinely get along with others\" (p. 1). Students take ownership of and responsibility for their own lear ning. Helping students become active citizens and preparing them for participation i n a democratic society are two key purposes of democratic classrooms. Democratically operated schools exchange traditional teacher authority f or informal control driven by close teacher-student relationships and mutual leadership respons ibility. In democratic schools and classrooms students actively engage in self governme nt (Gutmann, 1995; Checkley, 2003). Neigel (2006) suggests involving students in school leadership 42 provides opportunities for them to contribute beyond their classrooms as they \"explore their interests, refine their talents, gain a better understanding of themselves, a nd collaborate with their peers\" (p. 4). Such involvement also provides for the development of social skills and opportunities for leadership, both of which are important components of the democratic process. These opportunities give students a voice and a sense of belonging which helps to build healthy relationships and connections with students, teachers, administrators, a nd the greater community. When students are provided opportunities to participate activel y in school decision making rather than act passively within the bureaucratic struct ure they take ownership of and responsibility for their own learning and develop a sense of social intelligence that will serve them throughout their lives (Mosher, Kenny, & Garrod, 1994). Democratic schools are environments where children can live in much the same wa y as they will live in society. As principal stakeholders, diverse students s hould participate in the democratic process by playing an active role in schools and in school leader ship. According to Schutz (2001), schools have an obligation to promote such active democratic involvement among students, \"initiating them into practices that will enable the m to effectively engage with oppression and improve our society for everyone\" (pp. 294- 295). Schools need to teach children not to accept what is being thrust upon them by those who would protect to status quo and the privilege of class and to demand access to opportunities for themselves and for others. Democratic schools must follow the norms of justice , equity, inclusion, participation, and integrity (Calabrese, 1990). Lessons are developed ar ound these components. The RMC Research Corporation (\"Quick guide,\" 2004), similarly suggests , \"Democratic classrooms are those in which the curriculum actively engage s students in collaborative inquiry, decision making is shared between students and staff, and students 43 choose their daily activities\" (p. 1). When children are bound by expectations and rule s they had no part in establishing they are not democratic participants. Accordingly, s chools managed entirely by adults are not democratic and do not educate democraticall y (Miller, 2007). Social Justice. According to Ayers and Quinn (2009), \"Educators, citizens, and activists committed to social justice face a recent history charac terized by the radical rise of social injustice\" (p. xiv). Individual and family poverty levels have drastical ly increased but the money they are missing has not disappeared. Without coincidence, that wealth has found its way to the upper echelons of the economy. Socioeconomic factors are historically and now a clear and always present rating system in greater society and i n schools. For Bruner (1996), \"the impact of poverty, racism, and alienation on the mental life and growth of [children]\" (p. xiii) means that \"effective education is always in jeopa rdy either in the culture at large or with constituencies more dedicated to maintaining a status quo than t o fostering flexibility\" (p. 15). The United States prides itself as a democracy that fair and just where ev ery citizen has the right to equality in society, economics, politics, and education. The Constituti on of the United State advocates \"liberty and justice for all.\" According to Sec tion One of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution: No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive an y person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within it s jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. (\"14th Amendment,\" p. 1) 44 Regardless of this advocacy ours is a nation of injustices. Even though the mandates i n this amendment extend equal protections to education, inequities always have existed and continue to exist. Lunenburg and Ornstein (2007) state frankly: The U. S. educational system to this day is beset with inequities that exacerbate racial and class-based challenges. Differential levels of success in school distr ibuted along racial and social class lines continues to be the most pernicious and prevail di lemma of school. (p. 21) Wolk (2007) asks: What can be more essential to the health of a democracy than caring citizens? Yet explicitly teaching \"caring\" rarely goes beyond kindergarten. In schools obsessed with teaching \"technical\" knowledge and questions with single correct answer s, the idea of teaching children and young adults to care is seen as not being suffici ently \"rigorous\". (p. 653) Skrtic (1991a) stresses that education for social justice is predicated on the belief that schooling is not just and is not democratic \"unless its practices are excellen t and equitable\" (p. 199), and clarifies that educational excellence \"is a precondition for excelle nce\" (1991b, p. 181). Bruner (1996) acknowledges, \"Education is risky, for it fuels the sense of possibi lity. But a failure to equip minds with the skills for understanding and feeling and acting i n the cultural world... risks creating alienation, defiance, and practical incompetence \" (pp. 42-43). Greenberg (2000) argues that children are entitled to the same human rights and freedoms as adults and \"should be full participants in the life of their community\" (p. 1). Shields (2004) concurs that socially just learning is deeply democratic, and \"a n educational orientation to social justice and democratic community requires pedagogy for ged with, not 45 for, students to permit them to develop meaningful and socially constructed underst andings\" (p. 115). MacKinnon (2000) stresses that educators who teach for social justice must be concerned \"with the quality of relationships among all those who constitute 'the school' and the nature of the school circumstances in which children learn\" (p. 7). Shields (2004) a dds in order for teachers \"to promote deeper understanding and more meaningful relati onships and to enhance social justice for all students,\" they must overcome \"pathologizing silences and understand that learning is situated in relationships in which students need to be free t o bring their own realities into the conversation to 'make sense of things'\" (p. 117). In defining democratic instructional practices, the Rethinking School Reform (\"RSR book intro,\" 2003) authors suggest the curriculum choices and classroom values needed for democratic education should promote \"a common social and pedagogical vision that...st rives toward what we call a social justice classroom\" (p. 1). According to the Soci ology Guide authors (\"Social Justice,\" 2006), \"Social Justice derives its authority from t he codes of morality prevailing in each culture... [and refers] to the overall fairness of a society in its divisions and distributions of rewards... \" (p. 1). Freire (1970) suggested teachers must follow three steps to educate for social justice: (a) acknowledge students' voice s\u2014thoughts and feelings from their own perspectives and experiences; (b) use students' voices and past experiences to develop the curriculum; and (c) encourage and show students how to apply their voices and past experiences towards making significant changes in t heir communities. For Freire, the rationale for educating for social justice was the empowe rment to belong in the classroom and in society. For Lunenburg (2003), social justice in its simplest form is concerned with \"redressing institutionalized inequality and systemic racism\" (p. 10). Accor ding to Rawls 46 (1971), the four principles of social justice are: (a) equal treatment of all m embers of society including equal rights and liberties; (b) all people are regarded as indivi duals; (c) every person is gives a fair chance or equal opportunity; and (d) the greatest social and e conomic benefits go to those who are least advantaged. Regarding equal treatments, Apple ( 1993) suggests: The \"same treatment\" by sex, race and ethnicity, or class is not the same at all. A democratic curriculum and pedagogy must begin with a recognition of \"the diffe rent social positionings and cultural repertoire in the classrooms, and the power relati ons between them.\" Thus, if we are concerned with \"really equal treatment:\" ...we must base a curriculum on recognition of those differences that empower and depower our students in identifiable ways. (p. 1) Accordingly, additional resources would be provided for the disadvantaged. These resour ces would have to come from somewhere and the privileged have not traditionally been very willing to give up the advantages they enjoy. Ayers and Quinn (2009) suggest three principles or pillars of social justice: (a) Equity , the principle of fairness, equal access to the most challenging and nourishing educational experiences, the demand that what the most privileged and enlightened are able to offer their children must be the standard for what is ava ilable to all children. This must also account for equitable outcomes, and somehow for redressing and repairing historical and imbedded injustices. (b) Activism , the principle of agency, full participation, preparing youngsters to see and understand and, when necessary, to change all that is before them. This is a move away from passivity , cynicism and despair. (c) Social literacy , the principle of relevance, resisting the 47 flattening effects of materialism and consumerism and the power of the abiding s ocial evils of white supremacy, patriarchy, homophobia\u2014nourishing awareness of our own identities and our connection with others, reminding us of the powerful commitment, persistence, bravery, and triumphs of our justice-seeking forebears, reminding us as well of the link between ideas and the concentric circles of context\u2014economic condition, historical flow, cultural surround\u2014within which our lives are negotiated. (p. 1) Teachers, Connell (1994) points out, are in the best position to provide socially just opportunities for students as \"the workers most strategically placed to affe ct that relationship,\" and adds that schools must \"bring teachers' work to the center of dis cussions of disadvantage\" (p. 143). Freebody, Ludwig, and Gunn, (1995) stresses that teachers mu st be alert for \"interactive trouble\" and identify and rectify gaps in learni ng and the crucial cues underprivileged students miss in school because of the \"privileging of pedagogic al routines\" to which they are unfamiliar (p. 296). Freebody, et al (1995) suggest teachers c an counter social injustice by recognizing and addressing inconsistencies and incompat ibilities between the cultures and lived experiences of disadvantaged students and the culture of the school. For Quinn (2003), educating for social justice is requires three transformations: the transformation of self; the transformation of people; and the transformation of c ulture. In transformation of self, students examine personal and professional positions about spec ific situations. During the transformation of people, learners strives affect other pe ople through their own beliefs. Transformation of culture requires the learners to begin to empowe r others to affect social change in their communities. 48 The Achievement Gap The gap in wealth in the United States is greater now than in any time since 1929. Educators, legislators, the media and the general public are becoming increas ingly aware that increasing numbers of minority and economically disadvantaged children are not a chieving school success (Shields, 2004). Minority Achievement Gap. Research indicates that many low-income children do not perform as well in school as middle and upper-income students, and that African American student achievement lags considerably behind that of White children ( Kalmijin & Kraaykamp, 1996). These student achievement gaps are large and persistent and ex ist across the nation (Barton, 2003). These gaps are accompanied by high rates of failure, hi gh dropout rates, over-identification of special education and behavior problems, and placem ent in the lowest academic programs (Nieto, 1999). There are many reasons why achi evement gaps exist between students of color and White students. According to Gordon (2000), in most American societies, schooling seems to benefit those of privilege while unde rclass students typically do not fare as well. As school populations become more diverse, the educationa l opportunities in our schools are proving greatly inadequate. One suggested contributi on to the student achievement gap is the distinct gap that has been identified between the preparation and experience of teachers who teach in culturally isolated schools and those who teach in more affluent areas. Research indicates teachers in diverse s ettings are more likely to be \"unqualified\" in their content areas, inadequately prepared, and la cking sufficient professional development to teach effectively (White-Clark, 2005). Teacher Perceptions and Expectations. Another significant contributing issue suggested in the literature is the lower expectations teachers and principal s have for low 49 income students and students of color. Noddings (2007) refers to the lowered expectations for minority students as the \"soft bigotry of low expectations\" and suggests, \"When w e look honestly at the history of education in the United States, we must admit\u2014much to our shame\u2014that we have badly served our poor and minority students\" (p. 201). Numerous studies suggest a correlation between teacher perceptions of minority students a nd how they educate or fail to educate these children (White-Clark, 2005). Delpit (2006), suggests, a s a result of living \"in a society that nurtures and maintains stereotypes\", ma ny teachers naturally make assumptions about students assigned to their classrooms (p. xxiii). Accordingly , middle and upper class students tend to succeed more from what school has to offer because the culture of the school is based on the culture of the greater society\u2014of those in power. Gay (1993) suggests many teachers do not share similar backgrounds and perspectives as their culturally and ethnically diverse students and are not cul turally sensitive to the needs of these students. Often high poverty and high minority schools are staffed b y teachers with middle class values and attitudes who demonstrate low expectati ons for poor minority students thus perpetuating the achievement gap between minority and Whi te students (Hale & Rollins, 2006). Delpit (2006) offers that this is because many teac hers of minority students have their own roots in other cultures and \"do not often have the opportunity to hear the full range of their student's voices\" (p. 17). Shields (2004) describ es these \"pathologies of silence\" as \"misguided attempts to act justly, t o display empathy, and to create democratic and optimistic educational communities\" (p. 117) and stresse s, \"To ensure that we create schools that are socially just, educators must overcome sile nces about such aspects as ethnicity and social class\" (p. 110). This is not easy and even teachers who do hear their students struggle to relate to them and understand their thoughts and ideals. 50 Valencia (1997) suggests that \"deficit thinking\" and \"blaming the victim\" is t he most feasible explanation for the lower achievement of these children (p. 3). Ferguson (1998 ) suggests \"teachers underestimate the latent potential of Blacks more than Whites\" p. 281). Lower teacher expectations can lead to a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" as the se lower expectations result in a lower self-image and less effort from these affe cted students (Farkas, Grobe, Sheehan & Shaun, 1990). James (1994) observed that teachers have the power to make children \"feel invisible and insignificant and that their differences a re irrelevant\" through the choice of educational materials and teaching style, p. 27). Good (1981) found low-achieving students receive less attention, are seated further from the teacher, are assigned less demanding work, get less help from the teacher when struggli ng, and get less time to answer questions. According to Ferguson (1998), there are three types of teacher \"deviation from some benchmark of neutrality\" (p. 275). Teachers tend to practice unconditional race neutra lity, conditional race neutrality, or unobserved potential. In unconditional race neutrali ty teachers are unbiased and expect the same of students regardless of race and class. Conditiona l race neutrality is where the expectations teachers have for students are sha ped from past experiences. Unobserved potential is based not on past performance but on what students might accomplish in the future. Regardless of whether teachers are biased, r esearch suggests many teachers treat White and Black students differently. In Marylee Ta ylors's 1979 experiment (Ferguson, 1998) comparing teacher responses to Black and White student s, she found that Black students get \"briefer feedback after mistakes, ...less positi ve feedback after correct responses, ...and fewer helpful slips of the tongue\" (p. 294). While education has been historically purported to be the great equalizer and a vehicle to provide for soci al 51 mobility (Muller & Schiller, 2000), it is all too clear that while perhaps unintenti onally, many of our schools in effect reproducing social inequality. Banks and Lynch (1986) contended that teachers must understand how \"race and culture interact to cause educational problems for many ethnic minority st udents\" (p. 16). To make gains toward closing the achievement gap McKinley (2006) agrees tha t educators must attend carefully to the social context for learning to increase cultural com petence. If we are to transform educational experiences and maximize academic achievement for all of our students, we must overcome the silence about class difference and guide our te achers to recognize openly that learning is relationship situated and that students must ha ve their cultural and individual styles recognized so they may flourish (Shields, 2004). Acco rding to McKinley (2006), researchers have found that strategies that address historica l and contemporary sociocultural causes of achievement gaps focus on \"effective a nd culturally congruent instruction, constructive teacher attitudes and beliefs, positive rela tionships that nurture student motivation, equitable opportunities to learn, and activism that addresses racism, injustices, and disparate expectations and conditions\" (p. 44). Teachers are undoubtedly an important factor and the influence of the lived experiences of predominantly White teachers and administrators working with an increasingly racially diverse student body needs to be understood (Carr & Kla ssen, 1997). Noddings (2005) said effective pedagogy is grounded in reciprocally caring rel ationships based on trust and respect between students and their teachers. According to Hale a nd Rollins (2006), \"data-driven professional development and explanations of the basics of standardi zed tests and student movement up and down the achievement scale help teachers understand where and on whom their energies are best spent\" (p. 7). 52 Research shows that when children feel they belong and their interests are re cognized as important they become more engaged in the learning and they experience gre ater academic achievement (Brokenleg, 1999; Glasser, 1996). Specifically, Brokenle g (1999) states, \"...in cultures and communities where adults are securely bonded to child ren, learning flourishes\" (p. 196). Glasser's (1996) work with \"choice theory\" demonstrated that people have five sources of internal motivation: (a) survival or physical needs; (b) belong ing; (c) power or attainment; (d) freedom; and (e) fun. When teachers recognize st udents' strengths and connect to their needs, their challenges are met with hard work and effort fr om students. In schools where student deficits are emphasized, challenges are seen as r eflective of their innate ability and students are treated as if they have a limited potential for learning. This kind of deficit thinking must be changed and all students must be viewed as having potential, and teacher actions must aggressively push students to tap into this potential. While s ocial and economic disadvantages, cultural differences, covert and overt racism, poor nut rition, and negative attitudes toward academics certainly effect the achieveme nt gap, schools must not underestimate the very important influence they have on academic achievem ent for all students, regardless of status. Fruchter (2007) suggests \"that the nation's urban public schools can be transformed to effectively educate their poor students of color, and that the nation's urban school dis tricts are the key agents of this transformation\" (p. 44). Knestrict (2005) agree s, \"It is not unreasonable to assume that we can teach a solid curriculum and at the same time tre at students with dignity and care\" (786). This suggestion can be broadened to include all poor urban students regardless of color. Schools and teachers, if afforded the respect and autonomy to do what they know through best practice works for kids, can transform schools 53 into powerfully successful learning institutions. Fruchter (2007) rejects the \"invidious myth\" that public education is so ineffective that it must be transformed by market soluti ons. Market solutions have a long history of not serving the greater needs of schooling which must be to prepare all students to succeed in the society and not to fulfill slots in t he capitalistic machine. Systematic and continual professional development desig ned to raise cultural awareness and prepare teachers to differentiate instruction for a diverse population of students is critical in closing the achievement gap (White-Clark, 2005). This sta rts, of course, with a strong commitment to improve teaching and learning and an unwavering bel ief that all students can reach high expectations. Good schools and good teachers hold the key for student success. Gender Achievement Gap. With all of the attention to the achievement gap between White students and minority students, Sadker and Zitterman (2005) suggest too litt le attention has been recently given to the achievement gaps and biases between genders . Certainly, most teachers want to treat and teach all children equitably. The reality is boys and girls are often treated differently. Teachers call more on boys, wait long er for answers, and provide more precise feedback. Boys also receive more punishment even when misbehavior is similar. According to Altermatt, Jovanovic and Perry (1998), one reason boys g et more attention than girls is they demand more attention. Boys are more likely to shout out answers and they dominate classroom interactions. Sadker and Sadker (2005) in considering teac her- student interaction studies suggests teachers give more attention to boys inc luding attention that is positive, negative and neutral. Babad (1998) recognizes a correlation be tween low achieving boys getting more negative attention and high achieving boys gett ing more positive attention. Low achieving girls are more often ignored by teachers (Sadk er & Sadker, 2005). 54 Sadker and Zitterman (2005) suggest boys are expected to \"act out and rebel at s chool work,\" while the girls are expected to be \"docile, conforming, and willing to w ork hard\" (p. 19). Both views reflect gender stereotyping. Boys often credit their own academi c successes to intelligence and blame their failures on bad luck. Conversely, girls typical ly attribute their successes to good luck and their failures to a lack of ability creating a pote ntially damaging self-fulfilling prophecy. As when working with economically disadvantaged stude nts and students of color, school teachers and school leaders must work diligently to change thi s kind of detrimental thinking. Culture \"Culture,\" according to Thernstrom and Thernstrom (2003), \"is a loose and slippery term\" (p. 4). Although no single, universally accepted definition of culture has be en established, much of the literature defines culture as the context in which ever ything else takes place. There is general agreement that culture involves, in the words of Dea l and Peterson (1990), \"deep patterns of values, beliefs, and traditions that have formed ove r the course of history\" (p. 7). O'Neil (2006) agrees and suggests for behavioral sc ientists, \"culture is the full range of learned human behavior patterns\" (p. 1). According to the Merriam- Webster Online Dictionary (\"Culture,\" 2010), culture is defined as: ...the integrated pattern of human behavior that includes thought, speech, action, and artifacts and depends upon man's capacity for learning and transmitting knowle dge to succeeding generations [and] the customary beliefs, social forms, and mate rial traits of a racial, religious, or social group. (p. 1) Thernstrom and Thernstrom (2003), suggest \"culture\" is not \" a fixed set of group traits, but rather values, attitudes, and skills that are shaped and reshaped by envi ronment\" (p. 55 4). Perhaps the original definition was provided by Tylor (1871), who defined culture as \"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any othe r capabilities and habits acquired by man [or woman] as a member of society\" (p. 15). P erhaps the simplest and most direct definition is from Strahan (1994) who suggests culture is a shared sense of \"who we are and how we do things around here\" (p. 7). Schein (1985) describes culture as the pattern of shared basic assumptions that are invented, discovered, or developed by a group as it learns to cope with internal and external and has worked successfully enough to be considered valid and to be passed on to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problem s. Schein (1992) defines organizational culture as: A pattern of shared basic assumptions that the group learned as it solved its proble ms of external adaptation and internal integration, that has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems. (p. 12) School Culture. The teacher and students are part of a learning system within the classroom, and are part of a larger system within the school. Writing in 1932, Waller suggested, \"Schools have a culture that is definitely their own. There are, in a s chool, complex rituals of personal relationships, a set of folkways, mores, and irrational s anctions, a moral code based upon them\" (p. 103). Goodwyn and Findlay (2002) agree that every school has a culture and describe cultures as a set of norms and ways of working, thinking , talking, valuing, and behaving. Goodlad (1976) suggests school culture is characterized by rules , regulations, functions and activities of a system, and is defined by the norms and values that prevail in the school setting. The interactions of the people, the language they use, t hey 56 traditions they uphold, and the beliefs to which they subscribe, also contribute to make up the culture of a school. According to Rooney (2005), a school with a good culture knows what it believes in and where it is going. In the culture of a school, caring connections, posit ive behavioral supports, and social and emotional learning are essential (Osher & Fl eischman, 2005). What is taught and how it is taught exert tremendous influence on student performance and learning. There is abundant research stressing the importanc e teachers caring for their students and believing that these students can learn and to hold high expectations for them as learners (Barr & Parrett, 1995). Many studies hav e found that student performance and achievement are enhanced when teachers hold students to hi gh expectation and communicate these expectations for learning and the belief tha t students are capable of success (Borba, 1989; Nieto, 2000; Danielson, 2002). A 1979 study of effective schools conducted by Rutter and colleagues found that the underlying norms, values and traditions of schools contributed to their academic success. Other studies demonstr ated where the culture was not supportive, academic improvement did not occur (Deal & Peterson, 1999). An effective school culture consists of a caring, supportive and helping atmospher e conducive to learning and support (Barr & Parrett, 1995). Schools are cultural insti tutions with norms and values and formal and informal rules that affect how people are treat ed and how they treat each other. The teacher and students are part of a learning syste m within the classroom and are part of a larger system within the school. The school is part of th e school district, the state, the nation, and the world (Bonstingl, 1992). Every school has a culture; a set of norms and ways of working, thinking, talking, valuing, and behaving. Hanson (2001) suggests school culture is vital to the group interaction because culture is \"shaped a round a 57 particular combination of values, beliefs, and feelings that emphasize what is of paramount importance\" (p. 641). Hegemony. Fruchter (2007) defines the culture of schooling as \"what results from how a society structures, organizes, and implements its educational system\" ( p. 26) and suggests \"it reflects and embodies the dominant values of each society's hegem onic class and race\" (p. 27). These observations are certainly relevant as written and unwritt en rules, expectations, norms and traditions permeate every aspect of schooling. The cul turally diverse have always been and perhaps always will be in conflict with the upper and middle cl asses as the well-to-do strive to protect their ability to have and to get more and the less-t o-do struggle to have and to get enough. According to Breault (2003), because the concept implies equality, common goals, and cooperation, democracy presents a particular challen ge to diversity as \"diversity pushes a democracy to its limits of trust and force s it to honor its rhetoric by demanding an equal political and economic voice while supporting separa te cultural identities\" (p. 2). Breault (2003) further suggests oppression can be a stabilizing societal force but warns such \"stability is illusive and stifling\" (p. 2). Fr eire (1970) defined an oppressive situation as any \"in which 'A' objectively exploits 'B' or hinder s his pursuit of self-affirmation as a responsible person\" (p. 40). If democracy is to survive, schools must do more than make kids smarter. For schools to have the potential for continuous improvement they must create opportunities for engagement and secure commitments from all members through democratic practices and active meaningful participation. Schools must strive to break the grip of oppression and must make concerted efforts to instill the virtues in chil dren that they need to participate as democratic citizens. 58 In 1949, DuBois (DuBois, 1970) originally wrote: ...we should fight to the last ditch to keep open the right to learn, the right to have examined in our schools not only what we believe, but what we do not believe... We must insist upon this to give our children the fairness of a start which will equip the m with such an array of facts and such an attitude toward truth that they can have a rea l chance to judge what the world is and what its greater minds have thought it might be. (pp. 230-231) Felluga (2003b) defines hegemony as: The processes by which dominant culture maintains its dominant position: for example, the use of institutions to formalize power; the employment of a bureaucr acy to make power seem abstract (and, therefore, not attached to any one individual); the inculcation of the populace in the ideals of the hegemonic group through education, advertising, publication, etc. (p. 1) According to Erickson (2005), \"hegemony refers to the established view of thing s\u2014a commonsense view of what is and why things happen that serves the interests of those pe ople already privileged in a society\" (p. 48). Hegemony, according to Burke (2005) m eans \"the permeation throughout society of an entire system of values, attitudes, beliefs a nd morality that has the effect of supporting the status quo in power relations\" (p. 1). Burke (2005) asserts that hegemony refers not only to ideological control but more critical ly to consent. This suggests the public is content in existing roles. School systems are not immune f rom hegemonic forces and schools proves ideal for socializing individuals into maintain the status quo. 59 According to Darling-Hammond (1996), DuBois knew America's best hope for survival rested upon democracy and the \"kind of education that arms people with an intelligence capable of free and independent thought\" (p. 5).This would be a kind of education that takes into consideration the desires and interests of children and al lows them a voice and refrains from imparting a predetermined, restrictive, and hegemony -maintaining curriculum upon them. In too many schools, the dominant hegemonic school culture has served and continues to serve to keep students in their place. School cultures are key to school achievement and student learning. We must work to re-culture schools in a multicultural and democratic ideal so that student voices are heard and they partici pate actively in the design and implementation of their education. Reculturing School. Schlechty (1997) warns that \"structural change that is not supported by cultural change will eventually be overwhelmed by the culture, for it is in the culture that any organization finds meaning and stability\" (p. 136). According to Sche in (1992), culture is the most difficult organizational aspect to change as it represe nts \"the enduring assumptions, values and beliefs that are shared by members of an organizati on, that operate unconsciously, and that define in a basic 'taken-for-granted' fashion a n organization's views of itself and its environment\" (p. 12). Critical classroom pr actice is centrally important to all effective and lasting reform efforts and, as t he Rethinking School Reform (\"RSR book intro,\" 2003) authors assert, \"unless our schools and classrooms ar e animated by broad visions of equity, democracy, and social justice, they will never be able to realize the widely proclaimed goal of raising educational achievement for all children\" (p. 1). Accordingly, while schools with positive and supportive cultures have an opportunity to provide strong democratic and academic opportunities for students, schools that do not have 60 positive supportive cultures face an uphill battle in making the necessary changes to provide such democratic and academic opportunities. The human organism becomes a human being through participation in culture. Human culture is made up of conscious and nonconscious ways of being. Culture is learned behavior that is shared with other people. Culture influences how we behave and how we expect others to behave. Schools have a unique culture that is both part of and separate from the surrounding society (Berelson & Steiner, 1964). School cultures are vital to school achievement and student learning. Climate and the learning environment set the s tage for teaching and learning. A positive interpersonal environment can exist only wit hin a highly respectful school culture that treats all students with dignity in a businessl ike manner where teachers and students share the sense that work is relevant and important (Daniels on, 2002). Both the overall climate of the school and the specific learning environment of the indi vidual classroom have enormous influence on student achievement. Much of school climate is a reflection of perceptions and feeling. Teachers have the ability to influence t hese perceptions and feelings through the relationships they establish with students. For student s, the school's culture is what is valued and considered important to become a successful learner ( Danielson, 2002). Positive relationships do not happen without a substantial and continued investment (Deal & Peterson, 1999; Heim, 2007). Constructivism. Glickman, Gordon, and Ross-Gordon (2005) state, \"In a democratic society, it is vital that students learn to think reflectively, function at high sta ges of moral reasoning, and be autonomous decision makers\" (p. 156). Meier (2003) adds, \"We have lost sight of the traditional public function of schools: to pass on the skills, aptitudes, and habit s needed for a democratic way of life\" (p. 15). These skills are difficult to deve lop and are not 61 natural but they are necessary if our students are to participate fully and to thri ve in society. Participation is critical and all must be involved. School is the ideal place for suc h opportunities to occur. D\u00fcrr (2005) admits, if the school is to carry out critical functions for society by preparing students for roles as \"informed, responsible, democrati c and participative citizens\" (p. 28), then it must be strengthened and empowered to exer cise that role. Education must regain and retain its position as a foundation of democracy. Democra cy requires citizens who are academically prepared and prepared ethical ly and morally with drive for self-actualization. According to Hein (1991) \"constructivism...refers to the idea that learners cons truct knowledge for themselves\u2014each learner individually (and socially) constructs mea ning\u2014as he or she learns\" (p. 1). For Cohen, Cohen, and Kondo (2008): Constructivism is a philosophy of learning founded on the premise that, by reflect ing on our experiences, we construct our own understanding of the world we live in. Each of us generates our own \"rules\" and \"mental models,\" which we use to make sense of our experiences. Learning, therefore, is simply the process of adjusting our me ntal models to accommodate new experiences. (p. 1) Fosnot (1993) states, \"Constructivism is not a theory about teaching. It is a theory about knowledge and learning\" (p. vii). Fosnot (1996) identifies five principles of construct ivist pedagogy: (a) posing problems of emerging relevance to learners; (b) structuri ng learning around \"big ideas\" or primary concepts; (c) seeking and valuing students' points of vie w; (d) adapting curriculum to address students' suppositions; and (e) assessing student learning in the context of teaching. (pp. 29-30) 62 These principles represent practices that have validity for all students, r egardless or ethnic, language, race, class, religion, gender, disability, or other cultural f actor. For constructivist educators, each student is seen as a complex and multidimensi onal individual with unique needs (Wertsch, 1997). The focus is on the learner rather than the subject or lesson being taught. Is the student learning? The constructivist also vie ws knowledge as irrelevant if it is not constructed by the learner. Students are not le arning if they simply regurgitate what they hear or read. \"Learning,\" for Hei n (1991), is the \"personal and social construction of meaning out of the bewildering array of sensations whic h have no order or structure besides the explanations...which we fabricate for them\" ( p. 1). A teacher who delivers a thorough lecture has not provided knowledge unless the student connects with the material and constructs his or her own meaning. For students to construct their own meaning, VonGlasersfeld (1989) argues that the learner must be actively in volved in the learning and must take responsibility for the learning. Constructivist educators favor a loosely structured learning environment (Save ry & Duffy, 1995). Rigid learning environments make it difficult for students to construct t heir own meaning. Jonassen (1994) proposed eight principles that represent the constructivist learning environment: (a) provide multiple representations of reality; (b) represent the natural complexity of the real world; (c) focus on knowledge construction, not reproduction; (d) present authentic tasks (contextualizing rather than abstracting instruction); (e ) provide real- learning environments, than pre-determined instructi onal sequences; (f) foster reflective practice; (g) enable context-and conte nt dependent 63 knowledge construction; and (h) support collaborative construction of knowledge through social negotiation. (p. 35) While the goal of constructivism is for learners to arrive at their own versi on of the truth, it is critical that learners interact with those who can help them learn (Werts ch 1997). According to Bauersfeld (1995), teachers have to step out of their traditional roles and adopt t he role of facilitator to help the learner create his or her own meaning. Without effecti ve facilitation and social interaction, students would not be able to connect the learning to the greater social structure and know how to use any newly acquired learning (Wertsch 1997). Accordingl y, the constructivist educator should provide direction and guidance but not so much as to influence unnecessarily the learner's understanding of the truth. According to Cohen et al. (2008), constructive curriculum, instruction, and assessment look for different from traditional schooling. The constructivist cur riculum emphasizes a hands-on learning and problem solving approach and is constructed according to the prior knowledge of the students. Regarding instruction, teachers concentrate on he lping students connect facts and develop new understandings and \"tailor their teaching st rategies to student responses and encourage students to analyze, interpret, and predict informa tion\" (p. 1). Much of the instruction is represented by open-ended questioning and extensive dialogue among the learners. Grades and standardized testing are not important in construct ivist learning and students are directly involved in assessing their own progress. Holt and Willard- Holt (2000) suggest the true potential of learners can only be accessed through dynami c formative assessment which is significantly different from traditional tests. Assessment is a two-way process that involves both the instructor and the learner through dialogue. T his permits the instructor to determine the student's performance level on any s pecific task and 64 discuss with the learner how the task might be improved in the future. Accordingly, t he learning and the assessment are continually connected and the learner makes meaning through the assessment as well as the learning. Student Culture. The characteristics of most cultures are based on accepted myths or beliefs. While one's culture can clearly influence how adults perceive and part icipate in society, such perceptions and actions can also have a profound influence on children. Students have unique cultures and cultural awareness. A student's culture is dynami c, situational, and historic and directly influences how that student learns and perform s in a diverse setting. A student's culture is shaped by many influences including but not limited to ethnicity, gender, religion, location, generation, age, group memberships, and educati on (Gutierrez & Rogoff, 2003). For Vygotsky (1978): Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the soc ial level, and later, on the individual level; first, between people (interpsychological ) and then inside the child (intrapsychological). This applies equally to voluntary att ention, to logical memory, and to the formation of concepts. All the higher functions originate as actual relationships between individuals. (p. 57) Similarly, Cardwell and Flanagan (2004) cite Vygotsky's ideas that culture makes two critical contributions to a child's intellectual development: First, through culture children acquire much of the content of their thinking, that is, their knowledge. Second, the surrounding culture provides a child with the processes or means of their thinking, what Vygotskians call the tools of intellectual adapt ation. In short, according to the social cognition learning model, culture teaches childr en both what to think and how to think. (p. 118) 65 For Giroux (1996): Children's culture is a sphere where entertainment, advocacy, and pleasure me et to construct conceptions of what it means to be a child occupying a combination of gender, racial, and class positions in society, positions through which one defines oneself in relation to a myriad of others. (p. 89) Research suggests cultural values and beliefs affect motivation toward academ ic tasks (Unrau & Schlackman, 2006). Thernstrom and Thernstrom (2003) assert culture affec ts academic performance and contributes to the academic discrepancies between A sian and Caucasian students and African American and Hispanic students. Shields (2004) arg ues, \"if strong relationships with all children are at the heart of educational equity, then it is essential to acknowledge differences in children's lived experiences\" (p. 110). Every child ha s a culture and cultural awareness that is uniquely his or her own and no child can successful ly be forced to fit into any \"ideal\" mold. Children tend to be drawn to the familiar and chil dren as young as three demonstrate an awareness of racial and ethnic identity ( \"Culture and children,\" 2010). In addition to ethnicity, a child's culture is affected by, gender, a ge, religion, group membership, and family history (Gutierrez & Rogoff, 2003).Cultural development is also influenced by education, community, friends, and the media. Each exposure to different group characteristics serves to form and modify a chil d's unique culture. Every cultural factor contributes to a student's success or failure in divers e settings. When differences exist between a school system's culture and a student's cul ture, issues and problems can quickly manifest. According to Delpit (2006), \"teachers can easily m isread students' aptitudes, intent, or abilities as a result of the differences in styl es of language use 66 and interaction patterns\" (p. 167). Grant and Sleeter (2005) warn teachers \"it i s essential for you to understand how the dynamics of race, class, language, gender, and disabil ity can influence your understanding of your students\" (p. 64). Further, as each student is a m ember of multiple groups, it is critical to consider these dynamics communally, not i ndividually, as each student's unique culture influences thoughts and actions. Shields (2004) suggests, \"When children feel they belong and find their realities reflected in the curri culum and conversations of schooling, ...they are more engaged in learning and that they experie nce greater school success\" (p. 122). The goal must not be to create a perfectly matc hed cultural experience for each individual child. Instead, school systems and individual teacher s must strive to be culturally competent and recognize when certain situations provide probl ems for individual or groups of children and address those issues at their roots (Delpit, 2006). Cultural Knowledge and Competence. The demographic makeup of the United States is constantly changing and is symbolized by multiple diverse racial , ethnic, religious, language, and cultural groups. Ethnic and racial diversity continues to grow chiefl y as a result of immigration. The population growth between 1990 and 2000 was the largest in American history with a marked increase in people of color from 20% to 25% (Perry & Mackum, 2001). In 2000, according to Grant and Sleeter (2005), the U. S. population distribution was \"75% White, 12% African American, 4% Asian and Pacific Isla nder, 1% Native American, 2% more than one race, and 6% some other race\" (p. 61). About 12% of the United States population considers itself Hispanic. In many cities, Whites were no longer the majority ethnic group. Approximately 50% of those immigrating to the Unit ed States in the 1990s were from Central and South America and the Caribbean. Of these immigra nts, the largest population came from Mexico. In 2000, 14% of the U.S. population did not speak 67 English in the home. According to Martin and Midgley (1999), by 2050 racial minorities ar e expected to represent 48% of the U. S. population. Such demographic changes certainly and profoundly affect the diversity of children in our nation's schools and perpetuate the achievement gap between minority students and middle and upper class White students. According to the National Association of Social Workers (\"NASW standards,\" 2001) : In the United States, cultural diversity... has primarily been associat ed with race and ethnicity, but diversity is taking on a broader meaning to include the sociocultural experiences of people of different genders, social classes, religious and s piritual beliefs, sexual orientations, ages, and physical and mental abilities. (p. 8) Culturally competent educators who recognize and value diversity are key in c losing this achievement gap maximizing learning opportunities for all students. In order to define \"cultural competence\", it is necessary to look at the words \"cultural\" and \"competency\" independently. Similar to other definitions provide d above, for Chamberlain (2005), culture embodies \"the values, norms, and traditions that affect how individuals of a particular group perceive, think, interact, behave, and make judgments about their world\" (p. 197). For Walker, Reavis, Rhode, and Jenson (1985) and Osher and Osher (1995), competence implies having the capacity to function within the context of these culturally integrated patterns of a group. According to the University of Californi a, Berkeley Glossary of Terms (\"Diversity, equity, and inclusion\", 2009), \"Cultural compe tency is a set of academic and interpersonal skills that allow individuals to increase their understanding, sensitivity, appreciation, and responsiveness to cultural differences and the inte ractions resulting from them\" (p. 1). King, Sims and Osher (2007), cite Davis' 1997 operational definition of cultural competence as \"the integration and transformation of knowle dge about 68 individuals and groups of people into specific standards, policies, practices, and attit udes used in appropriate cultural settings to increase the quality of services; the reby producing better outcomes\" (p. 1). Martin and Vaughn (2007) suggest cultural competence is comprised of four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cult ural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews , and (d) cross- cultural skills. Martin and Vaughn (2007) further suggest a limited number of individua ls seem to possess cultural competence innately. Many others have to put forth conside rable effort to develop cultural competence by identifying biases, associating with culturally competent role models, and continuously developing culturally competent skills. A cultura lly knowledgeable and competent educator is able to function effectively with other cultur es and has the capacity to understand successfully and communicate effectively wi th people of diverse cultures (Walker et al., 1985; Osher & Osher 1995). To value diversity, one must recognize, accept and respect cultural difference s. Children come from a variety of backgrounds and their values, traditions, customs, and thoughts differ as well. It is vital that teachers and school leaders understa nd and respond accordingly to these cultural variances because by being responsive to cult ure, educators can maximize the affect of their relationships with students and families ( Walker et al., 1985; Osher & Osher 1995). While it is important to recognize diversity between cult ures, it is also importance but sometimes more difficult to recognize diversity within cultur es. Individuals may be similar in appearance, religion and language but diverse in many other wa ys. King et al. (2007), assert, \"Assimilation and acculturation can create kaleidoscopes of subcultures within racial groups\" (p. 1). For Osher and Osher (1995), gender, geography, a nd 69 socioeconomic status can more powerfully impact culture than race. In recogniz ing and responding to intra-cultural diversity educators must avoid stereotyping and ove rgeneralizing as not to offend or upset or offend a student by choosing an inappropriate tone, word, or body language (Walker et al., 1985; Osher & Osher 1995). According to King et al. (2007) , culturally competent institutions experience less cultural related misc ommunication and misbehavior and enjoy stronger and more supportive relationships with students and their families and therefore a higher likelihood of academic and behavioral success. Multiculturalism. According to the University of California, Berkeley Glossary of Terms (\"Diversity, equity, and inclusion\", 2009), multiculturalism recogni zes that we as a nation are culturally diverse and provides an avenue for \"the sharing and transfor ming of cultural experiences [which] allow us to re-articulate and redefine new spac es, possibilities, and positions for ourselves and others\" (p. 1). \"Multicultural education,\" according to B anks (2005b), \"incorporates the idea that all students\u2014regardless of their gender a nd social class and their ethnic, racial, or cultural characteristics\u2014should have an equal opportunit y to learn in school\" (p. 3). The goal is to help students develop social action and decision making skills (Banks, 2003). Many schools are structured in such a way that they deny equal educational opportunities to certain students. Sadker and Sadker (1994) assert that boys are more likely to receive discipline for the same infractions that are committ ed by girls while the girls typically escape consequences. Donovan and Cross (2002) point out that boys are also more likely to be referred for special education services than girls. M inority males traditionally receive an even higher rate discipline and suspension for similar offenses than do White males (Gibbs, 1988). 70 Banks (2005b) suggests multiculturalism was born as a result of the civil right s movement of the 1960s. A primary goal of the civil rights movement was to eradicat e discriminatory practices in public accommodations, housing, employment, and educat ion. According to Banks (2005a), \"A curriculum that focuses on the experiences of mains tream Americans and largely ignores the experiences, cultures, and histories of other ethnic, racial, cultural, language, and religious groups has negative consequences for both mainstrea m students and students of color\" (p. 242). Such a mainstream curriculum reinforces and perpetuates the racism and ethnocentrism of the mainstream culture. Simila rly, Banks (2005a) suggests a mainstream curriculum provides the mainstream students a \" false sense of superiority\" and denies them the \"knowledge, perspectives, and frames of referenc e that can be gained\" from other groups and cultures (p. 242). As a result of the civil rights movement, minority groups demanded that curricul a reflect their cultures, histories, experiences, and perspectives. School re sponse was reactionary. Programs and policies were developed without sufficient discuss ion and forward planning. Dominant were holidays, celebrations, and courses that recognized individual ethnic groups. Attempts to integrate the mainstream curriculum with multicultur al content proved difficult for several reasons (Banks, 2005a). First, it is difficult to counter the assimilation ideology and change the way many educators view the developme nt of the country's culture related to British heritage and consider the contributions of ethnic and cultural groups as significant. Second, multicultural education can face resistanc e because for many the mainstream curriculum reinforces and justifies the mainstrea m social, political, and economic power structure. Even though faced with these difficulties, today's idea of multiculturalism rose from these early interventions. 71 Grant and Sleeter (2005) point out that multicultural education is not a single course or program. Instead, multicultural education is a wide variety of programs and prac tices that serve to provide for educational equality for women, language minorities, ethnic groups, low socioeconomic groups, and people with disabilities. Nieto (2003) and Sleeter and Grant (2003) also suggest multicultural education can extend to total school reform efforts . When extended to broad based educational reform, Nieto (2005) attests that multicultural e ducation can have a profound effect on how and to what level students learn. Nieto (2004) defines multicultural educations as: ...a process of comprehensive school reform and basic education for all students. It challenges and rejects racism and other forms of discrimination in schools and s ociety and accepts and affirms the pluralism (ethnic, racial, linguistic, religious, e conomic, and gender) that students, their communities, and teachers reflect. Multicultural education permeates the school's curriculum and instructional strategies, as w ell as the interactions among teachers, students, and families, and the very way that sc hools conceptualize the nature of teaching and learning. Because it uses critica l pedagogy as its underlying philosophy and focuses on knowledge, reflection, and action (praxis ) as the basis of social change, multicultural education promotes democratic principles of social justice. (p. 346) According to Grant and Sleeter (2005), teachers work with multiculturalism according to five approaches: (a) teaching the exceptional and culturally di fferent; (b) human relations; (c) single-group studies; (d) multicultural education; and (e) education that is multicultural and social reconstructionist. The goals of the \"teaching the ex ceptional and culturally different\" approach \"are to equip students with the cognitive skills , concepts, 72 information, language, and values traditionally valued by U. S. society, and eventua lly to enable them to hold a job and function within society's institutions and culture\" (p. 65). Teachers begin by determining a student's current achievement level, and t hen working with that student to attain the ascribed grade level norms. The goals of the\" human rel ations\" approach are to \"engender positive feelings among all students, promote group identi ty and pride for students of color, reduce stereotypes, and work to eliminate prejudice and bi ases\" (p. 67). This approach uses cooperative learning and role playing to examine simila rities and differences and to include contributions of student groups to provide accurate informati on about ethnic, racial, gender, disability, or social class to address stereot ypes. The goals of the \"single-group studies\" approach are to \"raise the social status of the target group by helping young people examine how the group has been oppressed historically and what its capabilities and achievements have been\" (p. 67). The approach focuse s on one group at a time so the knowledge of that group is cohesive rather than gradual with the hope that students will develop respect and work to improve the group's status. The goals of the \"multicultural education\" approach are to \"reduce prejudice and discriminat ion against oppressed groups, to work toward equal opportunity and social justice for all groups, and to effect an equitable distribution of power among members of the different cultural groups\" (p. 70). This approach looks to reform the educational process for all students regardless of the cultural makeup. This approach assumes all students are capable of learning comple x material and performing at a high level. Multiple languages are taught a nd all students are expected to become at least bilingual. The goals of the \"education that is multicultural and social reconstructionist\" approach are \"to prepare future citizens to reconstruct society so that it better serves the 73 interests of all groups of people, especially those who are of color, poor, female , and/or with disabilities\" (p. 71). There are four practices unique to the education that is multic ultural and social reconstructionist approach: (a) democracy is actively practiced i n school\u2014students practice politics, debate, social action, and the use of power\u2014teachers guide s tudents so they develop prudent decision making skills; (b) students learn to analyze institutional inequality according to their own lives\u2014students prepare to change unjust social practices ; (c) students learn to use social actions skills\u2014social action skills are described by Be nnett (1990) as \"the knowledge, attitudes, and skills that are necessary for active citizen parti cipation\" (p. 307); and (d) bridges are built across various oppressed groups so they can work togethe r to advance their common interests\u2014this can strengthen and energize struggles a gainst oppression but can be difficult because members often believe they will have to give up something to the goals of the other group. Pine and Hilliard (1990) assert, \"If Ameri cans are to embrace diversity, the conscious and unconscious expressions of racism (sexis m) within our society must be identified and done away with\" (p. 7). Multicultural education assi sts greatly in the goal of recognizing, respecting, and celebrating diverse cult ures and living together in harmony. Teacher-Student Relationships What is taught and how it is taught exert tremendous influence on student performance and learning. \"Children,\" Ashworth (1990) asserts, \"are keenly aware of where they stand in the school community and of how they are perceived by other students and teachers\" (p. 3). \"By nature,\" Ashworth (1990) adds, \"human beings are social creatures...biologically intended to live, work, play and succeed together... deeply influenced by others and how they treat us\" (p. 6). For Perry (2001), the \"capacity to form and maint ain 74 relationships is the most important trait of humankind\u2014without it, none of us would survive, learn, work, or procreate\" (p. 32). In positive teacher-student relationships, Payne ( 2005) states \"emotional deposits are made to the student, emotional withdrawals are avoided, and students are respected\" (p.111). Moos (1979) and Goodenow (1993) suggest teachers who show personal involvement with students show those students that they are respected. T hese feelings of respect motivate and engage students toward increased positive produc tivity and academic achievement (Wentzel, 1997). There is abundant research stressing the importance of teachers caring f or their students and believing that these students can learn and holding high expectations for them as learners (Barr & Parrett, 1995). Numerous studies suggest a connection between t eacher beliefs and how they teach or fail to teach children (White-Clark, 2005). According to Payne (2001): Relationships always begin as one individual to another. First and foremost in all relationships with students is the relationship between each teacher and student, the n between each student and each administrator, and finally, among all of the pl ayers, including student-to-student relationships. (p. 111) The relationship between a teacher and a student, therefore, is the foundation upon whic h learning rests. For many students, their successes or failures are l argely dependent upon the relationships they enjoy or fail to enjoy with their teachers. Kohl (2006) sugge sts most children do not fail due to their cognitive abilities but because they feel unwelcome , detached, or alienated from significant others in the educational environment. Eff ective teachers care about their students and demonstrate that they care in such a way that their students are aware of it. According to Thayer-Bacon and Bacon (1996), \"Teachers who care 75 about their students are remembered, effect change, stimulate growth, and are more likely to be successful at teaching their students\" (p. 255). Senge (1990) states: When people genuinely care, they are actively committed. They are doing what they truly want to do. They are full of energy and enthusiasm. They persevere, even in the face of frustration and setbacks, because what they are doing is what they must do. It is their work. (p. 148) Research indicates that children who are securely attached to significant adults become more curious, self-directed and empathetic. Such relationships foster ac hievement, autonomy and altruism (Brendro et al., 1990). Students need to feel affirmed and to be assured they are valued. They need to be challenged and they need to know they can succ eed at a high level of expectation. Teacher expectations can be very powerful and can influe nce a student's attitudes and actions and lead to success or failure (Tomlinson & Eidson, 2003; Shalaway, 1989). As Pianta (1999) suggests \"No amount of focus on academics, no matter how strong or exclusive, will substantially change the fact that the substrate of classr oom life is social and emotional\" (p. 170). Brophy and Good (1970), assert that many teachers treat students differently toward based on preliminary perceptions and expectations. Students pi ck up on these perceptions and this can affect student self-image, motivation toward lear ning, behavior, and relationships with the teachers and other students and adults. These resul ts can then reinforce the teacher's initial perception and result in perpetuating unde rachievement. Accordingly, teachers demand better performance from those children for whom they have higher expectations and less from those they perceive as less capable. Teache rs are more likely to praise the performance of high-expectation students and to accept poor perfo rmance 76 from low-expectation students. Holding high expectations \"raises bar\" and pr omotes a \"culture of achievement\" (Shouse, 1996). According to Smey-Richman (1989), students wit h teachers who expect them to put forth their best effort are more highly motivated and m ore likely to work hard than are students who have teachers who expect less. Smey-Ric hman (1989) also suggests students for whom teachers have low expectations have fewer opportunities to interact and participate in classroom activities. The teacher-student relationship is recognized to be a formalized interpers onal association between an authority figure and a subordinate who interact on nearly a d aily basis (Larson et al., 2002; Bartlett, 2005). Positive individual relationships between adult s and youth are the foundations of successful programs of education. According to Borba ( 1989), \"The importance of interpersonal relationships in our lives cannot be overstated. We a ll need to feel a sense of connectedness to another human being\u2014particularly to those whom we consider to be important and significant\" (p. 163). If students are to learn, they must feel comfortable in their instructional environment. One method of enhancing student performance is to cultivate a culture of achievement in the classroom where i nstruction is challenging, students feel comfortable asking questions, and students are expec ted to do their best. When students feel challenged, they are less likely to be bored and disengage d (Brophy, 1987b). Several studies exploring what makes a good teacher show the importance of cari ng in the eyes of teachers and students. One study defines caring as an act of bri nging out the best in students through affirmation and encouragement. The characteristics of car ing go well beyond knowing the students to include qualities such as patience, trust, honesty, and courage. Specific teacher attributes that show caring include listening, ge ntleness, understanding, knowledge of students as individuals, warmth and encouragement, and an 77 overall love for children (Stronge, 2002). Creating a culture in the classroom where learning is \"cool,\" and asking questions is not only okay but expected takes time to develop and is accomplished by setting clear, high, consistent yet attainable expectat ions for all students. High quality instruction that is rigorous, aligned with content standards, and uses instructional strategies to meet the academic needs of all students is key i n promoting a culture of engagement and achievement in the classroom (Weiss & Pasley, 2004). It was once commonly held that it is not important for students to like their teache rs but they must respect them. Fay and Funk (1995) point to a convention of psychology that states: Human beings will perform for the person they love. If a person loves himself [of herself], he [or she] will do it for himself [or herself]. If he [or she] does not have that high self-esteem or belief in self, he [or she] will have to do it for someone els e until the time comes that he [or she] does love himself [or herself]. (p. 20) According to Jones (1987a), \"If the students like you, they will go along with almost anything\" (p. 191). Effective teachers understand that they can create and mai ntain a positive learning environment by developing positive relationships with their students. Devel oping such relationships takes time but this investment of time can set the stage for m eaningful learning because students want to work hard for teachers that care for them. F or Jackson and Davis (2000): The quality of relationships between school staff members and [children], and among all the adults within the school community, makes an enormous difference in the ability of a school to mount an effective instructional program. Positive relationships based on trust and respect, nurtured over time by supportive organizational structures 78 and norms of interaction, are the human infrastructure within a school that enables effective teaching and learning to occur. (p. 222) A fundamental assumption of quality education is that children have a safe place to learn (Heim, 2007). Students generally feel secure in classrooms if they fee l they can trust and depend on the teacher (Borba, 1989). The learning environment must be safe to make errors in learning and it must be safe to make errors in behaving (Jones, 1987a). Safe classrooms where students feel cared for and respected are required for g ood learning opportunities. Enjoying positive supportive relationships with teachers are ess ential to classroom success (Sornson, 2001). Students come to school with common human needs. They need to feel safe and secure, both physically and emotionally. They need to fe el they belong to the group and are important to it and that they share common ground with their peers (Tomlinson & Eidson, 2003; Shalaway, 1989). Building on early relationships enjoye d with their parents, students' sense of belonging and acceptance at school enhance s their ability and opportunity to learn and perform well in school (Jackson & Davis, 2000). This need is recognized and addressed in Ernest Boyer's Basic School (Boyer, 1995), w here each classroom is a community where teachers become listeners and learners along with their students. What matters most is not the amount of talk but the quality of the communicati on. The same can be stated for relationships. What matters is having a positive product ive relationship. Any other kind is counterproductive. A tenet of the Basic School (Boy er, 1995) is that it must be a \"caring place, where the principal, teachers, and student s are respectfully attentive to each other\" (p. 26). Stronge (2002) suggests praising students, reinforci ng positive behaviors, and establishing trust helps to build caring and respectful teacher -student relationships. 79 The research supports that relationships between teachers and students are cri tical for academic achievement and school success. According to its 2002 Set for Success report, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation (Blankstein, 2004) asserts, \"positive relati onships are essential to a child's ability to grow up healthy and achieve later socia l, emotional, and academic success\" (p. 59). McLaughlin's twelve-year study (Lewis, 2000) al so concluded that fostering relationships between children and adults provides opportunities for the m to \"see each other in new ways\" (p. 643). According to Glasser (1993), \"The better we know someone and the more we like about what we know, the harder we will work for that person\" (p. 30). Similarly, Ryan and Patrick (2001) found that students who believe that their teachers care about them perform better on tests. In Payne's (2001) work on poverty, she offers, \"The key to achievement for students from poverty is in creating relationships with them. Because poverty is about rel ationships as well as entertainment, the most significant motivator for these students is re lationships\" (p. 142). Nine out of ten students from poverty who make it to middle class credit the success of their journey to the power of relationships with specific teachers, counselors or coa ches who took an interest in them as individuals. Honoring students as human beings worthy of respe ct and care establishes relationships that enhance learning. Jackson and Davis (2000) also f ound that when successful adults are asked what factor of their education most impac ted their success they often credit a special relationship with a teacher. Students are \"empowered\" or \"disabled\" as a direct result of their interactions with educators in the schoo l. Relationships are also key to academic success for minority students and the influence of t he lived experiences of predominantly White teachers working with an increasingl y racially and ethnically diverse student body needs to be understood (Carr & Klassen, 1997). Resear ch 80 indicates teachers in diverse settings are more likely to be \"unqualified \" in their content areas, inadequately prepared, and lacking sufficient professional development t o teach effectively (White-Clark, 2005). Banks and Lynch (1986) contended that teachers m ust understand how \"race and culture interact to cause educational problems for many e thnic minority students\" (p. 16). Students who are empowered by their school experiences develop the ability, confidence, and motivation to succeed academically. They participate compete ntly in instruction as a result of having developed appropriate school-based knowledge and interactional structures. Students who are disempowered or \"disabled\" by thei r school experiences do not develop this type of cognitive-academic and social-emoti onal foundation (Cummins, 1986). Relationships matter and positive relationships with caring adults inc rease opportunities for children to succeed. It takes time to build positive relationship. Jone s (1987a) suggests, \"From the giving and receiving of caring, helping, concern, and r espect, a bond is built between two individuals that can be trusted. This bond is the basis of most cooperation and spontaneous helping\" (p. 65). Teachers have great influence in the classroom and school corridors. This inf luence and relationship building and maintaining are directly related in the pedagogy of te aching. Teachers not only influence students by how they treat them. They also influence s tudents by how they teach them and how the communicate with them during this teaching. Positive ly influential teachers teach with effective strategies, plan for motivat ing lessons and motivate students during these lessons, provide specific and appropriate feedback, different iate learning to promote the interests and skills of all students, manage the classroom e ffectively and efficiently, and practice effective and positive discipline procedures. 81 Teacher Effectiveness. Every August millions of children walk through the doors of our schools capable of engaging in meaningful learning and of experiencing gre at success. These students bring differing levels of preparedness and a variety of attitude s toward schooling. Many of these students with these varying backgrounds want to do well but do not know how. Development of a positive and supportive relationship with the students is imperative, but to fully affect positive academic outcomes, the teacher must de monstrate effective pedagogy. Effective teachers who know their students formally and informally not only know their learning styles and needs but also their personalities, likes, di slikes, and personal situations that might affect performance in school (Stronge, 2002). The ter m \"teacher effectiveness\" is broadly used to identify attributes of what c onstitutes a good teacher (Marzano, Pickering, & Pollock, 2001). Effective teachers are not only acc omplished instructors but also work to understand their students' personalities and needs and to develop and maintain positive supportive teacher-student relationships (Good & Brophy, 2000; Larrivee, 2005). Effective teachers are aware of the important difference s among students and identifying these differences helps the teacher better understand individual students and permits students to understand that the teacher has a personal interest in them (Ma rzano, 2003). The research is clear in demonstrating that effective teachers have a profound influence on student achievement and ineffective teachers do not (Stronge, 2002). Marzano's research (2003) demonstrates the affect of teacher effect iveness on student achievement. Researchers estimate that students typically gain approxim ately 34 percentile points measuring academic achievement points each year. Accordingly, a student who begins a year at the 50th percentile will end the year at the 84th percentile as me asured by the same assessment. While students of effective teachers will enjoy higher gains , students unfortunate 82 enough to have teachers who do not possess the attitude or aptitude to maximize their learning will achieve at a far lesser rate. Table 4 compares the differ ences in achievement level that can be anticipated dependant on the effectiveness of the teacher. Table 4 Student Achievement Differences Affected by Teachers Teacher Student Achievement Gain in 1 Year Least Effective 14 percentage points Average 34 percentage points Most Effective 53 percentage points Note . Adapted from What works in schools: Translating research into action . By R. J. Marzano, 2003, Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. According to Marzano (2003), schooling accounts for about 20% of the variance in student achievement. About 67% of this effect, or 13% of the total variance in achievem ent, is due to the efforts of individual teachers. The remaining 7% is dependent on the effor ts of the school. Sanders and Rivers (1998) have shown the enormous difference that teachers ca n make in the achievement of their students. One study in Dallas in the mid-1990s showe d that children assigned to effective teachers for three years in a row scored a n average of 49 percentile points higher on a standardized reading assessment than children as signed to three ineffective teachers in a row. Teacher effectiveness is a set of expe riences, traits, behaviors, and dispositions that are typically evident in effective teachers. Although t he effect the classroom teacher can have on student achievement is clear, the dynamics of how a teacher produces such an effect are not simple. The effective teacher performs man y functions that can be organized into three major roles: making wise choices about the most effective 83 instructional strategies to employ, designing classroom curriculum to faci litate student learning, and making effective use of classroom management techniques (Ma rzano et al., 2001). Marzano has shown that students in effective schools as opposed to ineffective schools have a 44% difference in their expected passing rate on a test that has a typical passing rate of 50%. When comparing the top 1% with the bottom 1% of schools, the difference in the passing rate on a test with a typical passing rate of 50% climbs to 70% (Marzano, Waters, & McNulty, 2005). Words such as ideal, analytical, dutiful, competent, expert, reflective, satisfy ing, diversity-responsible, and respectful have been used to describe good teachers (C ruickshank & Haefele, 2001). Effective teachers have been further described as caring, enthusiastic, motivated, fair, respectful, reflective, and dedicated individuals with a sense of humor who interact well with students. Stronge (2002) suggests interviews with students c onsistently reveal that they want teachers who hold them in mutual respect. Stronge and Hindma n (2006) add that effective teachers cultivate a positive classroom environment for their students by working with students to ensure that routines, procedures, and expectations are clea r. Marzano (2003) warns that ineffective teachers might actually impede the le arning of their students. Student Motivation. Many students enter school excited to learn but after a few short years this excitement too often falls victim to apathy (Glasser, 1993). Man y become skeptical of the value of school. School is not nearly as much fun as it was in Kindergarten and there is increasingly less satisfaction connected to learning. Research demonstr ates that motivation decreases as students progress from elementary through the secondary gra des (Harter, 1981; Gottfried, Fleming, Grouze t, & 84 Pelletier; 2005). Kohn (1993) suggests this drop in motivation might be caused by changes in or elimination of various extrinsic reward systems which undermine intrinsic motivation. Jones (1987b) suggests a reason for this lack of joy and motivation toward learning can be attributed to the classroom learning environment. Motivation is too often considered t o be an innate quality that students bring with them to school. Jackson and Davis (2000) suggest, however, that student motivation and engagement is relative to the quality of the relationships they have in school. Stronge and Hindman (2006) add that a high level of motivation and enthusiasm for learning in teachers leads to high levels of motivat ion and achievement in children. The link between student motivation and achievement is straightforward. Covey (1989) said we must \"Seek first to understand, then to be understood \" (p. 237). While a teacher cannot understand every problem for every child, through good communication the teacher should be able to acquire enough information to assist and motivate students who are struggling. Effective teachers must accordingly strive to motivate students to want to learn and achieve. A significant body of research indicates that \"academic achievement and s tudent behavior are influenced by the quality of the teacher and student relationship\" (Jones & Jones, 1981). Students respond well and are motivated by teachers who like and respect them. Accordingly, students who are motivated to learn will typically enjoy i ncreased academic success (Marzano, 2003; Shalaway, 1989). Learning is an active proce ss in which students must be engaged as genuine participants (Danielson, 2002). When teachers make the classroom experience engaging and students are meaningfully engaged in challenging learning opportunities and are experiencing success, learning increases and there is little time or inclination for misbehavior (Stronge, 2002; Danielson, 2002). Teachers must help stude nts 85 perceive themselves as capable and responsible. When the child's learning ne eds are met, motivation for further achievement is enhanced (Marzano, 2003; Shalaway, 1989). Conversely, students deprived of educational success typically express their frustration through inappropriate behavior or withdrawal (Brendro et al., 1990). Most authorities agree that motivation is an abstract concept that is not easy to define operationally. According to Berelson and Steiner (1964), motivation refers to all those strivings that are designated by such terms as \"wishes,\" \"desires,\" \" needs,\" and \"drives.\" Accordingly, Berelson and Steiner assert that a motive is an inner state that moves people toward goals resulting in purposeful behavior. Wlodkowski (1986) defines motivation as \"those processes that can (a) arouse and instigate behavior; (b) give direc tion or purpose to behavior; (c) continue to allow behavior to persist; and (d) lead to choosing or preferr ing a particular behavior\" (p. 12). Brophy (1988) suggests the motivation to learn is \"a student tendency to find academic activities meaningful and worthwhile and to try to derive the intended academic benefits from them\" (pp. 205-206). For Borba (1989), \"motivation is an internal impetus that induces us to perform a chosen exercise\" (p. 230). Glynn, Aultm an, and Owens (2005) define motivation as \"an internal state that arouses, directs, and sus tains human behavior\" (p. 150). Marzano et al. (2005) referred to motivation as the extent to whi ch students are motivated to be engaged in academic tasks from both external and inter nal sources. Motivation can be either intrinsic, extrinsic, or a combination of the two. According to Unrau and Schlackman (2006), \"Intrinsic motivation arises from an individual's personal interest in a topic or activity and is satisfied through pursuit of that topic or acti vity,\" while \"extrinsic motivation arises from participation in an activity, not for its own sake, but for 86 rewards or the release from some external social demand\" (p. 81). Deci, Koes tner, and Ryan (2001) argue that extrinsic motivation can undermine intrinsic motivation. Unrau and Schlackman (2006) suggest not all extrinsic motivation undermines intrinsic motivat ion and asserts that some extrinsic motivation may be internalized and owned by the stude nt. According to the self determination theory (Unrau & Schlackman, 2006), extrinsic motivation takes four forms: (a) external regulation (least autonomous), (b) introjected regulation (motive a nd associated behavior not fully embraced as one's own), (c) identified regulation (valuing of a goal or regulation and associated behavior as personally import ant), and (d) integrated regulation (most autonomous extrinsic motivation that is fully assimilated into the self and one's own values but not inherently enjoyed). (p. 82) For many students, getting good grades is \"identified and integrated regul ation\" as it is meaningful and valuable to them. Motivating students consists of making students receptive to and excited about learning and aware of the importance of learning itself (Stronge, 2002). Student moti vation can be stimulated by teachers' instruction and engaging school curriculum (Br ophy, 1987b). Teachers can elicit motivation by selecting academic activities tha t students will want to engage in because they are interested in the content or because they enjoy the ta sk (Smey- Richman, 1988). Stronge (2002) asserts that, \"Teachers can effectively motivate m ost students by encouraging them to be responsible for their own learning, maintaining an organized classroom environment, setting high standards, assigning appropriate cha llenges, and providing reinforcement and encouragement during tasks\" (p. 18). According to den 87 Brok, Levy, Brekelmans, and Wubbles (2005), researchers have determined four separ ate, though interrelated elements of motivation: (a) the pleasure (or enjoyment) students experience in lessons of a subject; (b) the relevance of the subject (for future work or other subjects and domains); (c) the confidence students have in learning and achieving for the subject; and (d) the effort they put in or interest they have for the subject. (p. 21) Research shows that students may not realize the influence effort has on their success in school, but they can learn that effort helps them succeed. Simply teaching students t hat effort pays off in terms of enhanced achievement actually increases stude nt achievement. One study by VanOverwalle and DeMetsenaere (1990) found that students who were ta ught about the relationship between effort and achievement achieved more than students who w ere taught techniques for time management and comprehension of new material. Reinforc ing effort can help teach students one of the most valuable lessons they can learn\u2014the har der you try, the more successful you are. Similarly, providing recognition for atta inment of specific goals not only enhances achievement, it stimulates motivation (Marz ano et al., 2001).When students feel they are emotionally supported they are better able to conce ntrate on and generate interest for the learning objective. Highly motivated students ac hieve more, are better behaved and are positive about themselves and others. They are creative , curious and confident. Providing for this feeling of support is the responsibility of the teac her (Shalaway, 1989; Sornson, 2001). Student Engagement. It was not that long ago that school was viewed as one of the most important aspects of a young person's life. Few questioned the value of a form al education and most wanted to perform well in school. Many students today do not share the 88 positive view of schooling that once was the norm. These disengaged students do the minimum to get by and to avoid getting into trouble. They expend little energy on schooling and do not see focusing on education as important to their future success. According to Osterman (2000), the best indicator for effort and productive engagement in school is the quality of relationship students have with their teachers. Students who enjoy a posit ive and supportive relationship with their teacher attend better to instruction, put forth gr eater effort, work through difficult situations, are better able to cope with stress, and are mor e accepting of teacher redirects and criticism then students who do not enjoy supportive and positive teacher-student relationships (Midgley, Feldlauffer, & Eccles, 1989; Skinner & Belmont, 1993). Pianta (1999) asserts students who have close relationships with caring teache rs and share with them personal feelings and information are more engaged and achieve hi gher academic levels than students who do not enjoy such relationships. Stipek (2006) agrees suggesting, \"When students have a secure relationship with their teachers, t hey are more comfortable taking risks that enhance learning--tackling challenging tasks, persisting when they run into difficulty, or asking questions when they are confused\" (p. 46). Stronge (2002) contends that the time students spend engaged in the instruction contributes greatly to classroom success. A 1993 study by Anderson discovered that only about 83% of allocated time is actually devoted to instruction in the typical Unit ed States school. Anderson also found that only about 62% of the allocated time for instruction was actually spent with the kids engaged in leaning which translates to only 37 minutes of each school hour with students actively engaged in the learning process. Too many students who are not engaged become bored and complacent and typically spend this extra time counte r to educational purposes and soon find themselves in trouble or lacking the motivation to invest 89 themselves in learning. Learning seems to be most successful when the lea rner is actively involved in the teaching and learning process. Students who are excited about what t hey are doing in school are usually active participants in their own learning (Lezotte, 1992). According to Newmann (1986), students are engaged when they \"devote substantial tim e and effort to a task, when they care about the quality of their work, and when they commi t themselves because the work seems to have significance beyond its personal inst rumental value\" (p. 242). Steinberg et al. (1996) define \"engagement\" as \"the degree to w hich students are psychologically 'connected' to what is going on in their classes\" ( p. 15). According to Graden, Thurlow, and Ysseldyke (1982), researchers have found a strong relationship between the amount of time students are actively engaged in le arning and their achievement. In their analysis of studies of influences on achievement , Good and Brophy (2000) also noted a strong association with achievement and engaged learning. Good performance in school is perhaps the best indicator of later success whether that success is measured by eventual level of education, occupation or income. More recent researc h has also concluded that positive student engagement in the classroom is a critical and c ompelling factor in enhancing student achievement (Garcia-Reid, Reid, & Peterson, 2005). Ma ehr and Midgley (1992) identified several strategies for increasing student enga gement and motivation: (a) emphasize goal setting and self-regulation; (b) offer c hoices in instructional settings; (c) reward students for attaining \"personal-best\" goals; ( d) foster teamwork through group-learning and problem solving experiences; (e) replace social comparis ons of achievement with self-assessment and evaluation techniques; (f) teach time -management skills; and (g) offer self-paced instruction when possible. 90 Teachers are vital in fostering student engagement as they work directl y with the students and typically are the most influential in a student's educational experi ence. Black (2004) contends, \"Teachers who are most successful in drawing students into deep and thoughtful learning develop activities that keep students' psychological and intel lectual needs in mind\" (p. 42). Effective teachers are thoroughly prepared and keep their student s actively involved in the teaching and learning process. When actively and positively engage d in the classroom dynamics, there is little opportunity or desire to misbehave (Strong e, 2002; Danielson, 2002). Creating a culture of achievement in their classroom, developing interactive and relevant lessons and activities, and being encouraging and support ive to students are all ways in which teachers can foster student engagement in the cl assroom (Garcia-Reid et al., 2005). Student disengagement is often a result of lacking a positive school relations hip with a caring adult (Steinberg et al., 1996). Teachers have an obligation not only to inform students but also to engage them. According to Adler (1982, \"All genuine learning is active, not passive. It involves the use of the mind, not just the memory. It is the process of discovery in which the student is the main agent\" (p. 23). When students are highly engaged they are involved emotionally as well as physically. They are committ ed to the learning activity. Well-managed classrooms are task-oriented and predictable with hi gh levels of student involvement and little wasted time, confusion or disruption (Wong & Wong, 1998). Teacher Feedback. Lezotte and Pepperl (1999) assert, \"There's nobody more important in a school than the teachers in terms of meeting the learning goals of the kids\" (p. 29). One of the most effective strategies a teacher can use to maximize st udent achievement is to provide useful feedback relative to how well students are doing (Hattie, 1992). As 91 Brookhart (2008) suggests, \"Feedback says to a student, 'Somebody cared enough about my work to read it and think about it!' ...It's just-in time, just-for-me information deli vered when and where it can do the most good\" (p. 1). The purpose of giving feedback in the classroom is to improve student performance. Lee (2006) asserts, \"Effective feedback helps pupils to know how to move forward with their learning\" (p. 56) by focusing \"on what needs to be done to improve and specific details about how to improve\" (p. 59). For Stronge (2002), feedback is one of the most powerful modification techniques for increasing l earning outcomes. Danielson (2002) describes feedback as information provided about the result s of performance intended to reinforce positive behavior and encourage needed change. Embe rger (2002) defines feedback as information that learners receive from their tea cher about their performance that may cause them to take self-corrective action and guide the m to attaining their goals. Effective teachers tell students what they are doing right and why and what needs improvement and how to improve. Children develop a self-image based on their experiences and on the feedback they receive from significant adults. If this feedback is positive, children becom e more confident and successful. If it is frequently negative, a child can develop feelings of inade quacy and inferiority (Barakat & Clark, 1998). Rosenshine (1971) found evidence that high rates of achievement were associated with high rates of approval while lower rates of achievement were associated with higher rates of disapproval. Formative feedback is cri tical to student learning as it gives information to the learner about what is going well and what needs to be done for improvement. Brookhart (2008) explains that effective feedback is a \"double- barreled approach\" (p. 2) as it addresses both motivational and cognitive factors. The cognitive benefit is the information students need to understand the level of their le arning and 92 what to do to increase that learning. The motivation comes from developing the feelin g that they have control over their own learning. Kluger and DeNisi (1996) found that students who receive feedback on average outperform students who do not receive feedback by .41 standard deviations which would represent an improvement of 16 percentile points on a standardized test. They also learned that while on average student performance impr oves with feedback, ineffective feedback can actually cause student performance t o decline. Hattie and Timperley (2007) suggest four levels of student feedback: (a) task performance feedback such as if work is correct and how to get more informati on; (b) task processing feedback such as strategies the student used or could use; (c) self- regulation feedback such as information about student self-confidence or self-evaluation; a nd (d) personal feedback such as value statements about the student being \"smart\" or a \"ha rd worker.\" Feedback about the quality of work and the strategies and processes used produce s the most improvement gain. Task performance feedback is of the greatest benef it when it corrects a student's misconceptions rather than when it points out a need for more information. The more specific the task feedback, the stronger the correlati on with improvement. Task process feedback benefits some students is they are able to conne ct and scaffold the process with the results. Feedback that causes students to consider self- regulation can produce gain if students hear it and believe that additional effort wi ll improve the results. With self-regulation feedback, students will accept, act on, and seek fut ure information, or they will not. Students with high self confidence usually find self- regulation feedback helpful. Even though such statements might boost a student's self-esteem, pe rsonal value feedback do not show to improves results as they are not formative and do not focus the student's attention on the learning. Such feedback can also backfire and cause a student to 93 view intelligence as fixed and achievement as something beyond his or her contr ol because he or she is either \"smart\" or not. Lee (2006) suggests there are three criteria the learner must know for fee dback to be effective: (a) the learning objectives and success criteria for the task; (b) the extent to which they have achieved the learning objectives/success criteria; and (c) how to m ove closer to achieving the learning objectives or how to close the gap between what they have done and what they could do. (p. 57) Immediate student awareness of progress usually serves as an incentive for increased effort (Smey-Richman, 1988). Schweinle, Meyer, and Turner (2006) suggest, \"Providing substantive feedback about competence and goal progress increases self-effi cacy, enhances interest and persistence, and increases intrinsic motivation\" (pp. 272-273). Conver sely, nonconstructive performance feedback can decrease motivation. Similarly, persona l rather than process feedback and criticism can decrease motivation. Students who rec eive positive feedback are more likely to engage in learning activities and initiate positive with the teacher interactions than those who receive negative feedback (Newman & Schwag er, 1993). A teacher behavior often cited in the literature addressing feedback is the use of praise and criticism. Brophy (1981) defines praise as a positive response to s tudents' good work or conduct that goes beyond mere affirmation or positive feedback. Smey-Richm an (1989) adds that, \"Teacher praise involves expressing surprise, delight, or exci tement and/or placing the students' behavior in context by giving information about its value and its implications for students' status\" (p. 12). Emmer (1998) warns that overenthusiastic ally praising students for correct answers loses its effectiveness over time s o effective feedback 94 must always be diagnostic and should always be constructive. Smey-Richman (1989) re fers to criticism as a negative teacher response that connotes expressions of disa pproval, disgust, or rejection. While in the past, teachers seemed to believe that students were mot ivated by the fear of failure, research now supports that using fear of failure only reinf orces poor self- concept (Danielson, 2002). Feedback that is corrective in nature must provide students w ith an explanation of what they are doing that is correct and what they are doing that is not correct (Marzano et al., 2001). When corrective feedback is done properly, it wil l always be supportive. One of the major by-products of effective corrective feedback is the re lationship building that comes from frequent and supportive helping (Jones, 1987a). Butler (1988) found that assigning grades or judging student work as a part of the feedback process can discourage the learner from using such feedback as a motivating factor or from seeking additional feedback to improve future learning. Judgment centere d feedback creates a focus on ego or performance rather than the learning task. Butle r (1988) learned that student performance on task improved with value free feedback describing what the students did well and offering suggestions on what they could do to improve. When grades were provided as feedback, performance declined. If descriptive feedback was provided with a grade attached, student task performance declined further. Table 5 describes the differences in achievement gain different types of feedback can be expected to generate. 95 Table 5 Feedback Comments and Grading Feedback Method Gain in Student Achievement Impact on Student Learning Descriptive feedback: teacher provides only comments (no grades) on student work 30% gain All positive Evaluative feedback: teacher provides only grades (no comments) on student work No gain Positive for the top students only and negative for the lower achieving students Descriptive and evaluative feedback: Teacher provides both comments and grades on student work No gain Positive for the top students only and negative for the lower achieving students Note . Adapted from \"Enhancing and undermining intrinsic motivation,\" by. R. Butler, 1988, British Journal of Educational Psychology, 58 (1). 1-14. Differentiated Learning. Schools as cultural organizations have a reputation of sameness in their day-to-day operations. Many teachers tend to fall into stag nant patterns of instruction (Lezotte, 1992). While all would certainly agree that all students are to be treated equitably, equity is rarely equality. In determining a proper educational f it for students, one size does not fit all. Heim (2007) warns, \"A lock-step learning environment may le ad to students falling out of step and not regaining their footing\" (p. 6). Children of the sam e age differ widely in their readiness to learn; they move forward at different rat es of speed; and they acquire quite different patterns of learning and thinking (Goodlad, 1976). We know that students learn best in very different ways and in very different educational s ettings (Barr & Parrett, 1995). While most would agree it is impractical to try to individualize eve ry lesson for every child, research has shown that teaching to the middle is also ineffecti ve. Teaching 96 to the middle ignores the needs of advanced students while it intimidates and confuses l ower functioning learners (Tomlinson, 2000). Best practice recommends differentiating instruction so learners ca n be reached through a variety of methods and activities. Research has shown that students are mor e successful when they are taught based on their own readiness levels, interests , and learning profiles (Tomlinson, 2000). Alexander and Murphy (1998) and Keller (2002) suggest when students are disinterested in something this can often result in lower achievem ent over students with interest. Students with high interest often see their achievem ent levels improve. According to Pintrich and Schunk (1996), interest is \"elicited by activities that present students with information or ideas that are discrepant from their present knowledge or beliefs and that appear surprising or incongruous\" (p. 277). For teachers to be effective the y must be aware of difference between children and must take a personal interest in ea ch student (Marzano, 2003). Teachers must determine what students are ready for and to what de gree. Learning activities that are too hard or too easy can hinder student learning. Thos e that are too hard require excessive time and do not increase achievement while those that are too easy are a waste of time (Sornson, 2001). Since students learn at different rates, e ffective teachers recognize differences among their students and plan academic enrichment and r emediation opportunities to accommodate those differences in their instruction (Stronge, 2002). En gaged students are clearly more likely to perform better academically than s tudents who are not actively engaged. Therefore, teachers need a large inventory of instructional strategies to engage a variety of students (Garcia-Reid et al., 2005). There is ample evi dence that students are more successful in school and find it more satisfying if they are taught i n ways that are responsive to their readiness levels (Tomlinson, 2000). 97 Effective teachers differentiate instruction according to student needs (T omlinson, 2000). How best to differentiate and individualize for the range of student needs and abiliti es in a common classroom is an ongoing challenge (Stronge, 2002). Differentiated ins truction is a teaching philosophy based on the premise that teachers should adapt instruction to mee t students' varying readiness levels, learning preferences, and interests (W illis & Mann, 2000). As defined by Tomlinson and Eidson (2003): Differentiated instruction refers to a systematic approach to planning cu rriculum and instruction for academically diverse learners. It is a way of thinking about the classroom with the dual goals of honoring each student's learning needs and maximizing each student's learning capacity. (p. 3) Differentiated instruction is a way of thinking about teaching and learning tha t values the individual and can be translated into classroom practice in many ways. At its most basic level, differentiation consists of the efforts of teachers to respond to variance among learners in the classroom. Whenever a teacher varies teaching in order to create the best learning experience possible, that teacher is differentiating instruction. Accordi ng to Tomlinson (2000), teachers can typically differentiate four classroom elements base d on student readiness, interest, or learning profile: (a) content--what the student needs t o learn or how the student will get access to the information; (b) process--activities in w hich the student engages in order to make sense of or master the content; (c) products--culminating project s that ask the student to rehearse, apply, and extend what he or she has learned in a unit; and (d) learning environment--the way the classroom works and feels. If schools are g oing to teach children successfully, teachers must become more flexible and dynamic ( Lezotte, 1992). 98 Classroom Management. According to Wong and Wong (1998), \"The number one problem in the classroom is not discipline; it is the lack of procedures and routines\" (p. 167). Classroom management addresses many teaching areas including but not limi ted to developing relationships, structuring respectful classrooms, organizing work around a meaningful curriculum, teaching and modeling morality and citizenship, motivating students, and other instructional aspects to maximize effective teaching and student le arning (LaPage et al., 2005). Marzano (2003) suggests that a classroom that is chaotic as a result of poor management not only does not enhance achievement, it might even inhibit it. According to Allen (1996), about 50% of instructional time in poorly managed class rooms is lost due to student misbehavior and being off task. Of the time lost, 80% is attributed to talking w ithout permission. Nineteen percent is lost to daydreaming, students being out of their sea ts and student making noises. Only 1% is lost to more serious misbehavior. Classroom manageme nt clearly plays a role in maximizing learning opportunities. Establishing hi gh standards and behavior expectations has proven to be successful (Barr & Parrett, 1995). The intent of effective classroom management is to enhance student involvement and cooperation and to establish a positive working environment (Wong & Wong, 1998). Doyle (1986) defines classroom management as \"the actions and strategies teacher s use to solve the problems of order in classrooms\" (p. 397). For Duke (1979), classroom management is \"the provisions and procedures necessary to establish and maintain an environment in which instruction and learning can occur\" (p. xii). Brophy (1988) defines classroom mana gement as \"the actions taken to create and maintain a learning environment conducive to attainm ent of the goals of instruction-arranging the physical environment of the class room, establishing rules and procedures, maintaining attention to lessons and engagement in academic 99 activities\" (p. 2). For Marzano (2003), classroom management is \"the confluence of teacher actions in four distinct areas: (a) establishing and enforcing rules and pro cedures, (b) carrying out disciplinary actions, (c) maintaining effective teacher and student rela tionships, and (d) maintaining an appropriate mental set for management\" (p. 88). Every interaction we have with children is a learning opportunity (Cattermole & Thompson, n.d.). The key to minimizing behavior problems is good classroom management. Proactive classroom management is the most effective deterrent to inappropri ate student behavior (Stronge, 2002). Effective classroom management is more a function of a te acher's ability to prevent problems than skill in responding to problems (Brophy & Good, 1986). Research in classroom management, according to Shalaway (1989), demonstra tes that \"effective teachers spend very little time dealing with student misconduct \" (p. 69). Effective teachers do not ignore problem behaviors; rather they have developed management strat egies for preventing such problems before they erupt. Effective teachers must develop a nd teach procedures and routines so that students know how things are done in their classrooms. According to Wong and Wong (1998), research has shown a clear link between effectively managed classrooms and high student achievement. In a major revi ew of the literature, Wang, Haertel, and Walberg (1993) identified classroom management as a factor that has the greatest impact on student achievement out of 228 variables. An effective relationship may be the keystone that allows the other aspects of classroom ma nagement to work well. As teachers invest themselves in building relationships with students, t hey build a willingness in students to cooperate with directives and classroom rules. When adults build a positive relationship with a young person, they place themselves in a position to influe nce the behavior of that young person. When an adult is in the role of a teacher to a young person, a 100 willingness by the young person to please the adult produces both cooperation and mutual appreciation (Jones, 1987a). According to Marzano (2003) in order to establish an optimal relationship with students, a teacher must exhibit appropriate levels of dominanc e that convey the teacher is in control and can be trusted to provide behavioral and academic guidance and must communicate appropriate levels of cooperation that demonstrate c oncern for the individual needs and opinions of students and a willingness for the class to function as a team. Effective Discipline. Classroom management, behavior management and classroom discipline are interrelated. Danielson (2002) defines discipline policies as t he \"rules regarding student conduct, both within classroom and in the school as a whole\" (p. 53). Classroom discipline is the business of enforcing classroom standards and buil ding patterns of cooperation in order to maximize learning and minimize disruptions (Jones, 1987a). Studies investigating antisocial behavior have regularly illustrated that l ow academic performance is related to behavioral problems (Maguin & Loeber, 1996). Teacher interactions with students who demonstrate aggression and resistance tend to be crit ical and punishing (Coie & Koeppl, 1990; Walker & Buckley, 1973), and are often characterized by high conflict and low warmth (Itskowitz, Navon, & Strauss, 1988). When children perform poorly or resist school work or act inappropriately, frustrated teachers commonl y resort to coercion or use punishment or threaten students with low grades and failure to make them comply. This clearly does not work and typically results in alienating students t o where they do not believe putting forth any real effort is worth it (Glasser, 1993). More than thr ee decades ago Walker and Buckley (1973) found that students perceived as antisocial tend to be less likely to receive encouragement for appropriate behaviors and are more prone to 101 punishment for negative behavior than students perceived as well behaved. Research continues to suggest that repeated punishment likely serves to bring about a sense of estrangement from teachers, and that this feeling of alienation may lead t o increased anger and defiant behavior (VanAcker, Grant, & Henry, 1996). Negative reinforcement almost never positively influences behavior. To improve undesirable behavior, the environment must be changed to reinforce the desired behavior. Behavior that is observed, attended to, and rewarded will certainly increase. A s chool climate relying on punishment can provoke problem behaviors resulting in an increase in antisocia l behavior, a breakdown of student-teacher relations, degradation of school and social cli mate, and decreases in academic achievement (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1994). The pr ice of \"laying down the law\" means upset and burnout for the adult and rejection and alienation f or the child. Punishment can lead to feelings of hatred, revenge, defiance, guilt , alienation, unworthiness, and self-pity (Faber & Mazlish, 1980). If the relationship between tea cher and student is allowed to degenerate into an adversary relationship between the punitive adul t authority and the revengeful child, the child inevitably is the loser (Jones, 1987a). Thomas' (2000) essay, \"The Mind of Man [and Woman]\" states, \"children who are yelled at feel rejected and frightened because a teacher shouts at them\" ( p. 122). These feelings lead to inhibiting the child from learning. Anxious or alienated student s are less likely to be motivated to learn than students who feel welcomed and cared for (Brophy, 1987a). Alienation destroys relationships as it drives a wedge between the teache r and the student that will ultimately destroy the child's motivation to cooperate (J ones, 1987a). Alienated children are commonly described as aggressive or anxious, as atte ntion-disordered or affectionless, and as unmotivated or unteachable, and struggling to find belonging t hrough 102 attention seeking and other undesirable behaviors (Brendro et al., 1990). Many reje cted students learn to resist positive or negative interpersonal involvement, and are more likely to develop psychological problems, use drugs and alcohol, engage in early sex, and commi t criminal acts (Steinberg et al., 1996). A quote from Bronfenbrenner (1986) clearly illustrates the effect of alienat ion: \"To be alienated is to lack a sense of belonging, to feel cut off from family, frie nds, school or work\u2014the four worlds of childhood\" (p. 430). Methods commonly used to attack dignity generally consist of put-downs, sarcasm, criticism, scolds, and threats, many of which are delivered publicly (Mendler, 1992). Elementary school students may be young but they are every bit as deserving as the adults in the school to be treated well. Danielson (2002) warns that some adults in schools seem to forget the imperative to treat everyone wit h dignity and respect and \"talk down to students, dismiss their accounts of situations, and cut them off when they are speaking\" (p. 17). Teachers who show respect for their students are more likely to have active learners in their classroom. Arrogant or offensive te achers typically meet passive or active resistance and have little meaningful control over the children. Authoritarian control often squashes the inquisitive nature of student in the primary g rades and upper grades teachers usually experience difficulty managing and motivat ing children who were subjected to an earlier authoritarian teacher (Jones & Jones, 1981). Many teachers get stuck in a rut and find it difficult to shift from punishing student s who do not do as they are told to creating learning environments where students are motivated to do what is desired of them (Glasser, 1993). Danielson (2002) asserts there is no place in a school committed to learning for policies and procedures that \"are punit ive, turn students away, or undermine their confidence\" (p. 51). Actions that insult or belittle are 103 likely to cause children to view their teachers negatively, which can inhibit lear ning and can teach the child to be unkind to others (Barakat & Clark, 1998). Discipline is a broad concept designed to provide for good behavior or to correct poor behavior. An effective discipline program operates in concert with an effective classroom management system . Good discipline programs prevent most problems by attending to student physical, intell ectual, social and emotional needs. Effective discipline techniques focus on improving a student' s self-image and sense of responsibility through encouragement and kind words rathe r than rebukes and reprimands. Teachers can send messages that students are valuable and capable even when students make inappropriate choices (Shalaway, 1989; Purkey & Strahan, 2002). Behavior management refers to teacher activities designed to promote positi ve behaviors in students. Self-discipline is the goal of all behavior management. All a ctivities should be individualized to each child's behavioral needs with the objective of decreasin g antisocial and disruptive behaviors and increasing appropriate social behaviors. F rom age 6 to about 12, children begin to act with increasing self-control (Barakat & Clark, 1998) . It has been often found that children's confidence and their beliefs about their abilitie s are better indicators of how they will do in school than their actual intelligence quotient (IQ) or achievement test scores (Bempechat, 1998). Recent research backs the understandin g that self discipline in students is a better predictor for future success than IQ. Duc kworth and Selligman (2005) found that the failure to exercise self discipline was a major r eason for students falling short of their intellectual potential. Discipline is crucial because it promotes children's self-control, teaches children responsibility and helps children ma ke thoughtful choices. Teaching children self-discipline requires patience, thoughtful atte ntion, cooperation and a good understanding of the child (Barakat & Clark, 1998). 104 Discipline techniques must be compatible with helping students maintain or enhance their self-esteem (Mendler, 1992). Children feel confident when they experience the positive consequences of doing a job well. When children \"mess up\", they need to have a learning experience from that event as well; a child who \"owns\" the problem will suffer t he pain of the consequence and will learn from it. For Fay and Funk (1995): The difference between consequences and punishment is where we interpret the pain emanating from. Consequences result in pain from coming from the inside; punishment results in pain coming from the outside. Children will respond positively to a penalty when they see a logical connection between their behavior and what happens to them as a result of their behavior. (pp. 164-165). Studies of successful teachers show that they consistently monitor performanc e and expect good results. They do so in ways that are positive and prescriptive rather than punitive . Consequences are intended to help students reflect on the infraction and determine how t o make more acceptable choices in the future (Purkey & Strahan, 2002). 105 CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY The identified problem this study considered was that students who perceive they do not enjoy a positive and supportive relationship with their teacher tend to struggle academically and behaviorally in school. It was the intent through this re search to explore and understand how teachers perceive the relationships between teachers and stude nts affect student behavior and academic performance in a 400-500 student small town elementar y school serving preschool through fifth grades. Preliminary Research Questions The purpose of this study was to explore the power of teacher-student relationships and teacher perceptions of how these relationships influence student learning and affect behavior. Accordingly, the specific questions posed were: 1. What teacher and student behaviors do teachers perceive contribute most directly to developing and maintaining positive and supportive teacher-student relationships? 2. To what extent do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence the academic and behavioral success of students in their classrooms? 3. How do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence their st udents' future academic and behavioral success? 4. How do teachers perceive school culture affects student behavior and academic performance and achievement? 106 Rationale for Qualitative Research An ethnomethodological exploratory descriptive case study supported through the lenses of narratology and portraiture was conducted to examine the relationships between students and teachers and the affect of those relationships on academic success and social behavior. These qualitative procedures served to address the complexities and associ ated methodological issues that arose in this study of human experiences and outcomes . Substantial documentation supported several methods associated with qualitative research investigations as useful in studying complex systems and human exper iences in the context of natural environments (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). According to McEnery and Wilson (1996), quantitative researchers \"classify features, count them, and even co nstruct more complex statistical models in an attempt to explain what is observed\" (p. 76). A nfara, Brown, and Mangione (2002) suggest qualitative methodology makes data analyses more ex plicit and promotes \"openness on the grounds of refutability and freedom from bias\" (p. 28). Findings can be generalized to larger populations and comparisons can be made betwee n similar settings as long as valid and reliable techniques have been used. According ly, quantitative analysis permits the distinction between what happens as a result of a variable acting on something and what occurs merely out of chance. A quantitative study ca n provide the researcher precise information regarding the frequency and rarity of particular occurrence, and the relative normality or abnormality (McEnery & Wilson, 1996). Qualitative data analysis permits researchers to discern, examine, c ompare and contrast, and interpret meaningful patterns or themes. According to Frechtl ing and Sharp- Westat (1997), meaningfulness is determined by the purpose of the research and the re search questions. The main disadvantage of the qualitative approach is that findings cannot be 107 extended to wider populations with the same degree of certainty that quantitative anal yses provides. This is because the findings of the research are not tested to discover whethe r they are statistically significant or due to chance. Yin (1994) argues that the r elative size of the sample is not of concern. The purpose of the research should establish the parameters and should then be applied to the research. Yin (1989) asserts that the results of a stud y are generally applicable depending on the methodology employed and the rigor of the re sulting case study. If a case study meets the three tenets of qualitative inquir y: describing, understanding, and explaining, the results are generally applicable. This study was not concerned about the generalizabilty of complex statist ics across settings, and was only concerned with the deep analysis of a limited number of five general education elementary teachers and how they perceive the relationships they have w ith their students affects their students' academics and behavior. According to Patton (2002), the benefit of qualitative research is to \"facilitate study of issues in depth a nd detail\" (p. 14). McEnery and Wilson (1996) suggest, \"Qualitative analysis allows for fine dis tinctions to be drawn because it is not necessary to shoehorn the data into a finite number of classi fications\" (p. 76). For Patton (2002) \"Thick, rich description provides the foundation for qualitative analysis and reporting. Good description takes the reader into the setting being de scribed\" (p. 437). Thick descriptions provide the information needed to make informed judgments regarding the degree and extent of fit in particular cases (Eisner & Pe shkin, 1990), and captures the thoughts and feelings of participants as well as the often complex web of relationships among them (Ponterotto, 2006). According to Schwandt (2001), \"to thickly describe social action is actually to begin to interpret it by recording the c ircumstances, meanings, intentions, strategies, motivations, and so on that characterize a part icular episode\" 108 (p. 255). Using thickly described analysis of interviews, observations, and partici pant journals to reveal the intricacies of teacher-student relationships served we ll to inform this study because, just as Patton suggests, \"stories and narratives offer espe cially translucent windows into cultural and social meanings\" (p. 116). While it would certainly be nice to discover the magic cure that will allow all students to enjoy successful, suppor tive, and positive relationships with their teachers, the goal was to investigate t he nuances of five select successful teachers and learn how these teachers facilitate and nur ture these relationships. As a rich, in-depth, intensive description is required to begin to speculat e on the multiple dimensions of teacher-student relationships, a qualitative desig n best served that need. According to Patton (2002), \" Inductive analysis involves discovering patterns, themes, and categories in one's data. Findings emerge out of the data, through the analyst's interactions with the data, in contrast with deductive analysis where the data are analyzed according to an existing framework\" (p. 453). Quantitative research is deduct ive and qualitative research is inductive. Deductive reasoning works from general to specific. Sometimes this is referred to as a \"top-down\" approach. A researcher beg ins by developing a theory about a topic of interest that is then narrowed down into specific hypotheses t hat can be tested. The researcher is ultimately able to test the hypotheses wi th specific data to confirm or disconfirm the original theory. Inductive reasoning moves the rese archer from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories. This is sometimes referred to as a \"bottom up\" approach. In qualitative inductive reasoning, the researcher beg ins with specific observations and measures, and works to detect patterns and regularit ies through coding (Trochim, 2006). 109 Quantitative research can be very cold and quantitative researchers may d estroy valuable data while imposing their worlds on those being studied. A questionnaire, for instance, can influence the findings and become itself an artifact of the rese arch. Participants can suppose they know what the research is about and try to respond accordingly in either a positive or negative fashion, in either a thoughtful or haphazard way, or in complete or sketchy responses. In quantitative research, the researcher is ideally a n objective observer that neither participates in nor influences what is being studied. According to Mars hall and Rossman (1980), a researcher cannot understand human behavior without first understanding the setting in which the participants interact. Participants may not alway s know or understand their feelings, interactions, and behaviors, so they cannot respond fully and informa tively to a questionnaire. This is where a qualitative researcher can assist the part icipant through dialogue in providing a constructive reply. In qualitative research it is belie ved much more can be learned about a case under study when the researcher participates in or is immersed in the setting to discover categories, dimensions and interrelationships (\"Princ iples supporting qualitative research,\" n.d.). A qualitative design best served the goals of this study as I was a fully immersed participant in the environment before, during, and after the stud y. Theoretical Traditions Specific theoretical traditions were selected to inform this study that assisted in investigating and analyzing the intricacies that exist in the dynamic s of teacher-student relationships. According to Lincoln and Guba (1985), the qualitative researcher oper ates in the unique position of a \"human-as-instrument,\" whose function is to recognize the socia l constructs discovered through data collection processes that are unobtrusive, non-contr olling, and non-manipulative. The only research instrument with the flexibility to capture t he 110 subtleties, complexities, and fluidity of the human experience is a person\u2014a huma n-as- instrument. This human being possesses skills, knowledge, experiences, background, and certain biases and this person is the primary collector and analyzer of data. Thi s collection of data is generally accomplished through observations, interviews, and analysis of doc uments and archival forms of data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Patton, 1990; Taylor & Bogdan, 1984). As a responsive, adaptive, and holistic researcher with the immediate ability to summarize and clarify, the human instrument can investigate unique observations with deeper ins ight then any quantitative instrument designed for a similar study. These mechani sms provide the basis for a holistic, inductive analysis that involves unitizing and categorizing pro cesses from which patterns and themes are discovered during the process of investigati on. The theoretical traditions employed in this research are case study, ethnomethodology, narratol ogy and portraiture. Case Study. According to Patton (2002): The case study approach to qualitative analysis constitutes a specific wa y of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data; in that sense it represents an a nalysis process . The purpose is to gather comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth information about each case of interest. (p. 447) For Stake (1995), \"A case study is expected to catch the complexity of a single case [and] is the study of the particularity and complexity of a single case, coming to un derstand its activity within important circumstances\" (p. xi). Stake (2000) emphasizes that the term case study \"draws attention to the question of what specifically can be learned from the si ngle case\" (p. 435 ). A case study, sometimes called a \"monograph\" , is the exploration of an event, process, person, organization unit or object (Routio, 2007). According to Benbasat, 111 Goldstein, and Mead (1987), \"A case study examines a phenomenon in its natural setting , employing multiple methods of data collection to gather information from one or a fe w entities (people, groups, or organizations)\" (p. 370). Yin (1994), suggests a case st udy approach is often the primary design of a qualitative investigation and provides a de tailed, in depth examination of a person, group, or settings and holds explanatory evidence relate d to the \"how,\" \"why,\" and \"what\" aspects of the questions that served as the impetus to the study. The case study design was appropriate for several reasons. Instead of attempting to explain teacher-student relationships by controlling variables, this study instead strove to understand the diverse characteristics and beliefs of five teachers as the y relate with students in natural settings. According to Feagin, Orum, and Sjoberg (1991), \"The quintessential characteris tic of case studies is that they strive towards a holistic understanding of cultural s ystems of action\" (p. 152). Feagin, Orum, and Sjoberg (1991) further define \"cultural systems of action \" as \"sets of interrelated activities and routines engaged in by one of more networks of actors within a social context that is bounded by time and space\" (p. 152). As case studies a re ideal for understanding the intricacies of a single unit of analysis within a bounded syst em (Stake, 1995; Yin 1994), in this case the teachers were the units of analysis and the classr ooms and school constructed the bounded system. The case study provides for flexibility per mitting the researcher to investigate the empirical events of the case under study wit h minimal to no impact on the holistic characteristics of the setting (Yin, 1984). Zonabend (1992) su ggests that case studies should be done in a way that incorporates the views of the \"actors\" in the case under study. This was the intent of seeking the teachers' views and per ceptions in this study. 112 Two purposes for using a case study approach identified by both Lincoln and Guba (1985) and Patton (1990) include: (a) increasing the reader's understanding of the phenomena being studied, and (b) revealing the aspects and characteristics t hat promote a construction of themes. Another benefit of case study research is its personal c onstruct. Case study results can lend to natural generalizations, or \"conclusions arrived at through personal engagement in life's affairs or by vicarious experiments so well constructe d that the person feels as if it happened to themselves\" (Stake, 1995, p. 85). Where quantitative resear ch permits statistical generalizations, the specificity and in-depth nature of case studies provide intimate and immediate results. A reader can connect personally and identif y characteristics of others known to the reader compared to the individual featured in the case study. Yin (1994) suggests case studies can be exploratory, explanatory, and descriptive. There is no exclusivity between the three case study types and while each serves a specific purpose the types can be combined. An exploratory case study is preliminary res earch that looks for patterns in the data and is often conducted prior to other social research. Exploratory case studies typically attempt to define the research questi on and form hypotheses. Data collection occurs before theories or specific researc h questions are formulated. Descriptive research design is more rigid and goes beyond explorator y research and attempts to describe characteristics of a phenomenon. While exploratory c ase study data collection is conducted prior to the formulation of theory and research questions, descr iptive case studies depend on a theory and specific questions to guide data collection. The the ory must cover the scope of the case under study. Explanatory case studies are appropri ate when a field of research has matured. Explanatory case studies attempt to explain c ourses of events and how those events occurred. While the field of research around teacher-students 113 relationships is fairly established, it is far from mature and there are m any gaps. Because existing literature about teacher perceptions regarding how their relati onships with students affect their learning and behavior was scarce, I chose to conduct an explorator y descriptive case study and chronicle the complexities of five general education element ary school teachers as they interacted with and related with their students in an effort to understand the perceptions of those teachers and how those teachers see the relationships they h ave with their students affecting student learning and behavior. Ethnomethodology. According to Patton (2002), ethnomethodology is a study of the ordinary methods of how people do things. The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (Blackburn, 1994) defines ethnomethodology as \"the study of common social knowledge, in particula r as it concerns the understanding of others and the varieties of circumstance in which i t can take place\" (p. 126). For Giddens (2006), \"Ethnomethodology is the study of how people make sense of what others say and do in the course of day-to-day social interaction\" (p. 1). Ethnomethodology gets at the norms, understandings and assumptions that are taken for granted by people in a setting because they are so deeply understood that people don't eve n think about why they do what they do (Patton, 2002). Silverman (1993) suggests, \"Ethnomethodology attempts ethno ) ) for organizing world. It locates these methods and the skills ('artful practice s') through which people come to develop an understanding of each other and of social situations\" (p. 60). The goal of ethnomethodology is to observe naturally occurring events through the exploration of the inner dynamics in order to comprehend the routines of a culture under study. To accomplish this goal, ethnomethodologists conduct deep interviews and partici pant 114 observations (Patton, 2002). Ethnomethodologists look on everyday interactions, and the practices involved in them, as having a regularity or stability so they form wha t sociologists refer to as institutions and structures. These are always actively produced thr ough interaction among social actors, but not necessarily in a conscious or meaningful manner. The ethnomethodological perspective emphasizes a social interaction that has a ra tionality of its own (Gingrich, 2003). Ethnomethodology is purported in the literature to be a very good method for seeing how individuals make sense of the social world for themselves. Accordingly, this tradition permitted me to explore fully the relationship d ynamics of teachers and their students. As a school principal, I am a frequent formal and informal visitor to all classr ooms and have unique access to conduct a case study that will permit me to observe the teac her's natural classroom setting with little interruption. Accordingly, I enjoy what Levine (1981) defines as \"privileged access\" of \"sufficient intensity and duration\" ess ential to a descriptive case study (pp. 173-174). As principal I am intimately familiar with multifa ceted context of the school which nearly eliminates the possibility that I will be an 'outsider ' who would misinterpret observed events and my contextual attendance would not be contrived. As a result, prior to beginning this study I had already informally conducted what C orsaro (1980) defines as a \"prior ethnography\" and considers a required step for case study research. As I interacted with each teacher multiple times weekly in my role as princ ipal, I had numerous opportunities to record detailed single case study type observations. While my pos ition as a principal is one of authority and separated me from these teachers, my regular pos itive relationship with each of them permitted unique opportunities for me to write detail ed and personal case studies of each teacher's relationships with his or her students. 115 For Lincoln and Guba (1985), reality is complex and uncertain, is relational rather than of linear cause, and is more perspective than objective. Concerning objecti vity, Schwartz and Ogilvy (1979) suggest \"perspective\" is a more relevant concept: Perspective connotes a view at a distance from a particular focus. Where we l ook from affects what we see. This means that any one focus of observation gives only a partial result; no single discipline ever gives us a complete picture. A whole pi cture is an image created morphogenetically from multiple perspectives. (p. 15) Rather than seeking an objective truth, the intent was to examine the percept ions and beliefs of five teachers' relational experiences with their students and how those ex periences affect student achievement and behavior. Narratology. According to Patton (2002), narratology strives to \"understanding lived experience and perceptions of experience\" (p. 115), focusing specifically on the interpretation of \"stories, life history narratives, historical memoirs, a nd creative nonfiction to reveal cultural and social patterns through the lens of individual experiences\" (p. 478 ). Stories are at the heart of narratology. Determining how best to interpret such stories is the challenge for the narratologist (Patton, 2002). Narrative is a form for inquiry that can contain both the environment and the relations within that environment and those relationships become the focus of attention (Eisner & Peshkin, 1990). Narratology is the theory of t he structures of narrative and accordingly examines the ways that narrati ves structure our perception of both cultural artifacts and the surrounding world. The study of narrati ve is particularly important since our ordering of time and space in narrative form s constitutes one of the primary ways we construct meaning in general (Felluga, 2003a). The narra tologist 116 dissects the narrative into component parts and then attempts to determine functions and relationships (Manfred, 2005). A major benefit of narratology is that narratives are rich in detail derived fr om human relationships and a rich, in-depth, intensive description is required to begin to speculate on the multiple dimensions of teacher-student relationships (Benham, 1997). Consi dering this richness, narratology provides an opportunity to really get into \"thick descriptions\" of the cases under study (Geertz, 1973). According to Holloway (1997): Thick description builds up a clear picture of the individuals and groups in the context of their culture and the setting in which they live... Thick description can be contrasted with thin description, which is a superficial account and does not explore the underlying meanings of cultural members. (p. 154) Rosembaum and Silber (2001) assert a thick description of human events and behavior faithfully retains the meanings which that behavior has for the people involved and enta ils a detailed, perhaps narrative, account of a case under study. Portraiture. Similar to narratology, Lawrence-Lightfoot and Davis (1997) propose that portraiture \"blurs the boundaries of aesthetics and empiricism in an effor t to capture the complexity, dynamics, and subtlety of human experience and organizational life\" ( p. xv). Portraiture is a way of recording people. Their personality, character, st atus, the place and time they lived, the environment in which they live, are all under study (\"Portrait ure\", 2007). Portraiture is a creative qualitative approach to engaging in research of groups in action and in telling the stories of individuals in life and the intent is to capture the \"ess ence\" of the subject (English, 2000). According to Lawrence-Lightfoot and Davis, (1997) \"Portr aitists seek to record and interpret the perspectives and experience of the people they are s tudying, 117 documenting their voices and their visions\u2014their authority, knowledge, and wisdom\" (p. xv). Portraiture narrative analysis is loaded with visual elements to crea te a thick description. The portraiture composition uses stories and knowledge to create a clear vision (\" In the company of others,\" n.d.). As the goal of portraiture is to investigate fully and il lustrate those being studied, this technique was useful in creating portraits of five elementar y classroom teachers and in telling their stories. As part of the data collection protoc ol, the five teacher participants were asked to journal around the issues connected with their relat ionships with their students. The data from these journals helped develop rich and detailed portrai ts and narratives to tell these teachers' stories. Design of the Study Setting. The site for this research was a middle-SES predominantly Caucasian preschool through fifth grade elementary school consisting of 498 students in a small tow n approximately 45 miles from a large Midwestern metropolitan area. The school is located on a district campus and is self standing but sharing a property with a district off ice and a joined middle school/high school building. The original building was opened in the late 1950s and followed with additions in 1990, 2000 and the recent addition of a preschool center which replaced existing modular classrooms in 2010. In the 2009-2010 school term, there were 24 general classroom teachers with four sections of four teachers, two secti ons of three teachers, and one section of two teachers. There were four special education teachers, thre e Title I teachers, a full time counselor, a full time nurse, and a shared district social w orker. A principal and an instructional coach supported teaching and learning. The site had sev en special education paraprofessionals, two cafeteria-recess supervisors, one secretary, one 118 health clerk, and one computer lab manager. The school had full time art, music, and physical education teachers and a full time library media specialist. According to the 2008-09 School Accountability Report Card filed with the state department of education, there were 471 full time students enrolled in Kindergarte n through fifth grades and 27 half day Preschool students. Full time students included 78 in Kindergarten, 88 in first grade, 63 in second grade, 90 in third grade, 76 in 4 th grade, and 76 in fifth grade (see Appendix A). From 2004 through 2009, building enrollment has ranged from a low of 469 in the 2006-2007 school year to 498 in the 2008-2009 school year (see Appendix B). In that same period, the percentage of students eligible for free or r educed- priced lunch ranged from 46 in the 2004-2005 school year to 51.4 in the 2009-2010 school year (see Appendix C). The racial and ethnic diversity in the 2008-2009 school year consisted of 88.3% Caucasian, 8.9% African American, 1.7% Hispanic, and 1.0% Other. Since the 2004-2005 school year there has been a 9.1% increase in African America n students and a 4.3% increase in Hispanic students and a similar decline of 12.7% in the enrollment of Caucasian students (see Appendix D). From 2004 through 2010, daily average attendance has exceeded 95% (see Appendix E). Site Access. Gaining access to this site was directly accomplished as I served as the building principal and enjoyed the permission and encouragement of the district superintendent. In order to generate informative case studies, this ethnomethodol ogical exploratory descriptive case study began with with an overview of teacher e valuations in search of records that indicated positive teacher-student interactions. Spec ifically, teachers were sought who had been recognized for positive teacher-student relationshi ps according to the district professional performance evaluation instrument. A letter w as generated for the 119 teachers I wished to study. In this letter the steps were specified t hat would be taken to ensure confidentiality. Also, because according to Lofland and Lofland, (1984), qualitat ive researchers ask participants to grant \"access to their lives, their minds, [ and] their emotions,\" straightforward descriptions of the goals of this research were provided ( p. 25). The teacher participants were referred to as Participant 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 any specific descri ptions that might identify them as individuals were avoided. A locked data physical artif act storage system was maintained that only I had access to and a password protected comput er storage system was used to store all electronic data. Data Collection. Yin (1994) suggests case studies may be significant if they are unusual and are of general public interest. Other theorists suggest a case is s uitable for study if the case is typical and permits naturalistic generalizations (Lincol n & Guba, 1985; Stake, 1995). The teachers in this study were \"unique as well as common\" (Stake, 1995). T he teachers studied were unique in that they had all been rated superior in their profess ional evaluations in the area of student relationships. These teachers were also common a s they taught students in general education elementary grade classrooms. Participant Selection. Selection of the participants was accomplished using purposive criterion-based sampling procedures to identify teachers who were unique in that they were recognized for positive teacher-student relationships according to the distric t professional performance evaluation instrument. These teachers were typical as they we re all female and Caucasian. Of the 20 regular education classrooms (four fewer than in the 2009-2010 school year) in the school, 19 teachers were Caucasian females. Three of the five stud y participants were in their first five years of teaching and two were tenured vetera n teachers. Four were 120 married and two had personal children. Each taught a different grade between Kinde rgarten and grade five. Patton (1990) describes criterion sampling as selecting participants that me et criteria specific to the phenomenon of interest. According to Fraenkel and Wallen (2003), researchers use purposeful sampling when they believe a specific sample wil l yield needed data. Maxwell (2005) suggests the reason for making purposeful criterion-base d selections is to examine selective cases critical to the goals of the research study and that purposeful criterion-based sampling \"is a strategy in which particular settings , persons, or activities are selected deliberately in order to provide information that can't be gotten as well from other choices\" (p. 88). For Patton (2002), purposeful cases \"are selected because they ar e \"information rich\" and illuminative, that is, they offer useful manifestations of the phenomenon of interest\" (p. 40). Patton (2002) further asserts: The logic and power of purposeful sampling lie in selecting information-rich cases for study in depth. Information-rich cases are those from which one can learn a gr eat deal about issues of central importance to the purpose of the inquiry. (p. 230) Rubin and Rubin (1995) assert a case to be studied must be purposefully sampled based on its ability to provide completeness. Similarly, Patton (2002) avows purposeful sampling is justified and necessary when logic and power result from the powe r generated from the sample. Purposive sampling procedures were used when determining whic h teachers to study. While Bassey, (1999) warns case studies allow for \"fuzzy generalizations\" (p. 17), data was collected that permitted the comparison of five teachers' rel ationship experiences and perceptions of the affect of those relationship experiences to t heories of how teacher-student relationships affect students academically and behaviora lly. Since only a 121 small sampling of five teachers was compared to ideas rather than to a lar ger population of other teachers, purposive sampling served these objectives. In this inquiry, the selection was made based on document analysis of teacher personnel files and personal observation. An informed consent letter outlining the purpose of the study, procedures, risks, benefits, information to be collected, refusal to sig n and authorization, and canceling consent and authorization was developed and provided to each proposed interviewee. Information as also provided regarding the process of the interviews and any questions from the interviewees about the process were addressed prior to be ginning each interview. Role of the Researcher. The role of the researcher is critical to the inquiry process in qualitative research that seeks to understand and portray natural settings and e vents. Accordingly, the researcher is the key instrument of data collection and the char acteristics or attributes of the researcher are relevant in establishing the trustworthine ss of the inquiry (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Patton, 1990). While I had completed graduate coursework in qualitative inquiry, I was and still consider myself to be a novice in using qualit ative methodology. I did have expertise in the field of elementary education and a profound des ire to understand and honestly represent the affect of teacher-student interactions central to this inquiry. Additionally, I had important foundational contextual knowledge regarding the setting for this inquiry through my direct involvement in the setting. Specifically , I served as principal of the elementary school central to the study and was accordingly an a dministrator in the public school system where the students and teachers participated. The nature of my participation as the researcher in that setting significantly enhanced m y ability to collect and interpret data for this inquiry. 122 Data Production . Data was collected through observations, interviews, and participant journals. Patton (2002) suggests, \"By using a combination of observations, interviewing, and document analysis, the fieldworker is able to use different data sources to validate and cross-check findings\" (p. 244). Combining data sources to validate and cross - check findings triangulates the data and increases validity as the stren gths of one approach can compensate for the potential weaknesses of another (Silverman, 1993; Maxwel l, 2005). Research was collected over an eight week period by systematically obse rving and interviewing these teachers regarding their interactions and perceptions of their relationships with their students from late November 2010 through early February 2011. Additionally, these teachers kept journals around the issues of their relationships with their s tudents. Interviews . According to Maxwell (2005), \"interviews can provide additional information that was missed in observation, and can be used to check the accuracy of the observation\" (p. 94). Accordingly, interviews provide a source for data triangulat ion and add validity (Silverman, 1993; Maxwell, 2005; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Interviewing is an efficient and valid method of capturing and understanding someone's unique perspective and delving deeply into the phenomenon under study. Patton (2002) states, \"We interview people to find out from them those things we cannot directly observe... We cannot observe feelin gs, thoughts, and intentions. We cannot observe the behaviors that took place at some previous point in time\" (pp. 340-341). According to Lofland and Lofland (1995), an in-depth interview does not follow a rigid form in order to provide for free and open responses and is designed to elicit rich, detailed information that can be analyzed. The goal of most qualitative studies is to gather an authentic understanding of experiences and open-ended interview questions seem to produce the best results tow ard this 123 goal. Patton (2002) suggests the purpose of asking open-ended interview questions is to gather and comprehend the perspectives of other people without influencing the respons es through pre-selected questions. For Fraenkel and Wallen (2000), the value in the open-ende d question is the individuality of the obtained responses. According to Silverman (1993), in a typical open-ended interview, interviewees are asked to give their own defi nitions of particular activities. The most open-ended interview approach is the informal conve rsational interview or unstructured interview (Patton, 2002). The purpose of this conversation type interview is to let the interview wander with complete flexibility permi tting most of the questions to develop in the context of the conversation. Unstructured does not mean unfocused, however, and while the goal is to go with the flow, the interviewer is still asking the questions and can subtly redirect if the dialog wanders into obviously irrelevant territory. Clearly, data gathered in such informal unstructured conversational intervie ws will be different for each interview and will have to be coded. Silverman (1993) suggests a potential concern with unstructured interviews is that while they are flexible and can provide for a more intense study of perceptions and feelings, their results often lack comparison to other open-ended interviews and the analysi s is more difficult and time consuming than structured interviews. On the opposite pole from the unstructured open-ended interview approach is the standardized interview approach whic h requires careful preparation of each question prior to the interview (Patton, 2002). The reason for this attention to detail is to make certain that each interviewee is asked the exact same questions in the exact same way. A combination of the informal conversational inter view and the standardized structured interview where a set of specifically worde d questions are asked and responded to in the beginning and then the interviewer is free to explore other areas of 124 interest at the end is highly effective. According to Patton (1990), the key to a good inte rview is good questioning and listening and the interviewer refraining from offering opinions , perceptions, or feelings. These interview methods and used semi-structured open-ended in-depth interviews (Saunders, Thornhill, & Lewis, 2007) were combined to make certain specific questions were covered to inform the study while providing for the thickest possible descriptions. Each interview began with semi-structured, focused, and open-ended questions to form an init ial understanding of the teacher's perspectives on the importance of relationships bet ween the teacher and students (Merton, Fiske, & Kendall, 1990; Rubin & Rubin, 1995). Although each interview began with a pre-determined set of questions, the design of each intervi ew, as recommended by Rubin and Rubin (1995), remained flexible, iterative, and continuous. In what Schutt (2004) refers to as progressive focusing, interview questions may be modi fied or additional questions developed to investigate emerging findings. Rubin and Rubin (1995) assert it is important that \"design remains flexible throughout the study beca use you have to work out questions to examine new ideas and themes that emerge during the interviews\" (p. 45). Following a semi-structured open-ended in-depth interview process permitte d the interviewee and me as researcher the opportunities to expand and clarify duri ng the interview session. As cautioned by deMaris (2004), care was taken to avoid questions and question stems that could generate rationalizations, causal explanations, or evaluat ions. Questions were designed to invite sharing of specific examples and feelings. When que stioning resulted in rationalizations, causal explanations, or evaluations, follow-up questions were as ked to 125 redirect toward specificity. Asking follow-up questions permitted thic ker description and a more complete portrait of each participant. Threats to validity and reliability were addressed by following a stand ardized interview protocol throughout. As Patton (2002) recommends, an interview guide was prepared with a list of questions to be explored and suggested probes for follow up when responses invited further examination. In this way, although the guide assured tha t same general information was gathered from each participant, I was able to, as Hoepfl (1997) suggests, remain \"free to probe and explore within these predetermined inquir y areas\" (p. 1). Using an interview guide helped to keep interviews focused and provided some skeletal structure. While each participant was offered the opportunity to meet at a convenient site of their choosing for the interviews, each participant elected to conduct his or he r interview in my office. After each interview was recorded, it was transcribed and prov ided to the interviewee to be reviewed for accuracy and revision if necessary. After the accuracy was checked, the completed transcripts were coded. Research Questions and Initial Interview Questions. 1.

Lincoln and Guba (1985) define documents as written or recorded material not prepared for the evaluative purposes. The value of documents is the window they provide for examining a setting or group of people that cannot be adequately or a t all observed or noted in another way (Tellis, 1997). Guba and Lincoln (1981) suggest documents can be either public or private. Public documents are created for account ability purposes and can be collected from internal or external sources. External records such as newspaper archives, business reports and government documents can help a researc her understand participants and compare persons or groups. Internal documents include such artifacts as student transcripts, mission statements, grade cards, stand ardized test reports, and policy manuals. Internal records help researchers understand personal and gr oup characteristics and assist in identifying strengths and concerns. Pers onal documents are first- person accounts and include diaries, portfolios, photographs, artwork, schedules, and much more. These documents can help the researcher understand how people view the world and what they want to communicate. Fetterman (1989) suggests attaining information f rom documents is the least intrusive data collection method and requires relatively m inimal cooperation from those within the setting. Each study participant was asked to keep participant journals around specific pr ompts to generate written documentation of their perceptions of how they relate w ith students and how those relationships affect student learning and behavior. These journals were c oded line by line using the code book established, used, and refined during the interview transcr iption. 128 Journal Prompts. 1.

According to Hoepfl (1997), the observation of participants in the context of a natural setting is the classic form of data collection in qualita tive field research. Observations are important because they provide opportunities to learn things the part icipants may not even be aware of or may be unwilling or unable to discuss in an interview. Conducting observations leads to deeper understanding than interviews alone, because observations permit windows through which the observer can study participants inter acting in the natural setting. Maxwell (2005) suggests observations allow the researche r a direct and insightful way to learn about behavior and the context in which the behavior occurs. Silverman (1993) contends the purpose of any observational study is to gather first-hand information about the \"social processes in a 'naturally occurring' context\" (p. 11). Patton (2002) adds: The first-order purposes of observational data are to describe the setting that was observed, the activities that took place in that setting, the people who participated i n those activities, and the meanings of what was observed from the perspective of t hose observed. (p. 262) According to Hoepfl (1997), field research notes are \"are running descriptions of settings, people, activities, and sounds\" (p. 1). Lofland (1971) suggests \"the fundament al concrete task of the observer is the taking of field notes. ...this task is perhaps the mos t important determinant of later bringing off a qualitative analysis. Field not es provide the 130 observer's raison d'\u00eatre . If [the observer] is not doing them, [the observer] might as well not be in the setting\" (p. 102). Patton (2002) maintains field notes must contain a description of everything that has been observed and nothing should be omitted with the hope for later recall. Field notes should be dated and should include the setting, the participants, socia l interactions, and activities observed. Silverman (1993) insists when talking field note s, it is critical to record descriptions rather than impressions. Patton (2002) specifica lly states a researcher's field notes \"should include the exact language used by partici pants to communicate the flavor and meaning of \"native\" program language\" (p. 289). Spradley (1979) recommends researchers take four types of field notes: short notes made at the time of the field session; expanded notes made soon after each observation; a fieldwork journal to record problems and ideas that present during the fieldwork; and a provisional running re cord of analysis and interpretation. As observations were conducted, concrete instanc es were recorded by capturing direct quotations and noting unembellished descriptions of intera ctions between the teachers and their students. Observations usually are guided by a structured protocol which helps assure that observer is gathering important information that will inform the study. Acc ording to Mahoney (1997), the protocol should prompt the observer to describe the setting, identify the participants, describe the activity, document interactions between participa nts, and be alert to unanticipated events that might require refocusing one or more evaluation questions . In order to understand fully the complexities of cultural situations and take the reader i nto the observed setting, the best method to capture data that can provide great depth and detail t o illustrate what happened and how it happened may be direct participation in and observati on of the phenomenon under study (Patton, 2002). Field notes were taken during classroom 131 observations and during other opportunities such as in the hallways and at recesses where these teachers interact with students. I strove to capture and record thick des cription as I observed the interactions that comprise the relationships between teachers and s tudents. Most field notes were typed the day of or the day after the observation but in all cas es the notes were formalized within a week of the observed interaction. These observati on notes were coded line by line using the code book established, used, and refined during the interview and journal coding. Data Analysis Qualitative analysis typically considers individual cases and multiple case s (Patton, 2002). This study involved analyzing the data from five teacher participants g enerating five unique case study reports following qualitative data analysis procedural steps a nd processes. A cross-case analysis was conducted examining the data from each participant and comparing to the other participant data for common themes (Merriam, 1998; Yin, 2003). Participant journals were examined using the narrative analysis process. Fo r White (1989), the narrative permits the transformation of knowing into telling. According to C asey (1995), researchers who employ narrative analysis carry believe meaning is made through the telling of stories. By telling their stories people \"put shards of experience toget her, to construct identity, community, and tradition... \" (p. 216). Riessman (1993) suggests storytelling is a collaborative process with a teller who has something to share and a listener whos e role is to gather and emphasize. Polkinghorne (1995) suggests that narrative analysts re flect on study data and construct the data elements into an account of the story teller's experi ence. Narrative analysis permits the researcher to consider the context as we ll as the content of the story. Narrative analysis seeks to understand why a storyteller told a stor y is such a manner. 132 Why the story was told and how it was told is critical to making meaning of the stor y elements. Participant observations and interviews were analyzed by emplo ying a generic coding procedure. The constant comparative method (CCM) was employed to analyze the data generated in this study ( Glaser & Strauss, 1968; Miles & Huberman, 1994; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). By comparing events and incidents against themselves and against prior determ ined categories, the qualitative researcher is able to determine themes to de scribe the data. According to Glaser & Strauss (1968), there are f our stages of CCM: (a) comparing incidents applicable to each category; (b) integrating categories and their prope rties; (c) delimiting the theory; and (d) writing the theory. In the first stage data items were c onsidered individually and each item was placed in a category based on similarities to items alre ady in that category. Next, each item was compared to the properties defining the category. Third, cate gories were fine tuned, combined as was reasonable and eliminated when irrelevant to make the numbe r of categories more manageable. Lastly, themes were determined by consi dering the context of each category. By following the constant comparative method, informati on was analyzed throughout the case study by unitizing and categorizing the data. Unitization invol ved reducing the interview transcripts into individual \"units\" of information that re present single ideas or thoughts. During the unitization process, units of data associated with cate gories of information were developed and through a process of organizing and re-organizing t he units of data and categories, a final category scheme was devised that containe d all relevant data collected or reviewed. Coding. The data analysis began by micro-analyzing each data point by grouping words, phrases and events into categories of meaningful units (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). T his 133 permitted the generation of tentative categories that were later revi sed as new themes were discovered. Data collected through interviews, journals, and observations were organize d onto a Microsoft Word table where it could be stored, merged, sorted, analyzed, and coded. I worked to collect data beyond theoretical saturation to where no new data will be discovered that might provide a unique dimension or property. The final themes represented constr ucts associated with factors that affect the educational experiences of t he teacher and his or her relationships with students. Interviews were digitally recorded using an Olympus WS-400S Digital Voice Recorder and were each transcribed verbatim by listening to a phrase and t hen typing that phrase into a word document making note of every syllable, fragment, filler, stut ter, and restart, as well as completed thought. While this was a very tedious process it i nvolved hearing every response multiple times to assure accuracy and helped me to be come very familiar with each interview. Participants were then provided transcripts of their interviews for review and revision if needed to clarify participant positions. Of the five partic ipants, one participant elaborated on most areas when provided the opportunity to revise and a second participant made a few clarifications. The three remaining participant s agreed the transcripts accurately represented their feelings and ideas. The additional data provided by the two participants who edited their transcripts was entered into the word documents and noted a s revision to keep separate from the original interview response but to still provide the opportunity for coding. Through this immersion in the research and data analysis, I was able to hear the voices of these five teachers and understand their perceptions of how their relationships with their students affect the academic and behavioral success of their students while in their classrooms and in the future. 134 Miles and Huberman (1994) discuss descriptive, interpretive and pattern codes. Eac h places more interpretation on the code than the previous one. I began by defining simple descriptive codes which were then developed into interpretative codes and re fined as I became more familiar and knowledgeable of the data discovered in the study. A code book was developed with operationally defined themes based on the conceptual framework and research questions and the interview data was coded by marking excerpts tha t represented similar information with the same short hand code. This coding process was simila rly employed to analyze observation field notes and narrative analysis was used wi th the participant journals. Categories were identified during data analysis. The se categories included: relationship; culture; engagement; classroom management, high quality i nstruction; and feedback. Repeating ideas were grouped under these categories. Once tra nscriptions were complete and participants had the opportunity to review and revise, each inte rview was coded line by line in a Microsoft Word data table. The data was first examined for fit in predetermined categories and new categories were determined as needed. Codes were then assigned within the categories to more precisely and accurately characte rize each specific line of data. In coding line by line it became apparent that \"feedback\" was more accurately a facet of \"high quality instruction\" and data coded as \"engaging\" also fi t within other categories. \"Classroom management\" ideas extended beyond the classroom so t he theme of \"behavior management\" seemed more appropriate. These revisions resulted in f our predominant themes\u2014each with multiple interpretive codes. Limitations. Perhaps the most apparent limitation was the proposed research site. While case studies provide rich descriptions, this single site limited the st udy to a unique community with a fixed set of criteria. This limitation was addressed by a ccessing 135 appropriate related literature and establishing and following a rigid data collection protocol. Another potential limitation was my personal involvement in the setting. I p erformed a key and continuous role in the school and therefore consciously kept myself aware of any biases or influences I may have presented. Further, I consciously considered the pos sibility that the responses and behaviors in the interviews, observations, and participant journals m ay be influenced by the teachers' relationships with me in a deliberate or unintenti onal way. This limitation was addressed through multiple data sources and through the litera ture review to lessen the potential for bias. Many factors affect a child's levels of academic and behavioral succe ss in the classroom. This study only investigated the factors that the teacher can in fluence. Factors\u2014 such as the adopted curriculum, the design of the instructional day, class size, home li fe, extracurricular peer involvement, socioeconomic status, race, culture, gender , and health\u2014 were considered beyond the grasp of the teacher's influence. In terms of making generalizations to a larger population, qualitative researchers do not attempt to generalize, as such, but to specify. This means that any theoretical formulation applies to the speci fic situation or circumstance under study but not to others (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). As this cas e study is designed to meet the three tenets of qualitative inquiry\u2014describing, unde rstanding, and explaining\u2014the results are believed to be generally applicable (Yin, 19 89). To further address the concerns of these limitations, specific measures were taken to a ttend to the validly and reliability of this study. I also worked to ensure that the data was supported through triangulation and endeavored to maintain trustworthiness in conducting, analyzing and presenting this research. 136 Validity . Validity pertains to the congruence of the researcher's claims to the rea lity those claims seek to represent. According to Joppe (2000), \"Validity determ ines whether the research truly measures that which it was intended to measure or how truthful the research results are\" (p. 1). Validity is a concern in case study research due to pote ntial investigator subjectivity. Maxwell (2005) contends validity is relative and must \"be asse ssed in relationship to the purposes and circumstances of the research\" (p. 105). Winter (2000) concurs the concept of validity is not fixed but is \"rather a contingent construct, i nescapably grounded in the processes and intentions of particular research methodologies and projects \" (p. 1). Validity pertains to the congruence of the researcher's claims to the reality those claims seek to represent. For Creswell and Miller (2000), validity is determ ined by the researcher's study design and procedures. Strauss and Corbin (1990), suggest the l iterature can be used to validate case study research finding. Yin (1994) further sugges ts researchers protect for validity by using multiple sources of data, establishing a chain of e vidence, and having drafts of the data reviewed by study subjects for accuracy. Appropriat e literature was referenced to validate the accuracy of the findings. Challenges of validit y were further addressed by taking complete and careful interview and field notes and recording an d reporting the data as completely and accurately as possible. Reliability . Joppe (2000) defines reliability as, \"The extent to which results are consistent over time,\" and suggests \"if the results of a study can be reprodu ced under a similar methodology, then the research instrument is considered to be reliable\" (p. 1) . This definition is fitting for the qualitative domain where the instrument generating the data is consistent. In qualitative research, the researcher acts as a human-as- instrument (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Patton, 2002). Healy and Perry (2000) argue that reliability of a qualitative 137 study should be judged by its design. Kirk and Miller (1986) suggest reliability b e supported by a carefully designing, adhering to, and documenting the research procedure. V alidity and reliability were protected for by properly and thoroughly following case s tudy protocol and appropriate data collection methods. To establish reliability in qualitative research the researcher must establish trustworthiness. Seale (1999), asserts the \"tr ustworthiness of a research report lies at the heart of issues conventionally discussed as validi ty and reliability\" (p. 266). Triangulation can aid in testing and maximizing reliability for a qual itative study. By using a consistent interview protocol, having all participants respond to the sa me journal prompts, and by comparing data from participant interviews, participant journals, f ield observations, and existing literature, every attempt was made to provide for r eliability in this study. Triangulation . Triangulation is a process central to ensuring that the findings of inquiry can be viewed as credible, valid, and reliable (Manning, 1997; Miles & Huberma n, 1994; Silverman, 1993; Patton, 1990). Triangulation is comparing different kinds of data and different methods to see whether they collaborate (Silverman, 1993), and to reduce th e risk of unintentional associations and systematic biases based on limited and restric tive research methods (Maxwell, 2005). Patton (2002) suggests by using a combination of observations, interviewing, and document analysis, the fieldworker is able to use different data sources to validate and cross-check findings. Mathison (1988) feels, \"Triangulation has a risen as an important methodological issue in naturalistic and qualitative approaches to eval uation have demanded attention to controlling bias and establishing valid propositions because tradi tional scientific techniques are incompatible with these alternate epistemolo gies\" (p. 13). 138 Triangulation also serves to reduce the risk of unintentional associations and systematic biases (Maxwell, 2005). Inquiries that employ multiple methodolog ies ensure that different data forms are available as a means of corroboration that give r ise to emergent constructs and themes. Patton (2002) suggests combining observations, interviews, and document analysis permits the researcher to use various data sources to validat e findings. In this study, multiple sources for data collection\u2014interview transcripts, part icipant observation notes, and participant journals\u2014were used to strengthen the validity of the findings , to reduce any known or unknown limitations, and to reduce the possibility that the findings would be affected by any known and unknown biases. Trustworthiness . In both quantitative and qualitative research, rigor is a concern. Research procedures must ensure that credibility, dependability, confirmabi lity, and transferability are demonstrated (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Skrtic, 1985). Accordingly, a ll four components were addressed as the data was analyzed. First, this study nat urally addressed credibility through multiple interviews, frequent observations, and participant journal and other document analysis serving to triangulate the data. The participants were also asked to review the findings and perform member checks\u2014the step Lincoln and Guba (1985) c onsider \"the most crucial technique for establishing credibility\" (p. 314). Each teac her was asked to ascertain the extent to which the results accurately represent him or her. Credibility was established by utilizing the constant comparative method and by intentionally seeking data points to disprove emerging categories and theories. Credibility. Erlandson, Harris, Skipper, and Allen (1993) define credibility as the \"degree of confidence in the 'truth' that the findings of a particular inquiry ha ve for the subject with which\u2014and context within which\u2014the inquiry is carried out\" (p. 29). In this 139 inquiry, credibility was achieved through prolonged engagement, persistent observa tion, triangulation, member checks and peer debriefing (Erlandson et al., 1993; Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Prolonged engagement ensures that sufficient time has been spent by the investi gator in settings of interest and with participants that a rapport and trust has been est ablished. It also enables the researcher to assess the possibility of receiving misi nformation and lessens the possibility of distortions in interpretation (Lincoln & Guba; 1985; Manning, 1997; Rodwell & Byers, 1997). Prolonged engagement was achieved as I, as the res earcher, served as principal of the elementary school that employed the teachers whose intera ctions with students served as the focus of this inquiry. Accordingly, ongoing opportunities were available to observe and participate in inclusive elementary school experienc es and to interact with the teachers and the students associated with each teacher. Persistent observation allows the inquirer to examine in depth and overtime the scope of the data as it is acquired and interpreted (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Prolonged engagement and persistent observation are therefore integrally related processes . Persistent observation allows the most relevant characteristics and elements of a case study s etting to be discovered. In this investigation, multiple interviews were conducted to inquire about the school experiences of the participating teachers to generate an understanding of the m otivations and events that ultimately influence the nature of interactions with students. The r eview of multiple journal entries associated with the participating teachers provided an in depth view of relationships with students over time. Further, I engaged in ongoing reflecti on and dialogue about the interactions and relationships with students with the teachers in m y role as principal of the elementary school where the teachers are employed and the stude nts are enrolled. 140 Lincoln & Guba (1995) describe peer debriefing as \"a process of exposing ones elf to a disinterested peer in a manner paralleling an analytical session and for t he purpose of exploring aspects of the inquiry that might otherwise remain only implicit wit hin the inquirer's mind\" (p. 308). A peer debriefer is an outside party who engages in discussions and who poses questions that may help the researcher: (a) become aware of biase s, perspectives and assumptions, (b) heighten sensitivity to their posture toward data a nd analysis test, and (c) defend emergent hypotheses (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Schutt ( 2001) suggests this process is the employment of a \"devil's advocate.\" In this st udy, a doctoral candidate in the field of education studying through a different university was enga ged as a peer debriefer to review the data in an effort to reduce bias and strengthen va lidity, which might have potentially been influenced by my strong feelings regarding the posi tive treatment of students by teachers in my role as principal. This individual had pr ior direct classroom experience with elementary students and a record of research an d project work relative to teacher-student relationships. This debriefer reviewed the transcripts of the interviews, the participant journal entries, and the observation field notes and consi dered the coding and themes assigned to the data. The peer debriefer agreed with the identifi ed themes and made several recommendations for rewording to clarify or strengthen def initions. Interactions with this peer debriefer occurred through all phases of this inquir y. Narrative accuracy checks are a subtype of a process called member che cking and were employed in this study. Lincoln and Guba (1985) suggest that narrative checking is the most critical procedure for establishing credibility This process involves as king the individuals who participate in the interview to review a written transcription of t heir interviews and to confirm that the transcript content accurately represents w hat they said, and 141 also depicts what they meant to say. Interviewees are requested to make desi red deletions, changes, or additions either directly on the transcript or in a direct conversati on with the researcher. Accordingly, while an interviewee may find the content of the i nterview to be accurate, he or she may feel that his or her own words did not convey the meaning intende d and can further explain or expand the response. Narrative accuracy checks were used for all interviews conducted in this study. Dependability. According to Erlandson et al. (1993), a study is dependable if, when \"replicated with the same or similar respondents (subjects) in the same (or s imilar) context, its findings would be repeated\" (p. 33). Lincoln and Guba (1985) suggest dependability is sometimes assessed through an audit of a study that employs ethnographic proce dures. Erlandson et al. (1993) call this a \"dependability audit\" which involves an accounting of the research process through research logs. An auditor confirms that the assert ions and quotations in the case study report can be directly traced back to original, raw dat a. The auditor also reviews the researcher's journal reflections and/or methodologica l log to confirm the appropriateness of the study design and procedures. The same peer debriefe r was enlisted to perform a dependability audit on the research process (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Confirmability. Erlandson et al. (1993) define confirmability as \"the degree to which its findings are the product of the focus of its inquiry and not of the biases of the res earcher\" (p. 34). As with dependability, Lincoln and Guba (1985) suggest the confirmability of a study can be assessed through an ethnographic audit where interpretations and c onclusions are evaluated. Erlandson et al. (1993) call this a \"confirmability audit.\" A st udy is confirmable if facts and conclusions can be traced to their sources and the findi ngs follow a logical path. To address comfirmability and dependability, an audit trail for t his investigation 142 was created to ensure that an audit can be conducted. The peer debriefer performed an inquiry audit on the data and findings to examine the process and the product of the resea rch and performed a content analysis of the field notes, interview transcript s, and document analysis (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Holsti (1969) describes content analysis as, \" any technique for making inferences by objectively and systematically identifying s pecified characteristics of messages\" (p. 14). Representative data was selected to serve as wh at Rex (2001) refers to as \"telling cases\" (p. 295) and that, as Mitchell (1984) describes, will \" show how general regularities exist precisely when specific contextual circumstanc es are taken account of\" (p. 239). These were specific and revealing yet typical examples of teacher -student relationships and interactions between the teacher and his or her students. A peer debriefer w as enlisted to perform and inquiry audit on the analyzed data and conclusions. This debriefer perform ed an analysis of the content of all interview transcripts, participant journals, and observation notes. To further provide for comfirmability representative data was selecte d to serve as \"telling cases\" that were specific, revealing, and typical examples of teacher -student relationships and interactions. Transferability. Transferability is defined by Erlandson et al. (1993) as \"the extent to which its findings can be applied in other contexts or with other respondents\" (p. 31). Transferability relates directly to the quality of the methodology follow ed throughout the study (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Transferability is realized through thickly des cribed, sufficient, and precise detail to ensure that the readers are able to determi ne the degree to which the findings can be applied to their own situations (Erlandson et al., 1993; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Patton, 1990). The design of this study strove to provide a \"thick description\" of observed teacher-student interactions (Geertz, 1973), and the transferability of the study was 143 addressed through purposive sampling procedures and the preparation of case studies that provide thick, descriptively rich narrative. Lincoln & Guba (1985) suggest that thes e two strategies allow the reader to determine the degree to which the case st udy findings and interpretation may apply to other settings. By taking detailed notes in a purposeful ly sampled case, this case is reported in a manner that provides for readers to view the c ase within the lens of their own experiences. Accordingly, the test of transferability rest s on the readers who must compare details of the case study to their own backgrounds. By thickly descri bing the data, readers will further be able to judge the analysis as confirmable, de pendable, and credible to them. 144 CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In my role as a school administrator responsible for evaluating public school middl e school and elementary school teachers regarding pedagogy and teacher-s tudent interactions, I have supervised many teachers who had positive and supportive relationships with stude nts and others who seemed unable or unwilling to take the necessary steps to form and mainta in positive and supportive relationships with the students they instructed. In my experi ence, the students who enjoyed positive and supportive relationships with their teachers achieve d at higher levels and had fewer behavior problems then these same students did with teac hers with whom they did not enjoy such positive and supportive relationships. In evaluating the professional literature, many studies were found that looked at the teacher-stude nt relationship and the affect on learning and behavior but a gap was found in the literat ure exploring teacher perceptions of how they feel their relationships with student s influence their students' academic and behavioral success. The purpose of this ethnomethodological exploratory descriptive case study supported through the lenses of narratology and portraiture was to investigate and unders tand the relationships between small town elementary grade teachers and their st udents and how those relationships affect the academic performance and the behavioral cho ices of those students. Five elementary classroom teachers were purposefully selec ted from a staff of twenty classroom teachers with the specific criterion that they had been c onsidered exceptional in their relationships with their students according to the district teacher 145 evaluation instrument. The school served approximately 500 students, was comprised predominately of Caucasian middle-income students, and was located in a small t own approximately 45 miles from a large Midwest metropolitan city. These teac hers were typical in that they were all Caucasian females as were 19 of the 20 classroom teache rs in the building. They were unique in their teacher-student relationship rating of exc eptional on the district teacher evaluation instrument. I served as principal for this school during this study. Data for each case was collected over approximately two months from late N ovember 2010 through early February 2011. Semi-structured, open-ended, in-depth interviews wer e conducted with each participant and transcripts were provided back to each participa nt to permit participant clarification and additional explanation if the participant felt her position needed clarification. Two to three classroom observations were conducted of eac h of the participants where care was taken to observe for and note dialog and interactions between the teacher and the students. Each participant also completed and submitted journals around specific prompts regarding to their perceptions of how their relationships with thei r students influence their students' behavior and academic achievement. Each participant journal was coded through a narrative analysis process and the interview transcripts and observation field notes of each participant were analyzed using a generic coding process. The resulting data informed five individual case studies that were later cross analyzed by examining the information from each participant case and comparing to eac h of the other cases to determine common themes. In addition to asking each participant to review interview transcripts and provide clarification, a peer debriefer was eng aged to review the data to reduce the potential for bias and to strengthen validity by reviewing the interview transcripts, the participant journal entries, the observation field notes, and assi gned coding 146 and resulting themes. This debriefer performed a dependability audit by rev iewing the research process followed and an inquiry audit on the analyzed data and conclusions. Presentation of Data by Research Question The data presented in this chapter is organized thematically according to each of the research questions posed in chapter one of this study. The specific questions that i nform this study are: 1. What teacher and student behaviors do teachers perceive contribute most directl y to developing and maintaining positive and supportive teacher-student relationships? 2. To what extent do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence the academic and behavioral success of students in their classrooms? 3. How do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence their st udents' future academic and behavioral success? 4. How do teachers perceive school culture affects student behavior and academic performance and achievement? For each discovered theme, the codes used to arrive at the theme are discussed. Whil e tedious and requiring many reads and categorical revisions, this process permitted the data to be revealed in such a manner that concepts were logically organized. The analysi s was accomplished partly by including vignettes from interviews and narrative stori es shared in journal responses. These vignettes and revelations from observations assiste d in presenting portraits of the five study participants. Within each section, participant data w as discussed in order of participant. Each teacher was referred to as Participant 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Eac h research question was addressed first by considering participant responses to interview 147 questions. Secondly, data from participant journals informed related researc h questions. Lastly, the relative research questions were supported through observation data. I n coding the data, some questions were informed by a larger quantity of data than others. Inter views provided the bulk of the data for each of the research questions. Participant journals contributed data mostly to questions 1and 2. Observations primarily supported participant responses regarding questions 1 and 2 and to a lesser degree contributed to question 4. Interview and participant journal data will be addressed together in question order. S o the observations can be presented as coherent units the data derived from them are prese nted separately and analyzed chronologically by participant. Participant interviews and journals. Question 1: What teacher and student behaviors do teachers perceive contri bute most directly to developing and maintaining positive and supportive teacher-stu dent relationships? A significant theme identified was \"relationship.\" The relationship bet ween teacher and students was defined as a formalized interpersonal association between an authority figure and a subordinate who interact on nearly a day to day basis (Lars on et al., 2002; Bartlett, 2005). The interpretive codes that lead to the determination of this them e were \"caring,\" \"personal knowledge,\" and \"empowerment.\" For Noddings (2005), effecti ve teaching is based on caring, trusting, and respectful relationships between st udents and their teachers. Effective teachers interact with students in such a way that the ir students are aware that they care about their learning and about them as people. A caring relati onship is defined by acts that bring out the best in students through listening, gentleness, understa nding, knowledge of students as individuals, warmth and encouragement, and an overall love for children (Senge, 1990; Waugh, 2007; Wolk, 2007). According to Strong (2002), teachers show they care through listening, gentleness, understanding, knowledge of students as individuals, wa rmth and encouragement, and an overall love for children. Shields (2004) attests for teache rs to have strong relationships with students they must understand and accept their lived experiences. A teacher who has personal knowledge of his or her students goes the e xtra step to get to know students' interests, backgrounds, strengths, and struggles individually and ti es that knowledge into the day to day relationship (Giroux, 1996; Gutierrez & Rogoff, 2003). Shields (2004) suggests children must be empowered to participate in their own learnin g and to take responsibility for their own learning, An empowered student is provided opportuni ties to develop the ability, confidence, and motivation to succeed behaviorally and academi cally (Freire, 1970; Checkley, 2003; Shields, 2004). Another significant theme was \"culture.\" Deal and Peterson (1990) define \" culture: as the \"deep patterns of values, beliefs, and traditions that have formed over the course o f history\" (p. 7). The teacher and students and classroom are part of larger learning system within the school building with a set of norms and ways of working, thinking, talking, valuing, and behaving that are shaped around a particular combination of values, beliefs , and feelings. The teacher and students each have conscious and non-conscious ways of being t hat they bring to the classroom that influence behaviors and expectations (Waller , 1932; Fleischman, 2005; Rooney, 2005). The interpretive codes that lead to the determination of culture as a th eme were \"cultural knowledge,\" \"culture of achievement,\" \"high expectations t o learn,\" and \"high expectations to behave.\" To have cultural knowledge is to be aware of the individual st udent 149 cultures (Vygotsky, \"Culture and children,\" 2010) and to be culturally competent (Walker et al., 1985; Osher and Osher, 1995; Chamberlain, 2005; Martin and Vaughn, 2007). Cultural knowledge is what the teacher knows about student culture that allows the teacher to make ef fective instructional decisions. By being knowledgeable of and responsive to culture, educ ators can tap in to this knowledge to maximize learning opportunities for all students (Walker et al., 1985; Osher & Osher 1995). A culture of achievement is characterized by instr uction that is challenging where students feel comfortable asking questions and students ar e expected to do their best (Brophy, 1987b; Smey-Richman, 1989; Shouse, 1996; Weiss & Pasley, 2004; Garcia-Reid et al., 2005). Having high expectations for students to learn is ground ed in the teacher having the belief that students can demonstrate high academic achieve ment (Borba, 1989; Barr & Parrett, 1995; Deal & Peterson, 1999; Nieto, 2000; Danielson, 2002). Similarly, high expectations to behave are based on a teacher believing that s tudents can demonstrate acceptable behavior (Shalaway, 1989; Wang, Haertel & Walberg, 1993; B arr & Parrett, 1995). Participant 1. When asked directly what she feels is the importance of having positive supportive relationships with her students, Participant 1 suggested: First you have... you have to give them the respect that they need to start off bef ore you're gonna get it from them... um... and every morning I always start off by... um... greeting my kids at the door whether they come in by five I always say good morning to each and every one of them to start out the morning... um... good, on a good note, even if they had a bad day the day before just to wipe it clean and let them, let them start over... let them know that I care. 150 In her journal, Participant 1 wrote about her quest to provide a supportive and positive classroom culture by providing her students a democratic voice: We make our classroom rules together as a class. These are not decided until t he first day of school. We make a class constitution and all of the students agree to follow the rules and sign the rules. These are posted all throughout the year. As the year g oes on, if we find that we need to add a rule to our classroom rule postings we can just add i t. This teacher also journaled about the need to avoid negativity when developing and supporting positive supportive relationships: All students need to have the opportunity to be praised. Instead of criticizing what a student is doing wrong, I think it is important to find a student doing what they should be doing and showing the student what it looks like. If a student feels like they are always in trouble and not making good choices they are not going to form that relationship they need with their teacher to have a good learning experience in t he classroom. Caring relationships in her classroom also extend from student to student. To this re gard she shared: My students are learning to help each other out in the classroom and how to take care of themselves in different situations. They have started clapping for each other when someone earns a [school coupon]. They are even telling me when and why they think someone deserves a [school coupon]. Participant 1 also looks to extend these positive supportive relationships beyond the classroom. Accordingly, she wrote: 151 I send home a daily communication log with all of my students. It just gives me a w ay to stay in touch with the parents and for them to stay in touch with me. For those students needing a boost of confidence I write a good quick note home to their parent on their log. Participant 2. When asked about her feeling of the importance of a teacher having positive and supportive relationships with his or her students, Participant 2 replied that having such relationships is: ...the most important thing that goes on at school. That's the basis for everything, i f they don't have a positive relationship with you they don't want to come to school, they don't want to try, they don't want to learn, they have a bad attitude, that kind of sets the stage for everything else that's gonna happen at school. To develop and maintain a caring relationship with her students, Participant 2 shar ed a clear process for developing personal and cultural knowledge by getting to know her student s to let them know she cares: First I try to get to know them, ask them questions, see what they like, I... I joke around a lot with them, um...make them feel comfortable, let them get to know me, don't just like put up that shield and... you know... show them that I'm human and I... I want to get to know them, that that's why I want to be at school every day. Ge t to know them personally and to do that... um... one thing I do, we do weekend news every Monday we write what we did over the weekend and then that can lead to questions that I can bring up later with them and something like, \"Oh yeah, she knew, she knew that, she cared enough to remember to ask me about it,\" and then that's 152 good conversation starters too. They share a lot. Like their parents might not wa nt to know that I know everything that I do. In her participant journal, Participant 2 wrote about her perception of the importance of student voice in determining classroom rules and procedures and setting a culture of high behavior expectations: On the first day of school I read a story called The Monster at School . It's about a boy who doesn't know the rules and acts like a monster. Once he learns the rules, he starts acting like everyone else. After we read the story, we talked about what is important to know. Then I had students share ideas and thoughts on what procedures and rules were important to know in our classroom. After we had our chart paper filled up, we divided them between being respectful, being responsible, and being safe. I alre ady knew in my head what procedures I wanted to teach, but the students came up with even more ideas and got to feel like it was all their idea. Along with getting to know her students, to provide for personal connection and academic success, Participant 2 also considers the individual needs of her students when planning instruction and establishing a culture of achievement. Considering how individuali zed planning helps to engage her students in a culture of achievement, she wrote: Reading Workshop allows for differentiation and for higher student engagement because students are reading books at their independent reading level, yet st ill working on the comprehension skills and strategies that we learned as a whole cla ss. If a student who is reading [below] grade level is required to read a book written for middle of the year [current] graders, they aren't going to be able to demonstra te their knowledge of cause and effect relationships because they didn't understand the wor ds 153 in the book when reading. If they get a book on their level, they will be able to read it, show the skills\u2014or if they still need help\u2014and develop confidence as a reader. The same goes for students who are reading at a [higher] grade level. If they are forced to read a [current] grade level book, they might not be as engaged, and definitely not as challenged and pushed toward their potential. Participant 3. When asked for her perception of the importance of having positive and supportive teacher-student relationships, Participant 3 explained her feelings a bout accentuating the positive to achieve desired behavioral outcomes: I believe always to reward positive behavior, that's my big thing is reward posit ive behavior and the kids. I have classroom cash. I have a row or a group of honor depending on how large it gets... um... I give my kids, they get warnings for doing things they know they're not supposed to and if they get less than two warnings for the whole week they get to be in the group of honor... um... that has been a big thing, everybody wants to be in the group of honor, so... um... I've always... I meet them at the door, high five, hand shake or hug... um... at the end of the day I do the same, I try to acknowledge everybody in the room, you know, with everything. Participant 3 also indicated that she shows her students she cares by getting to know them on a personal basis. Explaining the personal and cultural knowledge she has of her st udents she related a couple of vignettes: I try to find... um... positive things or maybe things we have in common, things I can talk to them about, like I have some boys in my room that are really into football... s o that makes a big conversation, you know we can talk about football... Some of my boys were kind of off, you know, like, \"Well, I don't want to do this, I'm too cool for 154 school,\" kind of thing but I think, it's taken a while but we've kind of gotten some common ground and they, I think they're really a lot better than they were... and they, they come in and tell me things, you know, \"Well I have football practice,\" or, \"I have this,\" and it's something, if they know that I understand something that they're doing and I talk to them about it, it makes them feel, \"Oh, she really ca res.\" Sharing a story of an individual student, this teacher continued: ...and then if I have a kid that's... um... like I have one student that's really... um... his home life's not so hot so, you know, he said something about, \"Well, I don't know if I'm gonna have a Christmas tree,\" you know, well, I said, \"If you want y ou can take ours home for the holidays,\" you know, that kind of stuff, just making, doing anything to make their life here at school more positive. And that is the main thing is listening, you know, even though you have twenty-five kids trying to talk to you all at once you have to try to at least acknowledge, you know, everybody and that's what I try to do. Journaling about the procedures she follows to empower her students to share their voices in her classroom, Participant 3 wrote, \"I have class meetings to get their i nput on what they feel is important in the classroom. I [also] have class jobs so that the students help to make the classroom run smoother.\" This teacher also encourages her students to share in t he direction academic activities take. \"The students can share with me how they feel about an activity... They help me to determine if the way I am presenting the information is ok for the m or if we need to do something different.\" This teacher also shows she cares about her student s' success by sharing her personal stories. In her participant journal she wrote, \"I always try to make them understand that it is ok if you don't understand something right away. Then I will 155 bring up times in my childhood when I struggled to understand something. They really li ke these stories.\" Participant 4. In sharing her perception of the importance of having a positive supportive relation with her students, Participant 4 responded: If you have a positive relationship with them or they trust you and they're willi ng to work for you, they're willing to try and they're willing to put in effort. If you don 't have a relationship with them, they're not gonna care, they don't, they have no reason to impress you, the kids are, that you have a relationship want to impress you, want to do their best, want to show you how good they can do. If they don't care about you and they don't want to be around you they don't care. Speaking to how she promotes a positive caring relationship by developing personal and cultural knowledge of her students, Participant 4 added: I try to do as much one on one things and find what their interests are to where I can, when I'm giving problems in the classroom or giving examples of things, I can use sentences... um... like I have a lot of boys in my class that are into football; I ca n do football related things just to grab their attention and that just shows them that I do recognize that they're in football and recognize that their interests, what their interests are; I have a lot of girls that are interested in horses... so I'm able to corr elate a lot of things with that and sports, and some of my kids are very artistic so we try to draw things and just kind of shows them that we do things that they are interested in just to keep them, keep the relationship going. 156 In her journal, Participant 4 shared how she works to build and maintain positive and supportive relationships with her students by empowering them to assist in developi ng and reviewing class expectations. Accordingly, she wrote: At the beginning of the year the class and I make a classroom expectation pos ter that we follow throughout the school year. I always title the poster with the word expectations rather than rules or procedures because the students view it as something to work towards and not as something that is refraining them from doing things; they feel as though they have more freedom. We frequently make additions to our expectations as the students grow academically as well as mature throug hout the year. I prompt the students with questions regarding how they think things will work best revolving around different activities. In addition to helping determine class expectations, Participant 4 also journaled about how she empowers her students to share their voice in academic decision making: Centers are introduced a few weeks into school and the students voice their opinion on how they feel centers should look and sound like throughout the allowed time. By [this] grade a large majority of the students know how the classroom should work and what decisions they should be making, so they are able to express and show by modeling what they need to do in the classroom to be able to learn and allow others to learn. Sharing evidence of the academic and behavioral influence resulting from the c ulture of high expectations she holds for her students, Participant 4 wrote about parental confirmati on she regularly receives: 157 I have a very open line of communication with my parents. I received a few e-mail s, written notes, as well as phone calls from parents this week about our Polar Express unit. The parents expressed their excitement for our unit and asked if they could help in any way. I had one parent that let me know about how happy she was that her son was receiving punches for his behavior because in the past years the relati onship had gone down with his teacher toward the end of the fall and she was happy that he was still showing me effort and working for me. Empowering her students to own their learning and showing caring concern for their success, this teacher regularly plans differentiated opportunities. Discussing how thi s works in her class, she wrote: While working on our United States region project, students researched to their ability and found a determined amount of facts based on their reading level. I also allowed the students to do different projects, all of which met a different learning style. The [gifted education] students were extremely excited to be able t o research and find information at their own pace and ability level. The students that are easily overwhelmed by a large amount of information found the differentiation very helpful and were very willing to research the required information and did not get easi ly frustrated with the task. I modified our research form for the students that nee ded additional assistance in looking for information and allowed for more fill in the blank information on their project. When students are given a task at their ability le vel they are willing to reach their expectations and go above and beyond what is required of them to do. 158 Participant 5. Regarding her perception of the importance of a positive supportive relationship with her students, Participant 5 stated: I think that you have to have a positive relationship in order for the kids to want to learn and want to come to school and be in your classroom. If you don't have a positive relationship it's gonna turn them off I think. To develop and maintain a positive caring relationship with her students, Participant 5 shared the importance of listening to her students to develop personal and cultural knowledge: I listen to, you know, they always have stories that they want to tell you when they come in the morning so I'll listen to their stories and talk about just personal things that they have, if they're having a personal issue or something, you know, somebody's picking on em then we talk about it, I try to pull all the kids involved out and talk to them about it and discuss ways that they can improve whatever the problem is. In her participant journal Participant 5 echoed her interview response as she wr ote about the importance of listening to her students and showing that she genuinely cares: I try to take time to listen to student's stories they can't wait to tell m e. I like to show them that I do care and I am interested. I want the students to know that they ca n trust me, and show them that I trust them as well. Showing the students that I respect them helps them to respect me as well. Learning would be at a minimum without the trust and respect needed. Additionally, Participant 5 strives to empower her students and provide for student voic e in her classroom. Describing the process of determining class rules, she wr ote: 159 At the beginning of the school year, we establish the rules together. I ask the s tudents what they think should be included in the rules, write down their suggestions, and then we combine and look at the suggestions that are similar and rewrite them to include everyone's. As the school year progresses, we often have to have clas s meetings to revisit our rules and procedures. The students are passed a ball, and only the person with the ball may talk. This is where we have discussions about what is not working with our procedures. The students give suggestions on how we can make things run smoother in the class and I take those suggestions into consideration. This gives me a chance to see where I might need to improve in my daily classro om management too. Promoting a culture of achievement with high expectations for learning, this te acher stressed that while she is available and willing to help, the students are held accountable for t heir own learning: Students are always welcome to come to me for help on academics. I also tell them that I won't just give them the answer, but I will guide them into finding the cor rect answers as well. Many times, students just feel like giving up when something is hard for them, but I try to build up their self-esteem by guiding them in the right direc tion and letting them figure it out independently. This is a challenge for many students , but I think it has to be done in order for them to fully understand the concepts being taught. Again discussing the importance of listening to her students and being available to t hem beyond academic support, Participant 5 added: 160 In showing students they can trust me I have often told them that they can talk to me in private to work out any problems that may arise. I have several girls who do t his, and I think it helps them to know that I care. If I didn't offer this to some students , they would be so focused on their personal problems, that they would not absorb any of the information and tools they need to be successful. Question 2: To what extent do teachers perceive their interactions wit h students influence the academic and behavioral success of students in their class rooms? As with Question 1, the significant themes were \"relationship\" and \"culture.\" The interpretive codes that supported the \"caring,\" \"personal knowl edge,\" and \"empowerment.\" The interpretive codes that theme of \"culture\" w ere again \"cultural knowledge,\" \"culture of achievement,\" \"high expectations to learn, \" and \"high expectations to behave.\" A third theme for this question was \"behavior management.\" In the literature, classroom management, behavior management and classroom discipline are interre lated and often used interchangeably (Jones, 1987a; Danielson, 2002). In collecting data for t his study it became clear that the teacher participants felt classroom manageme nt extended into all facets of the school. Accordingly, for this study the management of student behavior is referred to as \"behavior management.\" Many (Doyle, 1986; Brophy, 1988; Marzano, 2003). Duke's 1979 definition best fits this study. According to Duke (1979), classroom management is \"the provisions and procedures necessary to establish and maintain an environment in which instruction and learning can occur\" (p. xi i). The interpretive codes supporting this theme were \"discipline policies,\" \"re wards and 161 recognition,\" and \"consequences.\" Discipline policies are rules regardin g student conduct within the classroom or school (Jones, 1987a; Danielson, 2002). Rewards and recognitions can be tangible or intangible and result from positive behavior (Shalaway, 1989; VanOverwalle & DeMetsenaere, 1990; Marzano et al., 2001; Sornson, 2001). Consequences are defined as a negative response for inappropriate behavior coming from the ins ide (Fay and Funk, 1995) and are intended redirect negative behaviors and assist students in making better decisions in the future (Mendler, 1992; Purkey & Strahan, 2002). A fourth theme of \"high quality instruction\" was also identified in the data inform ing this question. High quality instruction is rigorous, is aligned with content sta ndards, and uses instructional strategies to meet the academic needs of all students classr oom (Marzano et al., 2001; Weiss & Pasley, 2004). Interpretive codes that lead to the determination of thi s theme were \"teacher effectiveness,\" \"differentiated instruction,\" and \"e ffective feedback.\" An effective makes wise choices about the most effective instru ctional strategies to employ, designs instruction to facilitate student learning, and makes effec tive use of classroom management techniques (Good & Brophy, 2000; Marzano et Stronge & Hindman, 2006). Teachers who differentiate instruction follow a systematic approach to planning instruct ion for academically diverse learners and modify the instructional content, process, pr oduct, and environment so that students who learn best in different ways are instructed in a manne r that maximizes a-Reid et al., 2005). For feedback to be effective it must always be supportive, diagnostic, and constr uctive and must provide an explanation of what is correct and what is not correct and how to make improvement Emberger (2002) describes effective feedback as information tha t students receive from their teacher about their performance so that they may take a ction to correct and to guide them in attaining their goals. Participant 1. When asked how she perceives that her relationships with her students affect their learning, Participant 1 stressed the importance of establis hing a caring environment for them to succeed: If they don't feel welcome they are not going to learn what they need to learn. If they don't feel a part of my class, or my family, or my community, they might not per form to the best of their ability. I think a lot has to do with...um... your tone too, your tone that, \"This is my teacher voice...I mean it\"...um...tone. Regarding her relationship with her students and the impact on student behavior, this te acher spoke about the importance of consistent expectations and predictable responses and how that supports a culture of high expectations for behavior: They know...they know what I expect and so they know that if they don't follow what I'm asking them to do that they are going to have their bear down and they are going to have to have to go to the safe seat and if they're not okay there...you know... there are things that they have to follow and if they don't...they know what's gonna happen next. In her journal Participant 1 shared an example of how she positively impacts the lea rning environment to provide for a culture of high learning: In the mornings sometimes the students can get a little jittery on the car pet. When I observe this, I always stop my instruction and do something to get them back on 163 track. These can be anything from deep breathing breaks, songs to sing and dance to, or just stretching exercises. This teacher also considers the ability levels of each of her students as she plans for differentiation and individualized instruction. \"Every student is put into a different group based on their reading skills according to my [screening] testing. Each grou p is directly working with me on specific skills they need to work on.\" Participant 2. Participant 2 also stressed the importance of establishing a culture of achievement where students feel safe and cared for and know what to expect. \"I thi nk if we have that positive relationship,\" she explained, \"they'll...they'll be motivated t o learn, they'll want to try... they want to please you.\" Additionally, considering the personal and c ultural knowledge she had developed, this teacher suggested: Since I know them and try to get to know them and they know me that they know that they aren't gonna get away with anything... they want to do what's best and i f they know that I'm not going to scream at them if they do make a bad choice for a day or something but we can practice making good choices together and... and they can feel safe enough that if they try something... you know... and they don't make a good choice that they're not gonna be... excluded. ... it's a partnership and so if it's a partnership then they're gonna try and they'll, they'll work harder on those, making better choices. Journaling about building and maintaining positive and supportive relationships with students, Participant 2 drew a direct connection between building and maintaining those relationships and academic success. Specifically, she wrote, \"I think that yo u have to build and maintain positive and supportive relationships in order to maximize learning and 164 academic performance. For me, the focus is on those relationships first.\" In dis cussing specific ways to build and maintain such relationships, this teacher journaled about bal ancing and prioritizing time as she develops personal and cultural knowledge of her students: One way to make sure the time is balanced [between instruction] without forgett ing about the importance of positive relationships with the students is to use any extra time\u2014during morning work/time before the bell rings, recess, lunch line, dismiss al time\u2014to really work on relationships. I ask students questions and talk to them. Once you show them that you care and want to get to know them, most students are pretty easy to relate to and eager to have a positive relationship back with you. Others require more work and effort to show them that you care and are there for them. These are the ones that sometimes turn out to be the most rewarding. If you use this time explicitly on these types of activities, then you can focus more on acade mic performance during communication arts time because the relationships are st ill being built and the students/teacher can work together to maximize the learning during learning time. Participant 2 also stressed the use of high gains instructional strategies, i nstructional technology, and engaging the home in an academic partnership to promote academic and behavioral success as she plans her instruction. Writing about one week of effective teacher practices in particular, she shared: We used graphic organizers\u2014non-linguistic representation\u2014while doing cause-eff ect relationships this week. One way that these graphic organizers promoted engagem ent and positive learning was because they were done with technology on the [Interacti ve White] Board. We also had math homework on our regular Tuesday and Thursday 165 nights. I think this promotes positive learning because it shows that practicing our money skills in math is so important and valued that it needs to be practiced at home. It also allows for a partnership with parents/guardians between what we do a t school and what the students are practicing at home. This teacher also journaled about the importance of empowering her students to have ownership in the learning process and differentiate their own learning: Students in my classroom do take learning activities in new directions sometim es. For example, they can ask questions or want to look up information on the internet that goes along with what we're learning but not what I had planned. By allowing student s to do go deeper into a topic or to expand on the required standards gives students ownership to their learning. Participant 3. Speaking about maintaining of a culture of high behavioral expectations where students feel safe and are empowered to perform at high leve ls through positive recognition, Participant 3 said: I go back to always rewarding positive behavior... I've had some parents say, \"You know they love that you have this thing going on because it's rewarding them for the way they're, you know, acting and they really work, and they try to, you know, do their best to stay there... \" I think they try really hard, they really try hard, and I think it makes them feel safe in the classroom and the environment makes them feel li ke they're going to, you know, they're gonna get rewarded if they do the good job, it' s not like, \"Well, you know, she never notices when I do something good,\" or, \"She never says anything to me when I do something good.\" 166 This teacher also stresses the importance of providing consistent effective feedback when recognizing and addressing inappropriate behavior choices: There's still some that struggle, can't make the good choices... [I believe i n] also calling them out on things that they shouldn't do, you know, I mean, I, I totally believe... I do call them out... their parents may not, they let them get away with whatever and I, I call them out on it every time and I know it's hard and it's rea lly, the first month of school's pretty tough but I keep doing it and I think they get used to it and they know, they know, \"Oh, she's gonna, you know, do that to me,\" or, \"She's gonna...,\" and that's been another issue, they, I'm consistent I guess, and I stay on them, you know, \"Unuh, that's not the way you act, you're not gonna do that,\" they know, they know. And then, we've had some tears cause they're like, \"Oh, but I forgot.\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, maybe next time, you know, it'll be, you'll remembe r,\" it's tough. Writing about how she interacts with her students to affect their academic and behavioral successes, Participant 3 stated, \"I make learning as fun as possible. I BE LIEVE IN REWARDING THOSE WHO ARE DOING GOOD!!\" Further, this teacher wr ote about the high expectations for learning that she has for her students and the importance of re warding appropriate behavior: I always have high expectations for what my students are doing. This includes behavior and academics. I have lots of reward systems. This is helping with a pos itive learning environment because I am rewarding the good behavior and not always picking on the bad behavior. The students realize that they need to do what they are supposed to do to get the rewards. 167 This teacher also shared in her journal how she uses high gains instructional strat egies and instructional technology to differentiate instruction and provide for success and i ncreased engagement for all students: This week I had the students work in partners as they worked on a Time for Kids . I think that it is good for all kids to work together and learn in a different way. They also get so see how others see things. We also learned the elements of a story by using a graphic artistic activity. I use my [Interactive White] Board to c hange the way I am teaching. This allows students a different way to learn. I try to make su re that I am changing the way I teach often. This also adds some interest to learning. The students enjoy school more. Participant 3 also moves through her class showing her students she cares about thei r learning checking for understanding. In her journal she shared, \"I constantly go around the room to check comprehension. I also give small assessments along the way to se e if I need to reteach or can go on.\" Writing about behavior struggles, this teacher wrote, \"M isbehaviors can be small or large. They could be arguing with another student, they could throw something, talking inappropriately, just being rude, talking back to me, etc.\" Hy pothesizing about what may cause this misbehavior and considering the personal and cultural knowle dge she had developed, Participant 3 pondered, perhaps \"the student gets frustrated about something and does not know how to handle the frustration. They may have something going on at home or at school that I don't know about.\" Regardless of the reason for the misbehavior, she wrote: I always remove them from the frustration and allow them to calm down. Then I talk to them about why this happened. I try to talk to them about how they could handle 168 that situation differently. Then if there is a situation that is taking place t hat I cannot talk to them about, I will send them to the counselor. I just want them to know that it is not ok to act this way at school and we talk about what would happen in life if they acted this way. Participant 4. For Participant 4, a culture of achievement defines her relationship with her students. To this regard she stated, \"My kids want to show off what they know, a re willing to do whatever just to get their grades, they want the good grades, they want to show me that they know the information.\" When discussing students who were initially re sistant to this teacher's invitation to participate in a culture of achievement, this te acher talked about reaching beyond the classroom: Last year I had a couple of students that would be with me for a little bit and then go completely away from me, didn't want to have anything to do with me, and I actua lly went back and built the relationship through the parents and the parents ...um... kind of built it up at home and then when they'd come we were able to talk about the same things that were being talked about at home, so I built the relationship up at home before I was able to fully get them at school, and by the end of the year last year I was able to see a big difference of, after I've done more with the family then they started to become... have a better relationship with me. Writing in her journal about balancing positive supportive relationships with a culture of high expectations, Participant 4 asserted: How you present information is one of the most important things in building the positive relationship; students don't want to sit and answer [state assessment ] questions all day but they are willing to do hands on activities revolving around [stat e 169 assessment] questions. If you are able to have them active and interested in what they are doing, you will have the positive relationship with them. This teacher also feels that sharing her personal experiences with her st udents shows she cares and helps maintain a positive relationship and a culture of high expectat ions for academic and behavior. She shared: With the demand of preparing students for state assessments, the students get ea sily frustrated and shut down quickly. I notice more students shutting down in the spring rather than the fall so after Christmas break I try to have many classroom m eetings about how important effort is with everything we do in life. I try to share some of my own experiences so that they know that I have had many of the same frustrations as them. Writing about her belief in empowering students by giving them voice in determining academic direction and differentiating their learning while maintaini ng a culture of high expectations for learning, Participant 4 journaled about her process: Students have opportunities to determine activities within the given instruction. As a class we learned about the regions of the United States and followed up this classroom instruction with a research project. The students were able to c hoose the region they would like to find more information about as well as how they would like to present their information. The students took great ownership in this project because they felt as though they had control of what they were doing. When the students are able to have choice and make their own decisions they are more willing to put in effort towards whatever they are working on. Towards the end of the year the students will take on more responsibility of what they are learning. We will do a unit 170 on Scientists and they will choose what scientist they would like to research, what they would like to research about that person as well as how to present the information. I will still have requirements that need to be met such as writing [learning objectives], reading [learning objectives], and science [learning objectives] but the students will have the opportunity to control their level of learning about their scientist. Participant 5. When asked how she feels her relationships with her students affect their learning and academic performance, Participant 5 stated: I think that has a lot to do with, with their performance in the classroom because if, if they want, if there's some, if the role model in the classroom wants them to do well and expresses that in a caring way then I think that they're more apt to want to do well for them. Provided the opportunity to review the interview transcript, Participant 5 added to this response stressing the importance of positive reinforcement in providing for a c ulture of achievement in her classroom. \"Students need positive reinforcement,\" she sta ted, \"whether they are the highest student in the class or the lowest. If I never praised a st udent for a job well done, it would be a very chaotic environment.\" She then shared a personal vignette to illustrate the effect of positive reinforcement: From personal experience, I remember how good it felt for my teachers to pr aise me doing well on something, and it made me want to work even harder. I will never forget my second grade teacher telling the class that another student and I were the best behaved students during one of our holiday parties. I still remember very cle arly 171 how good that made me feel, and made me want to keep up the good work. I think the same goes for students now. This teacher also added a written statement to her interview response discu ssing the importance of recognizing and rewarding positive behavior choices. Describing how s he rewards good behavior and accomplishments she explained: I also reward the students on a job well done. For example, when the class as a whole gets a compliment from another teacher, they receive a handful of marbles. O nce the marble jar is filled up, we will celebrate by having a movie or a game. We al so set Reading goals each quarter, and for those students who meet their goal, I have a pizza party or an ice cream party where just those students and I can spend a relaxing lunch period talking. This teacher also spoke of the importance of a highly structured agenda in mainta ining an environment that supports a culture of high academic and behavioral expectations: I've noticed that if I have too much down time or something like that then the behaviors kind of get out of hand and then, then the talking starts and that kind of thing so I always have to make sure that we have a set schedule that we're stic king to and not a lot of down time for them to start talking so that way we all stay on the same page and the behaviors don't get out of hand. Participant 5 also empowers her students to have a voice in determining academic direction when possible. To this goal, she journaled: The students get some choice in learning activities. We do many activities wi th partners, and I will allow the students to choose their partners. We try to do as many 172 hands-on activities as possible. The students seem to enjoy these hands-on activit ies and learn from them. Further, this teacher discussed how the effective teaching practice of helping her students set goals and how providing materials at students' instructional levels different iates their learning and reinforces a culture of high expectations for learning and empowe rs students for academic success. Journaling about her reading program, she wrote: The students set reading goals at the beginning of each quarter, and if they meet their goal by the end of the quarter, they get a reward. They must choose a reading level based on their test results that they must stay within. This ensures that the student s are reading books on a level they should be able to understand. Therefore, there is a wide variety of reading going on in the classroom and the students get very excited about reading. It also pushes those students who don't \"like\" to read. Some of my lower- level readers were going to great lengths and working really hard to m eet their goals. It really helped to boost their confidence in themselves as well. It didn't seem to them that they were learning to be better readers in a boring way. It made them fe el successful and that they could do it for themselves. Writing about behavior expectations and how the relationships she has with her students affects their behavior choices, Participant 5 stated: When discipline needs to be used, I try to follow the [building] procedure and our Citizenship program as well. The students in my class do a pretty good job with thi s, and I very rarely have any students who have to go as far as the Focus Room. The students know that my main focus is to teach them what they need to know in order to move on to the [next] grade. 173 Writing further about how she strives to provide a caring culture while maintaining high behavior and academic expectations, this teacher shared the following vignette : With one student in particular, I noticed that he was starting to act silly and be the class clown. I could also tell that he was getting frustrated with his work, a s this is what he normally does in this situation. He would get out of his seat, play with his pencils, turn around, and whisper to his neighbors. I simply walked over to the student, put my hand on his shoulder, and quietly asked him if he needed help on his work. After helping him, I let him work independently for a while. When he got frustrated again, I asked him to go to the safe seat so that he could calm down and compose himself, and I told him that as soon as he showed me how he should sit in the safe seat, I would help him on his assignment again. Question 3: How do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence their students' future academic and behavioral success? As with Question 1, the significant theme was \"relationship.\" \"Caring\" and \"empowerment\" were the supporting interpretive codes. The \"culture\" theme was also evident and was again supported by the interpre tive codes of a \"culture and \"high expec tations to behave.\" As this question asked the teacher participants to consider how their relati onships with their students influenced those students' future behavior and learning, the tenur e and grade levels of these teachers played a factor in their responses. All part icipants had taught more than one year and had former students to reflect on. Two participants, by gra de level or tenure, had former students to reflect on who had completed the elementary school experience. Some lived in the community and had knowledge of former students outside of the school setting and others lived outside the school community. A less prevalent them e was 174 \"behavior management,\" which was again supported through the interpretive code of the building \"discipline procedures.\" Participant 1. When asked how she feels the relationships she has had with students affects their academic and behavioral performance when the leave her class room, Participant 1 shared the following vignette regarding the carryover from her high expectat ions for behavior and the caring culture of her classroom: I had... my first year of teaching... um... [student] moved in mid-year... and um... it was really, really a struggle and he... behavior wise we had big issues but once [t he next year] rolled around and he got a new teacher I was his best bud and so to this day...like out at recess he came up and just gave me a hug and said... um... you know, \"I had... I had a good day today...\" and just to get to talk to him or... um... and he used to get to come down to my room but now he's to the point where he can't be trusted to walk down there anymore... He's different with me then he is with his teacher. Similarly, reflecting on a student she recommended for grade retention the prior year and is repeating the grade with a different teacher, Participant 1 reported how he is still drawn to her: This year one of my [students] that repeat...is repeating the grade...he com es... [his teacher] will let him come down to me and he will read me their paper decodable books and last year was not even... was not even possible for him to be able to do that. Participant 2. Participant 2 stated that she feels the culture of achievement and high academic and behavior expectations in her classroom \"sets the stage for wh at they're going 175 to do in [the next] grade.\" This teacher shared several stories of students ret urning to share their accomplishments: There's kids that come back, \"Look at this book I'm reading,\" or show me their [reading] test...they'll bring back to show so hopefully that's making them work even harder cause, \"Oh, I want to go show [teacher],\" so that I think affects them . There's so many that still come back every morning and every afternoon to talk to me but like, \"I'm gonna talk to your teacher and see if you had a good day,\" so they know that I'm still checking on them and hopefully they don't... they, they want to impress me... you know... that, \"Oh, I'm in [the next] grade, I'm still, I still have good behavior.\" And it's kind of surprising some of the ones that come back everyday...some that I didn't realize, like [student], you know, you...moved or whatever he did in the middle of the year, he comes and talks to me almost every single day and he was only with me half the year...so that meant a lot that I stil l see him every day. Participant 3. Reflecting on the development and maintenance of her students' personal values supported through the caring and empowering culture from their t ime in her classroom, Participant 3 stated: I think that... um... hopefully they're a better person when they leave my room, I would hope... um... I would hope that it would make them a stronger student just because they had a good relationship with me. I've had parents write notes; I've had kids come visit... um... I've had even, I had a [parent of a former student] and her daughter went to middle school and she wrote me a note and saying how she thought 176 my class helped her daughter in middle school... some days you think, \"Oh my word, why am I here?\" but most days it's a rewarding job... it is. Regarding former students sent to her room from other rooms for behavior time outs as part of the building discipline plan, this teacher talked about seeing this time as an opportuni ty to remind students of what they learned together and to reinforce expectations: They don't like to come to the buddy room in my classroom, from a future grade, they, they always look at me because I look at them, \"Why are you in here?\" and they're just, they know what my expectations of them were and that I am still thinking that they should be acting that way... um... I think they're gonna think about it, a lot of teachers will send them to me and I might have a talk with them, \"Why are you in here? What's going on?\" To further illustrate how her caring relationships with students and her high behavior expectations influences future choices, this teacher shared the following vignet te: There was one girl in a [next] grade class and I had a talk with her... um... her teacher just mentioned that she was doing some things and so I had a talk with her and I said, \"Now you know what we went through last year and how you're supposed to act,\" and, you know, she straightened up, I see her every once in a while in my safe seat, she comes a lot, but, or she did, and now I see her every once in a while so it's helped, so I think that just having those high expectations and... um... them knowing that you're gonna support them even if they do something wrong... um... that you're gonna still say, \"No, you know that that's not right,\" you know, \"we need to have you acting better and you know, you can act better, I know you can,\" that kind of thing, 177 and maybe even having confidence in them, saying, \"I have conf...,\" I say this all t he time to my kids, \"I have confidence in you, why can't you?\" Participant 4. Participant 4 reported evidence of the positive affect the caring relationships she formed with her students and high academic expectations had on them fr om their regular visits to talk and to share with her their successes: I have a lot of my kids [from] last year come and show projects that they've done l ike the leaf art... some of my kids that really struggled with spelling last yea r have brought me their spelling tests that they've got 100% on and they want to show me that they're doing well; they want to show me that they're getting good gr ades. Behaviorally, this teacher also talked about evidence of the influence her inte raction with students had on their future behavior choices and feelings about their behavior: I've had a couple of [former students]; a couple of their teachers sent them back to my buddy room, and they feel very, I want to say, embarrassed, cause they don't want me to see them doing wrong things once they're in [the next] grade, and I see the same thing if I send some, one of my kids down to [a prior] grade, they don't want to come back to my classroom because they know that they're expect, you know, that I expect them to do a lot more then what they're doing to get themselves into the buddy room, and so it seems like they're calmed down by the time that they get to my r oom because they know what the expectations are; they've had a year with me and I've seen that it's made, or if I see them in line, I'm able to just say their name and they, you know, do what their supposed to do rather than whatever they were doing. 178 Participant 4 also perceives her relationships have influenced former student s by showing she cares and has high expectations by the way they respond when she encounters them in public . Specifically, she stated: If they see me out at Wal-Mart they come and tell me all about their school da y and [former student] especially, when I see him around, he wants to tell me all about [t he gifted program] because I was the one that got or submitted him to the [gif ted program]. Participant 5. Participant 5 discussed how she views the time students spend learning in her classroom as developmental academically and behaviorally and she cited caring visits from former students in support of her perception: I think that they get used to that nine months of having me as a teacher and then they go [on] and, and hopefully they, they'll follow that same expectations that they did for me when they go on to [future grades]... I still have several kids that come back and see me and, you know, I'll see em out and about in the community and they're always coming up and give me a hug and stuff like that. Reporting that she felt hopeful about having a positive influence on her students' lives , this teacher stated, \"I hope that I am able to teach them the values of the classroom t hat they carry out into, you know, when they leave the school.\" Regarding the culture of high expecta tions, she said she shares her expectations for her students with her students as she empowe rs them to practice appropriate behavior beyond her classroom: I tell them too and, you know, if, I don't want to hear about bullying, or, you know, if there's an issue with bullying or picking on somebody, I said, \"I don't want to hear about it happening after school hours either because it started here and we're gonna 179 end it here and if I hear of it, you know, otherwise then we're gonna have to take care of the problem in another way,\" so I just keep encouraging them to make good choices outside of school too. Question 4: How do teachers perceive school culture affects student behav ior and academic performance and achievement? A significant theme addressing this question was \"culture,\" with interpretive codes of \"Behavior management\" was a common theme in ma ny responses and the dominant interpretive code was \"discipline policies.\" The them e of \"relationships\" was also present and was supported by interpretive codes of \"c aring\" and \"empowerment.\" To aid the reader in understanding Participant responses, a brie f overview of the two facets of the school's discipline program is provided. First, the school has a building wide discipline policy designed to create a consistent, supervised, saf e environment in order to teach and protect students. When a student is having difficulty following a sc hool expectation, he or she may be asked to go to a safe seat where they can sit and think about making good choices. If the student is not able to be in the classroom, he or she may be as ked to go to a buddy room or focus room. Secondly, the school also recently developed a school- wide behavior expectations matrix to teach students the expected behavior in all sc hool related areas. As a component of this program students who are observed following the expectations are given school coupons which can be entered into weekly drawings or banked toward earning a class or school privilege. Participant 1. When asked how she feels school culture affects the student learning, Participant 1 shared that she feels school-wide celebrations and recognitions e stablish a culture or achievement that supports high expectations for learning and good behavi or. 180 Specifically regarding academic support, she stated, \"The [state assess ment] celebrations are fun... I know [students] do look forward to...you know...getting to go up there and be recognized in front of everybody.\" Behaviorally, this teacher feels \" the [the weekly Mascot] Achiever is huge for them to be picked and...you know...they clap for their, for their friends that get picked and say, \"Yeah, I did see them... They...they've been, they haven't had t heir bear down all week... \" Further, Participant 1 stated she feels the school-wide behavior expectations matrix is: good because everybody\u2014people have different expectations in different part of the building and not all of our expect, expectations are the same so by creating that matrix...you know... the music teacher [is] able to follow the same discipline that I...you know...we have the same rules for hall way if we see somebody...you know...turned around walking the hall way they should be able to correct that behavior...um...and people not feel like their toes are being stepped on. In her participant journal, this teacher shared an example of how she typically us es the school discipline program. Regarding a particular issue with a particular student, she wrote: He didn't want to follow directions. He was testing the waters to see what he c ould get away with. I followed [the discipline] process. This child didn't follow my direction I gave. He was given 1 warning. The behavior still existed, so he had to pul l his bear down and go to the safe seat. In the safe seat he still wasn't okay so I took him to our buddy room. He was okay in the buddy room, and eventually made it back to his regular seat in the classroom. This child later showed me he could follow directions so he received a [school coupon]. 181 Participant 2. For Participant 2, academic artifacts displayed throughout the building convey a culture of high expectations for learning. In her response she stated: Everything hanging in the hallways...so no matter where we go we can see, \"O h they did this in this grade or in this grade, and oh I can't wait till I can do something li ke that,\" so then they might be like, \"Well I, I need to try harder on my sentences so when I'm in [the next] grade I can write stories like this,\" you know...just see ing all the, all the different stuff that [other] kids can do. Participant 2 also sees the school-wide behavior expectations matrix as a to ol that promotes a culture of high expectations for behaving. This teacher explained that having school-w ide behavior expectations empowers students because they know that \"it's the same i n each, the expectations are the same, consistent with everyone.\" Putting herself in the posi tion of a student, she shared: If it was me, if it was me as a student I would, I would feel a lot better, I would t hink it was more fair like, \"Why did they get all the attention or...now since we have t hese in place I, everyone knows I'm following the rules.\" Additionally, this teacher talked about reviewing the procedural steps of the \"cl assroom\" component of the behavior expectations matrix with her students to promote a culture of hi gh expectations for behavior and academics and provide an awareness and rationale for the consequences imposed for inappropriate behavior: We talk about it ... \"Don't take learning opportunities away from other people when you shout out or when you answer a question when it's not your turn and stuff, but that takes away opportunities for other people, just like that's why you have to go t o 182 the safe seat or buddy room because it's taking away from the rest of the cla ss... so if you talk about it then I think they realize that. In her journal, Participant 2 also wrote about the importance of school and classroom cul ture and the need to revisit school and classroom norms during key times of year: This was the first week back from a two week Christmas break... Students were ti red, but also excited to see everyone again. Their routines were entirely different over break so getting back into the swing of things [was needed]. I went back over all our procedures and routines on the first day back. We [reviewed] the behavior matrix and [went] over specific things that are required in the classroom, hallways, cafe teria, playground, and specials classes. We're still going through those and practicing e very day. Participant 3. Like the first two teachers, Participant 3 saw the school-wide behavior expectations matrix as establishing a culture of high expectations for behavi ng which then provides for a culture of learning: I think that...um...if the whole school culture is expecting them to be on good behavior... I think is wonderful...um... because they need to know, okay, for every student in this building this is how you are supposed to behave, this is how you're supposed to act and I think eventually the behavior getting... um...under control is gonna help academics big time... this is how you act here, this is how you write things, this is how you, I mean, just saying, \"This is what you do,\" ...it's just thi s is what is expected of you and I think eventually that's gonna affect their acad emics\u2014 they're gonna know, \"Well yeah, I'm safe here. I know that I'm not gonna ge t away 183 with this. I'm gonna try my hardest,\" ... actually get down to business and unders tand that school's very important. Participant 4. Participant 4 discussed how she feels extracurricular activities such as clubs support a culture of achievement. I have a lot of [students] in my room for Science Club; I don't teach Science C lub but they use my room so that they can use my [Interactive White] Board with other rooms around them and so the [students] that I had last year, they love coming in there after school because they get to see me outside of the school setting... it doesn't seem that they're there for academic things and just having those after school things just he lps build your relationship with them just, or even seeing them outside of school out on the playground with the [other] graders, it just gets them all kind of one community. This teacher further suggested clubs and other extracurricular activities s how students that teachers care and \"the students begin to feel more at home and safe at school... sc hool can be fun and geared to their interests. When students feel safe and at home they are l ikely to try their hardest and meet academic expectations.\" Participant 4 also feels the school-wide behavior expectations matrix supports a culture of high behavior standards and stated i t \"has helped the school form into more of a learning community. Students that feel that they are part of a community feel important and want to show what they are learning.\" This t eacher also reported by having high expectations: [Students] trust you more and respect you more that you're holding up to those expectations, that their not able to just, \"Okay, she's gonna say this but I'm stil l gonna be able to do whatever I want,\" and it builds your relationship up more because they know exactly what you want of them and exactly what the expectations are. 184 Participant 4 also suggested she feels there is community transfer of the positi ve culture of the school. \"I think it's carrying over into the community,\" she stated, \"cause they're not being amazing here and then going out and having issues outside of school.\" Participant 5. Participant 5 spoke to multiple school practices as supporting a culture of high academic learning and positive behavior: With our \"Character Pledge\" that we do every morning, you know, they know that those are our expectations of the building... \"Student of the Week,\" and all those types of things. I think that it's something that they look forward to being able t o do and they know that they have to live up to those expectations in order to do that... and having the celebrations for [state] testing and things, you know, just incentive \u2014 incentives to do well in the classroom. This teacher also reported that she feels the school discipline program supports a culture of high expectations for behavior which empowers students and provides enhanced opportunities for high achievement: If a student is acting out in the classroom, you know, get em out of the classroom if, if we have to so that it doesn't impede other students' learning, and I think that's a big thing because if one student is in your classroom messing up the whole environment of your classroom, it's gonna negatively affect the other kids, so I think holding them accountable for doing a good job behaviorally is gonna help not only them but the rest of the students as well. ...I just think that they know what is expected here and, you know, practicing that throughout the day is giving them the expectations that the y know here so again hopefully, you know, when they leave school that those same values are instilled in them when they leave the building. 185 Participant observations. As previously stated, data from participant observations primarily addresse d questions 1 and 2 and to a lesser degree addressed question 4: 1. What teacher and student behaviors do teachers perceive contribute most directly to developing and maintaining positive and supportive teacher-student relationships? 2. To what extent do teachers perceive their interactions with students influence the academic and behavioral success of students in their classrooms? 4. How do teachers perceive school culture affects student behavior and academic performance and achievement? To provide for the field observations to be read and understood as coherent units the observation data is presented and analyzed chronologically by participant. Al l four of the previously identified themes were found in the analysis of the observation data. The theme of \"High Quality Instruction\" was very evident and was supported by the interpre a clearly observed and the supporting interpretive codes were \"discipline policies,\" \"rewards and recognition,\" and \"consequences.\" of \"caring,\" \"empowerment,\" and \"per sonal knowledge,\" and the theme interpreted the \"culture of achie vement,\" \"high expectations to learn,\" and \"high to behave\" codes. Participant 1 . Visiting Participant 1's classroom it was evident that this teacher effectively plans high quality instructions for student success. As she began t eaching a communication arts lesson about letter sounds she displayed letter cards with pic tures of 186 mouths and asked the students what made each sound different. She called students by name and after they responded she dignified their efforts by restating their re sponses. When a student was not accurate, she asked follow-up questions to provide for success. She then covered the letters with sticky notes and asked students what sounds the mouth picture s were saying. After discussing each mouth shape she revealed the letter and they ce lebrated as a class by giving a cheer. When inappropriate student behavior was noticed, Part icipant 1 used student names in her redirects. Her tone was calm but her intent was clear and re directed students followed her instructions. In discussing this with her, she shared she feels the manner in which she redirects her students showed them she cares and has high expect ations for their behavior. Students who were observed being redirected seemed to quickly retur n to positive active participation. Behavior redirects noted during this observation incl uded: (a) [Student Name], I'm gonna ask you one more time- sit up please; (b) If you know it r aise your hand; (c) You don't have to make the sound right now; (d) [Student Name], I need you to move your chair back to your regular seat because you aren't listening r ight now- do you need any help?; (e) [Student Name]doesn't like that- I can tell he doesn't; (f) He asked you to stop; (g) [Student Name], that's very unsafe- thanks; and (h) Five seconds to be pockets on your chair. In a math lesson Participant 1 demonstrated how she engages in high quality planning by providing for active student involvement. Specifically, she asked students to whi sper in their partners ears the number that comes after 13. She then led the class in c horally counting bear shapes to 10. She then asked her students to extend their thinking and demonstrated a culture of high expectations for learning as she asked her students to think how many mo re were needed to get to 14. Participant 1 also demonstrated instructional design that i ncluded 187 high gains instructional strategies. Specifically, in the observed lesson sh e provided for students to classify examples and non-examples on a t-chart. Instruction around sim ilarities and differences is considered high quality teaching by the school district and a high ga ins instructional strategy (Marzano et al., 2001). Participant 1 drew a t-chart o n an easel pad and labeled the first column with a happy face and the second column with a frown face. She called a student to draw out a card and to place it under the happy face if an accurat e example of the number \"14\" and under the frown face if a non-example. Each student was thanke d for participating. When determined to be a non-example this teacher asked the students to explain why. A graphic organizer was provided and each student was asked to repre sent an addition problem by drawing circles. She monitored students and gave specific feedba ck as they worked on their tasks to assess informally their understanding. As they fi nished she sat with each student and talked through the modeled problem and then had students self- evaluate their effort on an effort rubric. This demonstrated care for their l earning and reinforced the culture of achievement in her classroom. Upon entering Participant 1's classroom to observe a skills instruction period a student from a neighboring classroom was sitting in the class safe seat. Part icipant 1 served as a buddy teacher for this student's classroom. The building discipline procedure inc ludes the use of buddy rooms if homeroom safe seats are ineffective in redirecting a be havior. Participant 1 was reading a Dr, Seuss book to her students who were seated around her on the floor. She stopped at strategic places and asked recall and application questions and connected story element to classroom. During this discussion a student returned to he r room from visiting with an adult mentor and loudly and excitedly relayed what he had been doing with his mentor. The teacher paused, permitted him to share out, recognized his excit ement 188 and told him, \"That sounds like so much fun. Why don't you sit and join us now.\" This was a clear demonstration of a caring positive teacher-student relationship. When the story was finished students were directed to return to their seats where they listed words from the story on the bands of a paper \"Cat in the Hat\" hat graphic organizer. Noted redirects durin g this observation were instructional and redirected the behavior while preserving the c lassroom culture of achievement and high expectations for behavior and academics: (a) O oh, I need you out please [to student who scooted under easel]; (b) Oh, I'm gonna wait till I h ave all eyes on me...and ears; (c) Stop and look- find the adult in charge; (d) [Student name], you need to stop making noises; (e) Stop and look- I can't have 23 of my students talking to me a t once- we can't do that. Participant 2. In a classroom observation Participant 2 was facilitating a communication arts activity where her students were comparing and contrasting frogs and toads on a Venn diagram. As similarities and differences is a high gains instruct ional strategy, this was an example of effective lesson planning (Marzano et al., 2001). As an anticipatory set the students were asked to complete the Venn diagram based on what t hey already knew about frogs and toads and what they thought they knew. Students were permitted to choose places around the room to work on this task. In visiting with the teacher she shared that she tries \"to create a learning environment where students f eel safe and comfortable to try their best.\" This demonstrated caring, empowerment, and a c ulture of achievement. As students worked on their Venn diagrams Participant 2 maneuvered throug h the room informally assessing and checking on student progress. Students were t hen directed to return to their seats and their attention was directed to the Interactive Whi te Board where the teacher displayed information about frogs and toads. As they read the informat ion the 189 teacher called on students to identify facts and to underline them on the board. They were then asked to check and edit their Venn Diagrams for accuracy as the teacher comple ted a Venn diagram on the board. Generating and testing hypotheses is also a high gains instructional strategy and is an indicator of high quality instruction (Marzano et al., 2001). The teacher did make a mistake and entered a fact on the incorrect side of her mode led Venn diagram and a few students noticed, raised their hands and asked her why the fact we nt there. She told the class, \"Ooops, I made a mistake, let me correct that for you.\" T his demonstrated high academic expectations and caring as it showed her students that it is okay t o make mistakes while learning but it is important to recognize errors and to correc t them when you do. Behavior redirects were subtle and succinct: (a) Go put your hat in your cubby; ( b) Keep it on your wrist; (c) Put that away; and (d) Pass that up to me. During a math lesson students were asked to use a thermometer to measure temperature and to organize that data on a bar graph. Participant 2 engaged her stude nts by first asking questions to activate prior knowledge about temperature and graphing. S he dignified all student responses and from the responses she asked follow-up questions to clarify and further develop the overview of understanding. She then directed student attention to the Interactive White Board where she called on students to read the displayed t ext and questions and answer the posted questions. She asked the students to engage in strategic thinking to explain the mental process of determining each answer. When a student appe ared to struggle while formulating an answer this teacher used wait time and then dig nified the student's response, thanked the student for answering, and remarked, \"That was a toug h one.\" Further demonstrating high quality teaching and an effectively planned l esson, Participant 2 then displayed a graphic organizer on the Interactive White Boa rd and called 190 students to the board to list temperatures from the organized list they had create d the day before. She then passed out graphic organizers and directed her students to transfe r the data from the board to their graphing sheets. She walked the room informally assessing t heir work while answering questions, giving feedback and redirecting where needed. In dis cussing how she performs such informal formative assessments as students work, Partici pant 2 shared that she felt this conveyed importance to her students to work accurately and showed them she cared about their success. Students finished transferring the data and Parti cipant 2 had them stand up and led them through a series of stretches telling them that they were get ting oxygen in their brains and getting loosened up so they could do their best work. Through this 50 minute lesson students were actively participating and working in small gro ups. The only redirect was not for behavior but to gain attention for a new direction. To get their at tention the teacher asked the students to \"Gimme 5-4-3-2-1.\" She waited until they wer e quiet and focused on her and did not talk over them. This demonstrated high expectations for both behavior and academics and further showed her students that she cared enough about their success that she would wait until all were attending. In an observed science lesson, Participant 2 prepared a lesson and activities for her students to be actively involved in using levers to raise objects. She began by displayin g a ruler with different amounts of pennies taped to each side sitting across a marker like a see- saw. She had the students engage in the high gains instructional strategy of gene rating and testing hypotheses as she asked them to predict which side would go down if placed wit h the marker directly in the middle (Marzano et al., 2001). Students were called on to sha re ideas and all suggestions were dignified by repeating or restating the idea and if vague by asking for more information. A student was called to the table to test his hypothesis and desc ribe the 191 results. Students were then asked to think about how to make the heavier side go up. All ideas were again shared and dignified. Students were called up to adjust the ruler and t est the various hypotheses. Students were then asked to discuss in partners why the balanc e changed. Partners then shared out ideas and the shared thoughts were dignified, cl arified, and expanded upon through additional questioning. Teams were then issued rulers and markers to make their own levers and were permitted to manipulate the items to change the ba lance points. The teacher then instructed each group get two books and had them use fingers on the other side. She asked groups to figure out how to make the books rise and when successful to place their hands on their heads. This permitted her to assess their understanding as t hey completed the task. While no individual student behavior redirects were observes, two cl ass behavior redirects were noted during this lesson: (a) I'm gonna wait till y our ready; and (b) We're gonna wait till everybody's being respectful. Participant 2 also re cognized appropriate behavior and in doing so reminded others of preferred conduct: (a) Thank you for raising your hand; and (b) Our next person to read is going to wait till everyone is quiet and following along. Participant 3. Participant 3 began a Communication Arts lesson by directing student attention to the posted learning objective and telling them they would be \"using details from a story to tell the beginning, middle and end.\" This lesson asked students to participat e in the high gains instructional strategy of summarizing and note (Marzano et al. , 2001). The teacher read a snowman picture book to her students. She then displayed a snowman shaped graphic organizer. The teachers asked for details that occurred at the beginning of the st ory. She restated student responses which served to clarify and she asked follow-up questi ons when more detail was desired. One noted example was when a student reported an event and t he 192 teacher asked, \"How did she feel about that?\" The teacher then modeled completi ng the snowman graphic organizer by listing beginning elements on the head, middle elem ents on the body and ending elements on the base of the snowman. Students were then provided their own copies of the graphic organizer and told they would be identifying beginning, middle and ending details from their individual reading books. A scoring guide was shared wi th students and its components were discussed. This provided the students with the exact requirements for success. As students worked Participant 3 moved through the room informally assessing understanding, asking leading questions to prompt student t hinking, and encouraging students when needed. The only behavior redirect was subtle and respect ful. A student was getting into his desk during discussion and the teacher quietly said the st udent's name and then asked the student a question. In discussing this with her later, this teac her stated she feels it is important to provide for the success of all her students a nd redirecting this way and then including the student immediately back into the lesson shows the student she cares about his learning and communicates high expectations for learning and beha vior. Participant 3 also stressed again the importance of rewarding her students' appr opriate behavior. She uses sticker cards for students to earn incentives in her room and she also ha s special honor chairs that are different from regular school chairs for student s who have regularly demonstrated appropriate behavior. In a recent conversation she shar ed that these chairs grew to a row of honor and have now grown to a group of honor. This is a clear demonstration of a culture of achievement, high expectations for behavior, and rewards and recognition for appropriate behavior. In an observation of a Social Studies lesson Participant 3 planned for cooperative learning which is a high gains instructional strategy (Marzano et al., 2001). T he objective of 193 this lesson was to have students solve conflicts and present solutions. One student from t his class was sitting in the class safe seat. The teacher presented students a problem of \"loud music,\" listed activity directions on the board, and assigned each group member a di fferent roll. Each student wore a yarn necklace with a badge detailing each cooperat ive role title and role description. Groups were provided chart paper on which to publish their resolutions. As groups worked Participant 3 moved through the room assessing informally their understanding and the performance of each role. Feedback, encouragement and redirec ts were given to dignify effort or keep students on task. A timer was set to raise the level of concern that groups needed to get work moving along. In our discussion this teacher explained she often uses the timer to encourage her students to work with a purpose and to stay of task. This shows students a high expectation for both behavior and academics. Dur ing this observation a student was walking around looking at the work of other groups and not joining his group. The teacher parroted several times in a calm but specific manne r, \"On the ground with your group please.\" He still did not move to floor. She stayed firm with her request and again directed for him to move to the floor. He did as requested and began to participate. In discussing this exchange Participant 3 explained that she was working to have a positive relationship with this student but he sometimes struggles with immedia te compliance and she had learned from experience that if she remains calm, fir m, and consistent he will usually join in after a moment. This shows a caring willing ness to understand a child's personality and work toward achievable goals while still having high expectations for learning. When asked about the student in the safe seat the teache r explained that the student had disrespected another student by calling the student a name and that she processed with the student later and she was able to return to class. 194 Participant 4. In an observed communication arts lesson about synonyms and antonyms Participant 4 began by directing student attention to the learning objec tive posted on the Interactive White Board. She called on a student to read the objective and asked student's what they knew about the word \"synonym.\" A student said it was like \"symmet ry.\" The teacher dignified this response and stated, Synonym and symmetry have the sam e root word. What does symmetry mean?\" She called on a student who answered, \"The two sides are the same.\" Participant 4 then called a student to the Interactive White Board to click a button to reveal the definition of \"synonym.\" After the definition was read aloud the teacher called on a student to suggest a synonym for the word \"cold.\" The student said, \"Snow.\" The teacher dignified this response by stating, \"Close, snow is cold but it doesn't me an cold.\" What is another word that means the same thing as cold?\" The student seemed confuse d so the teacher stated, \"We agree that snow is cold,\" and then asked, \"What makes s now cold?\" The student stated, \"It is frozen.\" By providing specific feedback and asking these leading questions and staying with this student the student experienced success and the tea cher demonstrated care and a high expectation for learning. The teacher then asked, \" What is an antonym?\" A student was called and stated, \"It means the opposite.\" That student was then called to click the board to reveal the definition. As the definition was read the tea cher noticed she had made a typing error and pointed it out to the students and corrected the err or. This demonstrated high expectations for accurate learning and demonstrate d for her students that while mistakes are inevitable it is important to recognize and corre ct them. Participant 4 then displayed directions for the activity on the board and reviewed the directions with t he students. She asked the class what the directions meant. She asked the students to re call the rules. She asked the students, \"What do I not want to hear?\" She asked the students, \"Wha t is 195 something in the room you can use to look up words?\" By asking rather than telling, the students did the thinking and the work and owned the learning. This is high quality instruction and shows high expectations and caring for student success. Synonym mat ching cards were handed out and students were directed to locate synonym partners permi tting students to interact positively. As students found partners they began working on the ir partner activities. The teacher circulated among the pairs monitoring wor k and informally assessing understanding. She gave feedback and redirected and was available for questions and discussion as she circulated. This showed the students that she cared about their suc cess and had high expectations for their behavior and performance in the activity. Ther e were a few subtle behavior redirects noted during the observation: (a) I want you to turn your body; (b) Hold on, we're not gonna blurt out; (c) I want your eyes up here; (d) I need you t o move to the safe seat [whispered]. Participant 4 began a math lesson by echo clapping to get student attention. She the n asked the students to move up in front of the Interactive White Board and sit criss-cross applesauce. Clocks faces set to 12:00 and digital times were displayed on the board. To ge t attention the teacher asked and modeled, \"Everybody show me one finger. Put it over your mouth.\" The teacher orally shared the posted learning objective of \"time to ne arest minute.\" She asked review questions to activate prior knowledge and to check for understanding. She then led a discussion through questioning about how schedules apply to real life. She dignified all responses and asked clarification questions to further check for unders tanding. Individual students were called to the board to click the times and drag them into chronological order. As each time was moved the student was asked to read the time and explain the thinking behind why it was the next time in the sequence. Students were the n 196 called students to board manipulate clock hands to represent the sequenced times. The student representing 10:30 was asked to explain why the hour hand was placed half way between 10 and 11. Asking students to explain their thinking processes is an example of high quality instruction as such questioning causes student to process at a deeper level. P repared time lines were handed out and directions were reviewed for how to complete the tim e line activity. Clarification questions were asked to check for understanding of direc tions. A scoring guide was also provided and components were shared and discussed through questioning. Students were permitted to work at locations of their choice and the teac her moved among the students informally evaluating comprehension through observation and engaging in questioning and other dialog to provide for academic success. During this observation there was an effective instructional balance between teacher talk and student talk and students were actively engaged in the learning process which further indica ted this was an effectively planned lesson that conveyed high expectations for learning and support ed a culture of achievement. A few behavior redirects were noted: (a) [Student name ], I'd like that out of your hand; (b) Okay, the only one that has permission to talk is raising her hand; a nd (c) [Student name], do you think you can raise your hand next time? Also noted were tw o positive recognition that also served to redirect others: (a) [Student name], sinc e you are the only one who raised your hand can you tell me...?; and (b) [Student name], thank you for raising your hand. This teacher very clearly conveyed her high behavior expect ation that students are to raise their hands before responding. In a brief classroom social studies observation Participant 4 had her students wor king in groups to jigsaw state regions. Each group was assigned a region and an area of the room to work. The teacher moved about groups monitoring for completion and understanding and 197 asking and answering questions. One group began to argue among themselves and the teacher walked over and knelt down with them. She calmly asked, \"How do we solve this problem?\" A student said, \"We need to do our jobs.\" The teacher paraphrased, \"We need to work together to cooperate.\" Then she added, \"What else do we need to do?\" By engagi ng this group in a problem solving dialogue Participant 4 showed her students she cared about their behavior and their learning and permitted them own the solution and return directl y to the academic activity. Participant 5. Observing a communication arts lesson in Participant 5's classroom the teacher began by calling on a student to recall a definition of \"figurati ve language.\" The student answered, \"When something isn't real.\" The teacher dignified the re sponse stating, \"Okay, I think you are on the right track but I need a little more.\" Another student w as called who replied, \"When something real is compared to something that is not real.\" The teac her dignified this response and asked probing questions to arrive at a more complete def inition. The teacher then informed the class that today they would be working with simi les and by the end of the lesson they should be able to tell what a simile is and use it in an example. A student was called on to read the definition of \"simile\" from the dictionary. The te acher modeled writing the definition on the board and students were instructed to write it i n their journals and. Participant 5 then wrote a simile sentence on the board and asked, \"What makes this sentence a simile?\" The students struggled giving a reason so the teacher underlined the word \"like\" and asked what two nouns were being compared. A student answered by identifying a verb and the teacher dignified the answer but pointed out it was a ve rb and reminded students that a noun is a person, place or thing. Students were then able to identify the nouns and the teacher drew an arrow to connect the nouns being compared. She then 198 instructed the class to copy the sentence and markings in their journals. Having s tudents take notes in their journals is a form of \"summarizing and note taking\" which is considere d a highly effective instructional strategy (Marzano et al., 2001). A non-simil e example was then displayed on the Interactive White Board and a student was called on to explain how to change it to a simile. The student's response was dignified and the student was a sked to come to the board to make the alteration to the sentence. Wanted Poster graphic organizer s were then passed out with a scoring guide. The students were told they would be designing want ed posters where they would use similes to describe the different features of thei r own faces. Each component of the scoring guide was read and discussed and students were as ked questions to check for understanding of the assigned tasks. As students worked Partici pant 5 walked through the room checking progress and giving feedback regarding simile for mation. This provided the opportunity to assess informally their understanding and to show her students she cared about their learning. This lesson was an example of effecti vely planned and executed high quality instruction. A few behavior redirects related to off ta sk and impulsive behavior were observed. These redirects were subtle and respectful a nd showed high expectations for behavior while providing for academic success: (a) [St udent name] and [Student name], do you have what you need because we need to get started here; (b) This is the last time you are allowed to get up; (c) We don't have time to share storie s now, you can tell me later; (d) It's okay, let him, it's not your turn; (e) If you have a question raise your hand; and (f) You need to raise your hand. In an observed math lesson where students were asked to \"convert from 1 unit to another within a system of linear measurement,\" Participant 5 began by cal ling on students to brainstorm a list of linear measurements and wrote those on the board. She then direct ed 199 students' attention to the Interactive White Board and showed a short linear measur ement video. She stopped the video at an imbedded question for students to calculate mentally a linear conversion. She asked recall questions to lead the students toward application. Af ter the video concluded the students were directed to take out their rulers. The teacher use d humor to remind them of safety expectations. She asked, \"Is it okay to spin and flip them around? How about poking or hitting each other?\" Holding up a ruler she then asked her students, \"Where do you start measuring with this ruler?\" A student responded, \"At the end.\" She dignified this response stating, \"You would think so but on many rulers there is actua lly a little space between the end and where the ruler starts measuring.\" She ha d each student identify this space on their rulers. This is an example of effective planning and t eaching as this could have been a problem for many students. Participant 5 then told the students they would be \"doing a measurement scavenger hunt with partners.\" She told them they woul d start with estimating and asked what it means to estimate. A student responded \"an educated guess.\" The teacher dignified this response and pointed out that it is not a wide guess but a guess that is as close to exact as possible. She then led a discussion through questioning about how to use everyday items to estimate measurement. Identified example s were a thumb width for an inch, a shoe for a foot, and a long stride for a yard. Students were told afte r they estimated they would measure to check for reasonableness of their estima tes. Names were draw to determine partners and prepared sheets were provided to record estimat es and measurements. As students began the activity Participant 5 monitored and assis ted by asking and answering questions while informally assessing for understanding. Only two behavior redirects were noted during this observation: (a) [Student name], we don't holler out; and (b) [Student name], please stop [talking to another student during discussion]. 200 Summary This chapter has provided an overview of five individual case studies regarding regular education classroom teachers and their perceptions of how the relati onships they have with students influences learning and behavior in the classroom and when the student s leave the classroom. The narratives these teachers provided and the portraits developed fr om interviews and observations provided insight into the lived experiences and feelings a nd beliefs of these teachers. A cross-case analysis was performed by e xamining the data from each participant and comparing to the data of each of the other participants to de termine common themes. Participant journals were examined using the narrative analys is process and participant observations and interviews were analyzed through a generic coding process. In coding the data from this research, four predominant themes emerged in analyzing teachers' perceptions of how the relationships they form and maintain with their students affe cts the academic and behavioral performance of these students while in and after le aving their classrooms. These four predominant themes, each with multiple interpretive code s, are: (a) relationships; (b) culture; (c) high quality instruction; and (d) behavior manageme nt. The \"relationship\" theme was evident in the observations, interviews and participant journals. In coding the observations, interviews and participant journals the interpretive codes t hat supported the relationship theme were \"caring,\" \"personal knowledge,\" and \"em powerment.\" These teachers clearly articulated caring through personal acts towa rd and interpersonal connections with their students. These teachers made a point to ge t to know their students as learners and as individuals. They worked to incorporate student int erest into their lesson design and in daily conversation with their students. These teachers also planned for and took advantage of opportunities for students to participate in the decision making 201 process in the classroom and to feel a sense of ownership in the learning. A sense of partnership with students in the business of schooling was evident in each of these teac hers' observations, interviews and participant journals. The theme of \"culture\" was also clear in the observations, interviews and partic ipant journals and the interpretive codes that supported this theme were \"cultural knowledge ,\" \"culture of achievement,\" \"high expectations to learn,\" and \"high expectati ons to behave.\" Each of the five teacher participants had comprehensible cultural understandings of each of their students and used this knowledge to relate learning so it could best resonate with e ach student's individual background and interest areas. Designing instruction and providing learning opportunities that students could relate to permitted each of these tea chers to establish classroom cultures of achievement where students felt they were an integral a part of the learning experience and students were expected to put forth maximum effor t and to do their very best. This was evident in teacher responses and observed actions as the y provided learning environments where their students were expected to perform academic ally high and to behave appropriately within established school and classroom boundaries. A third theme that emerged in the coding of the observations, interviews and participant journals was \"behavior management\". This theme was originally identified as \"classroom management\" but as the data was coded it became clear that these teachers felt classroom management extended into all facets of the school. The interpretive code s that emerged to support \"behavior management\" policies,\" \"rewa \"punishment.\" With building discipline polic ies and behavior expectations as a guide, these teachers involved their students in developing classroom rules and expectations. School-wide rewards and recognitions for posit ive 202 behavior were also supported and enhanced by systems of rewards and recognitions in ea ch classroom. These teachers spoke of and showed evidence of imparting consequences to redirect inappropriate student behavior but there was little mention or observation of punishment and it was clear that these teachers saw that the objective was to addr ess the inappropriate behavior and to impose a consequence to redirect that behavior but saw litt le to no value to imposing a punishment above what was needed to correct the infraction. \"High quality instruction\" was a fourth theme that was obvious in the data collec ted from observations, interviews and participant journals. The supporting interpretive c feedback.\" These teachers spoke of, wrote about, and were observed using specific instructional strat egies purposefully selected and implemented to maximize student learning and academi c achievement. These teachers also shared details of how they differentiate ins truction to allow for student choice and appropriate instructional levels and this differentiation wa s also evident in classroom visits. In the interviews and participant journals these tea chers expressed why they feel feedback and praise are beneficial and necessary and how they strive to make certain they are provided. Feedback and praise were frequently observed and feedback was specific and worded so the students could understand what was correct and why it was correct or what needed attention or correction. Similarly, observ ed praise was specific to what was good about a behavior or academic task. Tables 6 through 9 illustrate the relationship of each of the discovered themes and the interpretive codes that support each theme by participant case according to each research question. 203 Table 6 Common Themes Across Cases: Research Question 1: What teacher and student behavi ors do teachers perceive contribute most directly to developing and maintaining positive and supportive teacher-student relationships?

A comprehensive review of the empirical literature showed vast rese arch around the importance of positive and supportive teacher-student relationships but did not appear to 205 inquire of teachers how they see their relationships with students affecting student success. Accordingly, it was the intent of this study to investigate the perceptions of te achers deemed to be effective regarding how they see the relationships they build with their students impacting student academic achievement and behavioral success. It is clea r that the teachers investigated in this study believe the positive and supportive relationships they have with their students do play important roles in their students' academic and behavioral succ ess in and beyond their classrooms. Chapter 5 will consider and present discoveries, implica tions, conclusions, and recommendations for educators and researchers interested in furt hering the research around the area of teacher student relationships. 206 CHAPTER 5 IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS This ethnomethodological exploratory descriptive case study was undertaken to de lve into teacher perceptions of the complexities and nuances of the interpersonal re lationships between small town elementary school teachers and the students they instruct a nd to develop an understanding of how teachers perceive those relationships affect the aca demic achievement and behavior choices of these students. Narratives and portraits of five t eachers were developed as a result of research collected through interviews, observa tions and participant journals to investigate these teacher's perspectives of how the ir relationships with students affects their students' academic and behavioral success. This rese arch took place over a two month period in the winter of 2010-2011. A plethora of studies regarding the need for positive and supportive teacher-student relationships and demonstrating the negative effect of the absence of positive a nd supportive relationships on student learning and behavior exists in the literature. Studies a round teachers' perceptions of how they can influence student learning and behavior t hrough their relationships, however, was found to be lacking. In my experiences in more than ten yea rs as a building level administrator I have witnessed teachers taking many opportuni ties to develop and maintain positive and supportive relationships with students while in their classroom s and I have watched these students return to visit these teachers and these tea chers seek out these students in subsequent years after these students have left these tea chers classrooms. Without fail, academic and discipline records show that the teachers I have obse rved who 207 take the time to form these positive and supportive relationships with their students ha ve higher academic performance across the board and fewer discipline issues. The teacher-student relationship is absolutely relevant in the current educa tional environment on No Child Left Behind (NCLB). To make Adequate Yearly Progress ( AYP), students in every subgroup must score at or above state determined levels of profic iency. The result in many school systems has been an imposed pressure to perform that forces the development and maintenance of positive and supportive relationships toward the bottom of the list of school priorities. In my experience, effective teachers reco gnize the goals and pressures of NCLB but see the development and maintenance of positive and supportive relationships with their students as a vehicle toward meeting those goals. If the purpose of schooling is to produce well-rounded students ready to assume democratic roles in society then democratic school practices help teach ers and schools accomplish that goal. Glickman (1998) cites empirical evidence that democra tic schooling promotes \"astonishing success in the intellectual achievement of all stude nts\" and leads to living enriched lives (p. 4). Glickman (1998) also provides evidence that students taught democratically outperform their skilled and drilled peers in mastering basi c skills and in learning, understanding and applying content knowledge. By embracing and adopting man y of the tenets of democratic schooling, schools can create environments where tea chers and students work together to learn and grow. Greenberg (2000) explains, offers an idealized view of democratic schooling: Like the old colonial towns that nurtured our country's political traditions, democrati c schools are self-governing. Children of all ages are entitled to participate i n all decisions affecting the school, without exception. They have a full and equal vote in 208 deciding expenditures, in hiring and firing all employees (including teache rs), and in making and enforcing the rules of the community. In democratic schools, there is no residual authority vested in adults, no veto power lurking in the background. (p. 1) This vision of democratic schooling is the extreme. It is the complete opposite of children having no voice and having education done to them. With the possible exception of an experimental school, such a school could hardly survive as defined. Such chaos would never be permitted to see its possible potential and a program of this extreme would be vi ewed as ludicrous. There is still much room and need for teaching with democratic ideals. C hildren have full time jobs learning but they should and they must have a voice in this learning. Teachers' roles should be to influence and guide learning through positive and support relationships with students rather than to direct the learning. Students work to \"do t he right thing\" due to a sense of responsibility to the learning endeavor and must have a voice in all aspects of the learning experience including determining rules, values, and norm s for their classrooms. These opportunities to have a voice give students a sense of belonging which helps to build healthy relationships and connections with peers, teachers, administrators, a nd the greater community. Democratic education is based on trust in the capability and creative ability of all and develops a sense of community among students and between teacher s and learners (\"Education for Democracy,\" n.d). Multiple studies indicate that c ommitment increases when people are provided opportunities to participate in decision making (Bacharach, Bamberger, Conley, & Bauer, 1990; Kushman, 1992). 209 Glickman et al. (2005) suggest, \"it is vital that students learn to think reflec tively, function at high stages of moral reasoning, and be autonomous decision makers\" (p. 156). Similarly, Goodlad (2004) advocates for schools that: (a) introduce young people to the idea of democracy and the behaviors associated with a \"democratic citizenry\"; (b) provide all students with an education tha t allows for their full participation in a democratic society; (c) implement a \"caring pedagogy\" to which all teachers will adhere as morally committed educators; and (d) p ractice a responsible attitude toward the \"moral stewardship\" of the school and classroom. ( p. 20) Such schools do not just happen. \"Democracy,\" according to Covaleskie (2004), \"takes a great deal of intelligent diligence and a healthy dose of altruism\" (p. 5). D arling-Hammond (1996) suggests the task of implementing democratic instruction requires skills teachers do not naturally possess. It takes dedicated education professionals committed to de mocratic concepts who are willing to put forth the hard work and face the many obstacles. Today's students will one day be running our society and they must be prepared to do so. They must be equipped to make an impact on their inherited society rather than allowin g society to make its impact on them. Accordingly, the function of school must be to prepar e our children to fulfill active and impacting roles in society. If not empowered and pr epared to participate democratically in society, the haves, for the most part, will continue to have, and the have nots, without our guidance, will continue to have not, or at least to have far less tha n the haves. Positive and supportive relationships between teachers and their students are clearly the vehicles that will deliver and maximize opportunities for student s to learn and grow into productive and positive adults. Democratic practices in schools are possi ble and 210 educators must firmly believe that it is possible and that it is important. Schools can and must enable and prepare students democratically through positive and supportive teacher-st udent relationships to function democratically. Schools must be freed from their shac kles to develop and articulate their own goals through cooperation and collaboration with tea chers, students and the greater community. Only when learning is permitted to occur within s uch a system will our young people have any real hope to succeed in school and have any rea l hope to enter society prepared to question what may not seem right and with the courage to m ake a difference (Lieberman et al., 1994). We must resist molding children to fit pre determined social needs. Conducting this research has convinced me that teachers can and must develop positive and supportive relationships with their students so that these students truly have opportunities that are not in effect predetermined by the greater society. Whi le teachers hold the power to intimidate students and keep them in their place and cause these students to fit into conformist molds from which they have a difficult time ever breaking free , teachers equally have the power to form positive and supportive relationships with kids and democratically empower them to become students who accomplish much in and out of school. These are the teachers we must develop and demand for all children. School system s must empower and support such teachers. Such teaching must become the norm rather tha n the exception. Rather than having to look for and being amazed by a \"good\" teacher, we must accept nothing less than the vision of a school where we are instead surprised when we encounter a teacher who is \"average.\" The literature is filled with theories and examples of school reform models a nd movements (Steinberg et al., 1996; Baker et al., 1997; Sleeter & Grant, 2003; Banks, 2005a; 211 Nieto, 2005). From the works of John Dewey (1916) to the modern Democratic School Movement (Apple & Beane, 1995), extensive literature considers the implications of democratic schooling (Calabrese, 1990; Lieberman et al., 1994; (1995) School a \"caring place\" where teachers became learners with stude nts. Myles Horton's (1990) Highlander Folk School was built on principles of democracy where people learned together and use education to challenge the unjust society controlling their live s. While most certainly existing in democratic schools and other models of school reform, spe cific examples of schools that have used positive and supportive teacher-student rela tionships as a catalyst for school improvement, reform, or restructuring, however, are spars e in the literature. One example of an improvement effort based at least partially on positive and supportive teacher-student relationships is the Partnership Schools Initiativ e (PSI) supported reform of Pharr-San Juan-Alamo High School in Texas' Lower Rio Grande Vall ey (Fuentes, Crum & Garcia, 1994). This region is home to some of the poorest counties in the nation with low income student populations exceeding 80% and Hispanic students comprising 98% of the student population. PSJA's school PSI improvement plan for the 1992-1993 school year focused on the human element believing that the feeling of teachers, students and parents influenced student performance and success. This improvement plan took a three - prong approach: 212 1) change staff's mental frameworks through monthly staff development sessi ons; 2) heighten student's attitudes and expectations through retreats and Saturday workshops; and 3) improve parents' understanding of their role in children's learning through parenting classes and workshops for parents. Staff development activities were designed to \"target the attitudes, rel ationships, and mental frameworks of staff, students and parents\" (p. 3). School leaders specifically designed and provided professional development to tar get attitudes and beliefs directly. They approached their reform focusing in orde r on: 1) staff development; 2) change in the attitudes and beliefs of teachers, students, and parents; 3) change in the classroom practices of teachers; and 4) change in the learning outcomes of students. Another example of a school improvement endeavor considering positive and supportive teacher-student relationships is Whitman High School's three-yea r reform effort funded by a 1988 grant from the Bay Area School Reform Collaborative (Mitra, 2003). Serving students is a northern California working class community, half of Whit man's population qualifies for free or reduced-price lunches and half are English Lang uage Learners. Student focus groups were convened to share their concerns and needs. Working with staff, these focus groups identified four areas for reform: 1) improving the school's reputation; 2) increasing counseling and informational resources for incoming ninth graders; 3) improving communication between students and teachers; and 213 4) raising the quality of teaching. Two strategies for implementing these reform efforts were emplo yed. In teacher-based endeavors such as professional development activities, students were invited to par ticipate and as a result they learned how school operates and saw school from the perspectives o f the staff. Similarly, in student-based activities, adults participated and in doing so were made aware of student needs and views. While the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo and Whitman relationship-based reforms both occurred in high schools, such improvement endeavors must certainly occur in other levels of school as well. As elementary school is the first place many students encounte r adults other than their parents in roles of authority, elementary schools are prime candida tes for such reform. This study shows that teachers who understand the importance of forming and maintaining supportive, positive relationships with their students understand that this behavior, whether deliberate or natural, directly and positively influences t he academic and behavior successes of their students. As a deep, intense investigation is necessary to begin to consider the multi-faceted dimensions of teacher-student relationships, a qualita tive research design best met this need. As a qualitative researcher, I was the instrument t hat gathered the data and was able to observe the setting naturally in my immersed position as the bui lding principal. Five grade-level teachers were selected using purposive crit erion based sampling methods. These teachers were unique in that they were found to have positive relations hips with students according to the district's professional performance evaluati on instrument and common in that they were all Caucasian female general education classroom teachers. 214 Implications The focus of this study was to investigate the perceptions of teachers regardi ng the relationships between these teachers and their students and how these teachers perceive these relationships affect student achievement and student behavior. Teachers are very pow erful in the lives of their students and they have the power to positively or negatively aff ect the lives of every student they instruct. Most students enter school with a love of learning and a de sire to succeed. Teachers can either make or break the success of many of these students. Teachers must be aware of this power and of the affect they have on the childhoods a nd futures of each and every student under their charge. Teaching is an awesome responsi bility and one that must not be taken lightly and one that not every college graduate with a teac hing certification or license should undertake. Teachers who do not recognize the treme ndous power they wield over children have the potential to destroy desire and self est eem and should find other lines of employment. Teachers must believe in all students and must value their students and show these students that they are valued by word and by deed. Developing and maintaining positive teacher-student relationships where students feel valued and empowered to partici pate in the learning process must permeate every nuance of a teacher's day. Students w ho feel valued, empowered, and safe, are more likely to participate more fully in their own educat ions and to mature into adult citizens who feel empowered to participate more fully in the gr eater society. Recommendations For many teachers, having productive relationships with students is natural. Too many teachers, however, do not seem to put forth the effort to build and maintain positive 215 and supportive relationships with their students. They might be friendly toward their students and they might want the best for them but the relationships they form with students do not support their learning and development to the extent required for students to experie nce maximum success. Whether from fear of the sanctions of No Child Left Behi nd, from pressure from district or building administration to produce results, from lack of pr ofessional support, or from a pure lack of caring or from a desire to feel superior to their students , these teachers, by not forming positive and supportive relationships with students, are fai ling to serve their students' needs. These teachers must have their energies refocus ed or they must be removed from the classrooms. The cost of permitting them to maintain the status quo is simply too great. The mission of every district, every school, and every classroom must be for every teacher, administrator, and support personnel to work to develop and maintain positive and supportive relationships with each and every student to maximize opportunities for e ach and every student to achieve at academically high levels and operate within a pres cribed system of building and classroom behavior expectations so that each and every student experie nces maximum success and is prepared to succeed in the greater society. Anything l ess is unacceptable. The following recommendations are offered as a starting place for distric ts, schools, and teacher preparatory programs to consider: 1. Teacher preparation programs must include courses that consider the teacher- student relationship. Students in these programs should study accounts of teachers deemed to have positive and supportive relationships with their students and how those relationships affected academics and behavior. They should also consider 216 accounts of teachers who were deemed to not have such positive and supportive relationships and how academics and behavior were affected in those settings. Future teachers should also observe teachers deemed to have positive and supportive relationships with their students and other teachers who may or may not have such positive and supportive relationships and they should consider the influence of each teacher on the lives of their students. 2. Teacher selection instruments must facilitate identification of teach er candidates who have the skills, abilities, and competencies to develop and maintain positive and supportive relationships with students. Whether the instrument and procedure is a research based reliable and valid commercial product or is developed at the selection level, the process must be designed to recognize candidates who are highly predictable of being able to develop positive and supportive relationships with students. 3. Professional development in every school system must consider the teacher- student relationship and the affect of these relationships on the lives of students. Teachers should develop individual SMART goals around their relationships with their students and should build in measures of accountability such as student and parent surveys to check on their personal progress. Teachers should be provided opportunities to converse with peers and support each other in the development and maintenance of positive and supportive relationships with students and to reflect on the success and struggles in this endeavor. 4. Professional performance evaluation instruments should be designed to measure effort put forth by teachers in developing and maintaining these relationships. 217 Teachers should be able to respond in writing or verbally to a set of questions regarding these efforts and successes and struggles encountered. Informa tion and ideas from successes can be shared with others to aid in the development of positive and supportive teacher-student relationships and the identified struggles can provide targets for enhanced professional development. 5. Teacher evaluation processes should focus on coaching teachers toward effecti ve student relationship practices. Ineffective of less effective teachers found to not be working toward the development and maintenance of positive and support relationships with students should have professional improvement plans developed with specific steps identified to move toward this development and maintenance of positive and support relationships. If such teachers continue to fail to develop and maintain positive and support relationships with students, these teachers need to be dismissed from their teaching positions. These recommendations are by no means exhaustive but if considered and followed the students served will clearly be the beneficiaries. Future Research Needs As this study only considered the experiences and perceptions of five teache rs in a single small town Midwestern elementary school, future research is needed that will consider an increased sample size, various demographics, and other locations. Future rese archers endeavoring to research the affect of relationships between teachers and st udents should consider the following: 1. Research conducted by a researcher with whom the teachers do not have a professional relationship. 218 2. Research conducted in urban, suburban, rural and other small town school systems. 3. Research conducted in larger school systems. 4. Research conducted in the middle and high school grades. 5. Research conducted in schools that are more affluent and schools with higher poverty levels. 6. Research conducted in schools with higher student mobility rates and schools whose populations are more stable. 7. Research conducted to study teachers in high performing schools and in struggling programs. 8. Research conducted in a longitudinal study to consider the experiences of students as they progress through the grades. 9. Research conducted regarding students who have been retained and have the same teacher for the subsequent year or a different teacher when repeating the grade. 10. Research conducted regarding teachers, moving from one school setting to another, who are deemed to have positive and supportive relationships with their students. 11. Research conducted to compare teachers from preparatory institutions that st ress the teacher-student relationship and teachers from institutions where the teac her- student relationship is not a strong consideration. 12. Research conducted regarding teacher applicants selected through a procedure designed to predictably identify which ones are able to form and maintain positive and supportive relationships with students. 219 13. Research conducted to examine the affect of a professional development focus on building and maintaining teacher-student relationships and their effect on student success. 14. Research conducted to examine the affect of teacher evaluation procedures t hat consider positive and supportive teacher-student relationships. This listing of future directions for research is certainly not a conclusive li st but a starting place for researchers interested examining how teachers perceive they affect the lives of students in various demographic situations. Summary and Conclusion This ethnomethodological exploratory descriptive case study informed through the lenses of narratology and portraiture explored the perceptions of five smal l town general education elementary school teachers regarding how they perceive the r elationships they build and maintain with their students supports student academic and behavioral succe ss. During the winter of 2010-2011, interviews were conducted with each teacher, observat ions were made of each teacher interacting with students, and participant journal s were provided by each teacher. The data from the journals, interviews and observations were a nalyzed, coded, and organized by theme and presented in chapter 4 and again in chapter 5. Many studies exist in the literature concerning the benefit of positive and suppor tive teacher-student relationships but studies considering how teachers perceive they influence student learning and behavior through their relationships were not apparent. As a teacher and administrator I felt my interactions with students and the relationships I enjoyed with students made a positive difference. As an administrator I observed teacher s who worked to develop and maintain positive and supportive relationships with students, and I observed, 220 coached, and occasionally non-renewed contracts of teachers who did not see the teac her- student relationship as important. The pressure to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), and the mandates and of sanctions of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) weighs on most school systems and the administrators and teachers within. While some teachers appear to feel the pr essures of teaching maximum content so their students perform well on state assessme nts leaves little room for relationship building, I have observed and worked with many effective teach ers who recognize and accept the goals and pressures of NCLB but rely the developme nt and maintenance of positive and supportive relationships with their students to help these students develop the competencies needed to reach their goals. 221 APPENDIX A 2008-2009 Building Enrollment 27 78 88 63 90 76 76 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Preschool Kindergarten 1st Grade 2nd Grade 3rd Grade 4th Grade 5th Grade Number of Students 222 APPENDIX B 223 APPENDIX C Free and Reduced Lunch Eligibility 49.0 46.0 47.7 47.3 50.7 54.4 0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 2004-2005 2005-2006 2006-2007 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2 010 Percentage of Students 224 APPENDIX D Race/Ethnicity 7.7 7.0 6.4 8.7 8.9 1.1 2.8 1.8 2.0 1.7 91.2 89.3 90.9 88.7 88.3 0.0 0.9 0.9 0.6 1.0 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2004-2005 2005-2006 2006-2007 2007-2008 2008-2009 Percentage of Students African American Hispanic Caucasian Other 225 APPENDIX E Yearly Building Attendance 95.6 95.3 95.5 95.3 95.2 95.3 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 2004-2005 2005-2006 2006-2007 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2 010 Daily APPENDIX F SSIRB APPROVAL LETTER Study SS10-54: The Power of Teacher-Student Relatio nships in Determining Student barrethr@umkc.edu Sent: Friday, Barreth, Ed.S. 2036 North 66th Terrace Kansas City, KS 66104 Dear Michael Camp, The UMKC Social Sciences Institutional Review Board approved your research protocol #SS10-54: The Powe r of Teacher-Student Relationships in Determining Stu dent Success\" on 10/14/2010 pending revisions to th e informed consent form.

He attended Kindergarten through the beginning of fifth grade in Omaha. For the balance of fi fth grade through high school, Mr. Camp attended school in Bonner Springs, Kansas where he graduated in 1983. Earning a scholarship to Donnelly College in Kansas City, Kansas, he attended one year and then took a position in retail management. Not finding this care er path fulfilling, Mr. Camp returned to Donnelly College and earned an A.S. in Business in1988. He followed this degree with a brief career in food service management. Still not satisfied with this career choice he enrolled at the University of Kansas in Lawrence i n 1991 and graduated with B.S.E. in Elementary Education in 1993. A certification year followed in the Tur ner School District in Kansas City, Kansas. Mr. Camp began his teaching career as a fifth grade classroom teacher i n the North Kansas City School District in Gladstone, Missouri in January 1995. During his tenur e with North Kansas City, Mr. Camp earned M.A. and Ed.S. degrees in Education Administration through the University of Missouri- Kansas City. After five and one half ye ars he left the elementary classroom for a middle school teaching and coaching experience in the Blue Valley School District in Overland Park, Kansas. The following year brought an opportunity to return to the Turner School District as a middle school teacher and coach with administrative responsibilities. After one semester, Mr. Camp accepted a f ull-time middle school assistant principal position with Turner Schools and after four years beca me an elementary principal in the Turner District. After leading the school f or four years, the staff and students earned Adequate Yearly Progress in all areas of the state as sessment test. 268 During Mr. Camp's tenure with Turner Schools, he was accepted into an Ed.D. cohort at the University of Missouri- Kansas City where he studied with other profess ional educators and school leaders\u2014many serving in Missouri. Seeking new leadership opportunities, Mr. Camp accepted a position as an elementary principal in the Lafa yette County C-1 School District in Higginsville, Missouri in 2009. In his first year as pr incipal, the district was accredited with distinction in performance\u2014a recognition not r eceived since 2001. Mr. Camp's pursuit of a Doctoral degree is grounded in his continual desire to significantly and positively influence the lives of children. "}
