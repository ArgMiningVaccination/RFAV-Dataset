Metaphysical Properties - Connected to the lower chakras - Awakens your warrior spirit Like many orange [healing](https://tinyrituals.co/blogs/tiny-rituals/how-to-use-crystals-for-healing) stones, Carnelian is connected to the three lower chakras. The Root Chakra is the foundation of all our chakras, it's where our safety sits and keeps us grounded to the world that holds us. If the Root Chakra is blocked, it may feel like you are totally off balance and that you live life constantly feeling on edge and in a place of insecurity.

The final [chakra](https://tinyrituals.co/collections/chakra-crystal-bracelets) connected to Carnelian is the Solar Plexus Chakra, the place where our personal power burns.

Virgos are already creative and passionate and the Carnelian serves to keep them in this space. But sometimes, the Virgo can be a little tough on themselves and can also second guess themselves.
