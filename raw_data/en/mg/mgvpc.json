But in some cases, scented candles can be hazardous to your health, releasing toxins into the air and contributing to indoor air pollution. Although it depends on the candle, most release various types of toxic chemicals, such as benzene and toluene, both of which may affect the central nervous system. Chemicals in candle fragrances can cause damage to the lungs, brain, and central nervous system, as well as developmental difficulties, asthma attacks, and migraines. Diffusing Essential Oils [Organic essential oils](https://shop.bydesign.com/PureHaven/#/shop/from/2129?) provide a safe, effective alternative to toxic scented candles. They smell incredible and enhance mind, body, and spirit. Choose based on your scent preference and/or the benefits essential oils offer, such as supporting breathing (eucalyptus), soothing an upset stomach (peppermint), or creating a relaxing environment (cedarwood). Using an oil diffuser helps to disperse essential oil molecules into the air, giving your space a natural scent and helping you reap amazing benefits. However, using an electric, battery-operated, or candle-powered diffuser isn't always feasible. For a more portable, quick fix of your favorite essential oil, try one of these methods: - Bottle: The easiest way to enjoy the aromatic benefits of essential oil is directly from the bottle. Uncap the essential oil bottle, hold it a few inches from your nose, and move your hand back and forth over the bottle to wave the vapors toward your nose. - Hands: Place a drop or two of essential oil into your palm, rub hands together, and then cup your hands over your nose and inhale deeply. - Tissue: Diffusing oils on a tissue is inexpensive, requires no equipment, and can be done anywhere, anytime. Place 2-3 drops of essential oil on a tissue and keep it nearby. You can tuck it into an air vent in your car or simply hold it close to your nose and breathe in. Refresh with 1 drop every hour. - Room Spray: A quick spritz into the air helps freshen a room and mask odors. Fill a spray bottle with distilled water. Add 5-6 drops of essential oils for every ounce of water to create a 1% dilution, 10-12 drops for a 2% dilution, and so on. Since essential oils vary in strength, start with less. You can always add more. - Jewelry: Terracotta pendant diffusers can be worn on a necklace or bracelet. They're great for emitting a signature scent without putting it on your skin. Simply apply a few drops of essential oil to the pendant and breathe in the molecules as the oil evaporates. Refresh with 1 drop as needed. - Toilet Paper Roll: A great way to keep your bathroom smelling fresh is to put a few drops of essential oil on the cardboard tube inside a roll of toilet paper. Every time someone unrolls some toilet paper, air will flow across the essential oil and diffuse it into the air. - Cotton Ball: For a quick burst of essential oils, place a few drops onto a cotton ball, and then place the cotton ball in your car vent, floor vent, or even on the blade of a fan \u2014 just be sure to turn off and unplug your fan before taping the cotton ball to the fan, and completely remove your hands from the fan before plugging it in and turning it on. - Pillow Case: Drift off to sleep with the safe scent of essential oils. Just a couple of drops on the corner of your pillow case is all it takes!
