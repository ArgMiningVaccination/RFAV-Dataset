In response to a mandate from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), smoking will no longer be allowed in the 175,636 apartments and 2,418 buildings that make up NYCHA, as well as areas within 25 feet of a NYCHA building. This initiative, called Smoke-Free NYCHA, is an important opportunity to improve the health of the 1 in 14 New Yorkers who call NYCHA home and to address longstanding inequities in health faced by residents, who are predominantly low-income people of color. A key component of Smoke-Free NYCHA was the formation of the Advisory Group on Smoking and Health, made up of eight NYCHA resident members and eight members from partner agencies and organizations. With diverse expertise and perspectives, the Advisory Group was able to identify and address issues and challenges related to implementation and to develop concrete strategies to address them. These challenges are numerous. In addition to its large scale (with approximately 400,000 residents, it's larger than many major cities), NYCHA was provided only 18 months to design and implement the smoke-free policy. NYCHA also faces severe budget constraints, experiencing a $3 billion reduction in federal operating and capital funding since 2001. Within these constraints, strong partnerships with residents, as well as partners in government, advocacy organizations, hospitals, and academia, are critical to ensuring that implementation is thoughtful, considerate of the needs of different populations, and supported by many different stakeholders. NYCHA is building these partnerships through a broad strategy that engaged residents and partners early in the policy development and implementation planning process, as described later in this document. NYCHA incorporated feedback about hopes, concerns, experiences, and ideas into a multi-dimensional strategy to improve the health of its residents. This document is a summary of the work conducted by the Advisory Group. It presents a vision and a set of guiding principles for Smoke-Free NYCHA as well as recommended strategies and activities to support implementation. It also includes some of the commitments made by Advisory Group members to support implementation through education, cessation support, communication tools, and evaluation. The Advisory Group invites you to join the growing network of organizations working with NYCHA to go smoke-free by supporting the strategies outlined in this document. Implementing Smoke-Free NYCHA is a gradual process, but with the partnership, long-term commitment, and support from residents and partners, it will succeed.2 3Background: Smoking & Health at NYCHA It's in the hallway, it's coming into my house, and I'm a non-smoker with asthmatic kids.1 My son got sick when we moved here. He has asthma, and he got it because of people smoking. I have to give him medicine and do a lot to keep the smoke out of my home.2Smoking rates in New York City have been declining since 2002, but NYCHA residents still smoke at rates higher than other New Yorkers. The background to a recent study of East Harlem residents that examined smoking points to a number of factors, including stress, discrimination, targeted advertising, and longstanding economic, physical, and structural barriers to cessation and prevention, to explain this gap. High smoking rates also mean that non-smoking NYCHA residents are disproportionately impacted by secondhand smoke. According to a 2012 survey, more than half of NYCHA residents report smelling smoke at home.3Advisory Group Members The American Cancer Society Jacqueline Arroyo, NYCHA Resident and NYCHA Board Member Melanie Aucello, NYCHA Resident Monica Corbett, NYCHA Resident Maida Galvez, Mt.

DISCLAIMER: This report was drafted by Elizabeth Hamby, the Acting Director of Health Equity in All Policies at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. it synthesizes the discussions and recommendations of the Advisory Group on Smoking and Health, which included participants of diverse expertise and affiliations. The findings and recommendations expressed in this report are a summary of the Advisory Group's collective work, and they do not necessarily represent the views of the employers or affiliate institutions of the Advisory Group members.4 5Advisory Group Process May 2017 Advisory Group Member SolicitationThe Advisory Group on Smoking and Health was facilitated by Elizabeth Hamby, Assistant Director of Public Housing and Health at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Group members met on a bi-weekly basis from June through October 2017. They used a variety of tools to explore resident feedback, build empathy for resident experience, and design recommendations that are tailored to the particular needs and concerns of NYCHA communities. These tools, combined with the group's expertise in tobacco control, cessation, advocacy, public health, and NYCHA resident leadership, produced a rich set of insights and ideas, all of which informed the development of this document. What we're trying to do at 830 Amsterdam is become a family who really cares about where they live, who cares about their children, who cares about the air. We want to be that model building who knows that there are certain things that are not healthy for us.4 Shirley Williams, Advisory Group Member and 830 Amsterdam Resident Association PresidentJune 2017 Kickoff Meeting July 2017 Deep Dive Meeting: Education Dive Meeting: Cessation August 2017 Deep Dive Meeting: Signage & Communications 2017 Deep Dive Meeting: StressOctober 2017 Deep Dive Meeting: Enforcement & Other 2017 Synthesis Meeting: Vision & RecommendationsVision Smoke-Free NYCHA should improve the health of NYCHA residents by creating cleaner indoor air, expanding opportunities for resident leadership, and increasing access to resources to prevent smoking and to help people who want to quit. Implementation should be grounded in a long- term commitment to improving the health of NYCHA residents, which is negatively impacted by secondhand smoke and other factors. Implementation should be transparent, accountable, and inclusive of residents' feedback and guidance. Implementation should be leveraged to support NYCHA resident engagement and leadership. Implementation should be responsive to the needs and priorities of different communities and developments.6Education New and current NYCHA resident leaders can facilitate the implementation of Smoke-Free NYCHA through training and support. The Advisory Group discussed many different strategies to help residents understand the importance of Smoke- Free NYCHA and to work together to create healthy, smoke-free environments. The Advisory Group recommended offering training and education tailored to the needs and priorities of residents and resident leaders. Create an implementation toolkit or handbook, including talking points, activities, and available resources, that these leaders can use to support activities in their development. T rain residents to develop local campaigns to support successful implementation at their development and to organize their neighbors to fight back against the tobacco industry.For leaders who are ready to get started For residents who want to become leadersHelp residents host workshops exploring the root causes of high smoking rates, including targeted marketing by the tobacco industry. For residents & leaders who care about social justice Ensure that meetings facilitate networking and coordination among residents to lay the groundwork for future collaboration on implementation.For residents & leaders who want to grow their networks Help residents host workshops that use research and data to illuminate the differences in health outcomes between NYCHA residents and other New Yorkers.For residents & leaders who care about health & equity Encourage NYCHA to host workshops that comprehensively discuss efforts underway to create healthier homes at NYCHA.For residents & leaders who care about the environment9Support for people who want to quit smoking Smoke-Free NYCHA does not require residents to quit smoking, but research shows that more than two-thirds of people who smoke try to quit every year, and smoke-free housing can help people who smoke to smoke less or quit entirely.5 Partners can work with NYCHA to provide multi-level support for cessation that will help quitters succeed. Removing barriers to quit-smoking medications and other forms of support can facilitate the first steps of the cessation journey, and cessation support through peer counseling and navigation can provide leadership and employment opportunities for NYCHA residents.Increase access to cessation medicationsIncrease opportunities for community & leadership development Incentives CommunicationsOther priorities and OpportunitiesCessation big ideasFinancing for medicationsNRT at all community centersCessation support kits at Management Offices, TAs Sponsor programs (like 12 step)Paid peer support programsIn-building cessation programming Community Health Workers in every building Stipends for leaders (that don't impact rents)Gift cards or Metrocards for people who reach milestones Pride in your neighborhood initiatives (get a new couch, paint, etc.) Rotating and ongoing media campaigns High-profile champion (like Beyonce, Jay-Z), or a basketball player) to bring visibility.A concertAddress capital needs (ventilation) Monthly Meet and Greet for all residents (with food!) Mind map of cessation ideas generated during brainstorming discussing during July 2017 deep dive discussion on cessation. Increase awareness and capacity of current resources Many resources already exist to help people who want to go smoke-free along with their building. Through implementation, Smoke-Free NYCHA and partners can: Promote the NY State Smokers' Quitline, Help Me Quit app, NYC Quits Facebook page, and NYC Quits webpage Build partnerships to raise awareness of Medicaid benefits and rule changes among providers and health systems that serve NYCHA residents Support quitting by making medication and counseling available at NYCHA community centers Increase opportunities for NYCHA residents to help other residents quit smoking NYCHA residents can support friends, family, and neighbors who want to go smoke-free. Whether they are recognized as Community Health Workers (CHW) or simply advocates for health and wellness, residents can be trained to support one another by providing connections to resources as well as motivation and encouragement for quitters. At the Boston Public Housing Authority, which went smoke-free in 2012, residents who were trained as Tobacco T reatment Advocates successfully helped smokers quit and stay smoke- free. Increase the number of CHWs working with NYCHA residents T rain existing CHWs as peer navigators and/or cessation counselors T rain NYCHA staff and resident leaders who work with NYCHA residents (i.e., Resident Watch, Resident Engagement staff, Resident Associations) as peer navigators Offer incentives to generate excitement around cessation and celebrate those who succeed in going smoke-free Highlight special days, including New Year's Day, Kick Butts Day (March 21), World No Tobacco Day (May 31), Great American Smokeout (November 15), and July 30, 2018 (Smoke-Free NYCHA kickoff date), and create special offers (such as free nicotine replacement therapy) for quitters * Celebrate \"early adopter\" developments and individuals with events, press highlights, and/or certificates10 11Signage & Communications Communication strategies that are tailored to the communities who live at NYCHA and use targeted channels and media are key to successful implementation. New, permanent \"No Smoking\" signage, as well as signs with information about Smoke-Free NYCHA, will be installed in NYCHA buildings across the city. Additional posters, signage, and communication strategies should be developed and deployed by NYCHA and partners as part of educational strategies and to connect residents who want to quit smoking with support and resources. Signage is not the only way to share information about Smoke-Free NYCHA. Media and outreach campaigns across a variety of platforms, as well as person-to-person communications, help ensure that everyone understands the rule. And communication strategies that help residents talk to one another about smoking, secondhand smoke, and creating healthier indoor environments are key to the long-term sustainability of Smoke-Free NYCHA and other NYCHA health initiatives. The key messages that everyone should hear are: Tobacco companies target low-income communities of color Smoke-free housing is a valuable health benefit that everyone should be able to access Let's work together so that everyone can live in a smoke- free home We all share the air Quitting is hard, but you can do it, and we can help New, permanent signage will be installed throughout NYCHA developments notifying residents and guests of the smoke-free policy. The Advisory Group recommends that: Signage is written in the languages most commonly spoken at each development Signage includes information on how to report a violation and how to get support to quit smoking Signage stands out from other signage Temporary \"pop-up\" signage targets places where smoking occurs instead of targeting people who smoke Key Messengers NYCHA DOHMH Residents and Resident Leaders People who have successfully quit smoking Local champions of Smoke-Free NYCHA Partners Youth Elected Officials Key platforms/media Social media (memes, videos, infographics, photo stories, e-newsletter) Pop-up information/education stations (Family Days, Lobby Meetings, RA Meetings, etc.) NYCHA Journal Robo-calls Posters Palm cards Indoor and outdoor signage with maps Website12 13Reducing Stressors, Managing Smoking Triggers, and Building Community Bonds Throughout the engagement process, NYCHA residents described stress as a major factor in their lives. Both people who smoke and those who don't smoke described stressors ranging from family issues to discrimination and housing quality. People may smoke as a way to handle stress, especially in the short term. We recognize the importance of strategies that help reduce stressors overall across the population, managing smoking triggers, and building community bonds, as they will have longer lasting effects and increase the chances of successful smoking cessation. If people had help managing stress, you would see a lot less smoking.6 Create employment opportunities for NYCHA residents as a key implementation strategy for Smoke-Free NYCHA Create opportunities for NYCHA residents to network and build community Support community organizing efforts to address ongoing stressors (including transportation, pollution, policing, etc.Reduce stressors Build the capacity of resident leaders to host healing circles, meditation, and yoga at NYCHA developments Improve indoor environments Improve outdoor environments (especially safety) Incorporate stress relief activities into Smoke-Free NYCHA meetings and events Host cultural events, exercise classes, and other programsManage Smoking Triggers and Build Community Bonds As neighbors, we have to stick together.7 14 15Clear consequences for people who break the rules During the engagement process, NYCHA residents expressed frustration with neighbors' violations of existing policies, including smoking in common areas. In the focus groups, participants were \"frustrated by exposure in common areas but also by smoke entering their apartments from smoking in front of their doors and from other apartments where people smoke. \" Conversely, there were concerns that enforcement could be too aggressive, leading to eviction or police involvement. According to NYCHA 's \"Statement on Smoke-Free Housing\" from its 2018 Annual Plan, \"NYCHA staff observing violations can report them to the Property Management Office. Residents may report violations as well by calling the Customer Contact Center and providing details of the violation. Violations will be documented. After a staff member has observed a resident violating the policy, or in response to multiple resident-generated complaints that a resident has violated the policy, Property Management will conduct an informal conference with the resident to discuss the violation or violations. Property Management will provide materials to educate the resident on smoking and health topics such as the health effects of secondhand smoke and strategies to take smoking outside the buildings and the 25-foot perimeter. Property Management will also provide the resident with available smoking cessation resources. The lessee (and co-lessee) will agree in writing to comply with the smoke-free policy and will acknowledge that further violations can result in the commencement of termination of tenancy proceedings. \"Overall Feedback from the Advisory Group Enforcement, education, and communications need to be closely coordinated and aligned to ensure that residents have accurate information, a clear sense of enforcement protocol, and know what to do if they witness a violation. Self-enforcement will be key. Create a culture of non-smoking and find a way to reward positive behavior rather than just punishing negative behavior. Respond to breaches Focus on places where people smoke rather than people who smoke. For places where there are many complaints of smoking, increase signage and other efforts. Some hospitals created palm cards that they give to people violating their outdoor no-smoking policies. This is a non-confrontational way to deliver a simple no-smoking message as well as information on how to quit. These could be distributed by staff or resident ambassadors. A person who smokes may be more receptive to a message delivered in this manner. They're smoking outside, in the courtyard, in the staircase, in the hallway, in front of your door, even though it's not their door and the hallway's clouded full of smoke.8 Yes, it says 'No Smoking', but people stand in front of your door to smoke, and that smoke gets inside your apart- ment, so you suffer. I have allergies.916 17Other issues NYCHA residents consistently shared that exposure to marijuana smoke was a persistent and related issue that must be addressed along with exposure to tobacco smoke. Since Marijuana is currently illegal, neither HUD nor NYCHA will directly address it through policy. However, many residents feel that secondhand marijuana smoke is a nuisance (in some cases more of a nuisance than cigarette smoke). Conversely, residents are extremely wary of enforcement strategies that include police. Therefore, the Advisory Group recommended that marijuana be incorporated into self-enforcement strategies for Smoke-Free NYCHA, including education and communications. Incorporate marijuana into self-enforcement strategies for Smoke-Free NYCHA Facilitate community dialogue about marijuana Provide education on the health hazards associated with marijuana smoking Explore resources for marijuana cessation support Use broad language to describe \"no smoking\" rules that can be interpreted to include marijuana Conclusion & Next Steps NYCHA, the largest residential landlord in New York City, is home to 1 in 14 New Yorkers. On July 30, 2018, it will have the broadest smoke-free public housing policy in the country. Implementa- tion will be an ongoing process, requiring support from residents, staff, leadership, and partners in government, City agencies, and non-profits. The strategies in this document offer a path forward for a transparent, accountable, and responsive process to implement Smoke-Free NYCHA - because we all share the air.Commitments & Progress to date NYCHA and partner organizations have made significant progress ahead of the launch of Smoke- Free NYCHA on July 30, 2018.
