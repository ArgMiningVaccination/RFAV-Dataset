To understand mechanisms of inflammation, animal models that reflect genetic diversity and clinical outcomes observed in humans are needed. We report a mouse panel comprising the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains crossed to human ACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) that confers susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Infection of CC x K18-hACE2 resulted in a spectrum of survival, viral replication kinetics, and immune profiles. Importantly, in contrast to the K18-hACE2 model, early type I interferon (IFN-I) and regulated proinflammatory responses were required for control of SARS-CoV-2 replication in PWK x K18-hACE2 mice that were highly resistant to disease. Thus, virus dynamics and inflammation observed in COVID-19 can be modeled in diverse mouse strains that provide a genetically tractable platform for understanding anti-coronavirus immunity.

We report analysis of common genetic variations contributing to mitochondrial and heart functions using an integrative proteomics approach in a panel of inbred mouse strains called the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP). We performed a whole heart proteome study in the HMDP (72 strains, n=2-3 mice) and retrieved 848 mitochondrial proteins (quantified in 50 strains). High-resolution association mapping on their relative abundance levels revealed three trans-acting genetic loci on chromosomes (chr) 7, 13 and 17 that regulate distinct classes of mitochondrial proteins as well as cardiac hypertrophy. DAVID enrichment analyses of genes regulated by each of the loci revealed that the chr13 locus was highly enriched for complex-I proteins (24 proteins, P=2.2E-61), the chr17 locus for ubiquinone biosynthesis (3 regional mapping identified NDUFS4, LRPPRC and COQ7 as the candidate genes for chr13, chr17 and chr7 loci, respectively, and both experimental and statistical analyses supported their causal roles. Furthermore, a large cohort of Diversity Outbred mice was used to corroborate Lrpprc gene as a driver of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded gene regulation, and to show that the chr17 locus is specific to heart. Variations in all three loci were associated with heart mass in at least one of two independent heart stress models, namely, isoproterenol-induced heart failure and diet-induced obesity. These findings suggest that common variations in certain mitochondrial proteins can act in trans to influence tissue-specific mitochondrial functions and contribute to heart hypertrophy, elucidating mechanisms that may underlie genetic susceptibility to heart failure in human populations.

In male mice, the combination of Rapa and Aca started at 9 months and led to a longer lifespan than in either of the two prior cohorts of mice treated with Rapa only, suggesting that this drug combination was more potent than either of its components used alone. In females, lifespan in mice receiving both drugs was neither higher nor lower than that seen previously in Rapa only, perhaps reflecting the limited survival benefits seen in prior cohorts of females receiving Aca alone. Capt led to a significant, though small (4% or 5%), increase in female lifespan. Capt also showed some possible benefits in male mice, but the interpretation was complicated by the unusually low survival of controls at one of the three test sites. BD seemed to produce a small (2%) increase in females, but only if the analysis included data from the site with unusually short-lived controls. None of the other 4 tested agents led to any lifespan benefit. The C2017 ITP dataset shows that combinations of anti-aging drugs may have effects that surpass the benefits produced by either drug used alone, and that additional studies of captopril, over a wider range of doses, are likely to be rewarding.

Members of the research community propose compounds for study, and lifespan and health studies are performed at three sites to demonstrate the degree of reproducibility. A genetically heterogeneous mouse model is used to reduce the influence of strain-specific characteristics on the outcomes, and sufficient mice are used to detect a 10% change in mean lifespan with 80% power if at least two sites contribute data. There have been several positive findings that have prompted additional studies within the ITP and from the broader research community, including data on rapamycin, acarbose, 17-estradiol, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, Protandim, and glycine. This chapter describes the ITP structure, summarizes findings to date and how they have led to additional studies, and discusses the future role of the ITP in promoting research on antiaging interventions.

Aberrant activation of the adaptive immune system in response to myocardial necrosis has recently been implicated in the development of heart failure. The \u00df-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol hydrochloride is used for its cardiac effects in a variety of different dosing regimens with high doses causing acute cardiomyocyte necrosis. To assess whether isoproterenol-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis triggers an adaptive immune response against the heart, we treated C57BL/6J mice with a single intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol. We confirmed tissue damage reminiscent of human type 2 myocardial infarction. This is followed by an adaptive immune response targeting the heart as demonstrated by the activation of T cells, the presence of anti-heart auto-antibodies in the serum as late as 12 weeks after initial challenge and IgG deposition in the myocardium. All of these are hallmark signs of an established autoimmune response. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from isoproterenol-treated mice induces left ventricular dilation and impairs cardiac function in healthy recipients. In summary, a single administration of a high dose of isoproterenol is a suitable high-throughput model for future studies of the pathological mechanisms of anti-heart autoimmunity and to test potential immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches. Hart AJ, Johnson GH, [et al.](#), 2021, [Identification of the Adult Hematopoietic Liver as the Primary Reservoir for the Recruitment of Pro-regenerative Macrophages Required for Salamander Limb Regeneration.](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.750587), Front Cell Vol: 9, ISSN: 2296-634X The lack of scar-free healing and regeneration in many adult human tissues imposes severe limitations on the recovery of function after injury. In stark contrast, salamanders can functionally repair a range of clinically relevant tissues throughout adult life. The impressive ability to regenerate whole limbs after amputation, or regenerate following cardiac injury, is critically dependent on the recruitment of (myeloid) macrophage white blood cells to the site of injury. Amputation in the absence of macrophages results in regeneration failure and scar tissue induction. Identifying the exact hematopoietic source or reservoir of myeloid cells supporting regeneration is a necessary step in characterizing differences in macrophage phenotypes regulating scarring or regeneration across species. Mammalian wounds are dominated by splenic-derived monocytes that originate in the bone marrow and differentiate into macrophages within the wound. Unlike mammals, adult axolotls do not have functional bone marrow but instead utilize liver and spleen tissues as major sites for adult hematopoiesis. To interrogate leukocyte identity, tissue origins, and modes of recruitment, we established several transgenic axolotl hematopoietic tissue transplant models and flow cytometry protocols to study cell migration and identify the source of pro-regenerative macrophages. We identified that although bidirectional trafficking of leukocytes can occur between spleen and liver tissues, the liver is the major source of leukocytes recruited to regenerating limbs. Recruitment of leukocytes and limb regeneration occurs in the absence of the spleen, thus confirming the dependence of liver-derived myeloid cells in regeneration and that splenic maturation is dispensable for the education of pro-regenerative macrophages. This work provides an important foundation for understanding the hematopoietic origins and education of myeloid cells recruited to, and essential for, adult tissue regeneration.

Although acute inflammation in response to myocardial cell death has been extensively studied, subsequent adaptive immune activity and anti-heart autoimmunity may also contribute to the development of HF. After ischemic injury to the myocardium, dendritic cells (DC) respond to cardiomyocyte necrosis, present cardiac antigen to T cells and potentially initiate a persistent autoimmune response against the heart. Cross-priming DC have the ability to activate both CD4+ helperand CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in response to necrotic cells and may thus be crucial players in exacerbating autoimmunity targeting the heart. This study investigates a role for cross priming DC in post-MI myocardial impairment through (MI)-like ischemic injury in the heart by treatment with a single high dose of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. We characterized the DC population in the heart and mediastinal lymph nodes and analyzed long term cardiac immunopathology and functional decline in wild type and Clec9a-depleted mice lacking DC cross-priming function.Results: A diverse DC population, including cross-priming DC, is present in the heart and activated after ischemic injury. Clec9a -/- mice deficient in DC cross-priming are protected from long-term immune-mediated myocardial damage and decline of cardiac function, likely dueto dampened activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.Conclusion: Activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells by cross-priming DC contributes to exacerbation of post-ischemic inflammatory damage of the myocardium and corresponding decline in cardiac function. Importantly, this provides novel therapeutic targets to prevent immune-mediated worsening of post-ischemic HF.

Physiological factors leading to cardiac fibrosis have been recognized for decades. However, the specific cellular and molecular mediators that drive cardiac fibrosis, and the relative effect of disparate cell populations on cardiac fibrosis, remain unclear. METHODS: We developed a novel cardiac single-cell transcriptomic strategy to characterize the cardiac cellulome, the network of cells that forms the heart. This method was used to profile the cardiac cellular ecosystem in response to 2 weeks of continuous administration of angiotensin II, a profibrotic stimulus that drives pathological cardiac remodeling. RESULTS: Our analysis provides a comprehensive map of the cardiac cellular landscape uncovering multiple cell populations that contribute to pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix of the heart. Two phenotypically distinct fibroblast populations, Fibroblast-Cilp and Fibroblast-Thbs4, emerged after induction of tissue stress to promote fibrosis in the absence of smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts, a key profibrotic cell population. After angiotensin II treatment, Fibroblast-Cilp develops as the most abundant fibroblast subpopulation and the predominant fibrogenic cell type. Mapping intercellular communication networks within the heart, we identified key intercellular trophic relationships and shifts in cellular communication after angiotensin II treatment that promote the development of a profibrotic cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, the cellular responses to angiotensin II and the relative abundance of fibrogenic cells were sexually dimorphic. CONCLUSIONS: These results offer a valuable resource for exploring the cardiac cellular landscape in health and after chronic cardiovascular stress. These data provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote pathological remodeling of the mammalian heart, high Forte E, Daigle S, Rosenthal NA, 2020, [Protocol for Isolation of Cardiac Interstitial Cells from Adult Murine Hearts for Unbiased Single Cell Profiling.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2020.100077), STAR Protoc, Vol: 1 Interstitial cells have a crucial role in cardiac fibrosis and repair of the mammalian heart.

T and B cell have beenconvincingly demonstrated to be activated after myocardial infarction, a prerequisite for thegeneration of mature auto-antibodies. Yet, little is known about the immunoglobulin isotyperepertoire thus pathological potential of anti-heart auto-antibodies during heart failure.We obtained human myocardial tissue from ischemic heart failure patients and inducedexperimental MI in rats. We found that anti-heart autoimmunity persists during heart failure.Rat mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged and contain active secondary follicles with matureisotype-switched IgG2a B cells. Mature IgG2a auto-antibodies specific for cardiac antigens arepresent in rat heart failure serum, and IgG and complement C3 deposits are evident in heartfailure tissue of both rats and human patients.Previously established myocardial inflammation, and the herein provided proof of B cellmaturation in lymph nodes and myocardial deposition of mature auto-antibodies, provide allthe hallmark signs of an established autoimmune response in chronic heart failure. Bouvet M, Claude O, Roux M, [et al.](#), 2020, [Anti-integrin therapy ISSN: 2045-2322 There is currently no therapy to limit the development of cardiac fibrosis and consequent heart failure. We have recently shown that cardiac fibrosis post-myocardial infarction (MI) can be regulated by resident cardiac cells with a fibrogenic signature and identified by the expression of PW1 (Peg3). Here we identify V-integrin (CD51) as an essential regulator of cardiac PW1+ cells fibrogenic behavior. We used transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to identify specific cell-surface markers for cardiac PW1+ cells and found that V-integrin (CD51) was expressed in almost all cardiac PW1+ cells (93% \u00b1 1%), predominantly as the V1 complex. V-integrin is a subunit member of the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors and was found to activate complex of latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF at the surface of cardiac PW1+ cells. Pharmacological inhibition of V-integrin reduced the profibrotic action of cardiac PW1+CD51+ cells and was associated with improved cardiac function and animal survival following MI coupled with a reduced infarct size and fibrotic lesion. These data identify a targetable pathway that regulates cardiac fibrosis in response to an ischemic injury and demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of V-integrin could reduce pathological outcomes following cardiac ischemia.

To elucidate the cellular processes underlying scar formation, here we perform unbiased single-cell mRNA sequencing of interstitial cells isolated from infarcted mouse hearts carrying a genetic tracer that labels epicardial-derived cells. Sixteen interstitial cell clusters are revealed, five of which were of epicardial origin. Focusing on stromal cells, we define 11 sub-clusters, including diverse cell states of epicardial- and endocardial-derived fibroblasts. Comparing transcript profiles from post-infarction hearts in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ inbred mice, which displays a marked divergence in the frequency of cardiac rupture, uncovers an early increase in activated myofibroblasts, enhanced collagen deposition, and persistent acute phase response in 129S1/SvImJ mouse hearts, defining a crucial time window of pathological remodeling that predicts disease outcome. Sattler S, Baxan N, mice by multi-parametric quantitative 1-10, ISSN: 1754-8403 Hemorrhagic myocarditis is a potentially fatal complication of excessive levels of systemic inflammation. It has been reported in viral infection, but is also possible in systemic autoimmunity. Epicutaneous treatment of mice with the TLR-7 agonist Resiquimod induces auto-antibodies and systemic tissue damage including in the heart, and is used as an inducible mouse model of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).Here, we show that over-activation of the TLR-7 pathway of viral recognition by Resiquimod-treatment of CFN mice induces severe thrombocytopenia and internal bleeding which manifests most prominently as hemorrhagic myocarditis. We optimized a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) tissue mapping approach for the in vivo detection of diffuse infiltration, fibrosis and hemorrhages using a combination of T1, T2 and T2* relaxation times, and compared results to ex vivo histopathology of cardiac sections corresponding to CMR tissue maps. This allowed a detailed correlation between in vivo CMR parameters and ex vivo histopathology, and confirmed the need to include T2* measurements to detect tissue iron for accurate interpretation of pathology associated with CMR parameter changes.In summary, we provide detailed histological and in vivo imaging-based characterization of acute hemorrhagic myocarditis as acute cardiac complication in the mouse model of Resiquimod-induced SLE, and a refined CMR protocol to allow non-invasive longitudinal in vivo studies of heart involvement in acute inflammation. We propose that adding T2* mapping to CMR protocols for myocarditis diagnosis will improve interpretation of disease mechanisms and diagnostic sensitivity.
