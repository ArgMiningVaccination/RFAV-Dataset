What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used medical procedures in the world. It originated in China several thousand years ago and is a cornerstone to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). One of the major tenets of TCM is that health is achieved by maintaining the body in a balanced state and that disease is due to an internal imbalance. That imbalance leads to blockage of the flow of vital energy (qi) along pathways know as meridians. There are 12 main meridians and 8 secondary meridians with more than 2000 acupuncture points on the human body where the meridians surface. With fine sterile, disposable needles, Acupuncturists stimulate specific points on the body using a variety of needling techniques to produce different effects and results. Acupuncture standards are currently regulated by the World Health Organization which has identified many medical conditions as responsive to acupuncture treatment. [See List](https://www.evidencebasedacupuncture.org/who-official-position/) FAQs FAQs Does it hurt? The needles are very slender and flexible.

As yet, science has not been able to explain \"the spark of life\". Oriental medicine calls it Qi and works with that flow of \"life force\" in supporting emotional and physical well being. "}
