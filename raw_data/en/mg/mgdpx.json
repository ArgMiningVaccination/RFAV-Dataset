She has worked with our family for nearly 2 years now. Her adjustments are always spot on, but adjustments are not her only field of knowledge. Our son has nystagmus, and Dr. Jennifer has made such a difference in his eye movement. She is always looking for ways to help him more. Dr. Jennifer researched some ways for us to help him even more at home by giving him eye exercises to do on our own time. It has made a huge difference. My wife was dealing with some hormonal issues, and Dr. Jennifer worked with her in depth on changes to her diet and being aware of toxins that she's taking in on a daily basis. You are not just a patient to her; she treats each of us like we are a family member.

The holistic approach is something that was unique from previously experiences. I work with athletes for a living and was a former college athlete myself. My knees have not allowed me to work and train the way I was accustomed to. Dr. Christian provided treatments and muscle exercises that helped significantly reduce the pain in my knees. I can't thank Alternative Family Medicine & Chiropractic enough for getting me back to the activities and lifestyle I want to lead! Would recommend them to anyone and everyone!!! - 6/15/2021 I had 4 appointments with Dr. Barter with really no results & spent over $1200. I was really hoping to resolve my issues with her but couldn't afford this approach. Total disappointment. - 2/2/2017 Such an amazing team! I've been seeing Dr. Ann for awhile now and every time I see her she is able to pinpoint my problematic areas and help me understand the potential reasons behind my discomfort. Dr. Ann's techniques are holistic & discusses diet, emotions, stressors, and really encompasses health as a whole based off of your lifestyle. I instantly feel better after each adjustment! - 8/19/2016First to Review Dr. Jennifer Christian is a wonderful chiropractor. She has worked with our family for nearly 2 years now.

She helped me with neck and low back pain using tools I had not previously had when I went to See chiropractors. Next level stuff.
