When we visit our doctor after falling ill or picking up an injury, we usually leave with medication mainly consisting of tablets. But what if your doctor suggested you take a few leaves and herbs, grind them together, extract the juice and then drink it? In the western world this idea for many would be absurd but for the majority of people in Asian and Africa this form of alternative medicine is a form of treatment taken alongside modern techniques. On the market at the moment, there are unconventional remedies for every single medical condition imaginable. But the real question is, do they work? The origin of many alternative medicine techniques used in modern day date back to ancient medical practices in countries such as China and India. A form of traditional Chinese medicine known as acupuncture is something many of us are aware of. It is said to treat muscular and skeletal pain by inserting thin needles into the body. It is a very popular form of treatment not only in China but also the US and the UK. Acupuncture is even available on the NHS with permission from your GP or physiotherapist. This must mean it is a genuine form of treatment right? Unfortunately, this isn't the case with results from a number of scientific trials being inconsistent and improvement of patient conditions being classed as a \"placebo effect\" (the improvement of a patient's health condition not because of the treatment itself but from the personal expectations of the patient). Another form of alternative medication growing popular in western culture is the practice of Ayurveda. It is a medical system which was first established in India more than 3000 years ago. Ayurveda text states that health and wellness are dependent on the balance of mind, body and spirit. It is more focused on the prevention of sickness rather than the treatment. A crucial part of ayurvedic medicine is exercise such as yoga and meditation which have become a very popular form of exercise in western culture. I have had my own personal experiences with this form of medicine. Once when I was visiting India on holiday I had a very bad allergic reaction to mosquito bites which lead to blisters the size of half an orange. My parents (who are both in medical professions) chose for me to receive ayurvedic treatment rather than treatment from a normal hospital. I remember having to apply a special paste to the blister which consisted of a blend of a number of herbs and spices (this lead to a distinct bright yellow colour). Like my parents, nearly 80% of the Indian population use a form of traditional medicine which Ayurveda falls under. Its popularity has spread and many products such as face masks, creams, ointments etc. can be purchased in stores and on the internet. However, this is where the problems arise. Firstly, the effectiveness of ayurvedic treatment has not had enough clinical tests to prove whether or not it is an evidence based science. Furthermore, some ayurvedic treatments in the US have found to contain dangerous amounts of heavy metals such as lead and mercury. This is not to say all treatment is dangerous but caution needs to be taken. I have given you only two examples of a vast array of treatments which fall under the category of alternative medicine. Whether they work or not is something many professionals are unsure of. With alternative medicine, the effectiveness of treatment depends very much on the patient itself. Without enough clinical trials, we cannot be certain if they work but there is always a small chance they could. However, take precaution. Many forms of alternative medicine are very dangerous and these \"medical professionals\" that promote the practices will try their best to lure you in because at the end of the day they want to make money. My personal opinion is to do your own research. If in doubt talk to your local doctor and see what they think. However, when modern medicine will eventually strain due to antibiotics concerns etc, we will have to go back to our roots and rely on alternative medicine. Alternative medicine may not be reliable but it could be the future of medicine. "}
