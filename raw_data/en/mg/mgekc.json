The HPD offers a multidisciplinary combination of resources, along with an experienced and diverse faculty and staff who give our graduates a distinct competitive edge. Our students are better prepared and equipped for meaningful careers in the rapidly changing health care arena by learning inside and outside the classroom through a variety of real-world experiences. According to industry experts, by 2025 there will be significant talent shortages within various health professions that will greatly impact the public, specifically those living in medically underserved areas. NSU is addressing these needs by making major investments in all aspects of health and health care education. NSU's charter class of 53 students began studies at the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine in 2018. We also welcomed a new class of approximately 300 medical students to the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine. These students are all eager to make a difference in the world. With the opening of the M.D. college, NSU becomes one of only three universities in the country to offer both Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degrees. Our new teaching and research hospital, which will be built on NSU's Fort Lauderdale/Davie Campus through a partnership with HCA East Florida, is also on the horizon. The hospital will give our students an advantage in their career through integrated medical education and clinical opportunities. In addition, the facility will provide health care services for the community. It will conduct research and clinical trials that will ultimately impact our community\u2014and the world\u2014with advanced breakthroughs. As an HPD student, you will have the opportunity to access NSU's Center for Collaborative Research, which houses top researchers working in state-of-the-art wet labs, as well as gain practical experiences through simulation labs, clinical rotations, research projects, medical missions, community service, internships, and so much more. NSU is recognized as a research university with \"high research activity\" by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. You will have the opportunity to participate in research projects with faculty members and internationally renowned scientists and present your findings regionally and nationally at professional conferences. NSU researchers are making advances in numerous areas, including cardiovascular disease, anticancer therapies, chronic fatigue syndrome, autism, and stem cells, just to name a few. Regardless of which professional path you are pursuing, when you complete your degree program at NSU, you will exemplify excellence and gain a competitive edge in your career, your community, and your life. You are adding to a legacy of leadership in humanitarianism and compassionate care. We look forward to a lifelong partnership with you. George L.

Rogers, Ph.D. Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and ProvostLetter from the NSU Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost NSU Health Professions Division 3Nova Southeastern University's Health Professions Division is playing a pivotal role in leading the university to new levels of excellence. The division comprises eight distinctive colleges\u2014osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, optometry, medical sciences, dental medicine, health care sciences, nursing, and allopathic medicine\u2014that offer more than 60 degree and certificate programs. It is an exciting time to be a student at NSU, which continues to expand at a rapid pace. This is especially true of the Health Professions Division, which has grown from about 1,900 full-time students in 1994 to more than 8,000 in 2018. The past year was an exceptionally productive and successful one for the HPD. In the span of several months, four of the HPD's eight colleges were renamed to honor the generosity of benevolent donors. We have cut the ribbons, attended the various dedication ceremonies, and participated in the groundbreaking event at the new NSU Tampa Bay Regional Campus in Clearwater, Florida. NSU's success is driven by the unique vision of its president and chief executive officer, George L. Hanbury II, Ph.D. Thanks to his leadership, the HPD continues to evolve, addressing new educational techniques and market opportunities, while continually adding new graduate and undergraduate programs. Not surprisingly, the demand for health care professionals continues to grow. According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, the health care field added 560,000 jobs in the last 10 years and increased to more than 11 percent of the total workforce. NSU's Health Professions Division is a part of that growth. The university is committed to ensuring that our current and future students receive a well-rounded education at an academic institution that prides itself on being dynamic, innovative, and interprofessional in its academic approach.

Nova Southeastern University Mission Statement The mission of Nova Southeastern University, a private, not-for-profit institution, is to offer a diverse array of innovative academic programs that complement on-campus educational opportunities and resources with accessible, distance- learning programs to foster academic excellence, intellectual inquiry, leadership, research, and commitment to community through engagement of students and faculty members in a dynamic, lifelong learning environment. Core Values Academic Excellence Opportunity Student Centered Scholarship/Research Integrity Diversity Innovation Community The Vision 2020 Statement, Mission Statement, and Core Values were adopted by the NSU Board of Trustees on March 28, 2011.6 NSU Health Professions DivisionHealth Professions Division Mission Statement The mission of the Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is to train health practitioners in a multidisciplinary setting, with an emphasis on medically underserved areas. The institutional premise is that health professionals should be trained in a multidisciplinary setting and, whenever possible, with integrated education. The university trains students in concert with other health profession students so that the various disciplines will learn to work together as a team for the good of the public's health. During their didactic work, students share campus facilities and, in some cases, have combined classes. In their clinical experiences, they work together in facilities affiliated with the university. The division aims to educate health care practitioners who will eventually increase the availability of health care to alleviate health care shortages. The division aims to mitigate some of these shortages by exposing the entire student body to the needs and challenges of rural, underserved, and geriatric populations. Existing curricula require all students to attend ambulatory care rotations in rural or urban areas, or both, making Nova Southeastern University oriented toward a pattern of training its students in areas geographically removed from the health center itself, and to the care of indigent and multicultural population groups. In doing this, it developed training programs that address the health care needs of the region's most medically underserved populations. All students are encouraged to participate in community service. The Health Professions Division supports the mentoring and collaboration of interdisciplinary research with faculty members.Health Professions Division Board of Governors Barry J.

NSU Health Professions Division 7University History Sustained growth and unity has made Nova Southeastern University (NSU) the largest independent university in the state of Florida. This growth culminated in January 1994, when Nova University and Southeastern University of the Health Sciences merged to become Nova Southeastern University. Nova University was chartered in 1964 as a graduate institution in the physical and social sciences. Over time, Nova added programs in law, education, business, psychology, computer science, oceanography, social and systemic studies, and hospitality, and, in 1972, introduced its first off-campus course of study, in education. Soon, Nova became nationally recognized for its innovative distance learning programs. Today, field-based programs are located in 32 other Florida cities, in nearly 30 other states, and at selected international sites. While Nova continued to expand its educational reach, Southeastern University of the Health Sciences also was on an expansion course. Southeastern was created by osteopathic physicians committed to establishing a College of Osteopathic Medicine in the Southeast. As a result, Southeastern College of Osteopathic Medicine, as it was first known, opened in 1981. From 1987 to 1997, Southeastern added Colleges of Pharmacy, Optometry, Allied Health, Medical Sciences, and the College of Dental Medicine, which admitted 88 students in 1997. This growth was unprecedented, but not unsurpassed. There was still more to come. The merger brought on new possibilities. Prior to 1994, Nova had evolved with innovative technology and Southeastern expanded to provide much needed health care education. With the merger, Nova Southeastern University's resources make possible a more transdisciplinary education. Students have an opportunity to integrate across the disciplines and understand how their professions relate to society as a whole. The growth of the Health Professions Division (HPD) is continuous. In 2003, an R.N. to B.S.N. (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) program was added to the College of Allied Health, which then became the College of Allied Health and Nursing. Numerous other nursing programs were added over the next nine years. This resulted in the creation of a separate College of Nursing in 2012. At the same time, the College of Allied Health was renamed the College of Health Care Sciences. In 2015, an eighth college was added to the HPD academic mix\u2014the College of Allopathic Medicine\u2014which received preliminary accreditation in October 2017 and welcomed its inaugural class of 50 students in the summer of 2018.In September of 2017, NSU received the largest philanthropic gift in its history from Dr. Kiran C. Patel, M.D., and his wife, Dr. Pallavi Patel, M.D. The commitment from the Patel Family Foundation included a $50-million gift and an additional $150-million real estate and facility investment in a 325,000-square-foot medical- education complex. This real estate would become the NSU Tampa Bay Regional Campus in Clearwater, Florida, scheduled to open in the summer of 2019. The NSU Tampa Bay Regional Campus will house an additional site for NSU's osteopathic medical school, as well as all the other HPD programs now housed at NSU's current Tampa Campus. In honor of the financial gift, the Health Professions Division renamed two of its colleges. NSU's osteopathic medical college became the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine and NSU's health care sciences college became the Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences. In January 2018, the HPD attained other significant financial gifts. To honor these gifts, two more HPD colleges were renamed. The College of Allopathic Medicine became the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine, while the College of Nursing was renamed the Ron and Kathy Assaf College of Nursing. From the HPD's newest college\u2014the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine\u2014to its oldest\u2014the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014each enhances NSU's esteem by providing high levels of innovation and distinctiveness. Campus Nova Southeastern University's Health Professions Division\u2014now composed of the colleges of osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, optometry, health care sciences, medical sciences, dental medicine, nursing, and allopathic medicine\u2014offers a rare blend of tropical South Florida weather, plentiful sunny beaches, an easily accessible campus, a dedicated and professional faculty, well established affiliations with many hospitals, clinics, and health care systems in the area, and a mission to educate professionals capable of providing the highest-quality health care service. The university's main campus is located on a lush, 314-acre site in the Greater Fort Lauderdale area, 10 miles inland of the Atlantic Ocean and readily accessible via several highways and Florida's Turnpike. The Health Professions Division complex, dedicated in June 1996, is located on the northwest corner of the main campus and encompasses more than 540,000 square feet of space for administrative offices, classrooms, laboratories, the Martin and Gail Press Health Professions 8 NSU Health Professions DivisionDivision Library, and a patient-services clinic. There is also a 600,000-square-foot parking structure with space for 2,000 vehicles. The division elicited input from students and faculty members and incorporated innovations in architecture, ergonomics, and computer-aided technology to provide facilities that enhance the learning experience. The complex is an arrangement of eight buildings, four of which are connected by air conditioned lobbies. The Sanford L. Ziff Health Care Center, physical plant, and parking garage are connected to the central buildings by covered walkways. Administration and faculty offices are on the upper levels of the five-story Terry Administration Building, with the departments of admissions and student services, and a cafeteria located on the first floor. Located in the lobby of the Terry Building, the Health Museum exhibits artifacts and antiques representing each of the colleges of the Health Professions Division. The collection houses an informative and historical display of medical memorabilia for students, faculty members, and visitors to explore. Private tours of the museum can be arranged with the curator, Cynthia Magalian Tupler, B.F .A. Contact Helen Caidin in the Pharmacy Department to schedule an appointment, (954) 262-1380. Adjacent to the administration building is the Assembly Building, which consists of a 500-seat auditorium, a 250-seat auditorium, and eight 126-seat amphitheater-classrooms, all equipped with computerized audio/video systems. Connected to this is the three-story Library/ Laboratory Building. On the first floor is the library and a 100-seat cardiac laboratory utilizing \"Harvey,\" a computerized mannequin that duplicates the sounds and symptoms of most heart conditions. Also on the first floor are patient simulation training rooms and a 50-station computer laboratory for student use. The second and third floors house laboratories, a student lounge, and a research area. Laboratories are equipped for viewing pretaped medical procedures, and each large laboratory has a video system and hookups to equipment such as an electron microscope, so that illustrations can be amplified for laboratory-wide viewing. Just north of the Library/Laboratory Building is the Health Care Center, with facilities for primary health care, rehabilitative services, eye care, pharmacy, and a simulation nursing laboratory.The College of Dental Medicine's 70,500-square-foot building advances the state-of-the-art in dental education facilities. The first floor contains a 100-operatory predoctoral clinic facility and clinics and support laboratories for oral medicine, radiology, and oral surgery. The second floor houses a faculty practice; clinics for postgraduate programs in advanced education in general dentistry, endodontics, operative dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontology, and prosthodontics; a 120-position simulation technique laboratory; and support laboratories. Faculty and administration offices are on the third floor. The Health Professions Division added a building to foster opportunities for interdisciplinary education and to meet the need for additional classroom, computer, and research facilities. This modern, spacious facility known as the Assembly II Building contains more than 31,000 square feet of instructional and research facilities, including a 312-seat auditorium, ultrasound training center, a 50-station computer science laboratory, and 37 seminar and study rooms.

NSU Health Professions Division 9Admissions Policy Students provisionally are admitted to a degree-seeking program based on a review of unofficial transcripts or other specific program admission requirements. However, this admission includes a condition that final and official transcripts, documents, and requirements must be received within 90 calendar days from matriculation for the graduate and professional programs and by the end of the drop/ add period for undergraduate programs. If these final and official transcripts, documents, and/or requirements are not received by that time, the student will not be allowed to continue class attendance. Financial aid will not be disbursed to a provisional/ conditional student until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admissions requirements have been approved by the college /program admissions office). Students who have an unpaid balance 30 days from the start of the term will be assessed a $100 fee. Background Checks Accepted applicants and students are required to authorize the NSU Health Professions Division to obtain background check (s) as per the policy adopted on March 2011. If the background check (s) reveal information of concern, which the NSU Health Professions Division may deem unfavorable, HPD will request that the individual provide a detailed written explanation of the information contained in this report, along with appropriate documentation (e.g., police reports). Students may also be required to authorize clinical training facilities that they are assigned to by the Health Professions Division to obtain a background check with the results reported to the clinical training facility. This information must be delivered in the format requested (electronic or written) to the NSU Health Professions Division Background Check Committee within 10 business days of the date the communication is sent or another date specified by HPD in its communication with the student. Offers of admission will not be considered final until the completion of the background check (s), with results deemed favorable by the NSU Health Professions Division, and where appropriate, by the clinical training facilities. If information received indicates that the student has provided false or misleading statements, has omitted required information, or in any way is unable to meet the requirements for completion of the program, then the admission may be denied or rescinded, the student may be disciplined or dismissed, or his or her enrollment may be terminated. Acceptance to an NSU Health Professions Division program does not guarantee that a student with information of concern will be accepted by clinical training facilities to which they may be assigned. Following the initial background check(s), students will be asked annually to provide a certification relating to any convictions or guilty or no-contest pleas to any criminal offense other than traffic violations. Additionally, a Level 2 background check may be required for certain rotations. Tuition Credit Policy\u2014Voluntary Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw from the program or course, if course withdrawal is permitted in the student's college (refer to college policies), must submit a written request for voluntary withdrawal to the dean or program director, who will evaluate the student's request. After completing the required documentation and obtaining the dean's or program director's approval, an eligible student may receive partial credit of the tuition, according to the following formula: Drops during the first week of the semester in which classes begin ........ 75 percent Drops after the first week of the semester in which classes begin ......... No refund The withdrawal period starts in the second week of the semester and ends three weeks prior to the end of the semester. Students enrolled in programs that have a drop/ add period , will have until 11:59 p.m. the first Sunday of the semester, which is the end of the drop/add period, in order to make any changes in their schedule without incurring any financial expenses. Students who drop during the second week of classes will receive a reversal of 75 percent of their charged tuition. Students who drop after the second week of the semester will not be entitled to receive a refund. Students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs are required to follow policy procedures for drops and withdrawals as noted in the undergraduate catalog. Students may not be given refunds for portions of tuition paid by financial aid funds. As appropriate, the respective financial aid programs will be credited in accordance with federal regulations. Students should notify the Office of Student Financial Assistance prior to withdrawing to determine the effect this will have on financial aid. For complete withdrawals, please refer to the Return of Title IV Funds policies located at nova.edu/financialaid/apply- for-aid/title-iv-return. Failure to comply with these requirements could jeopardize future receipt of Title IV student assistance funds at any institution of higher education the student may attend. If a student is due a refund, it will be mailed to the student's address or deposited directly into his or her checking account as soon as the dean of the respective college has approved the withdrawal and the drop request has been processed. The tuition refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the university's board of trustees/the NSU administration. Changes to a semester's registration will not be accepted 20 days after the semester ends.10 NSU Health Professions DivisionPolicy for Florida In-State Tuition Eligible students must request in-state tuition upon application. For tuition purposes, students' Florida residency status (in-state or out-of-state) will be determined at initial matriculation and will remain the same throughout the entire enrollment of the student at NSU. Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after initial enrollment registration. For more information, visit nova.edu/hpd-florida-in-state-tuition.

There are four types of financial aid available to assist in meeting the cost of attending college: grants, scholarships, student employment, and loans. Grants and scholarships are considered \"gift\" aid and generally do not have to be repaid. However, if a student drops or withdraws from any classes for which financial aid has been received, the student may have to return any \"unearned\" funds. Loans are considered \"self-help\" aid and always have to be repaid. Student employment requires the student to work in exchange for a pay check. Please remember that students interested in federal financial aid must annually complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and meet general eligibility criteria. The NSU Federal School Code is 001509. For detailed information on the financial aid process and sources of aid, visit the financial aid website at nova.edu/financialaid. Financial Aid Checklist 1. Complete the FAFSA. Students complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at fafsa.gov annually. It becomes available each October 1 for aid in the following award year. The earlier students apply, the better chance they have of being considered for maximum available funds. To apply for Florida grants and scholarships, undergraduate students must complete the NSU State Aid Application available on the financial aid website at nova.edu /financialaid/forms. 2. Identify and Apply for Scholarships. Institutional and external scholarship opportunities are available to assist students in meeting their educational goals. The best resource for up-to-date information is the NSU scholarship website located at nova.edu/financialaid /scholarships . Students will find information on how to apply, as well as resources to help them identify scholarships. Students should commit to continually identifying and applying for scholarships. This type of financial aid does not have to be repaid. 3. Plan for Housing and Meal Expenses. The budget includes a housing and meal component. Students should ensure that they budget for these expenses if they intend to live on campus. 4. Check Your Financial Aid Account Frequently. Students should log in to SharkLink at sharklink.nova.edu and regularly check their financial aid status to ensure that there are no outstanding requirements. Students should confirm their admissions status, as they must have completed all admissions requirements in order for financial aid funds to be disbursed. 5. Submit Additional Documents and Complete a Master Promissory Note and Entrance Counseling. Some students may be required to submit additional documents prior to being awarded. Students will be notified of outstanding requirements via NSU (SharkLink) email. Requirements (outstanding and completed) can also be NSU Health Professions Division 11viewed in SharkLink. Students interested in receiving Federal Direct Loans, will be required to complete a Direct Loan Master Promissory Note (MPN) and entrance counseling at studentloans.gov. 6. Accept, Reduce, or Decline Your Loan and Federal Work-Study Award(s). The financial aid award notice provides students with detailed instructions on how to accept, reduce, or decline a financial aid award. Awards will not be disbursed until this step has been completed. 7. Check Your NSU (SharkLink) Email Daily. NSU email and SharkLink are the official means that the OSFA will use to communicate with students. Students should keep up-to-date by checking their NSU email daily. 8. Register for Classes (early). In order for students to receive any federal Title IV or state financial aid (grants, scholarships, Federal Work-Study, and loans), they must register for at least the minimum number of credits that are required for degree/certificate completion (degree-applicable), as published in the catalog from the year the student matriculated. Enrollment requirements for federal and state grants vary. Students awarded federal direct loans must be enrolled at least half time in degree- applicable courses. Half-time enrollment is defined as 6 degree-applicable credits per semester for undergraduate students. For graduate and professional students, half-time status varies by program. Students should register as early as possible to ensure timely disbursement of their financial aid funds. Return of Title IV Funds Any student who does not complete at least one course within an academic semester for which financial aid is received, or could have been received, will be reviewed for a Return of Title IV Funds calculation. For complete information, please review nova.edu/financialaid/apply-for -aid/title-iv-return. Student Employment There are four student employment programs: Federal Work-Study (FWS), Florida Work Experience (FWEP), Nova Student Employment (NSE), and Job Location and Development (JLD). The NSE and JLD programs provide jobs to students regardless of financial need. The FWS and FWEP programs are need-based and require the completion of the FAFSA. Students awarded FWS may participate in the America Reads/America Counts Programs through which students serve as reading or math tutors to elementary school children. For more information on NSU part-time and full-time student employment, visit nova.edu/financialaid/employment.Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) To receive financial assistance, a student must continually meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Different definitions of SAP apply for Florida state aid and federal aid. According to federal regulations, NSU has established annual, university-wide quantitative, qualitative, maximum time frame, and pace SAP requirements. Students who fail to meet SAP during the 2018-2019 academic year will not be eligible for Title IV federal and Florida state financial aid during the 2019\u20142020 academic year. Comprehensive information is available on the financial aid website at nova.edu/sap.

At the end of every evaluation period (e.g., term, semester) each veteran can request an official transcript that shows the current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted. This transcript can be obtained from the One-Stop Shop at the William and Norma Horvitz Administration Building or Terry Administration Building or online at sharklink.nova.edu for a $10 fee. The Office of the University Bursar The Office of the University Bursar is responsible for billing students, collecting and depositing payments, sending invoices and receipts, distributing student educational tax forms, issuing refunds from excess financial aid funds, and verifying students' eligibility for financial aid funds. The office also assists borrowers of Federal Perkins and Health and Human Services Loans with repayment options. NSU Student Health Insurance is also housed within this office. For more information, visit nova.edu/bursar.12 NSU Health Professions DivisionOffice of the University Bursar Policies By registering for courses at Nova Southeastern University, the student accepts financial responsibility for payment of all institutional costs including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, housing and meal plan (if applicable), health insurance (if applicable), and any additional costs when those charges become due. Payment is due in full at the time of registration. NSU ebills are sent the middle of each month to the student's NSU email address. However, to avoid late charges, students should not wait for their billing statement to pay their tuition and fees. A student will not be able to register for future semesters until all outstanding balances from previous semesters have been paid in full. If a student has a balance 30 days after the start of the semester, a hold and a $100 late fee will be placed on his or her account. This hold stops all student services, including, but not limited to, access to the University RecPlex, academic credentials, grades, and future registrations. It will remain on the student's account until the balance has been paid in full. Delinquent student account balances may be reported to a credit bureau and referred to collection agencies or litigated. Students with delinquent accounts will be liable for any costs associated with the collection of unpaid charges, including attorney fees and court costs. All registration agreements shall be construed in accordance with Florida law, and any lawsuit to collect unpaid fees may be brought in the appropriate court sitting in Broward County, Florida, regardless of the student's domicile. Methods of Payment NSU accepts Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Check payments include traveler's checks, cashier's checks, personal checks, and money orders. International checks must be in U.S. funds only and drawn on a U.S. bank. Wire transfers are accepted. Electronic check and credit card payments can also be made through NSU e Bill, SharkLink, or WebStar. Students can access NSU e bill using their SharkLink ID and password to authorize other individuals (e.g. parent, spouse, or grandparent) to view their bill and make payments to their account. Credit card authorization forms can be downloaded from the Bursar's website at nova.edu/bursar /forms/cc_authorization and faxed to (954) 262-2473. Students may also mail a payment to the Office of the University Bursar or make payments in person at either of the One-Stop Shops on the Fort Lauderdale/Davie Campus.Declined Payment Policy NSU assesses a $25 declined payment fee for each declined payment, including payments made by check or credit card. The bursar's office reserves the right to refuse personal checks from students whose previous check payments have been declined more than once. These students will be required to submit payment by money order, credit card, or certified check.

Upon registration, students must - pay charges in full for the semester/term to be reimbursed NSU Health Professions Division 13- send an email to bursar@nova.edu from their SharkLink (NSU) email account to request a receipt of paid charges Florida Prepaid College Plan NSU accepts and bills the Florida Prepaid College Plan for tuition, fees, and on-campus housing costs. The plans are based on the tuition rates of the tax-assisted Florida public colleges and universities. The difference between NSU tuition, fees, and on-campus housing costs and the allocations through the Florida Prepaid College Plan is the sole responsibility of the student. If a student is on the unrestricted plan, the student must designate a dollar amount for up to the cost of tuition and fees. Students new to NSU must contact Florida Prepaid at 800-552- GRAD to authorize NSU for payment. For those students who have notified the Florida Prepaid College Plan that they are attending NSU, the plan will automatically be billed based on the hours of enrollment after the drop/add period.

To learn more about the Florida Prepaid College Plan, visit myfloridaprepaid.com. NSU Student Health Insurance Students enrolled in certain programs are required to carry adequate health insurance coverage. Generally, this applies to most programs in the Health Professions Division. Students in a mandatory program will automatically be enrolled in the NSU Student Health Insurance Plan, and their student account will be charged accordingly. Students insured under another insurance plan must opt out of the NSU Student Health Insurance Plan each academic year by the given waiver deadline for their program. The effective dates for coverage under the NSU Student Health Insurance Plan will coincide with the academic year, not the calendar year. For more information on the NSU Student Health Insurance waiver deadlines and access to the online waiver process, students should visit the Bursar's website at nova.edu/studentinsurance.

The Student Medical Center will make appointments in as timely a manner as possible. Students may call (954) 262-1270 to make an appointment. Once made, the appointment becomes the student's obligation and must be kept. For students at other NSU campuses, appointments may be scheduled with the NSU-designated physician for their area. HPD Fee The HPD general access fee covers a series of three Hepatitis B vaccines and an annual PPD screening. All other immunizations and health care services are the responsibility of the student. Failure to Comply The university is not required to provide alternative sites for clinical practicum or rotations should immunization be a requirement for placement. Therefore, failure to comply with this policy may result in a student's inability to satisfy the graduation requirements in his or her program. Relative to clinical rotation site requirements, students are expected to consult their specific college/program handbooks for compliance with any college/program- specific requirements. Dress Code Students in the Health Professions Division must maintain a neat and clean appearance befitting students attending professional school. Therefore, attire should convey a professional appearance whenever the student is on the division campus and in classes or laboratory or on an experiential rotation or program. The dress code is to be observed at all times, including during midterms and examination periods. Students are expected to consult their specific program office for compliance with any program-specific and clinical rotation site-supplemental dress code policies. Identification Requirements and Fieldwork Prerequisites An affiliated clinical/fieldwork teaching facility may also require a student to pass a state of Florida Department of Health screening before rotation. Other requirements that may be held by the affiliated facility include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, a criminal background check, urinalysis for drugs and alcohol, and proof of immunization. If a student does not meet all requirements held by the affiliated facility before the first day of the scheduled placement, the student's placement will be canceled. If the placement has already begun, the student will be asked to leave.

Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine (KPCOM) is pledged to the admission and matriculation of qualified students and wishes to acknowledge awareness of laws that prohibit discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations. Regarding those students with verifiable disabilities, the university and KPCOM will not discriminate against such individuals who are otherwise qualified, but will expect applicants and students to meet certain minimal technical standards (core performance standards) as set forth herein, with or without reasonable accommodation. In adopting these standards, the university and KPCOM believe it must keep in mind the efficacy and safety in the learning environment, as well as the ultimate safety of the patients who some of its graduates will eventually serve. Specifically, the standards reflect what the university and KPCOM believe are reasonable expectations Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine Elaine M. Wallace, D.O., M.S., M.S., M.S. Dean 22 Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicinerequired of future osteopathic physicians in performing common functions. Any exceptions to such standards must be approved by the dean of KPCOM based upon appropriate circumstances. Honor and integrity are essential and depend on the exemplary behavior of the individual in his or her relations with classmates, patients, faculty members, and colleagues. This includes accountability to oneself and to relationships with fellow students, future colleagues, faculty members, and patients who come under the student's care or contribute to his or her training and growth, as well as members of the general public. This applies to personal conduct that reflects on the student's honesty and integrity in both academic and nonacademic settings, whether or not involving an NSU-sponsored activity. All students must have the capacity to manage their lives and anticipate their own needs. Upon accepting admission to NSU-KPCOM, each student subscribes to, and pledges complete observance to, NSU's Student Code of Conduct Policies. A violation of these standards is an abuse of the trust placed in every student and could lead to suspension or dismissal. Students in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree program must have, with or without reasonable accommodation, multiple abilities and skills including intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; interpersonal communication; mobility and strength; motor skills; and hearing, visual, tactile, behavioral, and social attributes. Students must be able to perform these abilities and skills in a reasonably independent manner. Osteopathic physicians must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to carry out the activities described below, students in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program at KPCOM must be able to integrate consistently, quickly, and accurately all information received. They must also have the ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Qualitative Abilities Students must have critical thinking ability sufficient for problem solving and good clinical judgment. This is necessary to identify cause/effect relationships and to develop plans of action or plans of care. In addition, students should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Students are expected to be able to perform multiple tasks in a diverse, dynamic, highly competitive, and challenging learning environment. They must be able to think quickly and accurately in an organized manner, despite environmental distractions. Examples include, but are not limited to, identification of cause/ effect relationships in clinical situations, development of treatment plans, transferring knowledge from one situation to another, evaluating outcomes, problem solving, prioritizing, and using short- and long-term memory. Interpersonal Communication Students must be able to interact and communicate effectively with respect to policies, protocols, and process\u2014 with faculty and staff members, students, patients, patient surrogates, and administration\u2014during the student's educational program. They must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but also reading and writing. Students must also be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in all written forms with all members of the health care team. They must have interpersonal abilities sufficient to interact with individuals, families, and groups from a variety of social, emotional, cultural, and intellectual backgrounds. Students must have sufficient proficiency with English to retrieve information from texts and lectures and communicate concepts on written exams and patient charts; elicit patient backgrounds; describe patient changes in moods, activity, and posture; and coordinate patient care with all members of the health care team. Students must be able to communicate or provide communication in lay language so that patients and their families can understand the patient's conditions, treatment options, and instructions. Students must be able to accurately enter information in the patient's electronic health record, according to his or her program's requirements. Motor Skills Osteopathic medicine students must have sufficient motor function to execute movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of some health care professionals are cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, and the ability to calibrate and use various pieces of equipment. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Strength and Mobility Students must have sufficient mobility to attend emergency codes and to perform such maneuvers as CPR when required. They must have the physical ability to move sufficiently from room to room and to maneuver in small places. Osteopathic medicine students must have the ability to position patients for the administration and delivery of osteopathic manipulative treatment in a variety of settings and to position and move patients when required. Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 23Hearing Students must have sufficient auditory ability to monitor and assess auditory communication, when necessary. Osteopathic medicine students must be able to hear information given by the patient in answer to inquires; to hear cries for help; to hear features in an examination, such as the auscultatory sounds; and to monitor equipment. Visual Osteopathic medicine students must have visual ability sufficient for observation, assessment, and rendering of treatment necessary in patient care. It must be consistent in many cases with being able to assess asymmetry, range of motion, and tissue texture changes. Osteopathic medicine students must have sufficient visual ability to use ophthalmologic instruments. It is necessary to have adequate visual capabilities for proper evaluation and treatment integration. Students must be able to observe the patient and the patient's responses, including body language and features of the examination and treatment. Tactile Osteopathic medicine students must have sufficient tactile ability for physical assessment. They must be able to perform palpation and functions of physical examination and/or those related to therapeutic intervention. Osteopathic medicine students must be able to use tactile senses to diagnose directly by palpation and indirectly by sensations transmitted through instruments. Sensory Osteopathic medicine students are required to have an enhanced ability to use their sensory skills. These enhanced tactile and proprioceptive sensory skills are essential for appropriate osteopathic evaluation and treatment of patients. Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program Mission Statement The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program in the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine is dedicated to student-centered osteopathic medical education to produce exemplary osteopathic physicians known for competent and compassionate care. Accreditation Nova Southeastern University Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine's Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program has been granted accreditation by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation of the American Osteopathic Association. This body is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council of Post- Secondary Accreditation as the accrediting agency for colleges educating osteopathic physicians and surgeons. An Osteopathic Physician T wo types of complete physicians may practice medicine in all 50 states: the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) and the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). While both types of physicians are trained in all aspects of patient care, D.O.s offer a distinct, holistic approach to medicine. Osteopathic medicine is distinguished by an emphasis on primary care, by using osteopathic manipulative medicine when necessary, and by a tradition of caring for patients in underserved rural and urban areas. Osteopathic physicians recognize the relationship between physical structure and organic function and view the human body as an interdependent unit rather than an assortment of separate parts and systems. While all medical and surgical specialties are represented within the osteopathic medical profession, the training of vitally needed family physicians and the drive to reach rural, minority, geriatric, and indigent populations, make the osteopathic medical profession unique. We are proud of our success in producing vitally needed primary care physicians\u2014nearly 55 percent of our graduates practice in the primary care disciplines of family medicine, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics\u2014and we remain committed to training physicians capable of delivering the highest standards of total-patient care in all practice settings. Admissions Requirements Applicants for the first-year class must meet the following requirements prior to matriculation: 1. have a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university (A minimum of 90 semester hours of coursework from a regionally accredited college or university may be considered for admission.) 2. have successfully completed (with a grade of 2.0 or higher) 8 semester hours of biological science (biology, embryology, genetics, microbiology, physiology, etc.) 8 semester hours of general chemistry with laboratory 8 semester hours of organic chemistry with laboratory 3 semester hours of biochemistry 8 semester hours of physics 6 semester hours of English/humanities (must include 3 semester hours of English) Note: These are minimum academic requirements for admission.

Box 4056 Iowa City, IA 52243-4056 MCAT scores must be no more than three years old prior to the date the AACOMAS application is submitted. The discipline and intensive study required by the osteopathic medicine curriculum make the attainment of a superior GPA in undergraduate studies essential. The college receives more than 7,000 applications a year, from which only 230 students are chosen. These students have varied backgrounds, and while some many enter the college directly from an undergraduate program, other students come from successful careers. The Committee on Admissions recommends applicants to the dean on the basis of demonstrated academic excellence, leadership, compassion, and commitment to the osteopathic medical profession. Application Procedures The college participates in the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS) for the receipt and processing of all applications. AACOMAS takes no part in the selection of students. Applicants should submit applications electronically through AACOMAS Online, an interactive, web-based application at aacom.org .

Not all applicants will be granted an interview. Those selected for an interview will be notified of the date and time of such interview by the Office of Admissions. Notice of acceptance will be on a rolling or periodic schedule; therefore, early completion of the application is in the best interest of the applicant because of the limited number of spaces available in each class. After acceptance, final and official documents and requirements must be received by the Office of Admissions within 90 days following the start of the first term. If these final and official documents are not received, or other requirements are not met by that time, the student will not be able to continue his or her enrollment.

Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine ProgramAcademics Transfer of Credit Circumstances may warrant that a student enrolled in a medical school seeks to transfer to another institution. Credits may be transferred from medical schools and colleges accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) of the American Osteopathic Association or by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Transfers from a medical school accredited by the COCA or the LCME shall require that, at minimum, the last two years of instruction be completed within the NSU Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine. Transfers from an LCME-accredited medical school must complete the NSU Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine's requirement for osteopathic manipulative medicine prior to graduation. Transfer credits will only be given if the student is in good academic standing at, and eligible for readmission to, the previously attended COCA- or LCME- accredited medical school. Credit is only given for completed courses with grades of 70 percent (2.0) or greater that fulfill the KPCOM's graduation requirements. Anyone wishing to transfer to the NSU Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine must meet the following criteria: 1. make a formal application to NSU Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine Office of Admissions 2. satisfy all admission requirements to NSU Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine, which include submitting official transcripts of all college work (including osteopathic transcripts); MCAT scores; National Board scores, if taken; and letters of evaluation 3. be in good standing at the transferring institution, as documented by a letter from the dean of the transferring institution 4. supply a letter of recommendation from a faculty member of the transferring institution 5. supply a written statement outlining reasons for request for transfer Decisions on transfer are made by the dean.

The decision will be based on factors which include, but are not limited to, academic record, interview, circumstances leading to the transfer request, available space, and admission standards.Course of Study The Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine has a dedicated faculty; well established affiliations with medical centers, hospitals, and health care systems; a nationally recognized rural medicine program; and a mission to educate the finest osteopathic physicians possible. We place our students and residents at the nation's fourth largest public hospital system\u2014the North Broward Hospital District\u2014or at one of our regional academic centers throughout the state to improve continuity and coordination of clinical education within our vast and growing clinical training network. Our innovative curriculum is designed to fulfill our mission. The design of the curriculum is based on successful academic models\u2014carefully developed and integrated. It emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, guiding students to develop a holistic, and more importantly, an osteopathic approach to medicine. We continually correlate basic scientific information with fundamental clinical application. Students are exposed to clinical settings in their first semester, which gives them the opportunity to prepare for the \"real world\" of medicine. This clinical exposure continues into the second year when students have increased opportunity to interact with standardized patients on campus as well as be involved, under physician supervision, with real patients in the office and hospital setting. A notable aspect of the clinical program is a required, three-month rotation in rural or urban underserved practice settings. In rural and urban underserved clinics throughout the state of Florida, nationally, and internationally, our students provide health care to medically underserved and indigent patients. Our students learn to treat various patients whose lifestyles, practices, and attitudes toward health care differ from those seen in more traditional training sites. This enriching educational experience is one that cannot be taught in the classroom. Physicians do not work in a vacuum, but rather in a health care team, and NSU promotes interdisciplinary cooperation whenever possible. Students share faculty members and campus facilities with NSU's pharmacy, dental, optometry, physician assistant, physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health, nursing, and medical science students.

The premise of the program is that exposure to professional role models is a significant determinant of medical students' Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 61career choices, and that an early clinical experience is an essential learning component for medical students to begin to correlate classroom knowledge with actual patient encounters. The IGC Program is composed of three components: (1) the IGC Physician Mentor Program, (2) the IGC Business of Medicine /Managed Care Program, and (3) the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine in Community Service (COM2Serve) Program. IGC Physician Mentor Program Students are placed with physician mentors, either one or two students at a time. They may elect to switch mentors every semester and are required to switch primary care disciplines and mentors after their first year. In addition to providing a broad exposure to the role of a primary care physician, the physician mentor provides the student with the opportunity to perform patient histories and physical examinations within the limits of the student's ability, and educates the student by providing timely feedback and engaging in discussions and explanations of his or her decision making. There are approximately 140 primary care physician mentors who teach first- and/ or second-year medical students in their private offices. This network of preceptors is composed of physicians in the three primary care disciplines; they are located throughout the tricounty area. Students will need a car or easy access to transportation to get to and from their IGC sites. IGC Business of Medicine/Managed Care Program Students learn the business aspects of practice as well as the various components of managed care organizations (MCOs). Each student is either assigned to an MCO teaching partner, or attends a special conference or seminar on health care systems, policies, and access. Students learn how a managed care organization operates by participating in seminars and small group discussions led by professionals representing various departments/experiences such as medical operations, physician committee meetings, utilization management, quality management, and provider /practice management. IGC COM2Serve Program This is the community service component of the IGC preceptorship, in which second-year medical students are involved in service learning with community health centers, public health departments, homeless assistance centers, migrant farmworker clinics, and other subsidized community clinics. The COM2Serve partner organizations provide health care and other needed services to medically underserved, minority, and at-risk populations. Osteopathic Principles and Practice Laboratories The development of the palpatory skills used for diagnosis and treatment is a significant distinction between the educational programs in osteopathic and allopathic medical schools. Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines palpation as \"examination with the hands and fingers; touching, feeling, or perceiving by the sense of touch.\" Palpation in the osteopathic medical education context is the use of touch to examine the body. Palpatory skills are used in all areas of osteopathic medical practice and are especially important in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the musculoskeletal system. The development of palpatory skills is taught in the first- and second-year osteopathic principles and practice (OPP) courses. Successful completion of these courses requires active participation in all laboratory sessions. During the two years, each student will palpate, in the laboratory setting, a variety of people, representing both genders and individuals with different body types to simulate the diversity of patients expected in a practice setting. Being palpated by other students helps the student understand from the patient's perspective how palpation feels and enables the students to provide feedback to their laboratory partners, thus enhancing the palpatory skills of all students. The osteopathic medical profession uses a variety of treatment models, and through the skills development process, the student learns the art and skills of manipulative treatment. Psychomotor skills are developed by repeated practice. Reading and observation, although helpful, do not develop the skills required to perform palpatory diagnosis and manipulative treatment. Each student is required to actively participate in all skills development laboratory sessions. These skills are taught by treating and being treated by a cadre of students of both genders and with varying body types to simulate a medical practice setting. Osteopathic Principles and Practice Fellowship KPCOM offers a Predoctoral OPP Fellowship Program annually to at least six students through a competitive application process. This is a unique opportunity that is made available to exceptional students. It expands the medical training period from four to five years by including a one-year fellowship with two years of clinical rotations. The fellowship program is a 12-month program that takes place between the M2 and M3 years. The curriculum includes guided clinical experience, teaching in the OPP courses, participation in department research activities, and a program of didactics. KPCOM Student Research Opportunities Director, Student Research Alison Bested M.D., FRCPC Undergraduate KPCOM Research Fellowship Program This is a unique opportunity for two second-year osteopathic students to participate in one fully funded year of research. The fellowship year occurs between the second and third years of study. Research fellows are 62 Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Programincluded in the department as members of the research staff. Fellows participate as team members in an ongoing study or conduct an individual research project. During this fellowship process, they acquire skills in conceptualizing, writing, and submitting an application to the Institutional Review Board. They learn the principles guiding the treatment of human participants in research studies. The research fellow acquires experience in budgeting a research project using university and federal guidelines. During this fellowship year, fellows develop writing skills as they conceptualize their research ideas and submit their scholarly manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. This opportunity includes presenting their research at a national/international meeting. The KPCOM rewards the fellows for their research efforts. The university pays their tuition for years three, four, and five of the fellows' medical training. This eliminates tuition expense for clinical years, including the fellowship year. Research Course M1 or M2: COM 9600A (3 credit hours) M4: COM 9600B Block Rotation (8 credit hours) This course is a research elective that can be taken by first-, second-, and fourth-year KPCOM students. The difference in credit hours is due to the time spent in the course with the fourth-year students spending one month in a block rotation. Under the supervision of a research scientist/faculty member, this course provides the opportunity for the student to develop an original research project or participate in scientific research in a health-related field. This experience will encourage students to publish and /or present their research findings. This course allows the student to select an area of interest to learn and/or apply research concepts applicable to that specific area of interest and level of knowledge, as determined by the course instructor. Dependent on the individual student needs and/or the instructor's area of research, each student who enrolls in this course may have different responsibilities and assignments. Examples of possible projects/experiences may include, but are not limited to, the following options: Theoretical/Literary Research Option Under the supervision of a research scientist/faculty member, this course provides the opportunity for the student to develop an original research project Experiential Research Option Under the supervision of a research scientist/faculty member, this course provides the opportunity for the student to participate in scientific research in a health- related field.

Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program The mission of NSU's Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program is to improve the access to and the quality of primary health care service to medically underserved communities by linking the resources of academic health centers with community-based health care providers. Nova Southeastern University's Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine, the first medical school in the state of Florida to develop an AHEC Program, officially began its program in 1985. Since its inception, the program has worked to develop effective and comprehensive training programs that improve access to quality primary health care for Florida's medically underserved rural and inner-city urban communities. Our nationally recognized program now serves underserved communities and populations throughout a nearly 20,000 square mile area of South and Central Florida. Our first AHEC center\u2014the Everglades AHEC\u2014reaches underserved areas within a 10-county region extending from Broward County to rural communities around Lake Okeechobee. Based on the success of the Everglades AHEC, the university was awarded additional funding to Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 63develop a Central Florida AHEC, which now serves nine counties and extends from Lake Okeechobee to north of Orlando. By including training programs in community settings, we expose students to the challenges, rewards, and practice opportunities related to working in medically underserved areas. Students have opportunities to work together while learning to provide valuable primary care services to the community.

Detection, management, and prevention of disease across populations\u2014through the collection and analysis of vital statistics and health data\u2014have the potential to be significantly influenced and advanced through the auspices of evolving information technology. People who have a degree in biomedical informatics have a wide variety of career opportunities. The type of informatics career options that an individual can pursue is, to some extent, dependent on his or her background and selected area of study. Biomedical informatics trained professionals may become chief medical information officers (CMIOs) chief medical officers (CMOs) chief information officers (CIOs) directors of medical informatics chief nursing information officers (CNIOs) project managers implementation specialists project designers researchers programmers clinical systems analysts health information technology (HIT) educators and trainers HIT consultants template writers nursing informatics specialists account representatives The following are examples of settings in which they might work: hospitals and health systems community health centers physician practices and clinics health care agencies within the federal and state government health information technology system vendors eHealth companies health insurance companiesNSU's Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine's Biomedical Informatics Program is designed to train future leaders in the development, dissemination, and evaluation of health information technologies that are utilized by hospitals and health systems, health information technology system vendors, eHealth companies, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions. With its focus on clinical informatics, the program's curriculum emphasizes the areas of computer science and its clinical applications, management, and evaluation of information technology in the health care environment. The Biomedical Informatics Program offers coursework in both on-campus and online formats to enable working professionals to earn a master's degree or graduate certificates in health informatics without career disruption. Biomedical informatics is an interdisciplinary field encompassing computer and information sciences, cognitive and decision-making sciences, medicine and epidemiology, telecommunications, business management, education sciences, and a collaboration of a number of other fields. In short, biomedical informatics is the intersection of health care, technology, and people, with the implicit goals of improving the quality and safety of the world's health care systems while reducing cost. As terminology continues to evolve along with the field itself, the more broadly encompassing term \"biomedical informatics\" can generally be broken down into three more distinct levels: bioinformatics, medical informatics, and public health informatics. At the molecular level, incorporating things such as gene sequencing research and pharmaceutical development, bioinformatics looks to change the way biological data is stored, retrieved, organized, and analyzed, ultimately producing new tools/methods for generating valuable biological knowledge. Medical informatics, at an individual patient level, can further be divided into a number of more specific areas including nursing informatics, imaging informatics, pharmacy informatics, dental informatics, and consumer health informatics. Medical informatics aims to manage an individual's health data\u2014including storage, retrieval, sharing, and optimal use\u2014with the goals of providing safer, more efficient, and more affordable health care. Integration of advanced clinical information systems into the health care decision-making process allows health care professionals to accomplish tasks in a more competent and effective manner. Furthermore, this integration affords development of novel tasks. It produces new knowledge and allows providers to begin thinking like epidemiologists in addition to providing patient care.Biomedical Informatics Program Dr. Kiran C.

Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Disaster and Emergency Management Program 89Disaster and Emergency Management Program Program Overview The Master of Science degree in Disaster and Emergency Management (M.S.) in the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine will provide students with the knowledge, skills, and basic research capabilities to enter one of the fastest-growing academic disciplines with both a national and an international perspective. This interprofessional degree is designed to provide students with the theoretical knowledge and applied skills to be part of the rapidly growing, interdisciplinary field of disaster and emergency management. It will allow students from a variety of disciplines to specialize in one of several concentrations (all of which have a community research practicum at the local, regional, state, federal, or international level as a key component). The program is available online and will incorporate interactive and individual, synchronous activities, including live, online class sessions. In addition, all students in the program will be required to participate in a final presentation at the conclusion of their studies. The concentrations for the Master of Science degree include maritime safety and security, cybersecurity, criminal justice, public health, environmental hazards, and fire administration. Distinct concentrations will allow the students to apply the principles of emergency management to these areas of particular interest and need. The M.S. in Disaster and Emergency Management is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills, along with basic research application in the field that will help them acquire the competencies as outlined by the FEMA Emergency Management Higher Education Program and will prepare them to work in an all-hazards preparedness environment. Disaster management is a critical challenge and responsibility of government, businesses, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and health care agencies and institutions. Response to disasters begins long before the disaster occurs, involving pre-disaster planning, mid-disaster operations, and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. A successful response can only be carried out through the coordinated efforts of all levels of government, the public and private sector stakeholders, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as the involvement of faith-based organizations. The program will help meet the need for trained emergency management professionals at local, state, national, and international levels. The Master of Science in Disaster and Emergency Management not only develops the skills in leadership, but facilitates students in gaining specialized training in emergency management and disaster response related to: 1) maritime safety and security, 2) cybersecurity, 3) criminal justice, 4) public health, 5) environmental hazards, and/or 6) fire administration. With the increased threat of terrorism, law enforcement and public health personnel need additional training in the areas of response and recovery and fire fighters need additional skills to oversee their departments in this new landscape. As the threats of cyber-theft, cyber-crime, cyber- fraud, and cyber-warfare continue to increase, computer and IT professionals need additional training in protecting our nation's assets and infrastructure. In addition, as the incidents of piracy on the high seas continue to grow and the potential for terrorists to attack our ports becomes more imminent, maritime security has become a high priority. As natural hazards continue to increase, environmental and meteorological experts are being called upon more and more for their input related to these disasters. This degree program fits the mission of NSU in that it provides an \"accessible distance learning\" program while \"fostering intellectual inquiry, leadership, and commitment to community through engagement of students\" by providing an online curriculum that is convenient, but also offers ample student and faculty member engagement. The program fosters community involvement by requiring a community research capstone project. The curriculum also supports the mission of the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine for \"producing compassionate and ethical lifelong learners and advocating for the health and welfare of diverse patient populations\" through its specialty concentration in public health, while the overarching goal of the degree to prepare communities to be more prepared and resilient to disasters serves the overall general health and welfare of all. Program Objectives By creating a cadre of individuals who interact with the public and private sectors, the program in disaster and emergency management can help to create an environment in which all-hazards initiatives include preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery as the standard. Students who graduate from this program will achieve the following program objectives: provide leadership skills to individuals entering the field of emergency management and disaster response demonstrate leadership skills in planning for and responding to disaster and emergency situations (both natural and man made) identify, describe, and respond to the types of threats and risks associated with natural and man-made disasters demonstrate the skills to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability risk assessment at the community, county, state, and national levels90 Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Disaster and Emergency Management Program demonstrate knowledge and skills of available tools and resources for disaster and emergency planning and response analyze the disaster process and differentiate disaster response actions, including recovery operations, from routine emergency operations exhibit competencies for disaster mitigation, response, and recovery at the individual, community, and state levels demonstrate the knowledge and skills necessary to build resilience post-disaster in a variety of disaster settings enter the field of emergency management and be leaders within this discipline Course of Study The M.S. program consists of six core courses (18 credits hours) which include: 1) an introductory course in all-hazards preparedness; 2) applied research methods; 3) disaster planning and evaluation; 4) a course in management and leadership; 5) a course covering different types of potential hazards, threats, and impacts to a community; and 6) a community research practicum. Along with these core requirements, the student can choose one of several concentrations, or choose to pursue a more generalized educational program in disaster and emergency management. If one of the six concentrations is chosen, it requires four courses (12 credit hours) from a list of courses related to that chosen concentration. To complete the degree, an additional two courses (6 credit hours) will be taken from any electives throughout the curriculum. This includes additional management and leadership courses, threats/hazards/impacts courses, general electives, or electives from any one of the six areas of concentration. If a more generalized program of study is desired, the student must take six courses (18 credit hours), in addition to the required courses, from any part of the curriculum. These may include additional management and leadership courses, threats/hazards/impacts courses, general electives, or any of the concentration electives. All students also have the option of choosing up to two courses (6 credit hours) from a preapproved selection of courses from the Master of Science in National Security Affairs and International Relations, a partner degree program offered by the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences. These credits would substitute for general electives in the M.S. DEM program of study. In order to analyze the broad spectrum of hazardous events and to appropriately assess and employ the large volume and rapidly evolving literature in this field, all students are required to take biostatistics and an introductory course in all-hazards preparedness, as well as the practicum in their chosen specialization concentration. In addition to the three courses required for all students, each student must take a core of 3 credit hours from the Management and Leadership cluster and 3 credit hours from the Threats, Hazards, and Impacts cluster. Realizing that disaster and emergency management often crosses the boundaries of interests, as well as the professional lines of homeland security and other disciplines, students in the program will be able to take courses from related programs at NSU, such as conflict resolution, sociology, or psychology, as a substitute for up to 6 general elective credit hours (with permission of the adviser).

Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Medical Education ProgramEducation is at a crossroads. Physicians and other health professionals are sought after to serve as educators in their respective professions. While they have strong recognition as experts in their clinical discipline, typically, they have little or no formal training in the educational process. Today's students no longer merely watch, listen, and memorize information. Those medical professionals who choose to teach in the health professions must be guided by new innovations and contemporary technology in order to better understand how people learn. It is important for educators in the health care professions to facilitate the learning process. Graduates of health programs should learn to connect and integrate multiple forms of reasoning (critical and creative thinking) and types of knowledge (formal and case-based) in order to provide the best patient care. Faculty members should be prepared to integrate formal knowledge and concepts fundamental to professional practice in a manner that is relevant to students and residents in a clinical context. To this end, the Nova Southeastern University Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine has developed a Master of Science in Medical Education program. This 36-credit-hour, online degree program is designed to help health professionals enhance their professional education and teaching skills, as well as expand their ability to facilitate the learning process of students and residents in a variety of clinical teaching environments. The program is composed of 3-credit-hour courses and includes assessment and evaluation educational methodologies research technology in education learning styles The rich, interprofessional platform of NSU's Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine and Health Professions Division provides an excellent environment for this degree program, as it parallels the interprofessional delivery model of patient-care settings.

(3 credit hours) Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Nutrition Program 107Nutrition Program The Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine (KPCOM) offers an innovative Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Nutrition in response to the growing demand for nutrition professionals at a mastery level. Ongoing changes in the American health care system have increased demand for wellness and preventative services, which include nutrition in almost all areas of practice. Nutrition assessment and nutrition intervention for chronic diseases are important components of health care reform mandates. This 42-credit-hour, online degree program incorporates the latest technology and tools in distance learning through synchronous meetings and self-directed activities to maximize the student's experience in the courses. In addition, all students are required to spend time on campus at the beginning of the program of study for orientation and at the end of the program to present their final projects and to participate in graduation ceremonies. The rich, interprofessional platform of NSU's Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine and Health Professions Division provides an excellent environment for this degree program. Nutrition is an essential part of medicine and health care delivery. This degree is intended to provide a strong educational foundation in human nutrition, applied sciences, and health promotion for health care practitioners, and better prepare nutritionists and dietitians to work in a variety of settings at the mastery level of practice. Some of the settings where our students work include hospitals, long-term care facilities, physician offices/private clinics, outpatient care centers, schools and universities, home health, corporations, athletic training centers or gyms, health departments, food production centers and plants, health care insurance companies, and private consulting businesses. The job outlook for appropriately trained dietitians and nutritionists is better than the average for other health-related disciplines. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017), employment in the nutrition field is expected to increase 16 percent during the next seven years. Job growth is primarily expected in the areas of wellness, prevention of disease with diet and foods, and greater integration of nutrition practice into primary care. Career outlooks incorporate a variety of specialties and settings. Possible career options include research, health center, public health, or school nutritionist nutrition entrepreneur nutrition consultant over the life cycle specialized clinical dietitian/nutritionist health/lifestyle coach or consultant culinary entrepreneur college instructor corporate wellness educator employee health and wellness coordinator media and communications professional personal trainer/health and fitness instructor The program will be a source of continuing graduate education for students from the athletic training, exercise science, and physical education programs. Students in osteopathic medicine, public health, and other health disciplines may also select a minor in this program or may obtain a concurrent degree. The M.S. in Nutrition provides an excellent interprofessional graduate degree for students in other health professions, such as medicine, dentistry, optometry, or pharmacy. The degree does not provide the required elements to become eligible to sit for the board certification as a registered dietitian nutritionist. The M.S. in Nutrition program has been accepted by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) as an early adopter Future Model of Education demonstration program eligible for candidacy. Future updates will be forthcoming on a proposed professional practice concentration for 2019 as the program completes the final steps in this professional accreditation process for preparing Registered Dietitian Nutritionists. The M.S. in Nutrition degree will satisfy the course of study requirements to meet Florida licensure criteria. Applicants should consult their own state professional licensing requirements to assess other practice requirements. Course of Study The curriculum is designed so that all students receive a 15-credit-hour core in the fundamental knowledge of nutrition. All students are also required to complete a 6-credit-hour special project focused on an original individual or community-based research project that adds experiential learning and competency to their preparation. Students proceed through a generalist program of study or can declare concentrations in sports nutrition, community nutrition, or functional nutrition and herbal therapy. Students are required to come to the NSU main campus both to begin their studies\u2014meeting with program advisers\u2014and at the completion of the program of study\u2014to present their final projects and meet 108 Dr. Kiran C.

Castejon, Ph.D. Chair, Pharmaceutical Sciences William D. Hardigan, B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Dean Emeritus Overview With the nation struggling to deliver high quality, affordable health care, there has come a greater appreciation of the importance of pharmacists as members of today's health care team. The pharmacist's role has expanded rapidly from drug compounding and distribution to a patient-centered role. The College of Pharmacy is educating its students in practices vital to meeting the challenges facing the profession and leading to improved health and wellness while reducing health care costs. The College of Pharmacy admitted its first class in 1987 to become the first College of Pharmacy in South Florida. Since then, it has graduated more than 4,500 pharmacy professionals. The college offers the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree program, a Ph.D. or M.S. in Pharma- ceutical Sciences, and an M.S. in Pharma ceutical Affairs. Pharmacists are experts on drugs and therapeutic goals, their biological action and uses, formulation, adverse effects, and potential for drug interactions. Pharmacists must be able to think quickly and accurately in an organized manner, despite environmental distractions; be able to communicate effectively; and have interprofessional abilities sufficient to interact with others. They consider both the medication and the patient to ensure the patient College of Pharmacy Michelle A. Clark, Ph.D., Interim Dean126 College of Pharmacyhas the right drug, in the right amount, for the right length of time, and with minimal adverse effects. The result is improved health care. Most pharmacists practice in patient-oriented settings: in community pharmacies, hospitals, extended care facilities, or public health clinics. In addition, pharmacists are employed by the pharmaceutical industry in research and development, in manufacturing, or as medical service representatives. They work in academic institutions, government, health maintenance organizations, and home health care programs. The college embraces these opportunities for pharmacists to assume a wider role in the health care needs of society, and qualified students have the opportunity to earn concurrent master's degrees in either business administration (M.B.A.), public health (M.P .H.), or biomedical informatics (M.S.). Ph.D. graduates focus on expanding the science of drug knowledge by creating and testing new drug molecules or using technology to develop new dosage forms. This field responds to needs identified by practicing pharmacists in caring for patients. The pharmaceutical scientist is very knowledgeable in pharmacology, pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, and administration. The M.S. in Pharmaceutical Affairs and M.S. in Pharmaceutical Sciences prepare graduates to work with professionals in diverse environments, such as the pharmaceutical industry, academia, governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and health care systems. Accreditation The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, 135 S. LaSalle Street, Suite 4100, Chicago, IL 60603, (312) 664-3575, 800-533-3606; Fax (312) 664-4652, website: www.acpe-accredit.org, has accredited the Doctor of Pharmacy Program of the College of Pharmacy, Nova Southeastern University. Memberships The College of Pharmacy is a member of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. The College of Pharmacy is also a member of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). Facilities The College of Pharmacy administrative offices are located on the third floor of the Health Professions Division Administration Building. Pharmacy practice and research laboratories are located on the third floor of the Library / Laboratories Building. The NSU Palm Beach Campus and NSU Puerto Rico Regional Campus have administrative offices, classrooms, and labs on site. Experiential sites are primarily located throughout Florida and Puerto Rico, and pharmacy practice faculty members are assigned to innovative, patient-centered facilities in South Florida and Puerto Rico. The M.S. in Pharmaceutical Affairs Program is based at NSU's Miami Campus. In the fall of 2000, the NSU College of Pharmacy opened a program in Palm Beach County. After spending many years at a shared site, NSU was happy to move to its own four-story, 75,000-square-foot facility. Classes began at the new location in the fall of 2011. The NSU Palm Beach Campus features 26 classrooms, including four labs. It also includes a student lounge, a fitness area, a pharmacy library, and offices. In the fall of 2001, a full-time program on the campus of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico in Ponce, Puerto Rico, was opened. The Puerto Rico program moved to its new location in San Juan in 2014. The San Juan location has state-of-the-art facilities for pharmacy students and is equipped with lecture halls; study rooms; computer, pharmaceutics, and patient care management laboratories; a Drug Information Center; and additional meeting and classroom space fully equipped for compressed interactive video. Each campus has administrators and faculty and staff members. Interactive video technology is used to provide lectures among the three campuses simultaneously. This provides for live interaction between lecturer and students regardless of location. Identical handouts, tests, and texts are used. Communication through telephone, fax, online technologies, and email are available to students at all campuses. All students have access to the Health Professions Division Library, computer labs, online learning resources, and the vast technological innovations provided by NSU, which has been a leader in distance education programs for many years. The pharmaceutical care center and pharmacy are adjacent to the health clinic in Fort Lauderdale. This is a community pharmacy with disease management services for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and anticoagulation. It also manages pharmacy services, including drug regimen review, consultation, and teaching.

Course of Study The Doctor of Pharmacy degree is awarded after successful completion of four years of professional study in the College of Pharmacy. The curriculum stresses innovative teaching delivery and assessment methods. Students are provided an initial orientation during which they are exposed to library and online resources, professionalism, and academic expectations. The curriculum is designed so courses integrate information and build on one another in order to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the profession. The curriculum meets the changing needs of the profession. The evolution of the practice of pharmacy has increased the types and depth of care pharmacists provide to patients. The generalist practitioner must collect, analyze, synthesize, and communicate information relating to the selection and use of medication. Pharmacists who practice \"at the top of their license\" are required to be certified in immunization to perform vaccinations and may need to complete postgraduate residencies and specialty Board Certification for employment in hospitals. The curriculum uses active-learning components to improve critical thought process, reflective activity to stimulate professional growth, and experiential learning to optimize provision of patient-centered care. College of Pharmacy\u2014Entry-Level Program 133Course content, teaching modalities, enhanced assessments, and incorporation of a block structure promote student learning and professional growth. The curricular design is based upon the 3 Ps. Prepare knowledge in the classroom. Practice skills in the laboratory. Provide direct care in experiential activities. Students will learn, understand, retain, and apply pharmaceutical principles to patient-centered care. At the end of the first and second years, students will complete required Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs). IPPE: Community Pharmacy is a four-week, full-time (160-hour) outpatient experience highlighting the operations and practice management aspects of community pharmacy practice. IPPE: Health Systems is a four-week, full-time (160-hour) inpatient experience highlighting the operations and practice management aspects of health systems pharmacy practice. During the final year, students will complete eight 160- hour Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs) in direct patient care areas and elective experiences in specialty health care areas. APPEs continue the student's education by providing opportunities for the clinical application of patient care in a broad variety of health care environments and systems. At this point in the curriculum, it is expected that student pharmacists practice drug therapy monitoring with more independence. Each semester of the fourth-year curriculum includes a Curricular Review course that provides resources for student-initiated review to assess and strengthen students' knowledge and skills developed during the curriculum. Students are required to return to their respective campuses at designated times each semester for live instruction and assessment. Note: APPEs are full-time commitments for the students (a minimum of 40 hours per week). Students are responsible for having reliable transportation (e.g., personal vehicle) to attend assigned IPPE and APPE sites. Students may be required to secure accommodation at APPE sites away from their home location. APPEs may be taken in any sequence, however students may not begin APPEs until all didactic courses, IPPEs, and assessments, are successfully completed. Failure to successfully complete required coursework may prevent the student from progressing in the curriculum. Students have 60 days after the end of the semester to resolve any grade disputes; after that, the instructor may discard all materials from the semester. This may lead to a delay in graduation. The program must be completed within six academic years from the date of matriculation.Travel Study Opportunities for travel study programs may be provided during the summer. Students must be preapproved to participate in travel study programs. Graduation Requirements\u2014Entry Level To receive a Pharm.D. degree, a student must fulfill the following requirements: be of good moral character successfully complete all curricular requirements and assessments within six academic years have a minimum GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale for alpha grading, or 70 percent for numerical grading satisfactorily meet all financial obligations complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of didactic coursework and all APPEs at NSU COP , if transferring from another college of pharmacy submit to the registrar's office an application for degree / diploma by the posted deadline.

Course of Study The Doctor of Optometry degree is awarded after successful completion of four years of professional study. The didactic focus of the first two years is in the basic sciences, including biochemistry, microbiology, anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, optics, and the vision sciences. Some of the basic science courses are taught in combined classes with other health care students. Concurrently, students initiate the study of general optometric theory and methods; general pathology; and the diagnosis, treatment, and management of binocular vision anomalies and ocular disease in preparation for direct patient care in our primary care clinic. In the third academic year, students study contact lenses, pediatric, geriatric, and rehabilitative optometry and develop a deeper understanding and ability to diagnose, treat, and manage increasingly complex conditions concerning anomalies of vision development and ocular disease. Additionally, students begin training in the primary care clinic by providing direct patient eye care. The fourth year of the academic program is entirely clinical with intensive training in university-based or affiliated primary, secondary, and tertiary care facilities. These include clinics dealing with contact lenses, pediatrics, binocular vision, low vision, and geriatric issues. Students also receive training in medical/ surgical tertiary care settings. By the completion of the program, our students have been trained to be optometric physicians capable of providing quality eye care. Extended (Five-Year) Doctor of Optometry Degree The College of Optometry has instituted an extended program leading to the Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree. The extended program is designed for individuals who are returning to school after an absence, are changing professional fields, or who require a lighter course load initially because of family or other obligations.

Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences 217Core Performance Standards for Admission and Progress The Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is pledged to the admission and matriculation of qualified students and wishes to acknowledge awareness of laws that prohibit discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations. Regarding those students with verifiable disabilities, the university will not discriminate against such individuals who are otherwise qualified, but will expect applicants and students to meet certain minimal technical standards (core performance standards) as set forth herein, with or without reasonable accommodation. In adopting these standards, the university believes it must keep in mind the ultimate safety of the patients whom its graduates will eventually serve as well as the efficacy and safety in the learning environment. The standards reflect what the university believes are reasonable expectations required of health professions students and personnel in performing common functions. Any exceptions to such standards must be approved by the dean of the student's particular college based upon appropriate circumstances. The holders of health care degrees must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to carry out the activities described below, candidates for Health Professions Division degrees must be able to integrate consistently, quickly, and accurately all information received, and they must have the ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Honor and integrity of the health professions student and health care professional is essential and depends on the exemplary behavior of the individual health care provider in his or her relations with patients, faculty members, and colleagues. This includes accountability to oneself and to relationships with fellow students, future colleagues, faculty members, patients, and members of the general public who come under the student's care or contribute to his or her training and growth. This applies to personal conduct that reflects on the student's honesty and integrity in both academic and nonacademic settings, whether or not involving an NSU-sponsored activity. All students must have the capacity to manage their lives and anticipate their own needs. Upon accepting admission to NSU, each student subscribes to and pledges complete observance to NSU's Code of Conduct Policies. A violation of these standards is an abuse of the trust placed in every student and could lead to suspension or dismissal. Candidates for degrees offered by the Health Professions Division must have, with or without reasonable accommodation, multiple abilities and skills including intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; interpersonal communication; mobility and strength; motor skills; and hearing, visual, tactile, behavioral, and social attributes. Candidates for admission and progression must be able to perform these abilities and skills in a reasonably independent manner. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Qualitative Abilities These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving\u2014a critical skill\u2014requires all of these intellectual abilities. Candidates and students must have critical thinking ability sufficient for good clinical judgment. This is necessary to identify cause/effect relationships in clinical situations and to develop plans of care. In addition, candidates and students should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. An individual is expected to be able to perform multiple tasks in a diverse, dynamic, highly competitive, and challenging learning environment. Examples include, but are not limited to, identification of cause/effect relationships in clinical situations, development of treatment plans, transferring knowledge from one situation to another, evaluating outcomes, problem solving, prioritizing, and using short- and long-term memory. All individuals are expected to meet their program requirements on a satisfactory level as determined by HPD administration or the applicable college/program administration. Students must be able to perform multiple tasks in a diverse, dynamic, highly competitive, and challenging environment. They must be able to think quickly and accurately in an organized manner, despite environmental distractions. Interpersonal Communication Candidates and students must be able to interact and communicate effectively\u2014with respect to policies, protocols, and processes\u2014with faculty and staff members, students, patients, patient surrogates, and administration during the student's educational program. They must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but also reading and writing. Candidates and students must also be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in all written forms with all members of the health care team. They must have interpersonal abilities sufficient to interact with individuals, families, and groups from a variety of social, emotional, cultural, and intellectual backgrounds. A student must have sufficient proficiency with English to retrieve information from texts and lectures and communicate concepts on written exams and patient charts; elicit patient backgrounds; describe patient changes in moods, activity, and posture; and coordinate patient 218 Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciencescare with all members of the health care team. A student must be able to communicate or provide communication in lay language so that patients and their families can understand the patient's conditions, treatment options, and instructions. The student must be able to accurately enter information in the patient's electronic health record, according to his or her program's requirements. Motor Skills Candidates and students must have sufficient motor function to execute movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of some health care professionals are cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, and the ability to calibrate and use various pieces of equipment. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Physical therapy and occupational therapy students must be able to position patients for treatment, as well as teach the functions involving gross and fine movements. Strength and Mobility Candidates and students must have sufficient mobility to attend emergency codes and to perform such maneuvers as CPR when required. They must have the physical ability to move sufficiently from room to room and to maneuver in small places. Physical therapy and occupational therapy students must be able to administer treatment in a variety of settings and positions and move patients when required. Hearing Candidates and students must have sufficient auditory ability to monitor and assess health needs. They must be able to hear information given by the patient in answer to inquires; to hear cries for help; to hear features in an examination, such as the auscultatory sounds; and to monitor equipment. Visual Candidates and students must have visual ability sufficient for observation, assessment, and rendering of treatment necessary in patient care. It must be consistent in many cases with being able to assess asymmetry, range of motion, and tissue texture changes. Physician assistant students must have sufficient visual ability to use ophthalmologic instruments. It is necessary to have adequate visual capabilities for proper evaluation and treatment integration. Candidates and students must be able to observe the patient and the patient's responses, including body language and features of the examination and treatment.Tactile Candidates and students must have sufficient tactile ability for physical assessment. They must be able to perform palpation and functions of physical examination and/or those related to therapeutic intervention. Sensory Physician assistants are required to have an enhanced ability to use their sensory skills. These enhanced tactile and proprioceptive sensory skills are essential for appropriate evaluation and treatment of patients. Behavioral and Social Attributes Candidates and students must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the ability to take responsibility for their own actions\u2014with respect to policies, protocols, and processes\u2014with faculty and staff members, students, patients, patient surrogates, and administration during the student's educational program; the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis, care, and treatment of patients; and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with the patients. Candidates and students must be able to physically tolerate taxing workloads, to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, diversity, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that will be assessed during the admissions and education process. Expenses and Financial Aid Students should anticipate spending approximately $3,000 for books and $19,000 per academic year for living expenses. The primary financial responsibility for a student's education rests with the student and his or her family, but economic circumstances for some families may make it necessary for the student to obtain assistance from other sources. The purpose of the Student Financial Assistance Program at Nova Southeastern University is to help as many qualified students as possible to complete their health professions education. Various loans, scholarships, and grants are available to qualified students to help ease the high cost of a health professions education. These assistance programs are described in a variety of separate university publications. The demands of these programs limit the number of hours a student can work at an outside job. During the months of clinical rotations, it is difficult or impossible for the students to work. Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Anesthesia 219Promotion, Suspension, Dismissal, and Readmission The policies for promotion, suspension, dismissal, and readmission are outlined in the Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook, which is revised, updated, and distributed annually to all students. Anesthesiologist Assistants (AAs), also known as anesthetists, are highly educated and skilled allied health professionals who work under the supervision of physician anesthesiologists to develop and implement anesthesia care plans. AAs work exclusively within the anesthesia care team environment as described by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). AAs possess a premedical background and a baccalaureate degree, and also complete a comprehensive didactic and clinical program at the graduate level. AAs are trained extensively in the delivery and maintenance of quality anesthesia care as well as advanced patient monitoring techniques. The goal of AA education is to nurture the transformation of qualified student applicants into competent health care practitioners who aspire to practice in the anesthesia care team. The 27-month AA course of study consists of an intensive academic and didactic program that will prepare the student to function within the anesthesia care team. The students will get an extensive clinical training experience that will consist of a minimum of 2,000 clinical hours that encompass all aspects of anesthesia care for the surgical patient. Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a Master of Science (M.S.) in Anesthesia degree from NSU. Students are trained in state-of-the-art AA facilities. Our classroom features high-definition technology\u2014providing crisp visual presentation of course materials\u2014and video recording capabilities, which allow students to review course lectures. The student's educational experience is enhanced by two of the largest fully functional operating rooms. The NSU AA programs are the only ones in the country to have four high-fidelity anesthesia simulators (two adult, one pediatric, and one infant).

At the standard pace established by the program, the course of study can be completed in three years. It is required that all coursework be completed within seven years. Admissions Requirements Prospective D.H.Sc. students are selected by the Committee on Admissions, which considers the overall qualities of applicants and their suitability for this course of study. Areas of consideration include application content, academic record, prior health care experience, letters of evaluation, and personal motivation. In special circumstances, a personal interview with members of the committee on admissions may be required.1. Prior to matriculation, applicants must have completed a master's degree from a regionally accredited college or university. 2. Applicants should demonstrate a cumulative master's degree G.P .A. at or above a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be eligible for regular admission. The Committee on Admissions will make a recommendation to the dean of the college as to any remedial coursework necessary for an applicant to achieve full admission. 3. Prior health care experience is required and is strongly considered in the admissions process. The D.H.Sc. is a postprofessional degree designed for advanced health practitioners, public health professionals, and health care administrators from a wide variety of disciplines. The commonality exhibited by our students is the expert practice of a recognized health occupation at a professional level, or five years of administrative experience in a health care organization with progressively increasing responsibilities over that time frame. The successful applicant's health profession may emphasize delivery of services to individual clients (e.g., PA, PT, R.N., LCSW, etc.) or be population based (M.P .H., M.H.A.). An appropriate level of professional practice is generally recognized by health professions licensure (e.g., R.N., PT), a national certification or registration (e.g., PA-C, RVT, RRT, CRNA, FACHE), a recognized M.P .H., M.S.N., M.S.W ., M.H.A., M.B.A.), or a combination of the above. All questions regarding the appropriateness of an applicant's qualifications for admission can be discussed with the department chair or program director on an informal basis, but the official recommendations are made by the Committee on Admi ssions to the dean of the Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences. The dean makes the final determination. Successful past applicants and graduates have included physicians, dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician assistants, master's degree-level social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dental hygienists, and athletic trainers. We have recently expanded the program to include health care administrators, and our graduates now include a hospital CEO and an assistant surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service. 4. All applicants must show evidence of computer skills through coursework or self study prior to the end of the first term. Students may obtain instruction through the NSU Student Microcomputer Laboratory, the D.H.Sc. Orientation Center, or other training facilities.Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.)

(2 credits, continuing service charge) HSP 9008\u2014Comprehensive Exam The comprehensive examination is a written examination that students take after the completion of all the required Ph.D. in Health Science coursework and before beginning the dissertation phase of the Ph.D. program. It is designed to evaluate a student's ability to demonstrate that he or she is a suitable candidate for a Ph.D. degree. Successful completion of the comprehensive examination is required for students to move to advanced standing and begin dissertation research. The comprehensive examination is given two times per academic year, during the summer and winter semesters, and takes place on the Fort Lauderdale/Davie Campus. Students must take the comprehensive examination within one year of completion of all academic coursework. Failure to complete the requirements within the time frame may result in dismissal from the program. Students who register for the comprehensive examination certify by this action that they are prepared to take the exam. However, participating in the comprehensive examination center does not mean that students will pass the comprehensive examination. Students can withdraw from the comprehensive examination without a reason up to 10 days before the exam. Once this time has passed, students with circumstances beyond their control (such as sickness, car accident, family illness or other extenuating circumstances), must notify the Ph.D. program director at the earliest possible time and provide documentation to support their need to withdraw from the exam. Students who have obtained approval from the Ph.D. program director to withdraw from the comprehensive examination will be allowed to take the comprehensive examination at the next scheduled offering. Students who registered for the comprehensive examination and who fail to take the exam, or students who do not contact the program director requesting to be excused from the examination, will automatically fail the comprehensive examination. Students who have failed the comprehensive examination are referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP). The CSP will examine the student's individual case and will make appropriate recommendations to the department chair or designee. See the procedures for the Committee on Student Progress and Student Appeals in the Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook.The grading of the comprehensive examination is on a Pass/Fail basis. Students are notified of their results on the comprehensive examination by certified mail and copies of the letters are sent to students' NSU email accounts. Following the successful completion of the comprehensive examination, students can register for dissertation credits and begin the dissertation process. Students are only allowed to take the complete comprehensive exam once and must pass all three categories to move forward to the dissertation phase of the Ph.D. program. Students who fail one or two of the three categories on the comprehensive examination have failed the exam and are referred to the CSP . The CSP will examine the student's individual case and may recommend that the student be allowed to retake a failed category or categories at the next scheduled institute. Students who do not pass all three exam questions and are given permission to retake one or two questions at the next exam offering will be required to enroll in an additional 1-credit continuation course. If students are allowed to retake a failed category, they have one opportunity to pass all failed categories. Failure of one or two categories on retake results in the student's second failure of the comprehensive exam. Students who fail the comprehensive examination on retake are referred to the CSP for possible dismissal from the Ph.D. program. Students who wish to dispute their grades must contact the Ph.D. program director, as there is no direct communication between graders and students. Grade disputes must be submitted in writing within five business days of notification of the comprehensive examination results. The program director will interact directly with the faculty member who graded the exams and inform the student of the grader's comments. The grade dispute ends at the program director. All college-wide policies regarding academic honesty, the student progress committee, and appeals apply to the comprehensive exam. Students are required to familiarize themselves with the academic standards and the academic honesty policy and procedure as described in the Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences Student Handbook. HSP 9011, 9012, 9013, 9014, 9015, and 9016\u2014Dissertation The dissertation is scheduled as six courses over two years. This includes the dissertation preparation seminar, proposal, dissertation, and oral defense. Students will conduct original research in an area of the student's expertise or concentration, as approved by the program chair and dissertation committee, with verification of presentation or publication. The dissertation will culminate with an oral final defense, which will occur in person at 296 Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences\u2014Department of Occupational Therapythe summer or winter institute, or on the Fort Lauderdale /Davie Campus. The oral defense must be arranged at least 45 days in advance. Process and requirements are detailed in the Health Professions Division Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences Dissertation Guide. (12 credits) HSP 9017\u2014 Dissertation Continuation For any additional semester after the initial six courses, students will register for a dissertation continuation course with a continuing service charge to maintain the students' full-time enrollment. At the end of each semester, students who demonstrate forward progress on their dissertation will earn a PR (in progress) grade. Students who do not demonstrate forward progress will earn an NPR (not in progress) grade. Students who earn an NPR grade in any dissertation course may register for the next semester, although they may not be eligible for federal funds. Students' progress through dissertation continuation may increase their total number of degree credits beyond the required 67. (2 credits, continuing service charge) On-Campus Institutes These one-week sessions are located either at the Fort Lauderdale/Davie Campus or the Tampa Campus. A minimum of three institutes are required to complete the Ph.D. degree. DHS 8080 and DHS 8170 will be offered as summer institutes. HSP 9007 will be offered as a fall or winter institute. Occupational therapists provide services to enhance participation and function in daily occupations, including self care, work, and leisure. Occupational therapists frequently work with individuals when performance has been interrupted or jeopardized by disease, injury, disability, life stress, or other factors. Therapy consists of clients' planned involvement in occupation\u2014purposeful and meaningful activities\u2014that positively influences their life adaptation. This involvement in occupation may be facilitated by supportive training, specialized equipment, environmental modification and/or problem solving to accomplish life tasks. The therapeutic process is founded upon the belief that individuals are the principal agents of their own adaptation, and through active involvement in occupation, can have a significant impact on their health status, and well-being. The occupational therapist must be an expert in the knowledge of occupation, its role in health and adaptation, and its use in therapy. Occupational therapy practice requires the therapist to exercise increasingly complex, autonomous decision-making and problem-solving skills in multifactorial situations. The therapist must, therefore, be a critical thinker, capable of evaluating and synthesizing information from a variety of sources about a wide range of phenomena. Finally, the therapist should be a reflective practitioner able to evaluate his or her own clinical reasoning. The NSU Department of Occupational Therapy offers an entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy (M.O.T.) degree, an entry-level Doctor of Occupational Therapy (O.T.D.), and two postprofessional degrees: a Doctor of Occupational Therapy (Dr.O.T.), and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). The M.O.T. program is a full- time, campus-based entry-level program. The M.O.T. is designed so that a student may enter after completing an undergraduate or graduate degree from a regionally accredited college or university. The Dr.O.T. and Ph.D. are postprofessional OT degrees offered through distance education. Master of Occupational Therapy Accreditation The entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), located at 4720 Montgomery Lane, Suite 200, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-3449. ACOTE's telephone number, care of AOTA, is (301) 652-AOTA. Graduates of the program will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). After successful completion of this exam, the individual will be an Occupational Therapist, Registered (OTR). In addition, most states require licensure in order to practice; however, state licenses are usually based on the results of the NBCOT certification examination.

In addition to providing direct patient care services, physical therapists serve as administrators of physical therapy services, educators, and consultants. They screen people for potential risk for movement dysfunction in order to prevent impairment and disability and engage in critical inquiry to conduct and review research. Physical therapists work in a range of settings including acute and subacute care hospitals, rehabilitation centers, outpatient clinics, home health, skilled nursing facilities, school systems, and industrial settings. Physical therapists work as employees of health care systems, may independently contract their services, or own and manage a private practice. In any setting, for every patient, physical therapists perform a history and physical examination; conduct assessments to determine a diagnosis; select, perform, and supervise appropriate physical therapy interventions; and monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Physical therapists are licensed in all states and may practice without physician referral in most of them. They are integral members of health care teams in a variety of service systems who serve to improve and maintain the quality of life for millions of people. Nova Southeastern University's Department of Physical Therapy prepares professional and postprofessional physical therapists with the skills, knowledge, and values to effectively practice, educate, lead, and conduct physical therapy education and research in interprofessional environments. The curricula foster clinical inquiry and reasoning, professionalism, and evidence-based practice. The programs facilitate accessibility to physical therapist education through innovative instructional delivery models and promote intellectual curiosity, reflection, and lifelong learning skills. Faculty members, students, and alumni actively participate in the profession through scholarship, service, collaboration, mentoring, and serving those in need of PT services locally, nationally, and globally.

Students are exposed to a variety of case studies, representing all Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physical Therapy 343adult neuromuscular practice patterns in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, to integrate and apply previously learned neuromuscular skills. Emphasis is placed on disease- specific tests and measures and application of clinical reasoning during all steps of patient/client management and throughout the course of management (acute to chronic); the ability to apply evidence in practice; the design and execution of patient/client-related instruction; delegation to support personnel; and documentation of all aspects of care. This class also addresses primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention for patients with neuromuscular conditions. (2 credits) PHTT 6914L\u2014Neuromuscular Systems II Lab This course is the laboratory component of Neuromuscular Systems II. In it, students will perform all aspects of patient/ client management including examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, development of a plan of care, procedural interventions, and outcome measurement for individuals with various neurologic conditions. Students will apply these techniques to a variety of case studies, representing the scope of adult practice patterns in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice. Neuromuscular Systems II culminates in an intense, one-week laboratory experience, the Neuro Boot Camp, in which students work with real clients who have complicated neuromuscular disorders in a faculty-supervised setting. Students are responsible for performing a thorough examination, writing a comprehensive plan of care, performing procedural interventions, providing patient instruction, and communicating with caregivers. (2 credits) PHTT 6920\u2014Applied Clinical Decision Making The course focuses on developing and refining fourth- year D.P .T. students' clinical reasoning skills by making thinking visible. We use a clinical reasoning framework that incorporates the Patient/Client Management Model, the ICF Framework, and Sch\u00f6n's reflective practice elements to build students' thinking and clinical decision- making routines. Students work under the guidance of expert clinicians skilled in empowering students to do the clinical reasoning themselves. Learning activities incorporate specific questions that target clinical reasoning strategies used for diagnosis; patient/client management; and ethical problem solving when faced with complex, ambiguous, uncertain, and unpredictable case scenarios and make clinical reasoning processes explicit to the students. Students' clinical reasoning capabilities are developed through exercises that incorporate reflection, as well as critical, complex, and dialectical thinking skills. Online and face-to-face learning activities mimic real-life clinical scenarios where students are required to demonstrate their ability to adjust their examination and treatment techniques for medically complex patients based on changing patient responses during a treatment session and/or episode of care. (4 credits)Fall-Winter PHTT 6911\u2014Clinical Internship I The Hybrid D.P .T. program's clinical internships occur in the fall and winter of a student's fourth year, after completion of all didactic coursework and consists of three consecutive, full-time, supervised, clinical internships totaling 36 weeks. The goal of clinical internship placements is for student achievement of entry-level competency and professional behaviors in a variety of clinical settings. Students engage in patient/ client management, including examination, evaluation, determination of diagnosis, prognosis, and plan of care, as well as providing interventions. They practice clinical decision-making based on evidence, patient goals, and the experience of their clinical instructor(s). Students refine their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors in a variety of patient-care settings across adulthood or the life span and across the continuum of care commonly seen in physical therapy practice. They are expected to demonstrate progressive independence in managing patients of increasing complexity within each practice setting. Students are expected to demonstrate effective communication and documentation skills, professionalism consistent with the American Physical Therapy Association's core values, and cultural competence, as well as ethical and legal practice appropriate to federal and state guidelines.

Activities include online review modules, self-assessment and practice examinations, a formal NPTE review course, outcomes data collection, presentation of the values portfolio, and preparation for commencement and job readiness. The class begins during clinical internships and culminates during the week prior to graduation. (2 credits) PHTT 6904\u2014Evidence in Practice Capstone Project Evidence-based practice (EBP) integrates evidence from three sources to answer clinically relevant questions concerning 1) research literature; 2) clinician knowledge, experience, and judgment; and 3) patient preferences, values, and circumstances. This is the last of three courses in evidence-based practice. The focus of this course is on the integration of content from the entire curriculum and the application of evidence-based practice to a patient or clinical situation from a clinical education experience. (2 credits) The Physical Therapy Department at Nova Southeastern University offers two postgraduate programs for practicing physical therapists: the clinical doctorate\u2014or transition Doctor of Physical Therapy (T-D.P .T.), and the research doctorate\u2014the Doctor of Philosophy in Physical Therapy (Ph.D.). These two distinct programs are designed to meet the diverse needs of physical therapists who are seeking to advance their education and skills from an accredited institution. Both programs are offered primarily in an online format to meet the needs of working professionals. There is an on-campus component for each core course taken, generally two days per course, per semester. Nova Southeastern University is a recognized leader of distance education and has a well-respected history of innovation and leadership in the health professions. Transition Doctor of Physical Therapy Program (T-D.P .T.) Given the complex health care environment and the growing body of knowledge in the physical therapy profession, entry-level education in physical therapy has shifted toward the clinical doctorate degree. The vision of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) is that by the year 2020, physical therapy will be provided by physical therapists who are doctors of physical therapy. In support of this vision, the Physical Therapy Department at Nova Southeastern University offers the transition Doctor of Physical Therapy (T-D.P .T.) Program. The transition D.P .T. program is a postprofessional curriculum designed to advance the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of practicing physical therapists to those commensurate with the current entry-level doctorate in physical therapy. This program focuses on the professional roles of the D.P .T., clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis, evidence- based practice, and patient/ client management related to optimizing movement, function, and health. The degree awarded upon completion of the program is the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree. Program Outcomes The transition D.P .T. program will prepare physical therapists to demonstrate competent and relevant patient/ client management skills across the continuum of Postprofessional Doctoral Programs in Physical Therapy Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physical Therapy 345care, including examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis and plan of care, interventions, and outcome measurement synthesize current evidence and experience into clinical decision making, incorporating client beliefs, values, and abilities to promote effective and efficient treatment plans in a direct access, autonomous, health care environment engage in critical self-reflection/assessment and life- long learning to enrich core values of professionalism as defined by APTA, including altruism, accountability, compassion/caring, excellence, integrity, professional duty, and social responsibility in all professional roles integrate health promotion, fitness, wellness, and prevention with patients, groups, community, organizations, and society as educators, consultants, administrators, and collaborators conduct analysis of patient, organization, and community needs, abilities, and concerns from a systemic perspective to achieve measurable outcomes that demonstrate effective change Admissions Requirements The following are requirements for admission: 1.

(1 credit)* Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physician Assistant 357Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 100,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialities and in all types of communities. Many PAs practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics (BLS) U.S. Department of Labor, as published in the 2016-2017 Occupational Outlook Handbook, employment of PAs is expected to grow 30 percent from 2014 to 2024. It is the obligation of each physician /PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Department of Physician Assistant offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will be awarded the master of medical science degree in physician assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, and others. The clinical year is devoted to 12 months of training in nine required rotations. Students are required to complete six-week rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, and internal medicine. Students are also required to complete three- week rotations in women's health and behavioral medicine. In addition, students have three elective rotations in any area of medicine they wish to pursue. T wo of the elective rotations are six weeks in length. The remaining elective rotation is four weeks in length.Accreditation The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA) has granted Accreditation\u2014Continued status to the Nova Southeastern University\u2014Fort Lauderdale Physician Assistant Program sponsored by Nova Southeastern University\u2014Fort Lauderdale.

(52-0-4) Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physician Assistant 367Physician Assistant Program\u2014Fort Myers Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, there are more than 100,000 nationally certified physician assistants in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics (BLS) U.S. Department of Labor, as published in the 2016-2017 Occupational Outlook Handbook, employment of PAs is expected to grow 30 percent from 2014 to 2024. It is the obligation of each physician /PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high- quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Program\u2014Fort Myers offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will earn a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in the basic sciences, clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, radiology, clinical behavioral medicine, legal and ethical issues in health care, cultural issues in health care, interpretation and evaluation of medical literature, complementary medicine and nutrition, and clinical pharmacology. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations throughout the state of Florida, primarily within 80-100 miles from NSU's Fort Myers Campus. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by two elective rotations and a selective rotation in one of the following areas: behavioral health, otorhinolaryngology, orthopedics, rural or underserved primary care medicine, or an internal medicine subspecialty. Each student should expect to complete one or more rotations in a rural or underserved area. This will likely entail traveling beyond the 80-100 mile radius of Fort Myers. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, housing will be provided for the student. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.

Your completed supplemental application must be received no later than January 15 in order to be considered for admission for the May/June entering class. Once we receive your GRE scores; copies of all professional certifications, registrations, licenses, or relevant credentialing materials; supplemental application; and $50 fee, your file will be reviewed. Completed applications are reviewed on a \"rolling\" or periodic basis. The applicant will not be considered for a possible interview until the application from CASPA, the supplemental application (signed and dated), the nonrefundable, $50 supplemental application fee, and the Graduate Record Evaluation (GRE) test scores are received by the Nova Southeastern University Physician Assistant Office of Admissions. Personal Interviews Once your application is complete, the Committee on Admissions (COA) will decide whether or not your application is strong enough to warrant an invitation for a personal interview. Interviews are conducted on the Nova Southeastern University campus in Fort Myers, Florida, and are by invitation only. Interviews will be held from September through February. An invitation to interview is not a guarantee of admission. Notice of acceptance or action by the COA will be on a \"rolling\" or periodic schedule; therefore, early completion of the application is in the best interest of the candidate. Transcripts All applicants who are accepted must submit official transcripts of all coursework to the NSU EPS Physician Assistant admissions office prior to matriculation. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that arrangements are made for these transcripts to be sent. Tuition and Fees Tuition for 2018-2019 will be posted on our website (http://healthsciences.nova.edu/pa/fort-myers/faq.html). All tuition and fees are subject to change by the board of trustees without notice. Acceptance fee is $500. This fee is required to reserve the accepted applicant's place in the entering first-year class. This advance payment will be deducted from the tuition payment due on registration day, but is not refundable in the event of a withdrawal. It is payable within two weeks of an applicant's acceptance. Deposit is $500. This is due February 15, under the same terms as the acceptance fee. A Health Professions Division general access fee of $145 is required each year. An NSU student services fee of $1,350 is also required annually. A clinical support charge of $400 will be assessed in each of the three semesters of clinical training. The first semester's tuition and fees, less the $1,000 previously paid, are due on or before registration day. Tuition for each subsequent semester is due on or before the appropriate registration day. Students will not be admitted until their financial obligations have been met. The 370 Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physician Assistantfinancial ability of applicants to complete their training at the college is important because of the limited number of positions available in each class. Applicants should have specific plans for financing 27 months of professional education. This should include tuition, living expenses, books, equipment, and miscellaneous expenses. Each student is required to carry adequate personal medical and hospital insurance. Students may avail themselves of the hospitalization insurance plan obtainable through the university. Opportunity for a limited number of part-time work- study assignments is available. Due to the demands of the PA curriculum, the program discourages any outside employment. Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible to graduate from the Physician Assistant Program, students must successfully complete the program of study required for the degree with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 (C) successfully complete all didactic and clinical coursework demonstrate professional behavior throughout the program satisfactorily meet all financial and library obligations attend, in person, the commencement program, at which time the degree is conferred Academic Dismissal in the Physician Assistant Program See the suspension /dismissal section of the student handbook. Readmission Policy in the Physician Assistant Program In selected cases, and only with the approval of the department chair and college dean, a student may be allowed to be noncompetitively matriculated with the next first-year class. It is emphasized that this only refers to those few students with special academic or personal issues. Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program curriculum is completed following attainment of a baccalaureate degree, including specified course prerequisites. The comprehensive curriculum, completed in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide variety of clinical settings. The first 14.5 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., although there are occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA program requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at the NSU Fort Myers Campus and will not grant requests for advanced placement, transfer of credit, or credit for experiential learning. The clinical year is devoted to 12.5 months of training with required six-week rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care/gynecology, general surgery, and internal medicine; one six-week selective rotation of behavioral health, otorhinolaryngology, orthopedics, rural or underserved primary care medicine, or an internal medicine subspecialty; and one six-week and one four-week elective rotation that may include other selectives or specialties. All required rotations must be completed in Florida, primarily within 80-100 miles from NSU's Fort Myers Campus. Each student will complete at least one rotation in a rural or underserved area. This will likely entail traveling beyond the 80-100-mile radius of Fort Myers, Florida. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, student housing will be provided. Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each rotation, a written comprehensive examination is administered and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, although many rotation sites require a greater student participation. Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). The role of the physician assistant requires a high level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must possess the ability and desire to complete a rigorous academic and clinical program and make a commitment to continued learning.

(0-90-3)376 Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physician AssistantPhysician assistants (PAs) serve as an essential component of a medical system that continues to strive to provide quality, affordable health care for all individuals. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 100,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many practice in primary care settings, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics (BLS) U.S. Department of Labor, as published in the 2016-2017 Occupational Outlook Handbook, employment of PAs is expected to grow 30 percent from 2014 to 2024. It is the obligation of each physician/PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Department of Physician Assistant\u2014Orlando offers a modern program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, the student is awarded a Master of Medical Science degree in Physician Assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instructions in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures, surgical skills, electrocardiography, radiology, and psychiatry. The student also takes courses in the Master of Medical Science program including health care law and ethics, epidemiology and biostatistics, research methodology, cultural issues in health care, publication skills, and medical research, as well as a graduate project. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations predominantly in Central Florida. Required six-week rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, behavioral health, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, general surgery, and one selective of six weeks from one of the following areas: dermatology, geriatrics, otorhinolaryngology, cardiology, neurology, or orthopedics. The clinical year contains one four-week elective rotation. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.Accreditation The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA) has granted Accreditation\u2014Continued status to the Nova Southeastern University\u2014Orlando Physician Assistant Program sponsored by Nova Southeastern University\u2014Orlando.

This fee is required to reserve the accepted applicant's place in the entering first- year class, but is not refundable in the event of a withdrawal. It is payable within two weeks of an applicant's acceptance. Deposit is $500. This is due February 15, or within two weeks of an applicant's acceptance, whichever is the latest, under the same terms as the Acceptance Fee. The first semester's tuition and fees, less the $1,000 previously paid, are due on or before registration day. Tuition for each subsequent semester is due on or before the appropriate registration day. Students will not be admitted until their financial obligations have been met. The financial ability of applicants to complete their training at the college is important because of the limited number of positions available in each class. Applicants should have specific plans for financing 27 months of professional education. This should include tuition, living expenses, books, equipment, and miscellaneous expenses. Each student is required to carry adequate personal medical and hospital insurance. Students may avail themselves of the hospitalization insurance plan obtainable through the university. Due to the demands of the PA curriculum, the program discourages any outside employment. The program does not allow working for NSU or any of the associated clinical training sites. Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible to graduate from the Physician Assistant Program, students must successfully complete all academic and clinical courses and degree requirements have satisfactorily met all financial and library obligations attend, in person, the commencement program, at which time the degree is conferred Academic Dismissal in the Physician Assistant Program See the suspension/dismissal section of the student handbooks. Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physician Assistant 379Remediation Policy The Nova Southeastern University Physician Assistant Program\u2014Orlando is an intense academic experience. Students will encounter both written and performance- based examinations. In specific courses, (Physical Exam/ diagnosis, Clinical Medicine, and Surgery, etc.) all blocks of instruction must be successfully passed by the student in order to pass the entire course. All students are aware of their performance at the end of every test. If a student fails to demonstrate the required competencies for a specific exam or block of instruction, he or she will be notified and certain actions shall be taken. Students will receive email notification of failed grades from the academic coordinator. The student will meet with his or her academic adviser and/or the course director/ instructor in order to discuss the academic situation and develop a plan of action for improving his or her academic deficiencies. The student will review the plan of action for improvement and grade sheets and sign them. Students will coordinate a retesting date with the course director and that will be within seven calendar days of the test failure or a mutually agreed upon date. The student must be proactive in coordinating additional study/tutoring time before the retest. If the student successfully passes the retest, the student will receive a maximum score of 75 percent. If the student fails to demonstrate mastery of the course objectives by failing the retest, the student's case will be forwarded to the Committee on Student Progress for further review and possible academic and administrative action. Recommendations will be referred to the department chair for final disposition. Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program curriculum is completed following an acceptable bachelor's degree. The comprehensive PA curriculum, completed in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide variety of clinical settings. The first 15 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the next semester or the clinical year. During this time frame, students may be in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., additionally, there may be occasional weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at NSU. Therefore, no requests for advanced placement, transfer of credit, and credit for experiential learning will be considered.The clinical year is devoted to 12 months of clinical training with required six-week clinical rotations in family medicine, internal medicine, emergency medicine, behavioral health, pediatrics, prenatal care/ gynecology, general surgery, as well as a selective rotation in orthopedics, dermatology, geriatrics, cardiology, neurology, or otorhinolaryngology and a four-week elective. The rotations are as follows: Emergency Medicine (six weeks) Family Medicine (six weeks) Internal Medicine (six weeks) Pediatrics (six weeks) Prenatal Care and Gynecology (six weeks) General Surgery (six weeks) Selective (six weeks in one of the following courses) Geriatrics (six weeks) Orthopedics (six weeks) Dermatology (six weeks) Otorhinolaryngology (six weeks) Cardiology (six weeks) Neurology (six weeks) Behavioral Health (six weeks) Elective (four weeks) Graduate Project (each semester) Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written, comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. The six-week selective rotation requires the submission of documents as defined in the Orlando Clinical Handbook and rotation syllabi as related to the rotation. A comprehensive, written, summative examination is administered as a component of the four-week elective and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems as required by the program and the ARC-PA standards. Testing will occur on scheduled end-of-rotation days (EORs). OSCE, PACKRAT, and other testing may occur as scheduled during EORs. Comprehensive, computerized patient logs are to be completed and submitted as directed prior to EORs. Weekly Exam Master tests must be submitted to advisers at the scheduled times. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 32 hours per week, however, many rotation sites require a greater student participation.380 Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physician AssistantUpon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant degree.

Final summer semester (0-0-1)386 Dr. Pallavi Patel College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Physician AssistantPhysician Assistant Program\u2014Jacksonville Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 100,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many PAs practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics (BLS) U.S. Department of Labor, as published in the 2016-2017 Occupational Outlook Handbook, employment of PAs is expected to grow 30 percent from 2014 to 2024. It is the obligation of each physician/PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Program offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will be awarded the Master of Medical Science Degree in Physician Assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, radiology, and others. Students also take courses that include health care law and ethics, epidemiology and biostatistics, research methodology, and cultural issues in health care. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, behavioral medicine, and surgery, all complemented by two elective rotations. NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.

Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program curriculum is completed following a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university in the United States. The comprehensive curriculum, completed in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide variety of clinical settings. The first 15 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., although there are occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA program requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at this campus. No advanced placement, transfer of credit, or credit for experiential learning will be granted. The clinical year is devoted to 12 months of clinical training with required clinical rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care/gynecology, surgery, behavioral health, and internal medicine. Students must also complete two elective rotations, for a total of nine clinical rotations. The required rotations and one of the elective rotations are six weeks in length. The remaining elective rotation is four weeks in length. Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written, comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, however, many rotation sites require students to work substantially more hours per week. Upon completion of the course of study, students will be awarded the Master of Medical Science degree in Physician Assistant. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants.

Core Performance Standards for Admission and Progress The Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is pledged to the admission and matriculation of qualified students. Consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, regulations, and/or local ordinances (e.g., Title VII, Title VI, Title III, Title II, Rehab Act, ADA, Title IX, and the Florida Civil Rights Act), it is the policy of Nova Southeastern University not to engage in discrimination or harassment against any individuals because of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations, and to comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and affirmative action laws, orders, and regulations. Any such acts are unacceptable and strictly prohibited by the university. Regarding those students with verifiable disabilities, the university will not discriminate against such individuals who are otherwise qualified, but will expect applicants and students to meet certain minimal technical standards (core performance standards) as set forth herein, with or without reasonable accommodation. In adopting these standards, the university believes it must keep in mind the ultimate safety of the patients whom its graduates will eventually serve, as well as the efficacy and safety in the learning environment. The standards reflect what the university believes are reasonable expectations required of health professions students and personnel in performing common functions. Any exceptions to such standards must be approved by the dean of a student's particular college, based upon appropriate circumstances. The holders of health care degrees must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to carry out the activities described below, candidates for Health Professions Division degrees must be able to integrate consistently, quickly, and accurately all information received, and they must have the ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Honor and integrity of the health professions student and health care professional is essential and depends on the exemplary behavior of the individual health care provider in his or her relations with patients, faculty members, and colleagues. This includes accountability to oneself and to relationships with fellow students, future colleagues, faculty members, and patients who come under the student's care or contribute to his or her training and growth, as well as members of the general public. This applies to personal conduct that reflects on the student's honesty and integrity in both academic and nonacademic settings, whether or not involving an NSU-sponsored activity. All students must have the capacity to manage their lives and anticipate their own needs. Upon accepting admission to NSU, each student subscribes to, and pledges complete observance to, NSU's Student Code of Conduct Policies. A violation of these standards is an abuse of the trust placed in every student and could lead to suspension or dismissal. Candidates for degrees offered by the Health Professions Division must have, with or without reasonable accommodation, multiple abilities and skills including intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; interpersonal communication; mobility and strength; motor skills; and hearing, visual, tactile, behavioral, and social attributes. Candidates for admission and progression must be able to perform these abilities and skills in a reasonably independent manner. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Qualitative Abilities These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving\u2014a critical skill\u2014requires all of these intellectual abilities. Candidates and students must have critical thinking ability sufficient for good clinical judgment. This is necessary to identify cause/effect relationships in clinical situations and to develop plans of care. In addition, candidates and students should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. An individual is expected to be able to perform multiple tasks in a diverse, dynamic, highly competitive, College of Medical Sciences 413and challenging learning environment.

Graduate Nursing Program Master of Science in Nursing (M.S.N.)\u2014Nonclinical The Master of Science in Nursing Program is an online degree program for graduates of Bachelor of Science programs with a major in nursing or other related fields. Students who hold Registered Nurse (R.N.) licensure who enter the M.S.N. program without a B.S.N. degree, but with a B.S. or B.A. degree in another field, will be required to enroll in NSG 5000B\u2014Transition to Advanced Nursing Practice in their first semester of admission to the M.S.N. program. This course is only offered in the fall term. Three concentrations are offered: nursing informatics, nursing education, and executive nurse leadership. Students can transform the landscape of patient care through Nursing Informatics. In a program that blends leadership skills with data management, students will learn how to catalyze the evolution of nursing through the evaluation and implementation of new technology. They will facilitate access to critical information, improving patient outcomes, while refining the health care experience for providers and recipients alike. The next generation of nursing professionals require quality instructors to flourish in the ever-changing field of health care. With courses focusing on clinical decision making and curriculum development, the Nursing Education concentration will prepare its students to provide future nursing generations with the guidance they need. Students in this concentration will be prepared for career paths in staff development, vocational-technical training, or community college education. Graduates interested in teaching in B.S.N. or higher programs may then proceed through the Ph.D. in Nursing program, which focuses on nursing education. The Executive Nurse Leadership concentration prepares students to assume the leadership roles that they deserve. By studying quality initiatives and the business of health care, students will understand how to make complex decisions that improve patient care and employee morale. They will gain the skills needed to inspire peers and take their organizations to new heights.476 Ron and Kathy Assaf College of Nursing \u2014Master of Science in Nursing\u2014NonclinicalAll M.S.N. students take 15 semester hours of core foundational nursing courses online/hybrid.

Courses in microbiology, computer science, cellular physiology, genetics, embryology, biostatistics, quantitative analysis, physical chemistry, humanities, and social and behavioral sciences, while not required, are useful in providing some essential skills and knowledge required for a medical education. 4. All applicants are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Applications for the MCAT may be obtained online at aamc.org, from your college's preprofessional adviser's office, by calling (319) 337-1357, or by writing directly to Medical College Admission Test Program Office 2255 North Dubuque Road P .O. Box 4056 Iowa City, IA 52243-4056 MCAT scores must be no more than three years old prior to the application cycle. The college expects to receive thousands of applications for admission each year, from which only 50 students will be chosen. These students will have varied backgrounds, and while some may enter the college directly from an undergraduate program, other students will come from successful careers. The Committee on Admissions recommends applicants to the dean on the basis of demonstrated academic excellence, leadership, compassion, and commitment to the medical profession. Technical Requirements 2018-2019 Technical Standards for Medical School Admission, Continuation, and Graduation Introduction Applicants to the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine (NSU MD) are selected for admission on the basis of their academic, personal, and extracurricular attributes. Applicants must also have the intellectual, physical, and emotional capabilities to meet the requirements of NSU MD's curriculum and of a successful medical career. The mission of NSU MD is to provide its graduates with broad, general knowledge in all fields of medicine and the basic skills and competence requisite for the practice of medicine. Therefore, the faculty of NSU MD believes that a broad-based and patient-oriented curriculum is necessary for the development of such knowledge and skills and is best suited to the education of future generalists, specialists, physician investigators, and leaders in medicine. In other words, NSU MD seeks to graduate students who will have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. The following technical standards are based on standards suggested by the Special Advisory Panel on Technical Standards for Medical School Admissions convened by the AAMC (Memorandum #79-4) in January 1979*. These guidelines were formally adopted by the NSU Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine (NSU MD) 503MD Committee on Admissions in 2016, are reviewed annually, and updated periodically. These guidelines specify the attributes considered essential for completing medical school training and for enabling each graduate to enter residency and clinical practice. Moreover, because the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree signifies that the holder is a physician prepared for entry into the practice of medicine within postgraduate training programs, it follows that graduates must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide array of patient care. As such, these standards, along with the academic standards established by the faculty, describe the essential functions that applicants must demonstrate to meet the requirements of a general medical education, and are prerequisites for entrance, continuation, promotion, and graduation. NSU MD will consider for admission and continuation any applicant who meets its academic and nonacademic criteria and who demonstrates the ability to perform skills and meet the standards listed in this document, with or without reasonable accommodations, consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These standards also conform to the AAMC guidelines for medical schools. NSU MD believes that all applicants must possess the intellectual, physical, and emotional capabilities necessary to undertake the required curriculum in a reasonably independent manner without having to rely on the assistance of others or intermediaries, and that all applicants must be able to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty. All applicants for admission, both those with and without disabilities, are expected to be competitive with others in the applicant pool in academic, personal, and extracurricular attributes. The institutional policy is to make admissions decisions on a case-by-case basis and on the basis of each applicant's qualifications to contribute to NSU MD's educational mission. For purposes of this document, and unless otherwise defined, the term \"applicant\" or \"candidate\" means applicants for admission to medical school, as well as enrolled medical students who are candidates for promotion and graduation. *Recommendations of the AAMC Special Advisory Panel on Technical Standards for Medical School Admissions, approved by the AAMC Executive Council on January 18, 1979, are reproduced below. Technical (Nonacademic) Standards for Medical School Admission A candidate for the M.D. degree must have abilities and skills in the five functional areas described following, and must have the physical and emotional stamina and capacity to function in a competent manner, and consistent with these standards, in the classroom, clinical, and laboratory settings, including settings that may involve heavy workloads, long hours, and stressful situations.1. Observation: The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including, but not limited to, anatomic, physiologic, and pharmacologic demonstrations; microbiologic cultures; and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision and hearing and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the sense of smell. 2. Communication: A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. 3. Motor: Candidates must have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers that comprise a complete physical examination (including pelvic examination). A candidate must be able to perform the basic and advanced clinical procedures that are requirements of the NSU MD curriculum. A candidate must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements; equilibrium; and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. 4. Intellectual: Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem-solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires that a candidate be able to learn, retrieve, analyze, sequence, organize, synthesize, and integrate information efficiently and reason effectively. In addition, the candidate should be able to measure and calculate accurately and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his or her intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to work effectively, respectfully, and professionally as part 504 Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine (NSU MD)of the health care team, and to interact with patients, their families, and health care personnel in a courteous, professional, and respectful manner. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are required. Technological compensation can be made in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the candidate, or a person used such that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation, is not permitted. In addition to the abilities and skills set forth above, candidates must possess the general physical health necessary for performing the duties of a medical student and physician in training without endangering the lives of patients and/or colleagues with whom the student might have contact. Candidates whose performance is impaired by abuse of alcohol or other substances are not suitable candidates for admission, continuation, promotion, or graduation. Process for Assessing the Applicant's Compliance with the Technical Standards Applicants are required to attest at the time they accept an offer to matriculate that they meet NSU MD's Technical Standards, and thereafter, must attest on an annual basis that they continue to meet the standards. These standards are not intended to deter any student who might be able to complete the requirements of the curriculum with reasonable accommodations. Requests from applicants for reasonable accommodations in meeting the technical standards will be reviewed and considered by the NSU Office of Student Disability Services. Students requesting accommodations must complete NSU's Academic Accommodations form (nova.edu/disabilityservices/forms /accademic_accomodations.pdf). For additional information about the college's process for assessing an applicant's compliance with the technical standards, contact Susan Gonzalez at susagonz@nova.edu or (954) 262-1639. Application Procedures The college participates in the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for the receipt and processing of all applications. AMCAS takes no part in the selection of students. Applicants should submit applications electronically through AMCAS online, using an interactive, web-based application. More information can be found at https:// students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/applying -medical-school-process/applying-medical-school-amcas/. For questions, applicants may call (954) 262-0515. The following steps are necessary to the primary application process. 1. The applicant must submit the following materials to AMCAS by January 15: completed AMCAS application official transcripts from the registrars of all colleges or universities attended, mailed directly to AMCAS by the college or university MCAT scores (must be no more than three years old prior to the application cycle) 2. The applicant must submit the following to the college by March 1: a secondary application, which will be sent to the applicant by the college upon receipt of the AMCAS application a nonrefundable application fee of $50 three letters of recommendation via the AMCAS Letters Service (if not included in the initial application) A personal interview is a part of the admission process; however, being interviewed is not a guarantee of admission. Not all applicants will be granted an interview. Those selected for an interview will be notified of the date and time of such interview by the college's Office of Admissions and Student Affairs. Notice of acceptance will be on a rolling or periodic schedule; therefore, early completion of the application is in the best interest of the applicant, because of the limited number of spaces available in each class. After acceptance, final and official documents and requirements must be received by the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs before the first day of orientation to the program. The college will provide accepted students with a detailed schedule of due dates for all documents and requirements. If these final and official documents are not received, or other requirements are not met by that time, or the student is not present at the start of orientation, the student will forfeit his or her place in the class and an applicant from the wait list will be offered the position in the class. Financial aid will not be disbursed to anyone until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admissions requirements have been approved by the program office). Tuition and Fees 1.

Academics Transfer of Credit Given the intensive curriculum at NSU MD, which is founded upon problem-based learning and devoted to integrated, self-directed learning and discovery to develop multiple competencies, this is not likely to be possible. Therefore, the college will not accept transferring students. Course of Study NSU MD has a dedicated faculty; strong affiliations with medical centers, hospitals, and health care systems; and a mission to educate the finest physician-leaders possible. Physicians do not work in a vacuum, but rather in a health care team, and NSU MD promotes interdisciplinary cooperation through the curriculum. Students also share teaching faculty members for some disciplines, as well as campus facilities, with NSU's osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, dental, optometry, physician assistant, physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health, nursing, and medical science students. This proximity to colleagues from other professions promotes collegiality.506 Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine (NSU MD)Curriculum Outline The college's curriculum proceeds sequentially in blocks dedicated to preclerkship disciplines and organ systems and courses covering clinical skills until spring of year 2, when required clinical clerkships begin, to be followed by electives. A schematic of the curriculum for the first year is shown below.

Patel College of Allopathic Medicine (NSU MD) 507MDF 6000\u2014Professional Immersion This course provides activities to introduce students to the curriculum, the learning approaches, and the learning environment of the NSU MD college. MDF 6001\u2014Fundamentals The fundamentals block is designed to provide students with a broad foundation in critical biomedical science subject areas, including biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, genetics/genomics, microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, physiology, anatomy, embryology, and histology. The course begins with four weeks focusing on human structure (anatomy, histology, embryology, and anatomy laboratory instruction) followed by eight weeks addressing the other subject areas. Content in each week is linked to a theme, which is reflected in the weekly problem-based learning case and other sessions. MDF 6002\u2014Hematology The hematology block provides students with basic concepts and vocabulary related to normal histology, physiology, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, and therapeutics of the hematologic system. This includes hematopoiesis, anemias, and other disorders of red blood cells; disorders of white blood cells, such as leukemia and lymphoma; and blood coagulation. Content in each week is linked to a theme, which is reflected in the weekly problem-based learning case and other sessions. MDF 6003\u2014Gastrointestinal/Human Nutrition /Endocrine/Reproductive The gastrointestinal/human nutrition/endocrine/ reproductive block provides basic concepts in normal anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, and therapeutics of the gastrointestinal and hepatic systems, human nutrition, the endocrine system, and the male and female reproductive systems. This includes normal nutrition, diagnosis and managements of common nutritional disorders, the structure and mechanisms of action of the classical hormones, principles of control and regulation of hormone synthesis and release, and approach to diagnosis and treatment of common endocrine disorders. The reproductive section covers basic concepts and vocabulary of male and female biology as it relates to pathology, gynecological diseases, and infertility. The block includes laboratory instruction, as well as real and simulated clinical experience (anatomy, histology, simulation center activities/cases, and a visit to a dialysis center). Problem-based learning (PBL) cases provide the fundamental knowledge of common gastrointestinal and hepatic disorders (including nutritional implications, where appropriate) and are complemented by lectures for specific diseases. The simulation component emphasizes correlations with clinical cases and localization of digestive system lesions. Students learn male and female genito- urinary exams with standardized patients during the concurrent clinical course. Content in each week is linked to a theme, which is reflected in the weekly PBL case and other sessions. MDF 6004\u2014Cardiovascular/Pulmonary/Renal The cardiovascular/pulmonary/renal block provides basic concepts in normal anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, and therapeutics of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems. Content includes structures, processes, and diseases of the coronary and peripheral vasculature, cardiac muscle, conduction system, cardiac valves, and pericardium; mechanism and significance of abnormal findings on cardiovascular and pulmonary exams; roles of the renal and cardiovascular systems in regulation of blood pressure; role of the kidneys in regulation of fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance; approach to a broad spectrum of pulmonary disease categories and diagnosis and treatment of respiratory failure; interpretation of laboratory findings to identify and manage common acid-base disturbances; and renal glomerular, vascular, and interstitial diseases. The block includes laboratory instruction (anatomy, histology, and simulation center activities that emphasize correlations with clinical cases). Content in each week is linked to a theme, which is reflected in the weekly problem-based learning case and other sessions. MDC 6050\u2014Practice of Medicine I The goal of the practice of medicine courses is to provide students with foundational clinical skills and professional behaviors to be successful in the clinical clerkships. The courses are designed as a developmental sequence. Practice of Medicine I is a 16-week course, with one half-day session each week. It begins with an introduction to the essentials of doctor-patient relationship, followed by a series of sessions in which students will learn each aspect of the basic history and physical exam using a hypothesis- driven approach, requiring them to learn not only the how, but also the why, for each new skill. The final month focuses on integrating the components into a logical whole and writing the clinical note. At the end of this course, students will pass an objective-structured clinical examination covering the basic history and physical and writing a clinical note.Course Descriptions508 Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine (NSU MD)MDC 6051\u2014Practice of Medicine II The goal of the practice of medicine courses is to provide students with foundational clinical skills and professional behaviors to be successful in the clinical clerkships. The courses are designed as a developmental sequence. Practice of Medicine II is a 22-week course with two half-day sessions per week. It builds on the basic clinical skills from Practice of Medicine I (establishing a doctor-patient relationship, hypothesis-driven history taking, physical examination, and writing clinical notes) by adding 1) a weekly half-day experience with patients in the office of a primary care preceptor; 2) sessions on advanced/specialized physical examinations; 3) small-group case discussions focused on threads such as ethics, leadership, research, and biomedical informatics; and 4) a required service-learning project in interprofessional teams. At the end of this course, students will pass an objective-structured clinical examination covering both a focused and complete history and a physical examination, as well as writing a clinical note and giving an oral case presentation.
