Acquired and created with help from The Trust for Public Land in 2015, this 38-acre, state-owned SNA encompasses significant biodiversity, thriving communities of native plants, and habitat for several rare species of birds and plants. The SNA's dramatic geologic features include a scenic waterfall, steep rocky cliffs, a winding cold-water stream, thick old forests, and panoramic views of the National Wild and Scenic St. Croix River. In 2018, The Trust for Public Land protected an additional 20 acres that will expand the SNA, protect the original investment, and provide better public access. Funding for this project was provided by the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund as recommended by the Legislative Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources, and the Reinvest in Minnesota Program (RIM), which uses funds from conservation license plate sales to match donations of land value to the state of Minnesota.
