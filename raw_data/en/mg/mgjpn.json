Additionally, all COVID-19-related emergency operations and safety measures at the Medical Center, with the exception of patient care-required clinical isolation precautions, will expire on that day. These actions follow the announcements by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that the national [Public Health Emergency for COVID-19](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-public-health-emergency/index.html) will expire on May 11 and by the White House that COVID-19 vaccination requirements for federal employees, contractors and international travelers will expire on the same date. The existing UMMC COVID-19 vaccination policy will expire on May 11, which also means any accommodations put in place under this policy will be terminated. If you currently wear an N95 mask as part of a vaccination accommodation, for instance, you will no longer be required to wear the mask beginning May 11. Also ending May 11 are the Student and Employee Health COVID-19 Hotline and the COVID-19-related processes for symptom reporting, positive test notification and return-to-work approval. For the safety of our patients, visitors, employees and students, it is recommended that you receive all vaccinations for which you are eligible. If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, please stay at home and get tested. If you test positive, follow the CDC recommended five days of isolation followed by five days of masking. Thank you. "}
