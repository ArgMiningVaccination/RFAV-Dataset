The Best Crystals for Meditation Different crystals have unique properties and can help us in different ways. With this in mind, choosing the right crystals for your meditation practice will ultimately depend on what you are trying to achieve. Take a moment to think about your current goals. Are you meditating to relieve stress and anxiety? Manifest success? Or perhaps to gain a new perspective on a difficult situation?

For example: - Selenite: for clearing negative energy and blockages - Rose quartz: for building compassion and self-worth - Amethyst: for relieving stress and anxiety - Citrine: to attract abundance and success - Clear quartz: to clear your mind and improve your focus - Lapis lazuli: for connecting with your intuition How to Meditate With Crystals So now that you know the best crystals for meditation, how should you incorporate them into your meditation practice? There's really no one \"right\" way to meditate. Some people prefer to lie down in a quiet place, while others may feel more at peace sitting out in nature. Some prefer complete silence, while others will benefit from listening to a guided meditation. You may want to try a few different methods before finding the one that works best for you. Once you've found a comfortable place to meditate, you can incorporate your crystals. Some of the easiest ways to meditate with crystals include: - Hold them in your hands. This will give you direct contact with the crystals, and invites you to share in their energy. - Place them on your chakras. Our chakras refer to the seven energy centers of our body. Certain crystals will correlate with a particular chakra, so placing them on your chakras will help to remove stagnant energy and help bring you back into alignment. - Create a crystal grid. You can create a protective force by placing your crystals in a circle around you before you start meditating. This forcefield will also surround you with high vibrations during your meditation practice, helping you manifest your desires. Don't forget to cleanse and recharge your crystals regularly to get the most benefits out of them!
