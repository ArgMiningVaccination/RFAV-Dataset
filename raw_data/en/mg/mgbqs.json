Non Toxic Paints & Coatings It is almost miraculous how a fresh coat of paint can renew and re-energize whatever it covers. From a simple fence or deck to an entire home's interior or exterior, a paint job or a new coat of stain or sealer provides a quick and affordable update. At the same time, it preserves and protects what it covers. But paint is a large and challenging category of products for most people. Beyond its impact on the looks of a room, paint affects the indoor air quality of a home or office. Finding the right non-toxic paint or food-safe paint that won't create hazardous air pollution can require lots of research. It can also be a challenging subject if you or your contractor are not familiar with applying these types of non-toxic products. To help you sort through the important details, we've done our own rigorous research and testing on all of these products at our own residence for the past 30 years. We've also learned from customer experiences which products work and which ones are the safest. Product reviews at the bottom of each product page let you see what others have experienced. We know everyone is different and every project is unique. Non-toxic paint for wood may be different from food-safe paint or rubber paint for wood. So we've gone to great lengths to provide as much technical information as possible, including downloadable Safety Data Sheets, application instructions, certifications, ingredients lists, and specifications. Although these documents can be very useful, in our opinion they are just starting points. Most of these test results or certifications take place in a laboratory. They never tell us the whole story, nor are they always relevant to our specific projects or special needs. We've also provided an extensive Q&A on each product page where you can read how-to advice for problem-solving and suggestions, tips, and techniques for complex projects. Reviews and Q&A are great too, but they only take you so far. That's why we suggest you take the next step and order small samples to test for adhesion, aesthetics, and your own personal tolerances to odor. By doing so, you will learn what works for your project and your needs without wasting lots of time and money. Sample First goes right along with Safety First. Our mission is to help people create beautiful, healthier homes by delivering high- performance, eco-friendly products we have personally tested. If you have further questions before, during, or after installation, our well-trained staff of eco-advisors are ready to help. Please call us weekdays at 800-405-0222 from "}
