Subpart A\u2014General Labeling Provisions \u00a7 201.1 Drugs; name and place of busi- ness of manufacturer, packer, or distributor. (a) A drug or drug product (as defined in \u00a7320.1 of this chapter) in finished package form is misbranded under sec-tion 502 (a) and (b)(1) of the act if its label does not bear conspicuously the name and place of business of the man-ufacturer, packer, or distributor. This paragraph does not apply to any drug VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun product dispensed in accord- ance with section 503(b)(1) of the act. (b) As used in this section, and for purposes of section 502 (a) and (b)(1) of the act, the manufacturer of a drug product is the person who performs all of the following operations that are re-quired to produce the product: (1) Mix-ing, (2) granulating, (3) milling, (4) molding, (5) lyophilizing, (6) tableting, (7) encapsulating, (8) coating, (9) steri-lizing, and (10) filling sterile, aerosol, or gaseous drugs into dispensing con-tainers. (c) If no person performs all of the applicable operations listed in para-graph (b) of this section, no person may be represented as manufacturer except as follows: (1) If the person performs more than one half of the applicable operations listed in paragraph (b) of this section and acknowledges the contribution of other persons who have performed the remaining applicable operations by stating on the product label that ''Cer-tain manufacturing operations have been performed by other firms.''; or (2) If the person performs at least one applicable operation listed in para-graph (b) of this section and identifies by appropriate designation all other persons who have performed the re-maining applicable operations, e.g., ''Made by (Person A), Filled by (Person B), Sterilized by (Person C)''; or (3) If the person performs at least one applicable operation listed in para-graph (b) of this section and the person is listed along with all other persons who have performed the remaining ap-plicable operations as ''joint manufac-turers.'' A list of joint manufacturers shall be qualified by the phrase ''Jointly Manufactured By llllll ,'' and the names of all of the manufacturers shall be printed to-gether in the same type size and style; or (4) If the person performs all applica- ble operations listed in paragraph (b) of this section except for those operations listed in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, person, when it identifies a corporation, in-cludes a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and con-trol. (d) The Food and Drug Administra- tion finds that it is the common prac-tice in the drug industry to contract out the performance of certain manu-facturing operations listed in para-graph (b) of this section. These oper-ations include: (1) Soft-gelatin encap-sulating, (2) aerosol filling, (3) steri-lizing by irradiation, (4) lyophilizing, and (5) ethylene oxide sterilization. (e) A person performs an operation listed in paragraph (b) of this section only if the operation is performed, in-cluding the performance of the appro-priate in-process quality control oper-ations, except laboratory testing of samples taken during processing, as follows: (1) By individuals, a majority of whom are employees of the person and, throughout the performance of the op-eration, are subject to the person's di-rection and control; (2) On premises that are continuously owned or leased by the person and sub-ject to the person's direction and con-trol; and (3) On equipment that is continu- ously owned or leased by the person. As used in this paragraph, person, when it identifies a corporation, includes a par-ent, subsidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and control. (f) The name of the person rep- resented as manufacturer under para-graph (b) or (c) of this section must be the same as either (1) the name of the establishment (as defined in \u00a7207.3(b) of this chapter) under which that person is registered at the time the labeled product is produced or (2) the reg-istered establishment name of a par-ent, subsidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and control. In ad-dition, the name shall meet the re-quirements of paragraph (g) of this sec-tion. (g) The requirement for declaration of the name of the manufacturer, pack-er, or distributor shall be deemed to be satisfied, in the case of a corporate per-son, only by the actual corporate name, except that the corporate name may be the name of a parent, sub-sidiary, or affiliate company where the related companies are under common ownership and control. The corporate VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.5 name may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. ''Company,'' ''Incor-porated,'' etc., may be abbreviated or omitted and ''The'' may be omitted. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used. (h)(1) Except as provided in this sec- tion, no person other than the manu-facturer, packer, or distributor may be identified on the label of a drug or drug product. (2) The appearance on a drug product label of a person's name without quali-fication is a representation that the named person is the sole manufacturer of the product. That representation is false and misleading, and the drug product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the act, if the person is not the manufacturer of the product in ac-cordance with this section. (3) If the names of two or more per- sons appear on the label of a drug or drug product, the label may identify which of the persons is to be contacted for further information about the prod-uct. (4) If a trademark appears on the drug or drug product label or appears as a mark directly on the drug product (e.g., tablet or capsule), the label may identify the holder or licensee of the trademark. The label may also state whether the person identified holds the trademark or is licensee of the trade-mark. (5) If the distributor is named on the label, the name shall be qualified by one of the following phrases: ''Manu-factured for llllll '', ''Distributed '', ''Marketed by llllll ''. The qualifying phrases may be abbreviated. (6) If the packer is identified on the label, the name shall be qualified by the phrase ''Packed by llllll '' or ''Packaged by llllll ''. The quali- fying phrases may be abbreviated. (i) The statement of the place of busi- ness shall include the street address, city, State, and ZIP Code. For a foreign manufacturer, the statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, country, and any applicable mailing code. The street ad- dress may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. The requirement for inclu-sion of the ZIP Code shall apply to con-sumer commodity labels developed or revised after July 1, 1969. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the ZIP Code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including the invoice). (j) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a drug or drug product at a place other than the person's prin-cipal place of business, the label may state the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such drug or drug product was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading. (k) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, do not apply to the la-beling of drug components. (l) A drug product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the act if its la-beling identifies a person as manufac-turer, packer, or distributor, and that identification does not meet the re-quirements of this section. (m) This section does not apply to bi- ological drug products that are subject to the requirements of section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 262. [45 FR 25775, Apr. 15, 1980; 45 FR Oct. 31, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 37620, Aug. 19, 1983] \u00a7 201.2 Drugs and devices; National Drug Code numbers. The National Drug Code (NDC) num- ber is requested but not required to ap-pear on all drug labels and in all drug labeling, including the label of any pre-scription drug container furnished to a consumer. If the NDC number is shown on a drug label, it shall be displayed as required in \u00a7207.35(b)(3) of this chapter. [40 FR 52002, Nov. 7, 1975] \u00a7 201.5 Drugs; adequate directions for use. Adequate directions for use means di- rections under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (Section VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun be inadequate be-cause, among other reasons, of omis-sion, in whole or in part, or incorrect specification of: (a) Statements of all conditions, pur- poses, or uses for which such drug is in-tended, including conditions, purposes, or uses for which it is prescribed, rec-ommended, or suggested in its oral, written, printed, or graphic adver-tising, and conditions, purposes, or uses for which the drug is commonly used; except that such statements shall not refer to conditions, uses, or pur-poses for which the drug can be safely used only under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law and for which it is advertised solely to such practitioner. (b) Quantity of dose, including usual quantities for each of the uses for which it is intended and usual quan-tities for persons of different ages and different physical conditions. (c) Frequency of administration or application. (d) Duration of administration or ap- plication. (e) Time of administration or appli- cation (in relation to time of meals, time of onset of symptoms, or other time factors). (f) Route or method of administra- tion or application. (g) Preparation for use, i.e., shaking, dilution, adjustment of temperature, or, other manipulation or process. [41 FR 6908, Feb. 13, 1976] \u00a7 201.6 Drugs; misleading statements. (a) Among representations in the la- beling of a drug which render such drug misbranded is a false or misleading representation with respect to another drug or a device or a food or cosmetic. (b) The labeling of a drug which con- tains two or more ingredients may be misleading by reason, among other rea-sons, of the designation of such drug in such labeling by a name which includes or suggests the name of one or more but not all such ingredients, even though the names of all such ingredi-ents are stated elsewhere in the (a) The ingredient information re- quired by section 502(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shall ap-pear together, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, ex-cept the proprietary names of ingredi-ents, which may be included with the listing of established names, and such statements that are specifically re-quired for certain ingredients by the act or regulations in this chapter. (b) The term ingredient applies to any substance in the drug, whether added to the formulation as a single sub-stance or in admixture with other sub-stances. (c) The labeling of a drug may be misleading by reason (among other rea-sons) of: (1) The order in which the names of the ingredients present in the drug ap-pear in the labeling, or the relative prominence otherwise given such names. (2) Failure to reveal the proportion of, or other fact with respect to, an in-gredient present in such drug, when such proportion or other fact is mate-rial in the light of the representation that such ingredient is present in such drug. (3) The employment of a fanciful pro- prietary name for a drug or ingredient in such a manner as to imply that the drug or ingredient has some unique ef-fectiveness or composition when, in fact, the drug or ingredient is a com-mon substance, the limitations of which are readily recognized when the drug or ingredient is listed by its es-tablished name. (4) The featuring in the labeling of inert or inactive ingredients in a man-ner that creates an impression of value greater than their true functional role in the formulation. (5) Designation of a drug or ingre- dient by a proprietary name that, be-cause of similarity in spelling or pro-nunciation, may be confused with the proprietary name or the established name of a different drug or ingredient. (d)(1) If the drug is in tablet or cap- sule form or other unit dosage form, any statement of the quantity of an in-gredient contained therein shall ex-press the quantity of such ingredient in VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.10 each such unit. If the drug is not in unit dosage form, any statement of the quantity of an ingredient contained therein shall express the amount of such ingredient in a specified unit of weight or measure of the drug, or the percentage of such ingredient in such drug. Such statements shall be in terms that are informative to licensed practitioners, in the case of a prescrip-tion drug, and to the layman, in the case of a nonprescription drug. (2) A statement of the percentage of an ingredient in a drug shall, if the term percent is used without qualifica- tion, mean percent weight-in-weight, if the ingredient and the drug are both solids, or if the ingredient is a liquid and the drug is a solid; percent weight in volume at 68 \u00b0F. (20 \u00b0C.), if the ingre- dient is a solid and the drug is a liquid; and percent volume in volume at 68 \u00b0F. (20 \u00b0C.), if both the ingredient and the drug are liquids, except that alcohol shall be stated in terms of percent vol-ume of absolute alcohol at 60 \u00b0F. (15.56 \u00b0C.). (e) A derivative or preparation of a substance named in section 502(e) of the act is an article derived or prepared from such substance by any method, including actual or theoretical chem-ical action. (f) If an ingredient is a derivative or preparation of a substance specifically named in section 502(e) of the act and the established name of such ingre-dient does not indicate that it is a de-rivative or preparation of the parent substance named in section 502(e) of the act, the labeling shall, in conjunc-tion with the listing of the established name of such ingredient, declare that such article is a derivative or prepara-tion of such parent substance. (g)(1) If the label or labeling of a pre- scription drug bears a proprietary name or designation for the drug or any ingredient thereof, the established name, if such there be, corresponding to such proprietary name or designa-tion shall accompany such proprietary name or designation each time it is featured on the label or in the labeling for the drug; but, except as provided in this subparagraph, the established name need not be used with the propri-etary name or designation in the run-ning text of the label or labeling. On any label or page of labeling in which the proprietary name or designation is not featured but is used in the running text, the established name shall be used at least once in the running text in association with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in such running text: Provided, however, That if the propri- etary name or designation is used in the running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presen-tation of the proprietary name or des-ignation in such running text. If any labeling includes a column with run-ning text containing detailed informa-tion as to composition, prescribing, side effects, or contraindications and the proprietary name or designation is used in such column but is not featured above or below the column, the estab-lished name shall be used at least once in such column of running text in asso-ciation with such proprietary name or designation and in the same type size used in such column of running text: Provided, however, That if the propri- etary name or designation is used in such column of running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent pres-entation of the proprietary name or designation in such column of running text. Where the established name is re-quired to accompany or to be used in association with the proprietary name or designation, the established name shall be placed in direct conjunction with the proprietary name or designa-tion, and the relationship between the proprietary name or designation and the established name shall be made clear by use of a phrase such as ''brand of'' preceding the established name, by brackets surrounding the established name, or by other suitable means. (2) The established name shall be printed in letters that are at least half as large as the letters comprising the proprietary name or designation with which it is joined, and the established name shall have a prominence com-mensurate with the prominence with VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 which such proprietary name or des- ignation appears, taking into account all pertinent factors, including typog-raphy, layout, contrast, and other printing features. (h)(1) In the case of a prescription drug containing two or more active in-gredients, if the label bears a propri-etary name or designation for such mixture and there is no established name corresponding to such propri-etary name or designation, the quan-titative ingredient information re-quired on the label by section 502(e) of the act shall be placed in direct con-junction with the most prominent dis-play of the proprietary name or des-ignation. The prominence of the quan-titative ingredient information shall bear a reasonable relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name. (2) If the drug is packaged in a con- tainer too small to bear the quan-titative ingredient information on the main display panel, the quantitative ingredient information required by sec-tion 502(e) of the act may appear else-where on the label, even though the proprietary name or designation ap-pears on the main display panel of the label; but side- or back-panel place-ment shall in this case be so arranged and printed as to provide size and prominence of display reasonably re-lated to the size and prominence of the front-panel display. (i) A drug packaged in a container too small or otherwise unable to ac-commodate a label with sufficient space to bear the information required for compliance with section 502(e)(1) (A)(ii) and (B) of the act shall be ex-empt from compliance with those clauses: Provided, That: (1) The label bears: (i) The proprietary name of the drug; (ii) The established name, if such there be, of the drug; (iii) An identifying lot or control number; and (iv) The name of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug; and (2) All the information required to appear on the label by the act and the regulations in this chapter appears on the carton or other outer container or wrapper if such carton, outer con-tainer, or wrapper has sufficient space to bear such information, or such com-plete label information appears on a leaflet with the package. [40 FR 13998, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended 4906, Feb. 1, 2002] \u00a7 201.15 Drugs; prominence of required label statements. (a) A word, statement, or other infor- mation required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label may lack that prominence and conspicuous-ness required by section 502(c) of the act by reason, among other reasons, of: (1) The failure of such word, state- ment, or information to appear on the part or panel of the label which is pre-sented or displayed under customary conditions of purchase; (2) The failure of such word, state- ment, or information to appear on two or more parts or panels of the label, each of which has sufficient space therefor, and each of which is so de-signed as to render it likely to be, under customary conditions of pur-chase, the part or panel displayed; (3) The failure of the label to extend over the area of the container or pack-age available for such extension, so as to provide sufficient label space for the prominent placing of such word, state-ment, or information; (4) Insufficiency of label space for the prominent placing of such word, state-ment, or information, resulting from the use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label; (5) Insufficiency of label space for the prominent placing of such word, state-ment, or information, resulting from the use of label space to give materi-ally greater conspicuousness to any other word, statement, or information, or to any design or device; or (6) Smallness or style of type in which such word, statement, or infor-mation appears, insufficient back-ground contrast, obscuring designs or vignettes, or crowding with other writ-ten, printed, or graphic matter. (b) No exemption depending on insuf- ficiency of label space, as prescribed in regulations promulgated under section 502 (b) or (e) of the act, shall apply if such insufficiency is caused by: (1) The use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.19 which is not required by or under au- thority of the act to appear on the label; (2) The use of label space to give greater conspicuousness to any word, statement, or other information than is required by section 502(c) of the act; or (3) The use of label space for any rep- resentation in a foreign language. (c)(1) All words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language: Provided, how- ever, That in the case of articles dis- tributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or in a Territory where the predominant language is one other than English, the predominant lan-guage may be substituted for English. (2) If the label contains any represen- tation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information re-quired by or under authority of the act to appear on the label shall appear thereon in the foreign language. (3) If the labeling contains any rep- resentation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other informa-tion required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or label-ing shall appear on the labeling in the foreign language. FR 6908, Feb. 13, certain required state-ments. An increasing number of medications restricted to prescription use only are being labeled solely in Spanish for dis-tribution in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico where Spanish is the pre-dominant language. Such labeling is authorized under \u00a7201.15(c). One re-quired warning, the wording of which is fixed by law in the English language, could be translated in various ways, from literal translation to loose inter-pretation. The statutory nature of this warning requires that the translation convey the meaning properly to avoid confusion and dilution of the purpose of the warning. Section 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires, at a minimum, that the label bear the statement ''Rx only.'' The Spanish-language version of this location of expiration date. When an expiration date of a drug is required, e.g., expiration dating of drug products required by \u00a7211.137 of this chapter, it shall appear on the imme-diate container and also the outer package, if any, unless it is easily leg-ible through such outer package. How-ever, when single-dose containers are packed in individual cartons, the expi-ration date may properly appear on the individual carton instead of the imme-diate product container. [43 FR 45076, Sept. 29, 1978] Drugs; significance of control numbers. The lot number on the label of a drug should be capable of yielding the com-plete manufacturing history of the package. An incorrect lot number may be regarded as causing the article to be misbranded. \u00a7 201.19 Drugs; use of term ''infant''. The regulations special die- tary foods (\u00a7105.3(e) of this chapter) de-fine an infant as a child not more than 12 months old. Apart from this, the Food and Drug Administration has not established any definition of the term infant. Some question has arisen whether, for the purposes of drug label-ing, an infant means a child up to 1 year of age or a child up to 2 years of age. Until the term is more precisely defined by legislation or formal regula-tion, where the exact meaning of the term is significant, manufacturers should qualify any reference to ''in-fant'' to indicate whether it refers to a child who is not more than 1 year of age, or a child not more than 2 years of age.

(a) The label for over-the-counter and prescription drug products intended for human use administered orally, na-sally, rectally, or vaginally, or for use in the area of the eye, containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 as a color additive using the names FD&C Yellow No. 5 and tartrazine. The labeling for over- the-counter and prescription drug prod-ucts shall bear a statement such as ''Contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) as a color additive'' or ''Contains color additives including FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine)''. The labels of certain drug products subject to this labeling requirement that are also cosmetics, such as antibacterial mouthwashes and fluoride toothpastes, need not comply with this requirement provided they comply with the require-ments of \u00a7701.3 of this chapter. (b) For prescription drugs for human use containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 that are administered orally, nasally, vaginally, or rectally, or for use in the area of the eye, the labeling required by \u00a7201.100(d) shall bear the warning statement ''This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (in-cluding bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the over-all incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.'' This warning state-ment shall appear in the ''Precautions'' section of the labeling. (c) The label for over-the-counter drug products intended for human use administered orally, nasally, rectally, or vaginally containing FD&C Yellow No. 6 shall specifically declare the presence of FD&C Yellow No. 6 by list-ing the color additive using the name FD&C Yellow No. 6. The labeling for over-the-counter and prescription drug products containing FD&C Yellow No. 6 shall declare the presence of FD&C Yellow No. 6. The labels of certain drug products subject to this labeling re-quirement that are also cosmetics, such as antibacterial mouthwashes and fluoride toothpastes, need not comply with this requirement provided they comply with the requirements of \u00a7701.3 of this chapter.

(a) Aspartame is the methylester of a dipeptide composed of two amino acids, phenylalanine and aspartic acid. When these two amino acids are so combined to form aspartame (1-methyl N-L-a- aspartyl-L-phenylalanine), they produce an intensely sweet-tasting sub-stance, approximately 180 times as sweet as sucrose. The Food and Drug Administration has determined that aspartame when used at a level no higher than reasonably required to per-form its intended technical function is safe for use as an inactive ingredient in human drug products, provided persons with phenylketonuria, who must re- strict carefully their phenylalanine in-take, are alerted to the presence of phenylalanine in the drug product and the amount of the ingredient in each dosage unit. (b) The label and labeling of all over- the-counter human drug products con-taining aspartame as an inactive ingre-dient shall bear Phenylalanine ( l)mg Per (Dos- age Unit). (c) The package labeling and other labeling providing professional use in-formation concerning prescription drugs for human use containing aspar-tame as an inactive ingredient shall bear a statement to the following ef-fect under the ''Precautions'' section of the labeling, as required in \u00a7201.57(f)(2): Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine ( l)mg Per (Dosage Unit). (d) Holders of approved new drug ap- plications who reformulate their drug products under the provisions of this section shall submit supplements under \u00a7314.70 of this chapter to provide for VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.23 the new composition and the labeling changes. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0910-0242) [52 FR 201.22 Prescription drugs containing sulfites; required warning state-ments. (a) Sulfites are chemical substances that are added to certain drug products to inhibit the oxidation of the active drug ingredient. Oxidation of the ac-tive drug ingredient may result in in-stability and a loss of potency of the drug product. Examples of specific sul-fites used to inhibit this oxidation process include sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, po-tassium bisulfite, and potassium metabisulfite. Recent studies have demonstrated that sulfites may cause allergic-type reactions in certain sus-ceptible persons, especially asthmatics. The labeling for any prescription drug product to which sulfites have been added as an inactive ingredient, regard-less of the amount added, must bear the warning specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. (b) The labeling required by \u00a7\u00a7201.57 and 201.100(d) for prescription drugs for human use containing a sulfite, except epinephrine for injection when in- tended for use in allergic or other emergency situations, shall bear the warning statement ''Contains ( insert the name of the sulfite, e.g., sodium metabisulfite ), a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life- threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensi-tivity in the general population is un-known and probably low. Sulfite sensi-tivity is seen more frequently in asth-matic than in nonasthmatic people.'' This statement shall appear in the ''Warnings'' section of the labeling. (c) The labeling required by \u00a7\u00a7201.57 and 201.100(d) for sulfite-containing epi-nephrine for injection for use in aller-gic emergency situations shall bear the warning statement ''Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or other emergency situations even though this product contains ( insert the name of the sulfite, e.g., sodium metabisulfite ), a sulfite that may in products cause allergic-type re-actions including anaphylactic symp-toms or life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain suscep-tible persons. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situa-tion may not be satisfactory. The pres-ence of a sulfite(s) in this product should not deter administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations.'' This statement shall appear in the ''Warn-ings'' section of the labeling. [51 FR 43904, Dec. 5, 1986] \u00a7 201.23 Required pediatric studies. (a) A manufacturer of a marketed drug product, including a biological drug product, that is used in a substan-tial number of pediatric patients, or that provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pe-diatric patients, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7314.55(c)(5) and 601.27(c)(5) of this chapter, but whose label does not pro-vide adequate information to support its safe and effective use in pediatric populations for the approved indica-tions may be required to submit an ap-plication containing data adequate to assess whether the drug product is safe and effective in pediatric populations. The application may be required to contain adequate evidence to support dosage and administration in some or all pediatric subpopulations, including neonates, infants, children, and adoles-cents, depending upon the known or ap-propriate use of the drug product in such subpopulations. The applicant may also be required to develop a pedi-atric formulation for a drug product that represents a meaningful thera-peutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric populations for whom a pediatric formulation is necessary, un-less the manufacturer demonstrates that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation have failed. (b) The Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) may by order, in the form of a letter, after notifying the manu-facturer of its intent to require an as-sessment of pediatric safety and effec-tiveness of a pediatric formulation, and after offering an opportunity for a written response and a meeting, which VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Edition) \u00a7 201.24 may include an advisory committee meeting, require a manufacturer to submit an application containing the information or request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in paragraph (a) of this section within a time specified in the order, if FDA finds that: (1) The drug product is used in a sub- stantial number of pediatric patients for the labeled indications and the ab-sence of adequate labeling could pose significant risks to pediatric patients; or (2) There is reason to believe that the drug product would represent a mean-ingful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients for one or more of the claimed indications, and the absence of adequate labeling could pose significant risks to pedi-atric patients. (c)(1) An applicant may request a full waiver of the requirements of para-graph (a) of this section if the appli-cant certifies that: (i) Necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical because, e.g., the number of such patients is so small or geographically dispersed, or (ii) There is evidence strongly sug- gesting that the product would be inef-fective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups. (2) An applicant may request a par- tial waiver of the requirements of para-graph (a) of this section with respect to a specified pediatric age group, if the applicant certifies that: (i) The product: (A) Does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing thera-pies for pediatric patients in that age group, and (B) Is not likely to be used in a sub- stantial number of patients in that age group, and (C) The absence of adequate labeling could not pose significant risks to pedi-atric patients; or (ii) Necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical because, e.g., the number of patients in that age group is so small or geographically dispersed, or (iii) There is evidence strongly sug- gesting that the product would be inef-fective or unsafe in that age group, or (iv) The applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed. (3) FDA shall grant a full or partial waiver, as appropriate, if the agency finds that there is a reasonable basis on which to conclude that one or more of the grounds for waiver specified in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this sec-tion have been met. If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pediatric formula-tion, the waiver will cover only those pediatric age groups requiring that for-mulation. If a waiver is granted be-cause there is evidence that the prod-uct would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, this information will be included in the product's label-ing. (d) If a manufacturer fails to submit a supplemental application containing the information or request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in paragraph (a) of this section within the time specified by FDA, the drug prod-uct may be considered misbranded or an unapproved new drug or unlicensed biologic. [63 FR 66668, Dec. 2, 1998] \u00a7 201.24 Labeling for systemic anti- bacterial drug products. The labeling of all systemic drug products intended for human use indi-cated to treat a bacterial infection, ex-cept a mycobacterial infection, must bear the following statements: (a) At the beginning of the label, under the product name, the labeling must state: To reduce the development of drug-resist- ant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of (insert name of antibacterial drug product ) and other antibacterial drugs, ( insert name of antibacterial drug product ) should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (b) In the ''Indications and Usage'' section, the labeling must state: To reduce the development of drug-resist- ant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of (insert name of antibacterial drug product ) and other antibacterial drugs, ( insert name of antibacterial drug product ) should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sus-ceptibility information are available, they VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.25 should be considered in selecting or modi- fying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and suscep-tibility patterns may contribute to the em-piric selection of therapy. (c) In the ''Precautions'' section, under the ''General'' subsection, the la-beling must ( insert name of antibacterial drug product ) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to pro-vide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. (d) In the ''Precautions'' section, under the ''Information for Patients'' subsection, the labeling must state: Patients should be counseled that anti- bacterial drugs including ( insert name of anti- bacterial drug product ) should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ( insert name of antibacterial drug prod- uct) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infec- tion, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ( insert name of anti- bacterial drug product ) or other antibacterial drugs in future. [68 FR 6081, Feb. 6, 2003] \u00a7 201.25 Bar code label requirements. (a) Who is subject to these bar code re- quirements? Manufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distribu-tors of a human prescription drug prod-uct or an over-the-counter (OTC) drug product that is regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the Public Health Service Act are subject to these bar code requirements unless they are exempt from the reg-istration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. (b) What drugs are subject to these bar code requirements? The following drug products are subject to the bar code label requirements: (1) Prescription drug products, how- ever: (i) The bar code requirement does not apply to the following entities: (A) Prescription drug samples; (B) Allergenic extracts; (C) Intrauterine contraceptive de- vices regulated as drugs; (D) Medical gases; (E) Radiopharmaceuticals; and (F) Low-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap. (ii) The bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to pa-tients, but versions of the same drug product that are sold to or used in hos-pitals are subject to the bar code re-quirements. (2) Biological products; and (3) OTC drug products that are dis- pensed pursuant to an order and are commonly used in hospitals. For pur-poses of this section, an OTC drug product is ''commonly used in hos-pitals'' if it is packaged for hospital use, labeled for hospital use (or uses similar terms), or marketed, promoted, or sold to hospitals. (c) What does the bar code look like? Where does the bar code go? (1) Each drug product described in paragraph (b) of this section must have a bar code that contains, at a minimum, the ap-propriate National Drug Code (NDC) number in a linear bar code that meets European Article Number/Uniform Code Council (EAN.UCC) or Health In-dustry Business Communications Council (HIBCC) standards. Addition-ally, the bar code must: (i) Be surrounded by sufficient blank space so that the bar code can be scanned correctly; and (ii) Remain intact under normal con- ditions of use. (2) The bar code must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act. (d) Can a drug be exempted from the bar code requirement? (1) On our own initia- tive, or in response to a written re-quest from a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler or private label distributor, we may exempt a drug product from the bar code label requirements set forth in this section. The exemption re-quest must document why: (i) compliance with the bar code re- quirement would adversely affect the VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 \u00a7 201.26 safety, effectiveness, purity or potency of the drug or not be technologically feasible, and the concerns underlying the request could not reasonably be ad-dressed by measures such as package redesign or use of overwraps; or (ii) an alternative regulatory pro- gram or method of product use renders the bar code unnecessary for patient safety. (2) Requests for an exemption should be sent to the Office of Compliance, Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 51, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 (requests involving a drug product or biological product regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research) or to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Document Control Center, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Rm.

(a) The appropriate FDA Center Di- rector may grant an exception or alter-native to any provision listed in para-graph (f) of this section and not explic-itly required by statute, for specified lots, batches, or other units of a human drug product, if the Center Director de-termines that compliance with such la-beling requirement could adversely af-fect the safety, effectiveness, or avail-ability of such product that is or will be included in the Strategic National Stockpile. (b)(1)(i) A Strategic National Stock- pile official or any entity that manu- factures (including labeling, packing, relabeling, or repackaging), distrib-utes, or stores a human drug product that is or will be included in the Stra-tegic National Stockpile may submit, with written concurrence from a Stra-tegic National Stockpile official, a written request for an exception or al-ternative described in paragraph (a) of this section to the Center Director. (ii) The Center Director may grant an exception or alternative described in paragraph (a) of this section on his or her own initiative. (2) A written request for an exception or alternative described in paragraph (a) of this section must: (i) Identify the specified lots, batches, or other units of the human drug product that would be subject to the exception or alternative; (ii) Identify the labeling provision(s) listed in paragraph (f) of this section that are the subject of the exception or alternative request; (iii) Explain why compliance with such labeling provision(s) could ad-versely affect the safety, effectiveness, or availability of the specified lots, batches, or other units of a human drug product that are or will be held in the Strategic National Stockpile; (iv) Describe any proposed safeguards or conditions that will be implemented so that the labeling of the product in-cludes appropriate information nec-essary for the safe and effective use of the product, given the anticipated cir-cumstances of use of the product; (v) Provide a draft of the proposed la- beling of the specified lots, batches, or other units of the human drug product subject to the exception or alternative; and (vi) Provide any other information requested by the Center Director in support of the request. (c) The Center Director must respond in writing to all requests under this section. (d) A grant of an exception or alter- native under this section will include any safeguards or conditions deemed appropriate by the Center Director so that the labeling of product subject to the exception or alternative includes the information necessary for the safe and effective use of the product, given the anticipated circumstances of use. (e) If you are a sponsor receiving a grant of a request for an exception or alternative to the labeling require-ments under this section: (1) You need not submit a supplement under \u00a7314.70(a) through (c) or \u00a7601.12(f)(1) through (f)(2) of this VerDate Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.51 (2) You must report any grant of a re- quest for an exception or alternative under this section as part of your an-nual report under \u00a7\u00a7314.70(d) or 601.12(f)(3) of this chapter. (f) The Center Director may grant an exception or alternative under this sec-tion to the following provisions of this chapter, to the extent that the require-ments in these provisions are not ex-plicitly required by statute: (1) \u00a7201.1(h)(1) Prescription Drugs and/or Insulin \u00a7 201.50 Statement of identity. (a) The label of prescription and insu- lin-containing drugs in package form shall bear as one of its principal fea-tures a statement of the identity of the drug. (b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of the established name of the drug. In the case of a prescription drug that is a mixture and that has no established name, the requirement for statement of identity shall be deemed to be satisfied by a listing of the quan-titative ingredient information as pre-scribed by \u00a7201.10. (c) The statement of identity of a prescription drug shall also comply with the placement, size and promi-nence requirements of \u00a7201.10.

(a) The label of a prescription or in- sulin-containing drug in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be ex-pressed in the terms of weight, meas-ure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement of quantity of drugs in tablet, capsule, ampule, or other unit dosage form shall be ex-pressed in terms of numerical count; the statement of quantity for drugs in other dosage forms shall be in terms of weight if the drug is solid, semi-solid, or viscous, or in terms of fluid measure if the drug is liquid. When the drug quantity statement is in terms of the numerical count of the drug units, it shall be augmented to give the weight or measure of the drug units or the quantity of each active ingredient in each drug unit or, when quantity does not accurately reflect drug potency, a statement of the drug potency. (b) Statements of weight of the con- tents shall in the case of prescription drugs be expressed in terms of avoirdu-pois pound, ounce, and grain or of kilo-gram, gram, and subdivisions thereof. A statement of liquid measure of the contents shall in the case of prescrip-tion drugs be expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, fluid-ounce, and fluid-dram subdivisions thereof, or of the liter and milliliter, or cubic centimeter, and shall express the volume at 68 \u00b0F. (20 \u00b0C.). A statement of the liquid measure of the contents in the case of insulin- containing drugs shall be expressed in terms of the liter and milliliter, or cubic centimeter, and shall express the volume at 68 \u00b0F. (20 \u00b0C.). (c) The declaration shall contain only such fractions as are generally used in expressing the quantity of the drug. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than three places, except in the case of a statement of the quantity of an active ingredient in a unit of a drug. (d) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the label and, in the case of large volume parenterals, may be embossed on the glass. (e) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of drug in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith. (f) A statement of the quantity of a prescription or insulin-containing drug in terms of weight or measure applica-ble to such drug, under the provisions VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Edition) \u00a7 201.55 of paragraph (a) of this section, shall express with prominence and conspicu-ousness the number of the largest whole unit, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, that are contained in the package. Any remainder shall be expressed in terms of common or dec-imal fractions of such unit or in terms of the next smaller whole unit and common or decimal fractions thereof. (g) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture dur-ing the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be un-reasonably large. In the case of a liquid drug in ampules or vials, intended for injection, the declaration shall be con-sidered to express the minimum quan-tity and the variation above the stated measure shall comply with the excess volume prescribed by the National For-mulary or the U.S. Pharmacopeia for filling of ampules. In the case of a solid drug in ampules or vials, the declara-tion shall be considered to express the accurate net weight. Variations shall comply with the limitations provided in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or the Na-tional Formulary. (h) A drug shall be exempt from com- pliance with the net quantity declara-tion required by this section if it is an ointment labeled ''sample'', ''physi-cian's sample'', or a substantially simi-lar statement and the contents of the package do not exceed 8 grams. \u00a7 201.55 Statement of dosage. Section 201.100(b)(2) requires that la- bels for prescription drugs bear a state-ment of the recommended or usual dos-age. Since the dosage for some pre-scription drugs varies within extremely wide limits, depending upon the condi-tions being treated, it may not be pos-sible in all cases to present an inform-ative or useful statement of the rec-ommended or usual dosage in the space available on the label or carton of the package. It is the view of the Food and Drug Administration that when such a situation prevails, compliance with this requirement would be met by a statement such as ''See package insert for dosage information'', where the de-tailed information is contained in such insert. However, if an informative, re-alistic, recommended or usual dosage can readily be set forth on the label, it should appear thereon. \u00a7 201.56 Requirements on content and format of labeling for human pre-scription drug and biological prod-ucts. (a) General requirements. Prescription drug labeling described in \u00a7201.100(d) must meet the following general re-quirements: (1) The labeling must contain a sum- mary of the essential scientific infor-mation needed for the safe and effec-tive use of the drug. (2) The labeling must be informative and accurate and neither promotional in tone nor false or misleading in any particular. In accordance with \u00a7\u00a7314.70 and 601.12 of this chapter, the labeling must be updated when new information becomes available that causes the la-beling to become inaccurate, false, or misleading. (3) The labeling must be based when- ever possible on data derived from human experience. No implied claims or suggestions of drug use may be made if there is inadequate evidence of safe-ty or a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions based on animal data but necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans must be identified as such and included with human data in the appropriate section of the labeling. (b) Categories of prescription drugs sub- ject to the labeling content and format re-quirements in \u00a7\u00a7201.56(d) and 201.57. (1) The following categories of prescrip-tion drug products are subject to the labeling requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and \u00a7201.57 in accord-ance with the implementation schedule in paragraph (c) of this section: (i) Prescription drug products for which a new drug application (NDA), biologics license application (BLA), or efficacy supplement was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2006; VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.56 (ii) Prescription drug products for which an NDA, BLA, or efficacy supple-ment is pending on June 30, 2006; or (iii) Prescription drug products for which an NDA, BLA, or efficacy supple-ment is submitted anytime on or after June 30, 2006. (2) Prescription drug products not de- scribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion are subject to the labeling require-ments in paragraph (e) of this section and \u00a7201.80. (c) Schedule for implementing the label- ing content and format requirements in \u00a7\u00a7201.56(d) and 201.57.

Certain contra- indications or serious warnings, par-ticularly those that may lead to death or serious injury, may be required by the FDA to be presented in a box. The boxed warning ordinarily must be based on clinical data, but serious ani-mal toxicity may also be the basis of a boxed warning in the absence of clin-ical data. The box must contain, in up-percase letters, a heading inside the box that includes the word ''WARN-ING'' and conveys the general focus of the information in the box. The box must briefly explain the risk and refer to more detailed information in the ''Contraindications'' or ''Warnings and Precautions'' section, accompanied by the identifying number for the section or subsection containing the detailed information. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 (2) 1 Indications and usage. This sec- tion must state that the drug is indi-cated for the treatment, prevention, mitigation, cure, or diagnosis of a rec-ognized disease or condition, or of a manifestation of a recognized disease or condition, or for the relief of symp-toms associated with a recognized dis-ease or condition. (i) This section must include the fol- lowing information when the condi-tions listed are applicable: (A) If the drug is used for an indica- tion only in conjunction with a pri-mary mode of therapy (e.g., diet, sur-gery, behavior changes, or some other drug), a statement that the drug is in-dicated as an adjunct to that mode of therapy. (B) If evidence is available to support the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product only in selected subgroups of the larger population (e.g., patients with mild disease or pa-tients in a special age group), or if the indication is approved based on a sur-rogate endpoint under \u00a7314.510 or \u00a7601.41 of this chapter, a succinct de-scription of the limitations of useful-ness of the drug and any uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits, with reference to the ''Clinical Stud-ies'' section for a discussion of the available evidence. (C) If specific tests are necessary for selection or monitoring of the patients who need the drug (e.g., microbe sus-ceptibility tests), the identity of such tests. (D) If information on limitations of use or uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits is relevant to the rec-ommended intervals between doses, to the appropriate duration of treatment when such treatment should be lim-ited, or to any modification of dosage, a concise description of the informa-tion with reference to the more de-tailed information in the ''Dosage and Administration'' section. (E) If safety considerations are such that the drug should be reserved for specific situations (e.g., cases refrac-tory to other drugs), a statement of the information. (F) If there are specific conditions that should be met before the drug is used on a long term basis (e.g., dem-onstration of responsiveness to the drug in a short term trial in a given pa- tient), a statement of the conditions; or, if the indications for long term use are different from those for short term use, a statement of the specific indica-tions for each use. (ii) If there is a common belief that the drug may be effective for a certain use or if there is a common use of the drug for a condition, but the prepon-derance of evidence related to the use or condition shows that the drug is in-effective or that the therapeutic bene-fits of the product do not generally outweigh its risks, FDA may require that this section state that there is a lack of evidence that the drug is effec-tive or safe for that use or condition. (iii) Any statements comparing the safety or effectiveness of the drug with other agents for the same indication must, except for biological products, be supported by substantial evidence de-rived from adequate and well-con-trolled studies as defined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, such statements must be supported by substantial evidence. (iv) For drug products other than bio- logical products, all indications listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section. (v) For biological products, all indi- cations listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of ef-fectiveness. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section. (3) 2 Dosage and administration. (i) This section must state the rec-ommended dose and, as appropriate: (A) The dosage range, (B) An upper limit beyond which safety and effectiveness have not been established, or beyond which increas-ing the dose does not result in increas-ing effectiveness, VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 \u00a7 201.57 (C) Dosages for each indication and subpopulation, (D) The intervals recommended be- tween doses, (E) The optimal method of titrating dosage, (F) The usual duration of treatment when treatment duration should be limited, (G) Dosing recommendations based on clinical pharmacologic data (e.g., clinically significant food effects), (H) Modification of dosage needed be- cause of drug interactions or in special patient populations (e.g., in children, in geriatric age groups, in groups de- fined by genetic characteristics, or in patients with renal or hepatic disease), (I) Important considerations con- cerning compliance with the dosage regimen, (J) Efficacious or toxic concentration ranges and therapeutic concentration windows of the drug or its metabolites, if established and clinically signifi-cant. Information on therapeutic drug concentration monitoring (TDM) must also be included in this section when TDM is necessary. (ii) Dosing regimens must not be im- plied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this sec-tion. (iii) Radiation dosimetry information must be stated for both the patient re-ceiving a radioactive drug and the per-son administering it. (iv) This section must also contain specific direction on dilution, prepara-tion (including the strength of the final dosage solution, when prepared accord-ing to instructions, in terms of milli-grams of active ingredient per milli-liter of reconstituted solution, unless another measure of the strength is more appropriate), and administration of the dosage form, if needed (e.g., the rate of administration of parenteral drug in milligrams per minute; storage conditions for stability of the reconsti-tuted drug, when important; essential information on drug incompatibilities if the drug is mixed in vitro with other drugs or diluents; and the following verbatim statement for parenterals: ''Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate mat-ter and discoloration prior to adminis-tration, whenever solution and con- tainer permit.'') (4) 3 Dosage forms and strengths. This section must contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is respon-sible, including: (i) The strength or potency of the dosage form in metric system (e.g., 10 milligram tablets), and, if the apothe-cary system is used, a statement of the strength in parentheses after the met-ric designation; and (ii) A description of the identifying characteristics of the dosage forms, in-cluding shape, color, coating, scoring, and imprinting, when applicable. The National Drug Code number(s) for the drug product must not be included in this section. (5) 4 Contraindications. This section must describe any situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use (e.g., certain potentially fatal adverse reactions) clearly out-weighs any possible therapeutic ben-efit. Those situations include use of the drug in patients who, because of their particular age, sex, concomitant ther-apy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by the drug and for whom no potential benefit makes the risk acceptable. Known hazards and not theoretical pos-sibilities must be listed (e.g., if severe hypersensitivity to the drug has not been demonstrated, it should not be listed as a contraindication). If no con-traindications are known, this section must state ''None.'' (6) 5 Warnings and precautions. (i) General. This section must describe clinically significant adverse reactions (including any that are potentially fatal, are serious even if infrequent, or can be prevented or mitigated through appropriate use of the drug), other po-tential safety hazards (including those that are expected for the pharma-cological class or those resulting from drug/drug interactions), limitations in use imposed by them (e.g., avoiding certain concomitant therapy), and steps that should be taken if they occur (e.g., dosage modification). The frequency of all clinically significant adverse reactions and the approximate VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 mortality and morbidity rates for pa- tients experiencing the reaction, if known and necessary for the safe and effective use of the drug, must be ex-pressed as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. In accordance with \u00a7\u00a7314.70 and 601.12 of this chapter, the labeling must be revised to include a warning about a clinically significant hazard as soon as there is reasonable evidence of a causal association with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been definitely established. A spe-cific warning relating to a use not pro-vided for under the ''Indications and Usage'' section may be required by FDA in accordance with sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the act if the drug is com-monly prescribed for a disease or con-dition and such usage is associated with a clinically significant risk or hazard. (ii) Other special care precautions. This section must contain information re-garding any special care to be exer-cised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug (e.g., pre-cautions not required under any other specific section or subsection). (iii) Monitoring: Laboratory tests. This section must identify any laboratory tests helpful in following the patient's response or in identifying possible ad-verse reactions. If appropriate, infor-mation must be provided on such fac-tors as the range of normal and abnor-mal values expected in the particular situation and the recommended fre-quency with which tests should be per-formed before, during, and after ther-apy. (iv) Interference with laboratory tests. This section must briefly note informa-tion on any known interference by the product with laboratory tests and ref-erence the section where the detailed information is presented (e.g., ''Drug Interactions'' section). (7) 6 Adverse reactions. This section must describe the overall adverse reac-tion profile of the drug based on the en-tire safety database. For purposes of prescription drug labeling, an adverse reaction is an undesirable effect, rea-sonably associated with use of a drug, that may occur as part of the pharma-cological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. This definition does not include all adverse events observed during use of a drug, only those adverse events for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event. (i) Listing of adverse reactions. This section must list the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable. The list or lists must be preceded by the information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions (e.g., for clinical trials, total number ex-posed, extent and nature of exposure). (ii) Categorization of adverse reactions. Within a listing, adverse reactions must be categorized by body system, by severity of the reaction, or in order of decreasing frequency, or by a com-bination of these, as appropriate. With-in a category, adverse reactions must be listed in decreasing order of fre-quency. If frequency information can-not be reliably determined, adverse re-actions must be listed in decreasing order of severity. (A) Clinical trials experience. This sec- tion must list the adverse reactions identified in clinical trials that oc-curred at or above a specified rate ap-propriate to the safety database. The rate of occurrence of an adverse reac-tion for the drug and comparators (e.g., placebo) must be presented, unless such data cannot be determined or presen-tation of comparator rates would be misleading. If adverse reactions that occurred below the specified rate are included, they must be included in a separate listing. If comparative rates of occurrence cannot be reliably deter-mined (e.g., adverse reactions were ob-served only in the uncontrolled trial portion of the overall safety database), adverse reactions must be grouped within specified frequency ranges as appropriate to the safety database for the drug (e.g., adverse reactions occur-ring at a rate of less than 1/100, adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 1/500) or descriptively identified, VerDate Sep<11>2014 \u00a7 201.57 if frequency ranges cannot be deter- mined. For adverse reactions with sig-nificant clinical implications, the list-ings must be supplemented with addi-tional detail about the nature, fre-quency, and severity of the adverse re-action and the relationship of the ad-verse reaction to drug dose and demo-graphic characteristics, if data are available and important. (B) Postmarketing experience. This sec- tion of the labeling must list the ad-verse reactions, as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, that are identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials. (iii) Comparisons of adverse reactions between drugs. For drug products other than biological products, any claim comparing the drug to which the label-ing applies with other drugs in terms of frequency, severity, or character of ad-verse reactions must be based on ade-quate and well-controlled studies as de-fined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter un-less this requirement is waived under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, any such claim must be based on substantial evidence. (8) 7 Drug interactions. (i) This section must contain a description of clinically significant interactions, either ob-served or predicted, with other pre-scription or over-the-counter drugs, classes of drugs, or foods (e.g., dietary supplements, grapefruit juice), and spe-cific practical instructions for pre-venting or managing them. The mecha-nism(s) of the interaction, if known, must be briefly described. Interactions that are described in the ''Contra-indications'' or ''Warnings and Pre-cautions'' sections must be discussed in more detail under this section. Details of drug interaction pharmacokinetic studies that are included in the ''Clin-ical Pharmacology'' section that are pertinent to clinical use of the drug must not be repeated in this section. (ii) This section must also contain practical guidance on known inter-ference of the drug with laboratory tests. (9) 8 Use in specific populations. This section must contain the following sub-sections: (i) 8.1 Pregnancy. This subsection of the labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the Pregnancy exposure registry. If there is a scientifically acceptable pregnancy exposure registry for the drug, contact information needed to enroll in the registry or to obtain in-formation about the registry must be provided following the statement: ''There is a pregnancy exposure reg-istry that monitors pregnancy out-comes in women exposed to ( name of drug) during pregnancy.'' (B) Risk summary. The Risk Summary must contain risk statement(s) based on data from all relevant sources (human, animal, and/or pharmacologic) that describe, for the drug, the risk of adverse developmental outcomes ( i.e., structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, functional im-pairment, alterations to growth). When multiple data sources are available, the statements must be presented in the following order: Human, animal, pharmacologic. The source(s) of the data must be stated. The labeling must state the percentage range of live births in the United States with a major birth defect and the percentage range of pregnancies in the United States that end in miscarriage, regard-less of drug exposure. If such informa-tion is available for the population(s) for which the drug is labeled, it must also be included. When use of a drug is contraindicated during pregnancy, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary. When applicable, risk statements as described in paragraphs (c)(9)(i)(B)( 1) and ( 2) of this section must include a cross-reference to addi-tional details in the relevant portion of the ''Data'' subheading in the ''Preg-nancy'' subsection of the labeling. If data demonstrate that a drug is not systemically absorbed following a par-ticular route of administration, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: ''( Name of drug ) is not absorbed systemically following (route of administration), and mater-nal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug.'' VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 (1) Risk statement based on human data. When human data are available that establish the presence or absence of any adverse developmental out-come(s) associated with maternal use of the drug, the Risk Summary must summarize the specific developmental outcome(s); their incidence; and the ef-fects of dose, duration of exposure, and gestational timing of exposure. If human data indicate that there is an increased risk for a specific adverse de-velopmental outcome in infants born to women exposed to the drug during pregnancy, this risk must be quan-titatively compared to the risk for the same outcome in infants born to women who were not exposed to the drug but who have the disease or condi-tion for which the drug is indicated to be used. When risk information is not available for women with the disease or condition for which the drug is indi-cated, the risk for the specific outcome must be compared to the rate at which the outcome occurs in the general pop-ulation. The Risk Summary must state when there are no human data or when available human data do not establish the presence or absence of drug-associ-ated risk. (2) Risk statement based on animal data. When animal data are available, the Risk Summary must summarize the findings in animals and based on these findings, describe, for the drug, the potential risk of any adverse devel-opmental outcome(s) in humans. This statement must include: The number and type(s) of species affected, timing of exposure, animal doses expressed in terms of human dose or exposure equivalents, and outcomes for pregnant animals and offspring. When animal studies do not meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies, the Risk Summary must so state. When there are no animal data, the Risk Summary must so state. (3) Risk statement based on pharma- cology. When the drug has a well-under- stood mechanism of action that may result in adverse developmental out-come(s), the Risk Summary must ex-plain the mechanism of action and the potential associated risks. (C) Clinical considerations. Under the subheading ''Clinical Considerations,'' the labeling must provide relevant in-formation, to the extent it is available, under the headings ''Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk,'' ''Dose (1) Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk. If there is a serious known or potential risk to the preg-nant woman and/or the embryo/fetus associated with the disease or condi-tion for which the drug is indicated to be used, the labeling must describe the risk. (2) Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period. If there are pharmacokinetic data that support dose adjustment(s) during pregnancy and the postpartum period, a summary of this information must be provided. (3) Maternal adverse reactions. If use of the drug is associated with a maternal adverse reaction that is unique to preg-nancy or if a known adverse reaction occurs with increased frequency or se-verity in pregnant women, the labeling must describe the adverse reaction and available intervention(s) for moni-toring or mitigating the reaction. The labeling must describe, if known, the effect of dose, timing, and duration of exposure on the risk to the pregnant woman of experiencing the adverse re-action. (4) Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions. If it is known or anticipated that treat-ment of the pregnant woman increases or may increase the risk of an adverse reaction in the fetus or neonate, the la-beling must describe the adverse reac-tion, the potential severity and revers-ibility of the adverse reaction, and available intervention(s) for moni-toring or mitigating the reaction. The labeling must describe, if known, the effect of dose, timing, and duration of exposure on the risk. (5) Labor or delivery. If the drug is ex- pected to affect labor or delivery, the labeling must provide information about the effect of the drug on the pregnant woman and the fetus or neonate; the effect of the drug on the VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun duration of labor and delivery; any in- creased risk of adverse reactions, in-cluding their potential severity and re-versibility; and must provide informa-tion about available intervention(s) that can mitigate these effects and/or adverse reactions. The information de-scribed under this heading is not re-quired for drugs approved for use only during labor and delivery. (D) Data\u2014(1) ''Data'' subheading. Under the subheading ''Data,'' the la-beling must describe the data that are the basis for the Risk Summary and Clinical Considerations. (2) Human and animal data headings. Human and animal data must be pre-sented separately, beneath the head-ings ''Human Data'' and ''Animal Data,'' and human data must be pre-sented first. (3) Description of human data. For human data, the labeling must describe adverse developmental outcomes, ad-verse reactions, and other adverse ef-fects. To the extent applicable, the la-beling must describe the types of stud-ies or reports, number of subjects and the duration of each study, exposure information, and limitations of the data. Both positive and negative study findings must be included. (4) Description of animal data. For ani- mal data, the labeling must describe the following: Types of studies, animal species, dose, duration and timing of exposure, study findings, presence or absence of maternal toxicity, and limi-tations of the data. Description of ma-ternal and offspring findings must in-clude dose-response and severity of ad-verse developmental outcomes. Animal doses or exposures must be described in terms of human dose or exposure equivalents and the basis for those cal-culations must be included. (ii) 8.2 Lactation. This subsection of the labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the subheadings ''Risk Sum-mary,'' ''Clinical Considerations,'' and ''Data'': (A) Risk summary. When relevant human and/or animal lactation data are available, the Risk Summary must include a cross-reference to the ''Data'' subheading in the ''Lactation'' sub-section of the labeling. When human data are available, animal data must not be included unless the animal model is specifically known to be pre-dictive for humans. When use of a drug is contraindicated during breastfeeding, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary. (1) Drug not absorbed systemically. If data demonstrate that the drug is not systemically absorbed by the mother, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: ''( Name of drug) is not absorbed systemically by the mother following (route of admin-istration), and breastfeeding is not ex-pected to result in exposure of the child to ( name of drug ).'' (2) Drug absorbed systemically. If the drug is absorbed systemically, the Risk Summary must describe the following to the extent relevant information is available: (i) Presence of drug in human milk. The Risk Summary must state whether the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) are present in human milk. If there are no data to assess this, the Risk Summary must so state. If studies demonstrate that the drug and/or its active metabo-lite(s) are not detectable in human milk, the Risk Summary must state the limits of the assay used. If studies demonstrate the presence of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk, the Risk Summary must state the concentration of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk and the actual or esti-mated daily dose for an infant fed ex-clusively with human milk. The actual or estimated amount of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) ingested by the infant must be compared to the labeled infant or pediatric dose, if available, or to the maternal dose. If studies dem-onstrate the presence of the drug and/ or its active metabolite(s) in human milk but the drug and/or its active me-tabolite(s) are not expected to be sys-temically bioavailable to the breast-fed child, the Risk Summary must describe the disposition of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s). If only animal lactation data are available, the Risk Summary must state only whether or not the drug and/or its active metabo-lite(s) were detected in animal milk and specify the animal species. (ii) Effects of drug on the breast-fed child. The Risk Summary must include VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 information, on the known or predicted effects on the child from exposure to the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) through human milk or from contact with breast or nipple skin (for topical products). The Risk Summary also must include information on systemic and/or local adverse reactions. If there are no data to assess the effects of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) on the breast-fed child, the Risk Summary must so state. (iii) Effects of drug on milk production. The Risk Summary must describe the effects of the drug and/or its active me-tabolite(s) on milk production. If there are no data to assess the effects of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) on milk production, the Risk Summary must so state. (3) Risk and benefit statement. For drugs absorbed systemically, unless breastfeeding is contraindicated during drug therapy, the following risk and benefit statement must appear at the end of the Risk Summary: ''The devel-opmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for (name of drug ) and any potential ad- verse effects on the breast-fed child from ( name of drug ) or from the under- lying maternal condition.'' (B) Clinical considerations. Under ''Clinical Considerations,'' the fol-lowing information must be provided to the extent it is available and rel-evant: (1) Minimizing exposure. The labeling must describe ways to minimize expo-sure in the breast-fed child if: The drug and/or its active metabolite(s) are present in human milk in clinically relevant concentrations; the drug does not have an established safety profile in infants; and the drug is used either intermittently, in single doses, or for short courses of therapy. When applica-ble, the labeling must also describe ways to minimize a breast-fed child's oral intake of topical drugs applied to the breast or nipple skin. (2) Monitoring for adverse reactions. The labeling must describe available intervention(s) for monitoring or miti-gating the adverse reaction(s) pre-sented in the Risk Summary. (C) Data. Under the subheading ''Data,'' the labeling must describe the data that are the basis for the Risk Summary and Clinical Considerations. (iii) 8.3 Females and males of reproduc- tive potential. When pregnancy testing and/or contraception are required or recommended before, during, or after drug therapy and/or when there are human and/or animal data that suggest drug-associated fertility effects, this subsection of labeling must contain this information under the subheadings ''Pregnancy Testing,'' ''Contracep-tion,'' and ''Infertility,'' in that order. (iv) 8.4 Pediatric use. (A) Pediatric population(s)/pediatric patient(s): For the purposes of paragraphs (c)(9)(iv)(B) through (c)(9)(iv)(H) of this section, the terms pediatric population(s) and pedi- atric patient(s) are defined as the pedi- atric age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neo-nates, infants, children, and adoles-cents. (B) If there is a specific pediatric in- dication different from those approved for adults that is supported by ade-quate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, it must be de-scribed under the ''Indications and Usage'' section, and appropriate pedi-atric dosage information must be given under the ''Dosage and Administra-tion'' section. The ''Pediatric use'' sub-section must cite any limitations on the pediatric indication, need for spe-cific monitoring, specific hazards asso-ciated with use of the drug in any sub-sets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pedi-atric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this sub-section should be discussed in more de-tail, if appropriate, under the ''Clinical Pharmacology'' or ''Clinical Studies'' section. As appropriate, this informa-tion must also be contained in the ''Contraindications'' and/or ''Warnings and Precautions'' section(s). (C) If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indica-tion also approved for adults that are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they must be summarized in the ''Pe-diatric use'' subsection and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ''Clinical Pharmacology'' and VerDate Sep<11>2014 must the ''Dosage and Administra-tion'' section. The ''Pediatric use'' sub-section of the labeling must also cite any limitations on the pediatric use statement, need for specific moni-toring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other infor-mation related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. As appro-priate, this information must also be contained in the ''Contraindications'' and/or ''Warnings and Precautions'' section(s). (D)(1) When a drug is approved for pe- diatric use based on adequate and well- controlled studies in adults with other information supporting pediatric use, the ''Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling must contain either the fol-lowing statement or a reasonable alter-native: The safety and effectiveness of ( drug name ) have been established in the age groups lll to lll (note any limitations, e.g., no data for pediatric patients under 2, or only applicable to certain indications approved in adults). Use of ( drug name ) in these age groups is supported by evidence from ade-quate and well-controlled studies of ( drug name ) in adults with additional data ( insert wording that accurately describes the data sub-mitted to support a finding of substantial evi-dence of effectiveness in the pediatric popu-lation ). (2) Data summarized in the preceding prescribed statement in this subsection must be discussed in more detail, if ap-propriate, under the ''Clinical Pharma-cology'' or the ''Clinical Studies'' sec-tion. For example, pediatric pharmaco-kinetic or pharmacodynamic studies and dose response information should be described in the ''Clinical Pharma-cology'' section. Pediatric dosing in-structions must be included in the ''Dosage and Administration'' section. Any differences between pediatric and adult responses, need for specific moni-toring, dosing adjustments, and any other information related to safe and effective use of the drug in pediatric patients must be cited briefly in the ''Pediatric use'' subsection and, as ap- propriate, and Precautions,'' and ''Dosage and Administration'' sections. (E) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for a par-ticular pediatric population, the ''Pe-diatric use'' subsection must contain an appropriate statement such as ''Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of ( ll) have not been established.'' If use of the drug in this pediatric population is as-sociated with a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in this sub-section, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the ''Contraindica-tions'' or ''Warnings and Precautions'' section and this subsection must refer to it. (F) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for any pediatric population, this subsection must contain the following statement: ''Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.'' If use of the drug in premature or neo-natal infants, or other pediatric sub-groups, is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in this subsection, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the ''Contra-indications'' or ''Warnings and Pre-cautions'' section and this subsection must refer to it. (G) If the sponsor believes that none of the statements described in para-graphs (c)(9)(iv)(B) through (c)(9)(iv)(F) of this section are appropriate or rel-evant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor must provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s). FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if FDA determines that no statement described in those para-graphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling and that the alternative statement is accurate and appropriate. (H) If the drug product contains one or more inactive ingredients that present an increased risk of toxic ef-fects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups, a special note of this risk must be made, generally in the ''Con-traindications'' or ''Warnings and Pre-cautions'' section. VerDate Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 (v) 8.5 Geriatric use. (A) A specific geriatric indication, if any, that is sup-ported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the geriatric population must be described under the ''Indica-tions and Usage'' section, and appro-priate geriatric dosage must be stated under the ''Dosage and Administra-tion'' section. The ''Geriatric use'' sub-section must cite any limitations on the geriatric indication, need for spe-cific monitoring, specific hazards asso-ciated with the geriatric indication, and other information related to the safe and effective use of the drug in the geriatric population. Unless otherwise noted, information contained in the ''Geriatric use'' subsection must per-tain to use of the drug in persons 65 years of age and older. Data summa-rized in this subsection must be dis-cussed in more detail, if appropriate, under ''Clinical Pharmacology'' or the ''Clinical Studies'' section. As appro-priate, this information must also be contained in the ''Warnings and Pre-cautions'' and/or ''Contraindications'' section(s). (B) Specific statements on geriatric use of the drug for an indication ap-proved for adults generally, as distin-guished from a specific geriatric indi-cation, must be contained in the ''Geriatric use'' subsection and must reflect all information available to the sponsor that is relevant to the appro-priate use of the drug in elderly pa-tients. This information includes de-tailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-docu-mented studies obtained from a lit-erature search. Controlled studies in-clude those that are part of the mar-keting application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug applica-tion, new drug application, biologics li-cense application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applica-tions (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The ''Geriatric use'' subsection must con-tain the following statement(s) or rea-sonable alternative, as applicable, tak-ing into account available information: (1) If clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ''Geriatric use'' subsection must include the following statement: Clinical studies of ( name of drug ) did not include sufficient numbers of sub-jects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clin-ical experience has not identified dif-ferences in responses between the el-derly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, re-flecting the greater frequency of de-creased hepatic, renal, or cardiac func-tion, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. (2) If clinical studies (including stud- ies that are part of marketing applica-tions and other relevant studies avail-able to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor's applica-tions) included enough elderly subjects to make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in safety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ''Geriatric use'' subsection must con-tain the following statement: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ( name of drug ), ll percent were 65 and over, while ll percent were 75 and over. (Alternatively, the labeling may state the total number of subjects included in the studies who were 65 and over and 75 and over.) No overall differences in safety or ef-fectiveness were observed between these sub-jects and younger subjects, and other re-ported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. (3) If evidence from clinical studies and other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific moni-toring or dosage adjustment, the VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 tain a brief description of observed dif-ferences or specific monitoring or dos-age requirements and, as appropriate, must refer to more detailed discussions in the ''Contraindications,'' ''Warnings and Precautions,'' ''Dosage and Admin-istration,'' or other sections. (C)(1) If specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out in the elderly, they must be described briefly in the ''Geriatric use'' subsection and in detail under ''Clinical Pharmacology'' and information on drug/disease and drug/drug interactions that is particu-larly relevant to the elderly, who are more likely to have concomitant ill-ness and to use concomitant drugs. (2) If a drug is known to be substan- tially excreted by the kidney, the ''Geriatric use'' subsection must in-clude the statement: This drug is known to be substantially ex- creted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in pa-tients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have de-creased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (D) If use of the drug in the elderly appears to cause a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in the ''Geri-atric use'' subsection, or, if appro-priate, the hazard must be stated in the ''Contraindications'' or ''Warnings and Precautions'' section, and the ''Geriatric use'' subsection must refer to those sections. (E) Labeling under paragraphs (c)(9)(v)(A) through (c)(9)(v)(C) of this section may include statements, if they are necessary for safe and effec-tive use of the drug, and reflect good clinical practice or past experience in a particular situation, e.g., for a sedating drug, it could be stated that: Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of (name of drug ) and observed closely. (F) If the sponsor believes that none of the requirements described in para-graphs (c)(9)(v)(A) through (c)(9)(v)(E) of this section are appropriate or rel-evant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor must provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose an alternative statement. FDA may permit omission of the state-ments if FDA determines that no state-ment described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling. FDA may permit use of an al-ternative statement if the agency de-termines that such statement is accu-rate and appropriate. (vi) Additional subsections. Additional subsections may be included, as appro-priate, if sufficient data are available concerning the use of the drug in other specified subpopulations (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment). (10) 9 Drug abuse and dependence. This section must contain the following in-formation, as appropriate: (i) 9.1 Controlled substance. If the drug is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the schedule in which it is controlled must be stated. (ii) 9.2 Abuse. This subsection must state the types of abuse that can occur with the drug and the adverse reac-tions pertinent to them, and must identify particularly susceptible pa-tient populations. This subsection must be based primarily on human data and human experience, but perti- nent animal data may also be used. (iii) 9.3 Dependence. This subsection must describe characteristic effects re-sulting from both psychological and physical dependence that occur with the drug and must identify the quan-tity of the drug over a period of time that may lead to tolerance or depend-ence, or both. Details must be provided on the adverse effects of chronic abuse and the effects of abrupt withdrawal. Procedures necessary to diagnose the dependent state and the principles of treating the effects of abrupt with-drawal must be described. (11) 10 Overdosage. This section must be based on human data. If human data are unavailable, appropriate animal and in vitro data may be used. The fol-lowing specific information must be provided: (i) Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings associated with an overdosage of the drug; (ii) Complications that can occur with the drug (for example, organ tox-icity or delayed acidosis); VerDate Sep<11>2014 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 (iii) Concentrations of the drug in biologic fluids associated with toxicity or death; physiologic variables influ-encing excretion of the drug, such as urine pH; and factors that influence the dose response relationship of the drug, such as tolerance. The pharmaco-kinetic data given in the ''Clinical Pharmacology'' section also may be referenced here, if applicable to overdoses; (iv) The amount of the drug in a sin- gle dose that is ordinarily associated with symptoms of overdosage and the amount of the drug in a single dose that is likely to be life threatening; (v) Whether the drug is dialyzable; and (vi) Recommended general treatment procedures and specific measures for support of vital functions (e.g., proven antidotes, gastric lavage, forced diure-sis, or as per Poison Control Center). Such recommendations must be based on data available for the specific drug or experience with pharmacologically related drugs. Unqualified rec-ommendations for which data are lack-ing for the specific drug or class of drugs must not be stated. (12) 11 Description. (i) This section must contain: (A) The proprietary name and the es- tablished name, if any, as defined in section 502(e)(2) of the act, of the drug or, for biological products, the proper name (as defined in \u00a7600.3 of this chap-ter) and any appropriate descriptors; (B) The type of dosage form(s) and the route(s) of administration to which the labeling applies; (C) The same qualitative and/or quan- titative ingredient information as re-quired under \u00a7201.100(b) for drug labels or \u00a7\u00a7610.60 and 610.61 of this chapter for biological product labels; (D) If the product is sterile, a state- ment of that fact; (E) The pharmacological or thera- peutic class of the drug; (F) For drug products other than bio- logical products, the chemical name and structural formula of the drug; and (G) If the product is radioactive, a statement of the important nuclear physical characteristics, such as the principal radiation emission data, ex-ternal radiation, and physical decay characteristics. (ii) If appropriate, other important chemical or physical information, such as physical constants or pH, must be stated. (13) 12 Clinical pharmacology. (i) This section must contain information re-lating to the human clinical pharma- cology and actions of the drug in hu-mans. Pharmacologic information based on in vitro data using human biomaterials or pharmacologic animal models, or relevant details about in vivo study designs or results (e.g., drug interaction studies), may be included in this section if essential to under-stand dosing or drug interaction infor-mation presented in other sections of the labeling. This section must include the following subsections: (A) 12.1 Mechanism of action. This sub- section must summarize what is known about the established mechanism(s) of the drug's action in humans at various levels (e.g., receptor, membrane, tis-sue, organ, whole body). If the mecha-nism of action is not known, this sub-section must contain a statement about the lack of information. (B) 12.2 Pharmacodynamics. This sub- section must include a description of any biochemical or physiologic phar-macologic effects of the drug or active metabolites related to the drug's clin-ical effect in preventing, diagnosing, mitigating, curing, or treating disease, or those related to adverse effects or toxicity. Exposure-response relation-ships (e.g., concentration-response, dose-response) and time course of pharmacodynamic response (including short-term clinical response) must be included if known. If this information is unknown, this subsection must con-tain a statement about the lack of in-formation. Detailed dosing or moni-toring recommendations based on pharmacodynamic information that appear in other sections (e.g., ''Warn-ings and Precautions'' or ''Dosage and Administration'') must not be repeated in this subsection, but the location of such recommendations must be ref-erenced. (C) 12.3 Pharmacokinetics. This sub- section must describe the clinically significant pharmacokinetics of a drug or active metabolites, (i.e., pertinent absorption, distribution, metabolism, VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 regarding bioavailability, the ef-fect of food, minimum concentration (C min), maximum concentration (C max), time to maximum concentration (T max), area under the curve (AUC), pertinent half-lives (t 1/2), time to reach steady state, extent of accumulation, route(s) of elimination, clearance (renal, he-patic, total), mechanisms of clearance (e.g., specific enzyme systems), drug/ drug and drug/food (e.g., dietary sup-plements, grapefruit juice) pharmaco-kinetic interactions (including inhibi-tion, induction, and genetic character-istics), and volume of distribution (V d) must be presented if clinically signifi-cant. Information regarding nonlin-earity in pharmacokinetic parameters, changes in pharmacokinetics over time, and binding (plasma protein, erythrocyte) parameters must also be presented if clinically significant. This section must also include the results of pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., of me-tabolism or interaction) that establish the absence of an effect, including per-tinent human studies and in vitro data. Dosing recommendations based on clinically significant factors that change the product's pharmacokinetics (e.g., age, gender, race, hepatic or renal dysfunction, concomitant therapy) that appear in other sections (e.g., ''Warnings and Precautions,'' ''Dosage and Administration'' or ''Use be re-peated in this subsection, but the loca-tion of such recommendations must be referenced. (ii) Data that demonstrate activity or effectiveness in in vitro or animal tests and that have not been shown by adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to be pertinent to clinical use may be included under this section only under the following cir-cumstances: (A) In vitro data for anti-infective drugs may be included if the data are immediately preceded by the state-ment ''The following in vitro data are available but their clinical significance is unknown.'' (B) For other classes of drugs, in vitro and animal data that have not been shown by adequate and well-con-trolled studies, as defined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter, to be necessary for the safe and effective use may be included in this section only if a waiver is granted under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. (14) 13 Nonclinical toxicology. This sec- tion must contain the following sub-sections as appropriate: (i) 13.1 Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, im- pairment of fertility. This subsection must state whether long term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential and, if so, the species and results. If results from reproduction studies or other data in animals raise concern about mutagenesis or impairment of fertility in either males or females, this must be described. Any precautionary state-ment on these topics must include practical, relevant advice to the pre-scriber on the significance of these ani-mal findings. Human data suggesting that the drug may be carcinogenic or mutagenic, or suggesting that it im-pairs fertility, as described in the ''Warnings and Precautions'' section, must not be included in this subsection of the labeling. (ii) 13.2 Animal toxicology and/or phar- macology. Significant animal data nec- essary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans that is not incor-porated in other sections of labeling must be included in this section (e.g., specifics about studies used to support approval under \u00a7314.600 or \u00a7601.90 of this chapter, the absence of chronic animal toxicity data for a drug that is administered over prolonged periods or is implanted in the body). (15) 14 Clinical studies. This section must discuss those clinical studies that facilitate an understanding of how to use the drug safely and effectively. Or-dinarily, this section will describe the studies that support effectiveness for the labeled indication(s), including dis-cussion of study design, population, endpoints, and results, but must not in- clude an encyclopedic listing of all, or even most, studies performed as part of the product's clinical development pro-gram. If a specific important clinical study is mentioned in any section of the labeling required under \u00a7\u00a7201.56 and 201.57 because the study is essential to an understandable presentation of the VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.57 information in that section of the la- beling, any detailed discussion of the study must appear in this section. (i) For drug products other than bio- logical products, any clinical study that is discussed in prescription drug labeling that relates to an indication for or use of the drug must be adequate and well-controlled as described in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter and must not imply or suggest indications or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the ''In-dications and Usage'' or ''Dosage and Administration'' section. For biologi-cal products, any clinical study that is discussed that relates to an indication for or use of the biological product must constitute or contribute to sub-stantial evidence and must not imply or suggest indications or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the ''Indications and Usage'' or ''Dosage and Adminis-tration'' section. (ii) Any discussion of a clinical study that relates to a risk from the use of the drug must also refer to the other sections of the labeling where the risk is identified or discussed. (16) 15 References. When prescription drug labeling must summarize or oth-erwise rely on a recommendation by an authoritative scientific body, or on a standardized methodology, scale, or technique, because the information is important to prescribing decisions, the labeling may include a reference to the source of the information. (17) 16 How supplied/storage and han- dling. This section must contain infor- mation on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is responsible. The information must include, as appropriate: (i) The strength or potency of the dosage form in metric system (e.g., 10 milligram tablets) and, if the apothe-cary system is used, a statement of the strength in parentheses after the met-ric designation; (ii) The units in which the dosage form is ordinarily available for pre-scribing by practitioners (e.g., bottles of 100); (iii) Appropriate information to fa- cilitate identification of the dosage forms, such as shape, color, coating, scoring, imprinting, and National Drug Code number; and (iv) Special handling and storage conditions. (18) 17 Patient counseling information. This section must contain information necessary for patients to use the drug safely and effectively (e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects). Any FDA-ap-proved patient labeling must be ref-erenced in this section and the full text of such patient labeling must be re-printed immediately following this sec-tion or, alternatively, accompany the prescription drug labeling. Any FDA- approved patient labeling printed im-mediately following this section or ac-companying the labeling is subject to the type size requirements in para-graph (d)(6) of this section, except for a Medication Guide to be detached and distributed to patients in compliance with \u00a7208.24 of this chapter. Medication Guides for distribution to patients are subject to the type size requirements set forth in \u00a7208.20 of this chapter. (d) Format requirements. All labeling information required under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must be printed in accordance with the fol-lowing specifications: (1) All headings and subheadings re- quired by paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section must be highlighted by bold type that prominently distinguishes the headings and subheadings from other labeling information. Reverse type is not permitted as a form of high-lighting. (2) A horizontal line must separate the information required by paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. (3) The headings listed in paragraphs (a)(5) through (a)(13) of this section must be presented in the center of a horizontal line. (4) If there are multiple subheadings listed under paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(13) of this section, each subheading must be preceded by a bullet point.

The term principal display panel, as it applies to over-the-counter drugs in package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and with-out obscuring designs, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alter-nate principal display panels, informa-tion required to be placed on the prin-cipal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of con-tents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term area of the prin- cipal display panel means the area of the side or surface that bears the prin-cipal display panel, which area shall be: (a) In the case of a rectangular pack- age where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal dis-play panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side; (b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 percent of the product of the height of the con-tainer times the circumference; and (c) In the case of any other shape of container, 40 percent of the total sur-face of the container: Provided, how- ever, That where such container pre- sents an obvious ''principal display panel'' such as the top of a triangular or circular package, the area shall con-sist of the entire top surface. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.62 In determining the area of the prin- cipal display panel, exclude tops, bot-toms, flanges at the tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bot-tles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, infor-mation required by this part to appear on the principal display panel shall ap-pear within that 40 percent of the cir-cumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or exam-ined under customary conditions of dis-play for retail sale. \u00a7 201.61 Statement of identity. (a) The principal display panel of an over-the-counter drug in package form shall bear as one of its principal fea-tures a statement of the identity of the commodity. (b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of the established name of the drug, if any there be, followed by an accurate statement of the general pharmacological category(ies) of the drug or the principal intended action(s) of the drug. In the case of an over-the- counter drug that is a mixture and that has no established name, this require-ment shall be deemed to be satisfied by a prominent and conspicuous state-ment of the general pharmacological action(s) of the mixture or of its prin-cipal intended action(s) in terms that are meaningful to the layman. Such statements shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of the proprietary name or des-ignation and shall employ terms de-scriptive of general pharmacological category(ies) principal intended ac-tion(s); for example, ''antacid,'' ''an-algesic,'' ''decongestant,'' ''antihis-taminic,'' etc. The indications for use shall be included in the directions for use of the drug, as required by section 502(f)(1) of the act and by the regula-tions in this part. (c) The statement of identity shall be presented in bold face type on the prin-cipal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most promi-nent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed. \u00a7 201.62 Declaration of net quantity of contents. (a) The label of an over-the-counter drug in package form shall bear a dec-laration of the net quantity of con-tents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination or numerical count and weight, measure, or size. The statement of quantity of drugs in tab-let, capsule, ampule, or other unit form and the quantity of devices shall be ex-pressed in terms of numerical count; the statement of quantity for drugs in other dosage forms shall be in terms of weight if the drug is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or in terms of fluid measure if the drug is liquid. The drug quantity statement shall be augmented when necessary to give accurate information as to the strength of such drug in the package; for example, to differentiate between several strengths of the same drug ''100 tablets, 5 grains each'' or ''100 capsules, 125 or ''100 capsules, 250 milligrams each'': Provided, That: (1) In the case of a firmly established, general consumer usage and trade cus-tom of declaring the quantity of a drug in terms of linear measure or measure of area, such respective term may be used. Such term shall be augmented when necessary for accuracy of infor-mation by a statement of the weight, measure, or size of the individual units or of the entire drug; for example, the net quantity of adhesive tape in pack-age form shall be expressed in terms of linear measure augmented by a state-ment of its width. (2) Whenever the Commissioner de- termines for a specific packaged drug that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a com-bination of these does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers, he shall by regulation designate the ap-propriate term or terms to be used for such article. (b) Statements of weight of the con- tents shall be expressed in terms of av-oirdupois pound and ounce. A state-ment of liquid measure of the contents shall be expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid-ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall express the volume VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun at 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C). See also paragraph (p) of this section. (c) The declaration may contain com- mon or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eights, sixteenths, or thirty- seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established, general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions. (d) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. (e) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated, by at least a space equal to the height of the let-tering used in the declaration, from other printed label information appear-ing above or below the declaration and, by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter ''N'' of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement, from other printed label in-formation appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count, such as ''giant pint'' and ''full quart'', that tends to exag-gerate the amount of the drug in the container. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bot-tom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: Provided, That: (1) On packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part; and (2) In the case of a drug that is mar- keted with both outer and inner retail containers bearing the mandatory label information required by this part and the inner container is not intended to be sold separately, the net quantity of contents placement requirement of this section applicable to such inner con-tainer is waived. (3) The principal display panel of a drug marketed on a display card to which the immediate container is af-fixed may be considered to be the dis-play panel of the card, and the type size of the net quantity of contents statement is governed by the dimen-sions of the display card. (f) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of drug or device in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith: Pro- vided, That in the case of drugs packed in containers designed to deliver the drug under pressure, the declaration shall state the net quantity of the con-tents that will be expelled when the in-structions for use as shown on the con-tainer are followed. The propellant is included in the net quantity declara-tion. (g) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or mold-ed on a glass or plastic surface is per-missible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that: (1) The ratio of height to width of the letter shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit, i.e., no more than 3 times as high as it is wide. (2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter ''o'' or its equivalent that shall meet the min-imum standards. (3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one- half the minimum height standards. (h) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the prin-cipal display panel of the package and VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.62 shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by com-plying with the following type speci-fications: (1) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages the principal dis-play panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less. (2) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on packages the principal dis-play panel of which has an area of more than five but not more than 25 square inches. (3) Not less than three-sixteenths inch in height on packages the prin-cipal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches. (4) Not less than one-fourth inch in height on packages the principal dis-play panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, except not less than one-half inch in height if the area is more than 400 square inches. Where the declaration is blown, em- bossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface rather than by printing, typ-ing, or coloring, the lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (h) (1) through (4) of this section shall be increased by one-sixteenth of an inch. (i) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure: (1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if ap-plicable (1 pound or 1 pint or more) fol-lowed in parentheses by a declaration in pounds for weight units, with any re-mainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs (k) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as appropriate) with any remain-der in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples set forth in para-graphs (k) (3) and (4) of this section). If the net weight of the package is less than 1 ounce avoirdupois or the net fluid measure is less than 1 fluid ounce, the declaration shall be in terms of common or decimal fractions of the re-spective ounce and not in terms of drams. (2) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term net weight shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. Use of the terms net or net con- tents in terms of fluid measure or nu- merical count is optional. It is suffi-cient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for example, ''Net wt. 6 ''net contents 6 fl oz''. (j) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed in pounds for weight units with any re-mainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound; in the case of fluid measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons, followed by common or dec-imal fractions of a gallon or by the next smaller whole unit or units (quarts or quarts and pints)) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart; see paragraph (k)(5) of this section. (k) Examples: (1) A declaration of 1 12pounds weight shall be expressed as ''Net wt. 24 oz (1 lb 8 oz),'' 24 oz (1 12lb)'' or ''Net wt. 24 oz (1.5 lb)''. (2) A declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be ex-pressed as ''Net wt. 12 oz''. (3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as ''Net contents 32 fl oz (1 qt)'' or ''32 fl oz (1 qt)''. (4) A declaration of 1 34quarts liquid measure shall be expressed as ''Net contents 56 fl oz (1 qt 1 pt 8 oz)'' or ''Net contents 56 fl oz (1 qt 1.5 pt),'' but not in terms of quart and ounce such as ''Net 56 fl oz (1 qt 24 oz).'' (5) A declaration of 2 12gallons liquid measure shall be expressed as ''Net contents 2 gal 2 qt,'' ''Net contents 2.5 gallons,'' or ''Net contents 2 12gal'' but not as ''2 gal 4 pt''. (l) For quantities, the following ab- breviations and none other may be em-ployed. Periods and plural forms are optional: Gallon gal quart qt pint pt ounce oz VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 g milligram mg microgram mcg liter l milliliter ml cubic centimeter cc yard yd feet or foot ft inch in meter m centimeter cm millimeter mm fluid fl square sq weight wt (m) On packages labeled in terms of linear measure, the declaration shall be expressed both in terms of inches and, if applicable (1 foot or more), the largest whole units (yards, yards and feet, feet). The declaration in terms of the largest whole units shall be in pa-rentheses following the declaration in terms of inches and any remainder shall be in terms of inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot or yard; if applicable, as in the case of ad-hesive tape, the initial declaration in linear inches shall be preceded by a statement of the width. Examples of linear measure are ''86 inches (2 yd 1 ft 2 in),'' ''90 inches (2 12yd),'' ''30 inches (2.5 ft),'' '' 34inch by 36 in (1 yd),'' etc. (n) On packages labeled in terms of area measure, the declaration shall be expressed both in terms of square inches and, if applicable (1 square foot or more), the largest whole square unit (square yards, square yards and square feet, square feet). The declaration in terms of the largest whole units shall be in parentheses following the dec-laration in terms of square inches and any remainder shall be in terms of square inches or common or decimal fractions of the square foot or square yard; for example, ''158 sq inches (1 sq ft 14 sq in).'' (o) Nothing in this section shall pro- hibit supplemental statements at loca-tions other than the principal display panel(s) describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents, provided that such supplemental state-ments of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the drug contained in the package; for example, ''giant pint'' and ''full quart.'' Dual or combination declarations of net quan-tity of contents as provided for in para-graphs (a) and (i) of this section are not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and shall be located on the principal display panel. (p) A separate statement of net quan- tity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight or measure is not re-garded as a supplemental statement and an accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal dis-play panel or on other panels. (q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture dur-ing the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be un-reasonably large. (r) A drug shall be exempt from com- pliance with the net quantity declara-tion required by this section if it is an ointment labeled ''sample,'' ''physi-cian's sample,'' or a substantially simi-lar statement and the contents of the package do not exceed 8 grams. \u00a7 201.63 Pregnancy/breast-feeding warning. (a) The labeling for all over-the- counter (OTC) drug products that are intended for systemic absorption, un-less specifically exempted, shall con-tain a general warning under the head-ing ''Warning'' (or ''Warnings'' if it ap-pears with additional warning state-ments) as follows: ''If pregnant or breast-feeding, ask a health profes-sional before use.'' [first four words of this statement in bold type] In addi-tion to the written warning, a symbol that conveys the intent of the warning may be used in labeling. (b) Where a specific warning relating to use during pregnancy or while nurs-ing has been established for a par-ticular drug product in a new drug ap-plication (NDA) or for a product cov-ered by an OTC drug final monograph in part 330 of this chapter, the specific warning shall be used in place of the warning in paragraph (a) of this sec-tion, unless otherwise stated in the NDA or in the final OTC drug mono-graph. (c) The following OTC drugs are ex- empt from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section: VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 \u00a7201 .66(b)(4) of this chapter for defini- tion of bullet symbol.

The title, headings, subheadings, and information set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section shall be presented on OTC drug products in accordance with the following specifications. In the interest of uniformity of presen-tation, FDA strongly reccommends that the Drug Facts labeling be pre-sented using the graphic specifications set forth in appendix A to part 201. (1) The title ''Drug Facts'' or ''Drug Facts (continued)'' shall use uppercase letters for the first letter of the words ''Drug'' and ''Facts.'' All headings and subheadings in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section shall use an uppercase letter for the first letter in the first word and lowercase letters for all other words. The title, headings, and subheadings in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(4) through (c)(9) of this section shall be left justified. (2) The letter height or type size for the title ''Drug Facts'' shall appear in a type size larger than the largest type size used in the Drug Facts labeling. The letter height or type size for the title ''Drug Facts (continued)'' shall be no smaller than 8-point type. The let-ter height or type size for the headings in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section shall be the larger of ei-ther 8-point or greater type, or 2-point sizes greater than the point size of the text. The letter height or type size for the subheadings and all other informa-tion described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section shall be no smaller than 6-point type. (3) The title, heading, subheadings, and information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section shall be legible and clearly presented, shall have at least 0.5-point leading (i.e., space between two lines of text), and shall not have letters that touch. The type style for the title, headings, sub-headings, and all other required infor-mation described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section shall be any single, clear, easy-to-read type style, with no more than 39 characters per inch. The title and headings shall be in bold italic, and the subheadings shall be in bold type, except that the word ''(continued)'' in the title ''Drug Facts (continued)'' shall be regular type. The type shall be all black or one color printed on a white or other con-trasting background, except that the VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 title and the headings may be pre- sented in a single, alternative, con-trasting color unless otherwise pro-vided in an approved drug application, OTC drug monograph (e.g., current re-quirements for bold print in \u00a7\u00a7341.76 and 341.80 of this chapter), or other OTC drug regulation (e.g., the require-ment for a box and red letters in \u00a7201.308(c)(1)). (4) When there is more than one statement, each individual statement listed under the headings and sub-headings in paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(7) of this section shall be preceded by a solid square or solid circle bullet of 5-point type size. Bullets shall be presented in the same shape and color throughout the labeling. The first bulleted statement on each horizontal line of text shall be either left justified or separated from an appropriate head-ing or subheading by at least two square ''ems'' (i.e., two squares of the size of the letter ''M''). If more than one bulleted statement is placed on the same horizontal line, the end of one bulleted statement shall be separated from the beginning of the next bulleted statement by at least two square ''ems'' and the complete additional bulleted statement(s) shall not con-tinue to the next line of text. Addi-tional bulleted statements appearing on each subsequent horizontal line of text under a heading or subheading shall be vertically aligned with the bulleted statements appearing on the previous line.

The continuation of the required content and format onto multiple panels must retain the re-quired order and flow of headings, sub-headings, and information. A visual graphic (e.g., an arrow) shall be used to signal the continuation of the Drug Facts labeling to the next adjacent panel. (6) The heading and information re- quired under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall appear immediately adja-cent and to the left of the heading and information required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The active ingre-dients and purposes shall be aligned under the appropriate headings such that the heading and information re-quired under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be left justified and the heading and information required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be right justified. If the OTC drug product contains more than one active ingredient, the active ingredients shall be listed in alphabetical order. If more than one active ingredient has the same purpose, the purpose need not be repeated for each active ingredient, provided the information is presented in a manner that readily associates each active ingredient with its purpose (i.e., through the use of brackets, dot leaders, or other graphical features). The information described in para-graphs (c)(4) and (c)(6) through (c)(9) of this section may start on the same line as the required headings. None of the information described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section shall appear on the same line as the ''Warning'' or ''Warn-ings'' heading.

Hyphens shall not be used except to punctuate compound words. (8) The information described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section shall be set off in a box or simi-lar enclosure by the use of a barline. A distinctive horizontal barline extend-ing to each end of the ''Drug Facts'' box or similar enclosure shall provide separation between each of the head-ings listed in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section. When a heading listed in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section appears on a subse-quent panel immediately after the ''Drug Facts (continued)'' title, a hori-zontal hairline shall follow the title and immediately precede the heading. A horizontal hairline extending within two spaces on either side of the ''Drug Facts'' box or similar enclosure shall immediately follow the title and shall VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.66 immediately precede each of the sub- headings set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, except the subheadings in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A) through (c)(5)(ii)(G) of this section. (9) The information set forth in para- graph (c)(6) of this section under the heading ''Directions'' shall appear in a table format when dosage directions are provided for three or more age groups or populations. The last line of the table may be the horizontal barline immediately preceding the heading of the next section of the labeling. (10) If the title, headings, sub- headings, and information in para-graphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this sec-tion, printed in accordance with the specifications in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(9) of this section, and any other FDA required information for drug products, and, as appropriate, cos-metic products, other than information required to appear on a principle dis-play panel, requires more than 60 per-cent of the total surface area available to bear labeling, then the Drug Facts labeling shall be printed in accordance with the specifications set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(i) through (d)(10)(v) of this section. In determining whether more than 60 percent of the total sur-face area available to bear labeling is required, the indications for use listed under the ''Use(s)'' heading, as set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, shall be limited to the minimum re-quired uses reflected in the applicable monograph, as provided in \u00a7330.1(c)(2) of this chapter. (i) Paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(5), (d)(6), and (d)(7) of this section shall apply. (ii) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall apply except that the letter height or type size for the title ''Drug Facts (continued)'' shall be no smaller than 7-point type and the headings in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(9) of this section shall be the larger of either 7- point or greater type, or 1-point size greater than the point size of the text. (iii) Paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply except that less than 0.5- point leading may be used, provided the ascenders and descenders do not touch. (iv) Paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall apply except that if more than one bulleted statement is placed on the same horizontal line, the additional bulleted statements may continue to the next line of text, and except that the bullets under each heading or sub-heading need not be vertically aligned. (v) Paragraph (d)(8) of this section shall apply except that the box or simi-lar enclosure required in paragraph (d)(8) of this section may be omitted if the Drug Facts labeling is set off from the rest of the labeling by use of color contrast.

(1) Under this section heading, the labeling shall state that: (i) The drug is indicated in the treat- ment, prevention, or diagnosis of a rec-ognized disease or condition, e.g., peni-cillin is indicated for the treatment of pneumonia due to susceptible pneumococci; and/or (ii) The drug is indicated for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of an important manifestation of a dis-ease or condition, e.g., chlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of edema in patients with congestive heart fail-ure; and/or (iii) The drug is indicated for the re- lief of symptoms associated with a dis-ease or syndrome, e.g., chlorpheniramine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 HHS \u00a7 201.80 in patients with vasomotor rhinitis; and/or (iv) The drug, if used for a particular indication only in conjuction with a primary mode of therapy, e.g., diet, surgery, or some other drug, is an ad-junct to the mode of therapy. (2)(i) For drug products other than biological products, all indications list-ed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not included in this section. (ii) For biological products, all indi- cations listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of ef-fectiveness. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not included in this section. (3) This section of the labeling shall also contain the following additional information: (i) If evidence is available to support the safety and effectiveness of the drug only in selected subgroups of the larger population with a disease, syndrome, or symptom under consideration, e.g., patients with mild disease or patients in a special age group, the labeling shall describe the available evidence and state the limitations of usefulness of the drug. The labeling shall also identify specific tests needed for selec-tion or monitoring of the patients who need the drug, e.g., microbe suscepti-bility tests. Information on the approx-imate kind, degree, and duration of im-provement to be anticipated shall be stated if available and shall be based on substantial evidence derived from adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. If the information is relevant to the rec-ommended intervals between doses, the usual duration of treatment, or any modification of dosage, it shall be stat-ed in the ''Dosage and Administration'' section of the labeling and referenced in this section. (ii) If safety considerations are such that the drug should be reserved for certain situations, e.g., cases refrac-tory to other drugs, this information shall be stated in this section. (iii) If there are specific conditions that should be met before the drug is used on a long-term basis, e.g., dem-onstration of responsiveness to the drug in a short-term trial, the labeling shall identify the conditions; or, if the indications for long-term use are dif-ferent from those for short-term use, the labeling shall identify the specific indications for each use. (iv) If there is a common belief that the drug may be effective for a certain use or if there is a common use of the drug for a condition, but the prepon-derance of evidence related to the use or condition shows that the drug is in-effective, the Food and Drug Adminis-tration may require that the labeling state that there is a lack of evidence that the drug is effective for that use or condition. (v) Any statements comparing the safety or effectiveness, either greater or less, of the drug with other agents for the same indication shall be sup-ported by adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. (d) Contraindications. Under this sec- tion heading, the labeling shall de-scribe those situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use clearly outweighs any pos-sible benefit. These situations include administration of the drug to patients known to have a hypersensitivity to it; use of the drug in patients who, be-cause of their particular age, sex, con-comitant therapy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by it; or contin-ued use of the drug in the face of an un-acceptably hazardous adverse reaction. Known hazards and not theoretical pos-sibilities shall be listed, e.g., if hyper-sensitivity to the drug has not been demonstrated, it should not be listed as a contraindication. If no contraindica-tions are known, this section of the la-beling shall state ''None known.'' (e) Warnings. Under this section head- ing, the labeling shall describe serious VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Edition) \u00a7 201.80 adverse reactions and potential safety hazards, limitations in use imposed by them, and steps that should be taken if they occur. The labeling shall be re-vised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an asso-ciation of a serious hazard with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been proved. A specific warning relat-ing to a use not provided for under the ''Indications and Usage'' section of the labeling may be required by the Food and Drug Administration if the drug is commonly prescribed for a disease or condition, and there is lack of substan-tial evidence of effectivenes for that disease or condition, and such usage is associated with serious risk or hazard. Special problems, particularly those that may lead to death or serious in-jury, may be required by the Food and Drug Administration to be placed in a prominently displayed box. The boxed warning ordinarily shall be based on clinical data, but serious animal tox-icity may also be the basis of a boxed warning in the absence of clinical data. If a boxed warning is required, its loca-tion will be specified by the Food and Drug Administration. The frequency of these serious adverse reactions and, if known, the approximate mortality and morbidity rates for patients sustaining the reaction, which are important to safe and effective use of the drug, shall be expressed as provided under the ''Adverse Reactions'' section of the la-beling. (f) Precautions. Under this section heading, the labeling shall contain the following subsections as appropriate for the drug: (1) General. This subsection of the la- beling shall contain information re-garding any special care to be exer-cised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug, e.g., pre-cautions not required under any other specific section or subsection of the la-beling. (2) Information for patients. This sub- section must contain information nec-essary for patients to use the drug safe-ly and effectively (e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects). Any FDA-ap-proved patient labeling must be ref-erenced in this section and the full text of such patient labeling must be re- printed immediately following the last section of labeling or, alternatively, accompany the prescription drug label-ing. The type size requirement for the Medication Guide set forth in \u00a7208.20 of this chapter does not apply to the Medication Guide that is reprinted in or accompanying the prescription drug labeling unless such Medication Guide is to be detached and distributed to pa-tients in compliance with \u00a7208.24 of this chapter. (3) Laboratory tests. This subsection of the labeling shall identify any labora-tory tests that may be helpful in fol-lowing the patient's response or in identifying possible adverse reactions. If appropriate, information shall be provided on such factors as the range of normal and abnormal values ex-pected in the particular situation and the recommended frequency with which tests should be done before, dur-ing, and after therapy. (4)(i) Drug interactions. This sub- section of the labeling shall contain specific practical guidance for the phy-sician on preventing clinically signifi-cant drug/drug and drug/food inter-actions that may occur in vivo in pa-tients taking the drug. Specific drugs or classes of drugs with which the drug to which the labeling applies may interact in vivo shall be identified, and the mechanism(s) of the interaction shall be briefly described. Information in this subsection of the labeling shall be limited to that pertaining to clin-ical use of the drug in patients. Drug interactions supported only by animal or in vitro experiments may not ordi-narily be included, but animal or in vitro data may be used if shown to be clinically relevant. Drug incompati-bilities, i.e., drug interactions that may occur when drugs are mixed in vitro, as in a solution for intravenous administration, shall be discussed under the ''Dosage and Administra-tion'' section of the labeling rather than under this subsection of the label-ing. (ii) Drug/laboratory test interactions. This subsection of the labeling shall contain practical guidance on known interference of the drug with labora-tory tests. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 \u00a7 201.80 (5) Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impair- ment of fertility. This subsection of the labeling shall state whether long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential and, if so, the species and results. If repro-duction studies or other data in ani-mals reveal a problem or potential problem concerning mutagenesis or im-pairment of fertility in either males or females, the information shall be de-scribed. Any precautionary statement on these topics shall include practical, relevant advice to the physician on the significance of these animal findings. If there is evidence from human data that the drug may be carcinogenic or muta-genic or that it impairs fertility, this information shall be included under the ''Warnings'' section of the labeling. Also, under ''Precautions,'' the label-ing shall state: ''See 'Warnings' section for information on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fer-tility.'' (6) Pregnancy. This subsection of the labeling may be omitted only if the drug is not absorbed systemically and the drug is not known to have a poten-tial for indirect harm to the fetus. For all other drugs, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following in-formation: (i) Teratogenic effects. Under this heading the labeling shall identify one of the following categories that applies to the drug, and the labeling shall bear the statement required under the cat-egory: (a) If adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: ''Studies in pregnant women have not shown that ( name of drug ) increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if adminis-tered during the first ( second, third, or all) trimester( s) of pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, the pos-sibility of fetal harm appears remote. Because studies cannot rule out the possibility of harm, however, ( name of drug) should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.'' The labeling shall also contain a description of the human studies. If animal reproduction studies are available and they fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, the la- beling shall also state: ''Reproduction studies have been performed in ( kinds of animal (s)) at doses up to ( x) times the human dose and have revealed no evi-dence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ( name of drug ).'' The labeling shall also contain a descrip-tion of available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, develop-ment, and functional maturation of the child. (b) If animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the labeling shall state: '' Re-production studies have been per-formed in ( kind(s) of animal (s)) at doses up to ( x) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to (name of drug ). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal re-production studies are not always pre-dictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.'' If animal reproduc-tion studies have shown an adverse ef-fect (other than decrease in fertility), but adequate and well-controlled stud-ies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: ''Reproduction studies in ( kind(s) of animal (s)) have shown ( describe findings ) at (x) times the human dose. Studies in pregnant women, however, have not shown that ( name of drug ) increases the risk of abnormalities when adminis-tered during the first ( second, third, or all) trimester( s) of pregnancy. Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is re-mote, if the drug is used during preg-nancy. Nevertheless, because the stud-ies in humans cannot rule out the pos-sibility of harm, ( name of drug ) should be used during pregnancy only if clear-ly needed.'' The labeling shall also con-tain a description of the human studies and a description of available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Edition) \u00a7 201.80 (c) If animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, if there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and if the benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks, the labeling shall state: '' ( Name of drug ) has been shown to be teratogenic (or to have an embryocidal effect or other adverse ef-fect) in ( name (s) of species ) when given in doses ( x) times the human dose. There are no adequate and well-con-trolled studies in pregnant women. (Name of drug ) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.'' The labeling shall contain a de-scription of the animal studies. If there are no animal reproduction studies and no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, the labeling shall state: ''Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ( name of drug ). It is also not known whether ( name of drug) can cause fetal harm when ad- ministered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. ( Name of drug) should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.'' The la-beling shall contain a description of any available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child. (d) If there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reac-tion data from investigational or mar-keting experience or studies in hu-mans, but the potential benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks (for example, if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or seri-ous disease for which safer drugs can-not be used or are ineffective), the la-beling shall state: '' See 'Warnings' sec-tion.'' Under the ''Warnings'' section, the labeling states: ''( Name of drug ) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( Describe the human data and any pertinent animal data. ) If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.'' (e) If studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or if there is positive evidence of fetal risk based on adverse reaction reports from investigational or marketing ex-perience, or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in a pregnant woman clearly outweighs any possible benefit (for example, safer drugs or other forms of therapy are available), the la-beling shall state: '' See 'Contraindica-tions' section.'' Under ''Contraindica-tions,'' the labeling shall state: ''(Name of drug) may ( can) cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( Describe the human data and any pertinant animal data. ) (Name of drug) is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be ap-prised of the potential hazard to the fetus.'' (ii) Nonteratogenic effects. Under this heading the labeling shall contain other information on the drug's effects on reproduction and the drug's use dur-ing pregnancy that is not required spe-cifically by one of the pregnancy cat-egories, if the information is relevant to the safe and effective use of the drug. Information required under this heading shall include nonteratogenic effects in the fetus or newborn infant (for example, withdrawal symptoms or hypoglycemia) that may occur because of a pregnant woman's chronic use of the drug for a preexisting condition or disease. (7) Labor and delivery. If the drug has a recognized use during labor or deliv-ery (vaginal or abdominal delivery), whether or not the use is stated in the indications section of the labeling, this subsection of the labeling shall de-scribe the available information about the effect of the drug on the mother and the fetus, on the duration of labor or delivery, on the possibility that for-ceps delivery or other intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary, and the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child. If any information required under this subsection is unknown, this subsection of the labeling shall state that the in-formation is unknown. (8) Nursing mothers. (i) If a drug is ab- sorbed systemically, this subsection of VerDate Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.80 the labeling shall contain, if known, in- formation about excretion of the drug in human milk and effects on the nurs-ing infant. Pertinent adverse effects observed in animal offspring shall be described. (ii) If a drug is absorbed systemically and is known to be excreted in human milk, this subsection of the labeling shall contain one of the following statements, as appropriate. If the drug is associated with serious adverse reac-tions or if the drug has a known tumorigenic potential, the labeling shall state: ''Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ( name of drug ) (or, ''Be- cause of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for ( name of drug) in ( animal or human ) studies), a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the im-portance of the drug to the mother.'' If the drug is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential, the la-beling shall state: ''Caution should be exercised when ( name of drug ) is admin- istered to a nursing woman.'' (iii) If a drug is absorbed system- ically and information on excretion in human milk is unknown, this sub-section of the labeling shall contain one of the following statements, as ap-propriate. If the drug is associated with serious adverse reactions or has a known tumorigenic potential, the la-beling shall state: ''It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the po-tential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ( name of drug ) (or, ''Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for ( name of drug) in ( animal or human ) studies), a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the im-portance of the drug to the mother.'' If the drug is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential, the la-beling shall state: ''It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exer-cised when ( name of drug ) is adminis- tered to a nursing woman.'' (9) Pediatric use. (i) Pediatric popu- lation(s)/pediatric patient(s): For the purposes of paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(viii) of this section, the terms pediatric population(s) and pedi- atric patient(s) are defined as the pedi- atric age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neo-nates, infants, children, and adoles-cents. (ii) If there is a specific pediatric in- dication (i.e., an indication different from those approved for adults) that is supported by adequate and well-con-trolled studies in the pediatric popu-lation, it shall be described under the ''Indications and Usage'' section of the labeling, and appropriate pediatric dos-age information shall be given under the ''Dosage and Administration'' sec-tion of the labeling. The ''Pediatric use'' subsection shall cite any limita-tions on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific haz-ards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pe-diatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this sub-section of the labeling should be dis-cussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ''Clinical Pharmacology'' or ''Clinical Studies'' section. As appro-priate, this information shall also be contained in the ''Contraindications,'' ''Warnings,'' and elsewhere in the ''Precautions'' sections. (iii) If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indi-cation also approved for adults that are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they shall be summarized in the ''Pe-diatric use'' subsection of the labeling and discussed in more detail, if appro-priate, under the ''Clinical Pharma-cology'' and ''Clinical Studies'' sec-tions. Appropriate pediatric dosage shall be given under the ''Dosage and Administration'' section of the label-ing. The ''Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling shall also cite any limita-tions on the pediatric use statement, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun pediatric popu- lation (e.g., neonates), differences be-tween pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. As appropriate, this infor-mation shall also be contained in the ''Contraindications,'' ''Warnings,'' and elsewhere in the ''Precautions'' sec-tions. (iv) FDA may approve a drug for pe- diatric use based on adequate and well- controlled studies in adults, with other information supporting pediatric use. In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the dis-ease and the effects of the drug, both beneficial and adverse, are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult popu-lations to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric pa-tients. The additional information sup-porting pediatric use must ordinarily include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of appropriate dos-age. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in the pediatric population, data from other studies supporting the safe-ty or effectiveness of the drug in pedi-atric patients, pertinent premarketing or postmarketing studies or experi-ence, may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and effec-tively in pediatric patients. When a drug is approved for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with other information sup-porting pediatric use, the ''Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling shall contain either the following statement, or a reasonable alternative: ''The safe-ty and effectiveness of ( drug name ) have been established in the age groups l to l (note any limitations, e.g., no data for pediatric patients under 2, or only applicable to certain indications ap-proved in adults). Use of ( drug name ) in these age groups is supported by evi-dence from adequate and well-con-trolled studies of ( drug name ) in adults with additional data (insert wording that accurately describes the data sub-mitted to support a finding of substan-tial evidence of effectiveness in the pe-diatric population).'' Data summarized in the preceding prescribed statement in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if appro- priate, under the ''Clinical Pharma-cology'' or example, pediatric pharmaco-kinetic or pharmacodynamic studies and dose-response information should be described in the ''Clinical Pharma-cology'' section. Pediatric dosing in-structions shall be included in the ''Dosage and Administration'' section of the labeling. Any differences be-tween pediatric and adult responses, need for specific monitoring, dosing ad-justments, and any other information related to safe and effective use of the drug in pediatric patients shall be cited briefly in the ''Pediatric use'' sub-section and, as appropriate, in the ''Contraindications,'' ''Warnings,'' ''Precautions,'' and ''Dosage and Ad-ministration'' sections. (v) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for a par-ticular pediatric population, the ''Pe-diatric use'' subsection of the labeling shall contain an appropriate statement such as ''Safety and effectiveness in pe-diatric patients below the age of ( l) have not been established.'' If use of the drug in this pediatric population is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in this sub-section of the labeling, or, if appro-priate, the hazard shall be stated in the ''Contraindications'' or ''Warnings'' section of the labeling and this sub-section shall refer to it. (vi) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for any pediatric population, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following statement: ''Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been estab-lished.'' If use of the drug in premature or neonatal infants, or other pediatric subgroups, is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in this subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the ''Contraindications'' or ''Warn-ings'' section of the labeling and this subsection shall refer to it. (vii) If the sponsor believes that none of the statements described in para-graphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi) of this VerDate Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.80 section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide reasons for omis-sion of the statements and may pro-pose alternative statement(s). FDA may permit use of an alternative state-ment if FDA determines that no state-ment described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling and that the alternative state-ment is accurate and appropriate. (viii) If the drug product contains one or more inactive ingredients that present an increased risk of toxic ef-fects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups, a special note of this risk shall be made, generally in the ''Con-traindications,'' ''Warnings,'' or ''Pre-cautions'' section. (10) Geriatric use. (i) A specific geri- atric indication, if any, that is sup-ported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the geriatric population shall be described under the ''Indica-tions and Usage'' section of the label-ing, and appropriate geriatric dosage shall be stated under the ''Dosage and Administration'' section of the label-ing. The ''Geriatric use'' subsection shall cite any limitations on the geri-atric indication, need for specific moni-toring, specific hazards associated with the geriatric indication, and other in-formation related to the safe and effec-tive use of the drug in the geriatric population. Unless otherwise noted, in-formation contained in the ''Geriatric use'' subsection of the labeling shall pertain to use of the drug in persons 65 years of age and older. Data summa-rized in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if ap-propriate, under ''Clinical Pharma-cology'' or the ''Clinical Studies'' sec-tion. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in ''Contra-indications,'' ''Warnings,'' and else-where in ''Precautions.'' (ii) Specific statements on geriatric use of the drug for an indication ap-proved for adults generally, as distin-guished from a specific geriatric indi-cation, shall be contained in the ''Geriatric use'' subsection and shall reflect all information available to the sponsor that is relevant to the appro-priate use of the drug in elderly pa-tients. This information includes de-tailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-docu-mented studies obtained from a lit-erature search. Controlled studies in-clude those that are part of the mar-keting application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug applica-tion, new drug application, biological license application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applica-tions (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The ''Geriatric use'' subsection shall con-tain the following statement(s) or rea-sonable alternative, as applicable, tak-ing into account available information: (A) If clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ''Geriatric use'' subsection shall include the following statement: ''Clinical studies of (name of drug) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they re-spond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or car-diac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.'' (B) If clinical studies (including stud- ies that are part of marketing applica-tions and other relevant studies avail-able to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor's applica-tions) included enough elderly subjects to make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in safety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ''Geriatric use'' subsection shall con-tain the following statement: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of (name of drug), l percent were 65 and over, while l percent were 75 and over. (Alternatively, the labeling may state the total number of subjects included in the VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Edition) \u00a7 201.80 studies who were 65 and over and 75 and over.) No overall differences in safety or ef-fectiveness were observed between these sub-jects and younger subjects, and other re-ported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. (C) If evidence from clinical studies and other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific moni-toring or dosage adjustment, the ''Geriatric use'' subsection of the label-ing shall contain a brief description of observed differences or specific moni-toring or dosage requirements and, as appropriate, shall refer to more de-tailed discussions in the ''Contra-indications,'' ''Warnings,'' ''Dosage and Administration,'' or other sections of the labeling. (iii)(A) If specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out in the elderly, they shall be described briefly in the ''Geriatric use'' subsection of the labeling and in detail under the ''Clinical Pharmacology'' section. The ''Clinical Pharmacology'' section and ''Drug interactions'' of the ordinarily contain information on drug-disease and drug-drug inter-actions that is particularly relevant to the elderly, who are more likely to have concomitant illness and to utilize concomitant drugs. (B) If a drug is known to be substan- tially excreted by the in-clude the statement: ''This drug is known to be substantially ex- creted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in pa-tients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have de-creased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.'' (iv) If use of the drug in the elderly appears to cause a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in the ''Geri-atric use'' subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the ''Contraindications,'' ''Warnings,'' or ''Precautions'' section of the labeling, and the ''Geriatric use'' subsection shall refer to those sections. (v) Labeling under paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(iii) of this sec-tion may include statements, if they would be useful in enhancing safe use of the drug, that reflect good clinical practice or past experience in a par-ticular situation, e.g., for a sedating drug, it could be stated that: ''Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of (name of drug) and observed closely.'' (vi) If the sponsor believes that none of the requirements described in para-graphs (f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(v) of this section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide reasons for omis-sion of the statements and may pro-pose an alternative statement. FDA may permit omission of the statements if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appro-priate or relevant to the drug's label-ing. FDA may permit use of an alter-native statement if the agency deter-mines that such statement is accurate and appropriate. (g) Adverse Reactions. An adverse re- action is an undesirable effect, reason-ably associated with the use of the drug, that may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. (1) This section of the labeling shall list the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable. (2) In this listing, adverse reactions may be categorized by organ system, by severity of the reaction, by fre-quency, or by toxicological mecha-nism, or by a combination of these, as appropriate. If frequency information from adequate clinical studies is avail-able, the categories and the adverse re-actions within each category shall be listed in decreasing order of frequency. An adverse reaction that is signifi-cantly more severe than the other re-actions listed in a category, however, shall be listed before those reactions, regardless of its frequency. If frequency information from adequate clinical studies is not available, the categories VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.80 and adverse reactions within each cat- egory shall be listed in decreasing order of severity. The approximate fre-quency of each adverse reaction shall be expressed in rough estimates or or-ders of magnitude essentially as fol-lows: ''The most frequent adverse reac-tion(s) to ( name of drug ) is (are) ( list re- actions ). This (these) occur(s) in about (e.g., one-third of patients; one in 30 patients; less than one-tenth of pa-tients). Less frequent adverse reactions are ( list reactions ), which occur in ap- proximately (e.g., one in 100 patients). Other adverse reactions, which occur rarely, in approximately (e.g., one in 1,000 patients), are ( list reactions ).'' Per- cent figures may not ordinarily be used unless they are documented by ade-quate and well-controlled studies as de-fined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter, they are shown to reflect general experi-ence, and they do not falsely imply a greater degree of accuracy than actu-ally exists. (3) The ''Warnings'' section of the la- beling or, if appropriate, the ''Contra-indications'' section of the labeling shall identify any potentially fatal ad-verse reaction. (4) Any claim comparing the drug to which the labeling applies with other drugs in terms of frequency, severity, or character of adverse reactions shall be based on adequate and well-con-trolled studies as defined in \u00a7314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under \u00a7201.58 or \u00a7314.126(c) of this chapter. (h) Drug Abuse and Dependence. Under this section heading, the labeling shall contain the following subsections, as appropriate for the drug: (1) Controlled Substance. If the drug is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the schedule in which it is controlled shall be stated. (2) Abuse. This subsection of the la- beling shall be based primarily on human data and human experience, but pertinent animal data may also be used. This subsection shall state the types of abuse that can occur with the drug and the adverse reactions perti-nent to them. Particularly susceptible patient populations shall be identified. (3) Dependence. This subsection of the labeling shall describe characteristic effects resulting from both psycho-logical and physical dependence that occur with the drug and shall identify the quantity of the drug over a period of time that may lead to tolerance or dependence, or both. Details shall be provided on the adverse effects of chronic abuse and the effects of abrupt withdrawal. Procedures necessary to diagnose the dependent state shall be provided, and the principles of treating the effects of abrupt withdrawal shall be described. (i) Overdosage. Under this section heading, the labeling shall describe the signs, symptoms, and laboratory find-ings of acute overdosage and the gen-eral principles of treatment. This sec-tion shall be based on human data, when available. If human data are un-available, appropriate animal and in vitro data may be used. Specific infor-mation shall be provided about the fol-lowing: (1) Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings associated with an overdosage of the drug. (2) Complications that can occur with the drug (for example, organ toxicity or delayed acidosis). (3) Oral LD 50of the drug in animals; concentrations of the drug in biologic fluids associated with toxicity and/or death; physiologic variables influ-encing excretion of the drug, such as urine pH; and factors that influence the dose response relationship of the drug, such as tolerance. The pharmaco-kinetic data given in the ''Clinical Pharmacology'' section also may be referenced here, if applicable to overdoses. (4) The amount of the drug in a single dose that is ordinarily associated with symptoms of overdosage and the amount of the drug in a single dose that is likely to be life-threatening. (5) Whether the drug is dialyzable. (6) Recommended general treatment procedures and specific measures for support of vital functions, such as proven antidotes, gastric lavage, and forced diuresis. Unqualified rec-ommendations for which data are lack-ing with the specific drug or class of drugs, especially treatment using an-other drug (for example, central nerv-ous system stimulants, respiratory stimulants) may not be stated unless VerDate Sep<11>2014 \u00a7 201.80 specific data or scientific rationale ex- ists to support safe and effective use. (j) Dosage and Administration. This section of the labeling shall state the recommended usual dose, the usual dosage range, and, if appropriate, an upper limit beyond which safety and ef-fectiveness have not been established; dosages shall be stated for each indica-tion when appropriate. Dosing regi-mens must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not in-cluded in this section. This section shall also state the intervals rec-ommended between doses, the optimal method of titrating dosage, the usual duration of treatment, and any modi-fication of dosage needed in special pa-tient populations, e.g., in children, in geriatric age groups, or in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Specific tables or monographs may be included to clarify dosage schedules. Radiation dosimetry information shall be stated for both the patient receiving a radio-active drug and the person admin-istering it. This section shall also con-tain specific direction on dilution, preparation (including the strength of the final dosage solution, when pre-pared according to instructions, in terms of milligrams active ingredient per milliliter of reconstituted solution, unless another measure of the strength is more appropriate), and administra-tion of the dosage form, if needed, e.g., the rate of administration of paren-teral drug in milligrams per minute; storage conditions for stability of the drug or reconstituted drug, when im-portant; essential information on drug incompatibilities if the drug is mixed in vitro with other drugs; and the fol-lowing statement for parenterals: ''Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate mat-ter and discoloration prior to adminis-tration, whenever solution and con-tainer permit.'' (k) How Supplied. This section of the labeling shall contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is respon-sible. The information shall ordinarily include: (1) The strength of the dosage form, e.g., 10-milligram tablets, in metric system and, if the apothecary system is used, a statement of the strength is placed in parentheses after the metric designation; (2) The units in which the dosage form is ordinarily available for pre-scribing by practitioners, e.g., bottles of 100; (3) Appropriate information to facili- tate identification of the dosage forms, such as shape, color, coating, scoring, and National Drug Code; and (4) Special handling and storage con- ditions. (l) Animal Pharmacology and/or Animal Toxicology. In most cases, the labeling need not include this section. Signifi-cant animal data necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans shall ordinarily be included in one or more of the other sections of the label-ing, as appropriate. Commonly for a drug that has been marketed for a long time, and in rare cases for a new drug, chronic animal toxicity studies have not been performed or completed for a drug that is administered over pro-longed periods or is implanted in the body. The unavailability of such data shall be stated in the appropriate sec-tion of the labeling for the drug. If the pertinent animal data cannot be appro-priately incorporated into other sec-tions of the labeling, this section may be used. (m) ''Clinical Studies'' and ''Ref- erences''. These sections may appear in labeling in the place of a detailed dis-cussion of a subject that is of limited interest but nonetheless important. A reference to a specific important clin-ical study may be made in any section of the format required under \u00a7\u00a7201.56 and 201.57 if the study is essential to an understandable presentation of the available information. References may appear in sections of the labeling for-mat, other than the ''Clinical Studies'' or ''References'' section, in rare cir-cumstances only. A clinical study or reference may be cited in prescription drug labeling only under the following conditions: (1)(i) If the clinical study is cited in the labeling in place of a detailed dis-cussion of data and information con-cerning an indication for use of the drug, the clinical study must con-stitute an adequate and well-controlled study as described in \u00a7314.126(b) of this VerDate Sep<11>2014 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.100 chapter, except for biological products, and must not imply or suggest indica-tions or uses or dosing regimens not stated in the ''Indications and Usage'' or ''Dosage and Administration'' sec-tion. (ii) When prescription drug labeling must summarize or otherwise rely on a recommendation by an authoritative scientific body, or on a standardized methodology, scale, or technique, be-cause the information is important to prescribing decisions, the labeling may include a reference to the source of the information. (2) If the clinical study or reference is cited in the labeling in the place of a detailed discussion of data and infor-mation concerning a risk or risks from the use of the drug, the risk or risks shall also be identified or discussed in the appropriate section of the labeling for the drug.

A drug subject to the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the act shall be ex-empt from section 502(f)(1) if all the following conditions are met: (a) The drug is: (1)(i) In the possession of a person (or his agents or employees) regularly and lawfully engaged in the manufacture, transportation, storage, or wholesale distribution of prescription drugs; or (ii) In the possession of a retail, hos- pital, or clinic pharmacy, or a public health agency, regularly and lawfully engaged in dispensing prescription drugs; or (iii) In the possession of a practi- tioner licensed by law to administer or prescribe such drugs; and (2) It is to be dispensed in accordance with section 503(b) (b) The label of the drug bears: (1) The statement ''Rx only'' and (2) The recommended or usual dosage and (3) The route of administration, if it is not for oral use; and (4) The quantity or proportion of each active ingredient, as well as the information required by section 502 (d) and (e); and (5) If it is for other than oral use, the names of all inactive ingredients, ex-cept that: (i) Flavorings and perfumes may be designated as such without naming their components. (ii) Color additives may be des- ignated as coloring without naming specific color components unless the naming of such components is required by a color additive regulation pre-scribed in subchapter A of this chapter. (iii) Trace amounts of harmless sub- stances added solely for individual product identification need not be named. If it is intended for administra-tion by parenteral injection, the quan-tity or proportion of all inactive ingre-dients, except that ingredients added to adjust the pH or to make the drug isotonic may be declared by name and a statement of their effect; and if the vehicle is water for injection it need not be named. (6) An identifying lot or control num- ber from which it is possible to deter-mine the complete manufacturing his-tory of the package of the drug. (7) A statement directed to the phar- macist specifying the type of container to be used in dispensing the drug prod-uct to maintain its identity, strength, quality, and purity. Where there are standards and test procedures for de-termining that the container meets the requirements for specified types of con-tainers as defined in an official com-pendium, such terms may be used. For example, ''Dispense in tight, light-re-sistant container as defined in the Na-tional Formulary''. Where standards and test procedures for determining the types of containers to be used in dispensing the drug product are not in-cluded in an official compendium, the specific container or types of con-tainers known to be adequate to main-tain the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug products shall be described. For example, ''Dispense VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 in containers which of spec- ifications which clearly enable the dis-pensing pharmacist to select an ade-quate container)'': Provided, however, That in the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to accommo-date a label with sufficient space to bear all such information, but which are packaged within an outer container from which they are removed for dis-pensing or use, the information re-quired by paragraph (b) (2), (3), (5), and (7) of this section may be contained in other labeling on or within the package from which it is to be dispensed; the in-formation referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be placed on such outer container only; and the in-formation required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section may be on the crimp of the dispensing tube. The information required by this paragraph (b)(7) is not required for prescription drug products packaged in unit-dose, unit-of-use, on other packaging format in which the manufacturer's original package is de-signed and intended to be dispensed to patients without repackaging. (c)(1) Labeling on or within the pack- age from which the drug is to be dis-pensed bears adequate information for its use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and fre-quency and duration of administration, and any relevant hazards, contra-indications, side effects, and pre-cautions under which practitioners li-censed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the pur-poses for which it is intended, includ-ing all purposes for which it is adver-tised or represented; and (2) If the article is subject to section 505 of the act, the labeling bearing such information is the labeling authorized by the approved new drug application or required as a condition for the cer-tification or the exemption from cer-tification requirements applicable to preparations of insulin or antibiotic drugs. (d) Any labeling, as defined in section 201(m) of the act, whether or not it is on or within a package from which the drug is to be dispensed, distributed by or on behalf of the manufacturer, pack-er, or distributor of the drug, that fur-nishes or purports to furnish informa-tion for use or which prescribes, rec-ommends, or suggests a dosage for the use of the drug (other than dose infor-mation required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section and \u00a7201.105(b)(2) contains: (1) Adequate information for such use, including indications, effects, dos-ages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant warnings, hazards, contra-indications, side effects, and pre-cautions, under which practitioners li-censed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the pur-poses for which it is intended, includ-ing all conditions for which it is adver-tised or represented; and if the article is subject to section 505 of the act, the parts of the labeling providing such in-formation are the same in language and emphasis as labeling approved or permitted, under the provisions of sec-tion 505, and any other parts of the la-beling are consistent with and not con-trary to such approved or permitted la-beling; and (2) The same information concerning the ingredients of the drug as appears on the label and labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed. (3) The information required, and in the format specified, by \u00a7\u00a7201.56, 201.57, and 201.80. (e) All labeling described in para- graph (d) of this section bears con-spicuously the name and place of busi-ness of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, as required for the label of the drug under \u00a7201.1. (f) Reminder labeling which calls at- tention to the name of the drug prod-uct but does not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug product is exempted from the pro-visions of paragraph (d) of this section. This reminder labeling shall contain only the proprietary name of the drug product, if any; the established name of the drug product, if any; the estab-lished name of each active ingredient in the drug product; and, optionally, information relating to quantitative ingredient statements, dosage form, quantity of package contents, price, the name and address of the manufac-turer, packer, or distributor or other written, printed, or graphic matter containing no representation or sug-gestion relating to the drug product. If VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.105 the Commissioner finds that there is evidence of significant incidence of fa-talities or serious injury associated with the use of a particular prescrip-tion drug, he may withdraw this ex-emption by so notifying the manufac-turer, packer, or distributor of the drug by letter. Reminder labeling, other than price lists and catalogs sole-ly intended to convey price informa-tion including, but not limited to, those subject to the requirements of \u00a7200.200 of this chapter, is not per-mitted for a prescription drug product whose labeling contains a boxed warn-ing relating to a serious hazard associ-ated with the use of the drug product. Reminder labeling which is intended to provide consumers with information concerning the price charged for a pre-scription for a particular drug product shall meet all of the conditions con-tained in \u00a7200.200 of this chapter. Re-minder labeling, other than that sub-ject to the requirements of \u00a7200.200 of this chapter, is not permitted for a drug for which an announcement has been published pursuant to a review of the labeling claims for the drug by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Ef-ficacy Study Group, and for which no claim has been evaluated as higher than ''possibly effective.'' If the Com-missioner finds the circumstances are such that reminder labeling may be misleading to prescribers of drugs sub-ject to NAS/NRC evaluation, such re-minder labeling will not be allowed and the manufacturer, packer, or dis-tributor will be notified either in the publication of the conclusions on the effectiveness of the drug or by letter.

The causing of an exemption to expire shall be considered an act which results in such drug being misbranded unless it is disposed of under circumstances in which it ceases to be a drug or device. (b) The exemptions conferred by \u00a7\u00a7201.117, 201.119, 201.120, 201.122, and 201.125 shall continue until the drugs are used for the purposes for which VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.150 they are exempted, or until they are relabeled to comply with section 502(f)(1) of the act. If, however, the drug is converted, compounded, or manufactured into a dosage form lim-ited to prescription dispensing, no ex-emption shall thereafter apply to the article unless the dosage form is la-beled as required by section 503(b) and ''intended uses''. The words intended uses or words of similar import in \u00a7\u00a7201.5, 201.115, 201.117, 201.119, 201.120, and 201.122 refer to the objective intent of the persons legally responsible for the labeling of drugs. The intent is determined by such persons' expressions or may be shown by the circumstances sur-rounding the distribution of the arti-cle. This objective intent may, for ex-ample, be shown by labeling claims, ad-vertising matter, or oral or written statements by such persons or their representatives. It may be shown by the circumstances that the article is, with the knowledge of such persons or their representatives, offered and used for a purpose for which it is neither la-beled nor advertised. The intended uses of an article may change after it has been introduced into interstate com-merce by its manufacturer. If, for ex-ample, a packer, distributor, or seller intends an article for different uses than those intended by the person from whom he received the drug, such pack-er, distributor, or seller is required to supply adequate labeling in accordance with the new intended uses. But if a manufacturer knows, or has knowledge of facts that would give him notice, that a drug introduced into interstate commerce by him is to be used for con-ditions, purposes, or uses other than the ones for which he offers it, he is re-quired to provide adequate labeling for such a drug which accords with such other uses to which the article is to be put.

(a) Except as provided by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a drug which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or re-packed in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduc-tion into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling and packaging re-quirements of sections 501(b) and 502 (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of the act if: (1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce is the operator of the estab-lishment where such drug is to be proc-essed, labeled, or repacked; or (2) In case such person is not such op- erator, such shipment or delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed by and con-taining the post-office addresses of such person and such operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such drug in such establishment as will insure, if such specifications are followed, that such drug will not be adulterated or mis-branded within the meaning of the act upon completion of such processing, la-beling, or repacking.

(b) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a drug under para-graph (a)(1) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment, be-come void ab initio if the drug com-prising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so re-moved. (c) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a drug under para-graph (a)(2) of this section shall be-come void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by such para-graph (a)(2) of this section. (d) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a drug under para-graph (a)(2) of this section shall expire: (1) At the beginning of the act of re- moving such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establish-ment if the drug comprising such ship-ment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or (2) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such drug is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by such clause.

(a) Carbon dioxide, cyclopropane, ethylene, helium, and nitrous oxide gases intended for drug use are exempt-ed from the requirements of \u00a7201.100(b) (2), (3), and (c)(1) provided the labeling bears, in addition to any other infor-mation required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the following: (1) The warning statement ''Warn- ing\u2014Administration of (name of gas) may be hazardous or contraindicated. For use only by or under the super-vision of a licensed practitioner who is experienced in the use and administra-tion of (name of gas) and is familiar with the indications, effects, dosages, methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and with the haz-ards, contraindications, and side ef-fects and the precautions to be taken''; and (2) Any needed directions concerning the conditions for storage and warn-ings against the inherent dangers in the handling of the specific compressed gas. (b) This labeling exemption does not apply to mixtures of any one or more of these gases with oxygen or with each other. (c) Regulatory action may be initi- ated with respect to any article shipped within the jurisdiction of the Act contrary to the provisions of this section after 60 days following publica-tion of this section in the F EDERAL REGISTER . Subpart F\u2014Labeling Claims for Drugs in Drug Efficacy Study \u00a7 201.200 Disclosure of drug efficacy study evaluations in labeling and advertising. (a)(1) The National Academy of Sciences\u2014National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, has com-pleted an exhaustive review of labeling claims made for drugs marketed under new-drug and antibiotic drug proce-dures between 1938 and 1962. The results are compiled in ''Drug Efficacy Study, A Report to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs from the National Academy of Sciences (1969).'' As the report notes, this review has made ''an audit of the state of the art of drug usage that has been uniquely extensive in scope and uniquely intensive in time'' and is ap-plicable to more than 80 percent of the currently marketed drugs. The report further notes that the quality of the evidence of efficacy, as well as the quality of the labeling claims, is poor. Labeling and other promotional claims have been evaluated as ''effective,'' ''probably effective,'' ''effective but,'' and a report for each drug in the VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.200 study has been submitted to the Com- missioner. (2) The Food and Drug Administra- tion is processing the reports, seeking voluntary action on the part of the drug manufacturers and distributors in the elimination or modification of un-supported promotional claims, and ini-tiating administrative actions as nec-essary to require product and labeling changes. (3) Delays have been encountered in bringing to the attention of the pre-scribers of prescription items the con-clusions of the expert panels that re-viewed the promotional claims. (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that: (1) The failure to disclose in the la- beling of a drug and in other pro-motional material the conclusions of the Academy experts that a claim is ''ineffective,'' ''possibly effective,'' ''probably effective,'' or ''ineffective as a fixed combination,'' while labeling and promotional material bearing any such claim are being used, is a failure to disclose facts that are material in light of the representations made and causes the drug to be misbranded. (2) The Academy classification of a drug as other than ''effective'' for a claim for which such drug is rec-ommended establishes that there is a material weight of opinion among qualified experts contrary to the rep-resentation made or suggested in the labeling, and failure to reveal this fact causes such labeling to be misleading. (c) Therefore, after publication in the F EDERAL REGISTER of a Drug Efficacy Study Implementation notice on a pre-scription drug, unless exempted or oth-erwise provided for in the notice, all package labeling (other than the im-mediate container or carton label, un-less such labeling contains information required by \u00a7201.100(c)(1) in lieu of a package insert), promotional labeling, and advertisements shall include, as part of the information for practi-tioners under which the drug can be safely and effectively used, an appro-priate qualification of all claims evalu-ated as other than ''effective'' by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences\u2014National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, if such claims continue to be included in ei-ther the labeling or advertisements. However, this qualifying information will be required in advertisements only if promotional material is included therein for claims evaluated as less than ''effective'' or if such claims are included in the indications section of the portion of the advertisement con-taining the information required in brief summary by \u00a7202.1(e)(1) of this chapter. When, however, the Food and Drug Administration classification of such claim is ''effective'' (for example, on the basis of revision of the language of the claim or submission or existence of adequate data), such qualification is not necessary. When the Food and Drug Administration classification of the claim, as stated in the implementation notice, differs from that of the Acad-emy but is other than ''effective,'' the qualifying statement shall refer to this classification in lieu of the Academy's classification. (d) For new drugs and antibiotics, supplements to provide for revised la-beling in accord with paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted under the provisions of \u00a7314.70 and \u00a7514.8 of this chapter within 90 days after publi-cation of the implementation notice in the F EDERAL REGISTER or by May 15, 1972, for those drugs for which notices have been published and such labeling shall be put into use as soon as possible but not later than the end of the time period allowed for submitting supple-ments to provide for revised labeling. (e) Qualifying information required in drug labeling by paragraph (c) of this section in order to advise pre-scribers of a drug of the findings made by a panel of the Academy in evalu-ating a claim as other than ''effective'' shall be at least of the same size and color and degree of prominence as other printing in the labeling and shall be presented in a prominent box using one of the following formats and proce-dures: (1) In drug labeling the box state- ment may entirely replace the indica-tions section and be in the following format: INDICATIONS Based on a review of this drug by the Na- tional Academy of Sciences\u2014National Re-search Council and/or other information, VerDate as fol- lows: ''Probably'' effective: ( list ''Possibly'' effective: ( list or state in para- graph form ). Final classification of the less-than-effec- tive indications requires further investiga- tion. (2) Or the indication(s) for which the drug has been found effective may ap-pear outside the boxed statement and be followed immediately by the fol-lowing boxed statement: Based on a review of this drug by the National Academy of Sciences\u2014Na-tional Research Council and/or other information, FDA has classified the other indication(s) as follows: ''Probably'' effective: ( form ). ''Possibly'' effective: ( list or state in paragraph form ). Final classification of the less-than- effective indications requires further investigation. (3) In drug labeling (other than that which is required by \u00a7201.100(c)(1)) which may contain a promotional mes-sage, the promotional message shall be keyed to the boxed statement by the same means as those provided for ad-vertisements in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. (f) Qualifying information required in prescription drug advertising by para-graph (c) of this section shall contain a prominent boxed statement of the ad-vertised indication(s) and of the limita-tions of effectiveness using the same format, language, and emphasis as that required in labeling by paragraph (e) of this section. (1) The boxed statement shall appear in (or next to) the information required in brief summary by \u00a7202.1(e)(1) of this chapter and shall have prominence at least equal to that provided for other information presented in the brief sum-mary and shall have type size, cap-tions, color, and other physical charac-teristics comparable to the informa-tion required in the brief summary. (2) Less-than-effective indication(s) in the promotional message of an ad-vertisement which is a single page or less shall be keyed to the boxed state-ment by asterisk, by an appropriate statement, or by other suitable means providing adequate emphasis on the boxed statement. On each page where less-than-effective indication(s) appear in a mutiple page advertisement, an as-terisk shall be placed after the most prominent mention of the indi- cation(s); if the degree of prominence does not vary, an asterisk shall be placed after the first mention of the in-dication. The asterisk shall refer to a notation at the bottom of the page which shall state ''This drug has been evaluated as probably effective (or pos-sibly effective whichever is appro-priate) for this indication'' and ''See Brief Summary'' or ''See Prescribing Information,'' the latter legend to be used only if the advertisement carries the required information for profes-sional use as set forth in \u00a7201.100(c)(1). (3) For less-than-effective indications which are included in the advertise-ment only as a part of the information required in brief summary, the disclo-sure information shall appear in this portion of the advertisement in the same manner as is specified for label-ing in paragraph (e) of this section. (g) The Commissioner may find cir- cumstances are such that, while the elimination of claims evaluated as other than effective will generally eliminate the need for disclosure about such claims, there will be instances in which the change in the prescribing or promotional profile of the drug is so substantial as to require a disclosure of the reason for the change so that the purchaser or prescriber is not misled by being left unaware through the sponsor's silence that a basic change has taken place. The Food and Drug Administration will identify these situ-ations in direct correspondence with the drug promoters, after which the failure to make the disclosure will be regarded as misleading and appropriate action will be taken. [40 FR 13998, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended 11576, Mar. 29, 1990] VerDate \u00a7 201.301 Subpart G\u2014Specific Labeling Re- quirements for Specific Drug Products \u00a7 201.300 Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of glan-dular preparations. (a) Under date of December 4, 1941, in a notice to manufacturers of glandular preparations, the Food and Drug Ad-ministration expressed the opinion that preparations of inert glandular materials intended for medicinal use should, in view of the requirement of section 201(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (52 Stat. 1041; 21 U.S.C. 321(n)), be labeled with a statement of the material fact that there is no scientific evidence that the articles contain any therapeutic or physiologically active constituents. Numerous preparations of such inert glandular materials were subsequently marketed with disclaimers of the type suggested. The term inert glandular ma- terials means preparations incapable of exerting an action or effect of some significant or measurable benefit in one way or another, i.e., in the diag-nosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or in affecting the structure or any function of the body. (b) Manufacturers have heretofore taken advantage of \u00a7201.100 permitting omission of directions for use when the label bears the prescription legend. Section 201.100(c) requires that the la-beling of the drug, which may include brochures readily available to licensed practitioners, bear information as to the use of the drug by practitioners li-censed by law to administer it. Obvi-ously, information adequate for the use of an inert glandular preparation is not available to practitioners licensed by law. (c) The Department of Health and Human Services is of the opinion that inert glandular materials may not be exempted from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the act that they bear adequate directions for use; and, accordingly, that their labeling must include among other things, represen-tations as to the conditions for which such articles are intended to be used or as to the structure or function of the human body that they are intended to affect. Since any such representations offering these articles for use as drugs would be false or misleading, such arti-cles will be considered to be mis-branded if they are distributed for use as drugs. (d) The amended regulations provide also that in the case of drugs intended for parenteral administration there shall be no exemption from the require-ment that their labelings bear ade-quate directions for use. Such inert glandular materials for parenteral use are therefore subject to the same com-ment as applies to those intended for oral administration. \u00a7 201.301 Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of estro-genic hormone preparations. Some drug preparations fabricated wholly or in part from estradiol and la-beled as to potency in terms of inter-national units or in terms of inter-national units of estrone activity have been marketed. The international unit of the estrus-producing hormone was established by the International Con- ference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones at London, England, on Au-gust 1, 1932. This unit was defined as ''the specific estrus-producing activity contained in 0.1 gamma ( = 0.0001 mg.) of the standard'' hydroxyketonic hor-mone found in urine (estrone). The International Conference declared that it did not recommend the determina-tion of the activity of nonhydroxyketonic forms of estrogenic hormones in units of estrone because of the varying ratios between the activity of such nonhydroxyketonic estrogenic hormones and estrone, when measured by different methods on test animals. There is no international unit for measuring the activity of estradiol and no accepted relationship between its activity and that of estrone, either in test animals or in humans. The dec-laration of potency of estradiol in terms of international units or in terms of international units of estrone activity is therefore considered mis-leading, within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 352(a). The declaration of the es-tradiol content of an estrogenic hor-mone preparation in terms of weight is considered appropriate. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun \u00a7 201.302 Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of drugs for internal use which contain min-eral oil. (a) In the past few years research studies have altered medical opinion as to the usefulness and harmfulness of mineral oil in the human body. These studies have indicated that when min-eral oil is used orally near mealtime it interferes with absorption from the di-gestive tract of provitamin A and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K, and consequently interferes with the utili-zation of calcium and phosphorus, with the result that the user is left liable to deficiency diseases. When so used in pregnancy it predisposes to hemor-rhagic disease of the newborn. (b) There is accumulated evidence that the indiscriminate administration of mineral oil to infants may be fol-lowed by aspiration of the mineral oil and subsequent ''lipoid pneumonia.'' (c) In view of these facts, the Depart- ment of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act a drug for oral ad-ministration consisting in whole or in part of mineral oil, the labeling of which encourages its use in pregnancy or indicates or implies that such drug is for administration to infants. (d) It is also this Department's view that the act requires the labelings of such drugs to bear a warning against consumption other than at bedtime and against administration to infants. The following form of warning is sug-gested: ''Caution: To be taken only at bedtime. Do not use at any other time or administer to infants, except upon the advice of a physician.'' (e) This statement of interpretation does not in any way exempt mineral oil or preparations containing mineral oil from complying in all other respects with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \u00a7 201.303 Labeling of drug prepara- tions containing significant propor-tions of wintergreen oil. (a) Because methyl salicylate (win- tergreen oil) manifests no toxicity in the minute amounts in which it is used as a flavoring, it is mistakenly re-garded by the public as harmless even when taken in substantially larger amounts. Actually, it is quite toxic when taken in quantities of a teaspoon-ful or more. Wintergreen oil and prep-arations containing it have caused a number of deaths through accidental misuse by both adults and children. Children are particularly attracted by the odor and are likely to swallow these products when left within reach. (b) To safeguard against fatalities from this cause, the Department of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act any drug containing more than 5 percent methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil), the labeling of which fails to warn that use otherwise than as directed therein may be dangerous and that the article should be kept out of reach of children to prevent accidental poi-soning. (c) This statement of interpretation in no way exempts methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil) or its preparations from complying in all other respects with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \u00a7 201.304 Tannic acid and barium enema preparations. (a) It has become a widespread prac- tice for tannic acid to be added to bar-ium enemas to improve X-ray pictures. Tannic acid is capable of causing di-minished liver function and severe liver necrosis when absorbed in suffi-cient amounts. The medical literature reports a number of deaths associated with the addition of tannic acid to bar-ium enemas. There is a lack of sci-entific evidence to establish the condi-tions, if any, under which tannic acid is safe and effective for use in enemas. Tannic acid for rectal use to enhance X-ray visualization is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. (b) In view of the hazards involved when tannic acid is used in barium en-emas, any shipments of tannic acid la-beled to come within the exemptions under 502(f) of the Act containing such phrases as: ''Caution: For processing, Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.305 use only'' will be regarded by the Com- missioner of Food and Drugs as mis-branded within the meaning of section 502(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless the label and the labeling bear conspicuously a warning to the effect: '' Warning\u2014 Not for use in enemas.'' (c) Any tannic acid intended for use by man and found within the jurisdic-tion of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act labeled contrary to this section after 60 days from the date of its publication in the F EDERAL REG- ISTER may be made for human use; warnings. (a) Accumulating reports have been received by the Food and Drug Admin-istration and have appeared in the medical literature of severe paradox-ical bronchoconstriction associated with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations in the treatment of bronchial asthma and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders. The cause of this paradoxical reaction is unknown; it has been ob-served, however, that patients have not responded completely to other forms of therapy until use of the isoproterenol inhalation preparation was discon-tinued. In addition, sudden unexpected deaths have been associated with the excessive use of isoproterenol inhala-tion preparations. The mechanism of these deaths and their relationship, if any, to the cases of severe paradoxical bronchospasm are not clear. Cardiac arrest was noted in several of these cases of sudden death. (b) On the basis of the above informa- tion and after discussion with and con-currence of the Respiratory and Anes-thetic Drugs Advisory Committee for Food and Drug Administration, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs con-cludes that in order for the labeling of such drugs to bear adequate informa-tion for their safe use, as required by \u00a7201.100, such labeling must include the following: Warning: Occasional patients have been re- ported to develop severe paradoxical airway resistance with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations. The cause of this refractory state is unknown. It is advisable that in such instances the use of this preparation be discontinued imme-diately and alternative therapy instituted, since in the reported cases the patients did not respond to other forms of therapy until the drug was withdrawn. Deaths have been reported following exces- sive use of isoproterenol inhalation prepara-tions and the exact cause is unknown. Car-diac arrest was noted in several instances. (c)(1) The Commissioner also con- cludes that in view of the manner in which these preparations are self-ad-ministered for relief of attacks of bron-chial asthma and other chronic bron-chopulmonary disorders, it is necessary for the protection of users that warn-ing information to patients be included as a part of the label and as part of any instructions to patients included in the package dispensed to the patient as fol-lows: Warning: Do not exceed the dose prescribed by your physician. If difficulty in breathing persists, contact your physician imme-diately. (2) The warning on the label may be accomplished (i) by including it on the immediate container label with a statement directed to pharmacists not to remove the label or (ii) by including in the package a printed warning with instructions to pharmacists to place the warning on the container prior to dispensing. (d) The marketing of isoproterenol inhalation preparations may be contin-ued if all the following conditions are met: (1) Within 30 days following the date of publication of this section in the F EDERAL REGISTER : (i) The label and labeling of such preparations shipped within the juris-diction of the act are in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this sec-tion. (ii) The holder of an approved new- drug application for such preparation submits a supplement to his new-drug application to provide for appropriate labeling changes as described in para-graphs (b) and (c) of this section. (2) Within 90 days following the date of publication of this section in the F EDERAL REGISTER , the manufacturer, VerDate Sep<11>2014 Edition) \u00a7 packer, or distributor of any drug con- taining isoproterenol intended for in-halation for which a new-drug approval is not in effect submits a new-drug ap-plication containing satisfactory infor-mation of the kinds required by \u00a7314.50 of this chapter, including appropriate labeling as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. (3) The applicant submits additional information required for the approval of the application as may be specified in a written communication from the Food and Drug Administration. (e) After 270 days following expira- tion of said 90 days, regulatory pro-ceedings based on section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may be initiated with regard to any such drug shipped within the jurisdic-tion of the act for which an approved new-drug application is not in effect. [40 FR 13998, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 55 FR 11576, Mar. 29, 1990] \u00a7 201.306 Potassium salt preparations intended for oral ingestion by man. (a) The Food and Drug Administra- tion will initiate no regulatory action with respect to the continued mar-keting of coated tablets containing po-tassium chloride or other potassium salts which supply 100 milligrams or more of potassium per tablet provided all the following conditions are met: (1) Within 30 days from the date of publication of this statement of policy in the F EDERAL REGISTER : (i) The labeling of the drug bears the prescription caution statement quoted in section 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; (ii) The labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its use by practitioners in accord with the ''full disclosure'' labeling re-quirements of \u00a7201.100 of this chapter, including the following warning state-ment: Warning \u2014There have been several reports, published and unpublished, concerning non-specific small-bowel lesions consisting of ste-nosis, with or without ulceration, associated with the administration of enteric-coated thiazides with potassium salts. These lesions may occur with enteric-coated potassium tablets alone or when they are used with nonenteric-coated thiazides, or certain other oral diuretics. These small-bowel lesions have caused obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation. Surgery was frequently required and deaths have occurred. Based on a large survey of physicians and hospitals, both United States and foreign, the incidence of these lesions is low, and a causal relation-ship in man has not been definitely estab-lished. Available information tends to impli-cate enteric-coated potassium salts, al-though lesions of this type also occur spon-taneously. Therefore, coated potassium-con-taining formulations should be administered only when indicated, and should be discon-tinued immediately if abdominal pain, dis-tention, nausea, vomiting, or gastro-intestinal bleeding occur. Coated potassium tablets should be used only when adequate dietary supplementation is not practicable. (Although the warning statement in- cludes references to enteric-coated po-tassium salt preparations, it applies to any capsule or coated tablet of a potas-sium salt intended for oral ingestion without prior dilution with an ade-quate volume of liquid to preclude gas-trointestinal injury.) (iii) Any other labeling or additional advertising for the drug conforms to the labeling described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7202.1 and 201.100 of this chapter. (2) Within 90 days from the date of publication of this statement of policy in the F EDERAL REGISTER , the manu- facturer, packer, or distributor of the drug shall submit a new-drug applica-tion containing satisfactory informa-tion of the kind required by \u00a7314.50 of this chapter, with appropriate labeling as described in this paragraph. (b) The Food and Drug Administra- tion may initiate regulatory pro-ceedings after 30 days from the date of publication of this section, with re-spect to the marketing of uncoated tablets containing potassium chloride or other potassium salts which supply 100 milligrams or more of potassium per tablet or with respect to liquid preparations containing potassium chloride or other potassium salts which supply 20 milligrams or more of potas-sium per milliliter, labeled or intended for human use, unless all the following conditions are met: (1) The labeling of the drug bears the prescription statement quoted in sec-tion 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.307 (2) The labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its use by practitioners in accord with the ''full disclosure'' labeling re- quirements of \u00a7201.100 of this chapter, including a recommendation that pa-tients be directed to dissolve any such tablets in an appropriate amount of liquid and to dilute any such liquid preparations adequately to assure against gastrointestinal injury associ-ated with the oral ingestion of con-centrated potassium salt preparations.

(a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that multiple container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution available in the marketplace have caused consumer confusion and appear to have been in-volved in several consumer deaths. So-dium phosphates oral solution has been marketed in 45-milliliter (mL), 90-mL, and 240-mL container sizes. The 45-mL and 90-mL container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution are often rec-ommended and prescribed by physi-cians for bowel cleansing prior to sur-gery and diagnostic procedures of the colon. Sodium phosphates oral solution (adult dose 20 mL to 45 mL) is also used as an over-the-counter (OTC) laxative for the relief of occasional constipa-tion. Accidental overdosing and deaths have occurred because the 240-mL con-tainer was mistakenly used instead of the 45-mL or 90-mL container. The Food and Drug Administration is lim-iting the amount of sodium phosphates oral solution to not more than 90 mL (3 ounces (oz)) per OTC container because of the serious health risks associated with the ingestion of larger than in-tended doses of this product. Further, because an overdose of either oral or rectal enema sodium phosphates can cause an electrolyte imbalance, addi-tional warning and direction state-ments are required for the safe use of any OTC laxative drug product con-taining sodium phosphates. (b) Any OTC drug product for lax- ative or bowel cleansing use containing sodium phosphates as an active ingre-dient when marketed as described in paragraph (a) of this section is mis-branded within the meaning of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act unless packaged and labeled as follows: (1) Package size limitation for so- dium phosphates oral solution: Con-tainer shall not contain more than 90 mL (3 oz). (2) Warnings. The following sentences shall appear in boldface type as the first statement under the heading ''Warnings.'' (i) Oral dosage forms. ''Taking more than the recommended dose in 24 hours can be harmful.'' (ii) Rectal enema dosage forms. ''Using more than one enema in 24 hours can be harmful.'' (3) Directions\u2014(i) The labeling of all orally or rectally administered OTC drug products containing sodium phosphates shall contain the following directions in boldface type imme-diately the dosage informa-tion: ''Do not'' (''take'' ''use'') ''more unless directed by a doctor. See Warnings.'' (ii) For products containing dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate identified in \u00a7334.16(d) mar-keted as a solution. Adults and chil-dren 12 years of age and over: Oral dos-age is dibasic sodium phosphate 3.42 to 7.56 grams (g) and monobasic sodium phosphate 9.1 to 20.2 g (20 to 45 mL di-basic sodium phosphate/monobasic so-dium phosphate oral solution) as a sin-gle daily dose. ''Do not take more than 45 mL (9 teaspoonfuls or 3 tablespoon-fuls) in a 24-hour period.'' Children 10 and 11 years of age: Oral dosage is diba-sic sodium phosphate 1.71 to 3.78 g and monobasic sodium phosphate 4.5 to 10.1 g (10 to 20 mL dibasic sodium phos-phate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. ''Do not take more than 20 mL (4 tea-spoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.'' Chil-dren 5 to 9 years of age: Oral dosage is dibasic sodium phosphate 0.86 to 1.89 g and monobasic sodium phosphate 2.2 to 5.05 g (5 to 10 mL dibasic sodium phos-phate/monobasic sodium phosphate oral solution) as a single daily dose. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun \u00a7 take (2 tea- spoonfuls) in a 24-hour period.'' Chil-dren under 5 years of age: ask a doctor. (c) After June 22, 1998, for package size limitation and September 18, 1998, for labeling in accord with paragraph (b) of this section, any such OTC drug product initially introduced or ini-tially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, or any such drug product that is repackaged or relabeled after these dates regardless of the date the product was manufactured, ini-tially introduced, or initially delivered for introduction into interstate com-merce, that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory ac-tion. and directions for use for over-the- counter sale. (a) It is estimated that each year about 500,000 accidental poisonings occur in the United States and result in approximately 1,500 deaths, of which over 400 are children. In the emergency treatment of these poisonings, ipecac syrup is considered the emetic of choice. The immediate availability of this drug for use in such situations is critical, since rapid treatment may be the difference between life and death. The restriction of this drug to prescrip-tion sale limits its availability in emergencies. On the other hand, it is the consensus of informed medical opinion that ipecac syrup should be used only under medical supervision in the emergency treatment of poisonings. In view of these facts, the question of whether ipecac syrup la-beled as an emergency treatment for use in poisonings should be available over the counter has been controver-sial. (b) In connection with its study of this problem, the Food and Drug Ad-ministration has obtained the views of medical authorities. It is the unani-mous recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the American Medical Association, and the Medical Advisory Board of the Food and Drug Administration that ip-ecac syrup in 1 fluid ounce containers be permitted to be sold without pre-scription so that it will be readily available in the household for emer-gency treatment of poisonings, under medical supervision, and that the drug be appropriately packaged and labeled for this purpose. (c) In view of the above recommenda- tions, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that it is in the interest of the public health for ipecac syrup to be available for sale without prescription, provided that it is pack-aged in a quantity of 1 fluid ounce (30 milliliters), and its label bears, in addi-tion to other required label informa-tion, the following, in a prominent and conspicuous manner: (1) A statement conspicuously boxed and in red letters, to the effect: ''For emergency use to cause vomiting in poisoning. Before using, call physician, the Poison Control Center, or hospital emergency room immediately for ad-vice.'' (2) A warning to the effect: ''Warn- ing\u2014Keep out of reach of children. Do not use in unconscious persons. Ordi-narily, this drug should not be used if strychnine, corrosives such as alkalies (lye) and strong acids, or petroleum distillates such as kerosine, gasoline, coal oil, fuel oil, paint thinner, or cleaning fluid have been ingested.'' (3) Usual dosage: 1 tablespoon (15 mil- liliters) in persons over of age. \u00a7 201.309 Acetophenetidin (phen- acetin)-containing preparations; necessary warning statement. (a) In 1961, the Food and Drug Admin- istration, pursuant to its statutory re-sponsibility for the safety and effec-tiveness of drugs shipped in interstate commerce, began an active investiga-tion of reports of possible toxic effects and renal damage due to misuse of the drug acetophenetidin. This study led to the decision that there was probable cause to conclude that misuse and pro-longed use of the drug were in fact re-sponsible for kidney lesions and dis-ease. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in December 1963, appointed an ad hoc Advisory Committee of Inquiry on Possible Nephrotoxicity Associated With the Abuse of Acetophenetidin (Phenacetin)-Containing Preparations. This committee, composed of scientists VerDate Sep<11>2014 Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.314 in the fields of pharmacology and med- icine, on April 23, 1964, submitted its findings and conclusions in the matter and recommended that all acetophe-netidin (phenacetin)-containing prep-arations bear a warning as provided in section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. (b) On the basis of the studies made by the Food and Drug Administration and the report of the Advisory Com-mittee, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is nec-essary for the protection of users that the label and labeling of all acetophe-netidin (phenacetin)-containing prep-arations bear a warning statement to the following effect: ''Warning\u2014This medication may damage the kidneys when used in large amounts or for a long period of time. Do not take more than the recommended dosage, nor take regularly for longer than 10 days without consulting your physician.'' \u00a7 201.310 Phenindione; labeling of drug preparations intended for use by man. (a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that phenindione, a synthetic anticoagulant drug, has caused a number of cases of agranulocytosis (with two fatalities). There are also reports implicating the drug in cases of hepatitis and hyper-sensitivity reactions. In view of the po-tentially serious effects found to be as-sociated with preparations of this drug intended for use by man, the Commis-sioner of Food and Drugs will regard such preparations as misbranded with-in the meaning of section 502(f) (1) and (2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act, unless the label and label-ing on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed, and any other labeling furnishing or pur-porting to furnish information for use of the drug, bear a conspicuous warn-ing statement to the following effect: ''Warning: Agranulocytosis and hepa-titis have been associated with the use of phenindione. Patients should be in-structed to report promptly prodromal symptoms such as marked fatigue, chill, fever, and sore throat. Periodic blood studies and liver function tests should be performed. Use of the drug should be discontinued if leukopenia occurs or if evidence of hyper-sensitivity, such as dermatitis or fever, appears.'' (b) Regulatory action may be initi- ated with respect to preparations of phenindione intended for use by man found within the jurisdiction of the act on or after November 25, 1961, unless such preparations are labeled in ac-cordance with paragraph (a) of drug products. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate should be listed on the label of a drug product as epsom salt, which is its common or usual name. \u00a7 201.313 Estradiol labeling. The article presently recognized in The National Formulary under the heading ''Estradiol'' and which is said to be ''17-cis-beta estradiol'' is the same substance formerly recognized in the United States Pharmacopeia under the designation ''Alpha Estradiol.'' The substance should no longer be referred to in drug labeling as ''Alpha Estra-diol.'' The Food and Drug Administra-tion would not object to label ref-erences to the article as simply ''Es-tradiol''; nor would it object if the label of a preparation containing this substance referred to the presence of ''Estradiol (formerly known as Alpha Estradiol).'' \u00a7 201.314 Labeling of drug prepara- tions containing salicylates. (a) The label of any oral drug prepa- ration intended for sale without pre-scription and which contains any salic-ylate ingredient (including aspirin, sal-icylamide, other salicylates, and com-binations) must conspicuously bear, on a clearly contrasting background, the warning statement: ''Keep out of reach of children [highlighted in bold type]. In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away,'' or ''Keep out of reach of chil-dren [highlighted in bold type],'' except that if the article is an aspirin prepara-tion, it shall bear the first of these VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Edition) \u00a7 201.314 warning statements. Such a warning statement is required for compliance with section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and is intended to guard against accidental poisonings. Safety closures that pre-vent access to the drug by young chil-dren are also recommended to guard against accidental poisonings. (b) Effervescent preparations and preparations containing para- aminosalicylate as the only salicylate ingredient are exempted from this la-beling requirement. (c) Aspirin tablets sold as such and containing no other active ingredients, except tablets which cannot be readily subdivided into a child's dose because of their coating or size, should always bear dosage directions for each age group down to 3 years of age, with a statement such as ''For children under 3 years of age, consult your physician.'' It is recommended that: (1) Aspirin tablets especially made for pediatric use be produced only in 1 14-grain size to reduce the hazard of errors in dosage; (2) By June 1, 1967, manufacturers and distributors of 114-grain size aspi- rin tablets discontinue the distribution of such tablets in retail containers con-taining more than 36 tablets, to reduce the hazard of accidental poisoning; (3) The flavoring of 5-grain aspirin tablets or other ''adult aspirin tablets'' be discontinued; and (4) Labeling giving undue emphasis to the pleasant flavor of flavored aspi-rin tablets be discontinued. (d) Salicylate preparations other than aspirin tablets sold as such may, at the option of the distributor, be la-beled for use by adults only. If their la-beling and advertising clearly offer them for administration to adults only. (e)(1) It is the obligation of the dis- tributor who labels a salicylate prepa-ration for administration to children to make certain that the article is suitable for such use and labeled with adequate directions for use in the age group for which it is offered, but in no case should such an article bear direc-tions for use in children under 3 years of age. If the directions provide for ad-ministration to children as young as 3 years of age, the label should bear the statement, ''For children under 3 years of age consult your physician.'' How- ever, if the directions provide for ad-ministration to children only of an age greater than 3 years (for example, the dosage instructions provide for admin-istration of the article to children only down to age 6), the label should bear a statement such as, ''For younger chil-dren consult your physician.'' (2) A statement such as, ''For chil- dren under 3 years of age consult your physician'' or ''For younger children consult your physician'' is not required on the label of an article clearly of-fered for administration to adults only. (f) If the labeling or advertising of a salicylate preparation offers it for use in arthritis or rheumatism, the label and labeling should clearly state that the beneficial effects claimed are lim-ited to: ''For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of arthritis and rheumatism.'' The qualifying phrase ''for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains'' should appear with the same degree of prominence and conspicuousness as the phrase ''arthri-tis and rheumatism''. The label and la-beling should bear in juxtaposition with such directions for use con-spicuous warning statements to the ef-fect: ''Caution: If pain persists for more than 10 days, or redness is present, or in conditions affecting children under 12 years of age, consult a physician im-mediately.'' The salicylate dosage should not exceed 60 grains in a 24-hour period or 10 grains in a 4-hour period. If the article contains other analgesics, the salicylate dosage should be appro-priately reduced. (g)(1) The label of any drug con- taining more than 5 percent methyl sa-licylate (wintergreen oil) should bear a conspicuous warning such as: ''Do not use otherwise than as directed.'' These drug products must also include the ''Keep out of reach of children'' warn-ing and the accidental ingestion warn-ing as required in \u00a7330.1(g) of this chap-ter. (2) If the preparation is a counter- irritant or rubefacient, it should also bear a caution such as, ''Caution: Dis-continue use if excessive irritation of the skin develops. Avoid getting into the eyes or on mucous membranes.'' (See also \u00a7201.303.) VerDate Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.316 (h)(1) The labeling of orally or rec- tally administered over-the-counter drug products containing aspirin or nonaspirin salicylates as active ingre-dients subject to this paragraph is re-quired to prominently bear the fol-lowing warning: ''Reye's syndrome [subheading in bold type]: Children and teenagers who have or are recovering from chicken pox or flu-like symptoms should not use this product. When using this product, if changes in behav-ior with nausea and vomiting occur, consult a doctor because these symp-toms could be an early sign of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious illness.'' (2) This warning statement shall ap- pear on the immediate container label-ing. In cases where the immediate con-tainer is not the retail package, the re-tail package also must bear the warn-ing statement. In addition, the warning statement shall appear on any labeling that contains warnings and, in such cases, the warning statement shall be the first warning statement under the heading ''Warnings.'' (3) Over-the-counter drug products subject to this paragraph and labeled solely for use by children (pediatric products) shall not recommend the product for use in treating flu or chick-en pox. (4) Any product subject to paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2), and (h)(3) of this section that is not labeled as required by these paragraphs and that is initially intro-duced or initially delivered for intro-duction into interstate commerce after the following dates is misbranded under sections 201(n) and 502(a) and (f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act. (i) Compliance by October 18, 2004, for OTC drug products containing aspirin and nonaspirin salicylates as an active ingredient and marketed under a new drug application or abbreviated new drug application. (ii) Compliance by April 19, 2004, for OTC antidiarrheal and overindulgence drug products that contain bismuth subsalicylate as an active ingredient and have annual sales greater than $25,000. (iii) Compliance by April 18, 2005, for OTC antidiarrheal and overindulgence drug products that contain bismuth subsalicylate as an active ingredient and have annual sales less than $25,000. (iv) Compliance dates for all other OTC drug products containing aspirin and nonaspirin salicylates as an active ingredient and marketed under an OTC drug monograph (for internal analge-sic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, or for menstrual drug products) will be established when the final monographs for those products are published in a future issue of the F EDERAL REGISTER . In the interim, these products should continue to be labeled with the previous Reye's syn-drome warning that appears in para-graph (h)(1) of this section. [40 FR 13998, Mar. 27, 1985, as amended at 51 FR 8182, Mar. 7, 1986; 53 FR FR FR for minor sore throats; suggested warn-ing. The Food and Drug Administration has studied the problem of the labeling of lozenges or troches containing a local anesthetic, chewing gum con-taining aspirin, various mouth washes and gargles and other articles sold over the counter for the relief of minor irri-tations of the mouth or throat. It will not object to the labeling of suitable articles of this type ''For the tem-porary relief of minor sore throats'', provided this is immediately followed in the labeling with a warning state-ment in prominent type essentially as follows: ''Warning\u2014Severe or per-sistent sore throat or sore throat ac-companied by high fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting may be serious. Consult physician promptly. Do not use more than 2 days or administer to children under 3 years of age unless di-rected by physician.'' \u00a7 201.316 Drugs with thyroid hormone activity for human use; required warning. (a) Drugs with thyroid hormone ac- tivity have been promoted for, and con-tinue to be dispensed and prescribed for, use in the treatment of obesity, al-though their safety and effectiveness for that use have never been estab-lished. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Edition) \u00a7 201.317 (b) Drugs for human use with thyroid hormone activity are misbranded with-in the meaning of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless their labeling bears the fol-lowing boxed warning at the beginning of the ''Warnings'' section: Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other therapeutic agents, have been used for the treatment of obesity. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal re-quirements are ineffective for weight re-duction. Larger doses may produce seri-ous or even life-threatening manifesta-tions of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympatho-mimetic amines such as those used for their and cardiotonic drugs for human use in oral dosage forms; required warn-ing. (a) Digitalis and related cardiotonic drugs for human use in oral dosage forms have been promoted for, and con-tinue to be dispensed and prescribed for, use in the treatment of obesity, al-though their safety and effectiveness for that use have never been estab-lished. (b) Digitalis and related cardiotonic drugs for human use in oral dosage forms are misbranded within the mean-ing of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless their la-beling bears the following boxed warn- ing at the beginning of the ''Warnings'' section: Digitalis alone or with other drugs has been used in the treatment of obesity. This use of digoxin or other digitalis glycosides is unwarranted. Moreover, since they may cause potentially fatal arrhythmias or other adverse effects, the use of these drugs in the treatment of obesity is dangerous. (c) This section does not apply to dig- oxin products for oral use, which shall be labeled according to the require-ments of \u00a7310.500 of this plantago seed polycarbophil tragacanth, and xan-than gum) as active ingredients; re-quired warnings and directions. (a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that esophageal obstruction and asphyxia-tion have been associated with the in-gestion of water-soluble gums, hydro-philic gums, and hydrophilic mucilloids plantago seed (psyllium), polycarbophil, tragacanth, and xan-than gum. Esophageal obstruction and asphyxiation due to orally-adminis-tered drug products containing water- soluble gums, hydrophilic gums, and hydrophilic mucilloids as active ingre-dients are significant health risks when these products are taken without adequate fluid or when they are used by individuals with esophageal nar-rowing or dysfunction, or with dif-ficulty in swallowing. Additional label-ing is needed for the safe and effective use of any OTC drug product for human use containing a water-soluble gum, hydrophilic gum, or hydrophilic mucilloid as an active ingredient when marketed in a dry or incompletely hy-drated form to include, but not limited to, the following dosage forms: Cap-sules, granules, powders, tablets, and wafers. Granular dosage forms con-taining psyllium are not generally rec-ognized as safe and effective as OTC laxatives (see \u00a7310.545(a)(12)(i)(B) of this chapter) and may not be marketed without an approved new drug applica-tion because the warnings and direc-tions in paragraph (b) of this section have been found inadequate for these products.

(a) The aluminum content of large volume parenteral (LVP) drug products used in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy must not exceed 25 micrograms per liter ( g/L). (b) The package insert of LVP's used in TPN therapy must state that the drug product contains no more than 25 g/L of aluminum. This information must be contained in the ''Pre-cautions'' section of the labeling of all large volume parenterals used in TPN therapy. (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum level of aluminum present at expiry must be stated on the immediate container label of all small volume parenteral (SVP) drug products and pharmacy bulk packages (PBPs) used in the prep-aration of TPN solutions. The alu-minum content must be stated as fol-lows: ''Contains no more than ll g/L of aluminum.'' The immediate con-tainer label of all SVP's and PBP's that are lyophilized powders used in the preparation of TPN solutions must contain the following statement: ''When reconstituted in accordance with the package insert instructions, the concentration of aluminum will be no more than ll g/L.'' This max- imum level of aluminum must be stat-ed as the highest of: (1) The highest level for the batches produced during the last 3 years; (2) The highest level for the latest five batches, or (3) The maximum historical level, but only until completion of produc-tion of the first five batches after July 26, 2004.

The warning must state: WARNING: This product contains alu- minum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is im-paired. Premature neonates are particularly VerDate Sep<11>2014 Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.325 at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain alu-minum. Research indicates that patients with im- paired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 g/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone tox-icity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. (f) Applicants and manufacturers must use validated assay methods to determine the aluminum content in parenteral drug products. The assay methods must comply with current good manufacturing practice require-ments. Applicants must submit to the Food and Drug Administration valida-tion of the method used and release data for several batches. Manufactur-ers of parenteral drug products not subject to an approved application must make assay methodology avail-able to FDA during inspections. Hold-ers of pending applications must sub-mit an amendment under \u00a7314.60 or \u00a7314.96 of this chapter. [65 FR 4110, Jan. 26, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 70691, Nov. 26, 201.325 for vaginal contraceptive and spermicide use containing nonoxynol 9 as the active ingre-dient; required warnings and label-ing information. (a) Studies indicate that use of vag- inal contraceptive drug products con-taining nonoxynol 9 does not protect against infection from the human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or against the trans-mission of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Studies also indicate that use of vaginal contraceptive drug products containing nonoxynol 9 can increase vaginal irritation, such as the disruption of the vaginal epithelium, and also can cause epithelial disruption when used in the rectum. These effects may increase the risk of transmission of the AIDS virus (HIV) from an in-fected partner. Therefore, consumers should be warned that these products do not protect against the trans-mission of the AIDS virus (HIV) or other STDs, that use of these products can increase vaginal and rectal irrita-tion, which may increase the risk of getting the AIDS virus (HIV) from an HIV infected partner, and that the products are not for rectal use. Con-sumers should also be warned that these products should not be used by persons who have HIV/AIDS or are at high risk for HIV/AIDS. (b) The labeling of OTC vaginal con- traceptive and spermicide drug prod-ucts containing nonoxynol 9 as the ac-tive ingredient, whether subject to the ongoing OTC drug review or an ap-proved drug application, must contain the following warnings under the head-ing ''Warnings,'' in accordance with 21 CFR 201.66. (1) ''[bullet] For vaginal use only [bullet] Not for rectal (anal) use'' [both warnings in bold (2) [in bold prod-uct not [word in bold type] protect against HIV/AIDS or other STDs and may increase the risk of get-ting HIV from an infected partner''. (3) ''Do not use'' [in bold type] if you or your sex partner has HIV/AIDS. If you do not know if you or your sex partner is infected, choose another form of birth control''. (4) ''When using this product [in bold type] [optional, bullet] you may get vaginal irritation (burning, itching, or a rash)''. (5) ''Stop use and ask a doctor if [in bold type] [optional, bullet] you or your partner get burning, itching, a rash, or other irritation of the vagina or penis''. (c) The labeling of this product states under the ''Other information'' section of the Drug Facts labeling in accord-ance with \u00a7201.66(c)(7), ''[bullet] when used correctly every time you have sex, latex condoms greatly reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. (d) The labeling of this product in- cludes the following statements either on the outside container or wrapper of the retail package, under the ''Other information'' section of the Drug Facts labeling in accordance with \u00a7201.66(c)(7), or in a package insert: VerDate Sep<11>2014 (1) ''[bullet] studies have raised safe- ty concerns that products containing the spermicide nonoxynol 9 can irritate the vagina and rectum. Sometimes this irritation has no symptoms. This irri- tation may increase the risk of getting HIV/AIDS from an infected partner''. (2) ''[bullet] you can use nonoxynol 9 for birth control with or without a dia-phragm or condom if you have sex with only one partner who is not infected with HIV and who has no other sexual partners or HIV risk factors''. (3) ''[bullet] use a latex condom with- out nonoxynol 9 if you or your sex partner has HIV/AIDS, multiple sex partners, or other HIV risk factors''. (4) ''[bullet] ask a health professional if you have questions about your best birth control and STD prevention methods''. (e) Any drug product subject to this section that is not labeled as required and that is initially introduced or ini-tially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce after June 19, 2008, is misbranded under section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 352), is a new drug under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355), and is subject to regulatory action.

The solar simulator output should be measured before and after each phototest or, at a minimum, at the beginning and end of each test day. This radiometer should be cali-brated using side-by-side comparison with the spectroradiometer (using the weighting factors determined accord-ing to paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) of this sec-tion) at the time of the annual spectroradiometric measurement of the solar simulator as described in paragraph (i)(1)(iv) of this section. (iii) Operation. A solar simulator should have no significant time-related fluctuations (within 20 percent) in radi-ation emissions after an appropriate warm-up time and demonstrate good beam uniformity (within 20 percent) in the exposure plane. The delivered dose to the UV exposure site must be within 10 percent of the expected dose. (iv) Periodic measurement. To ensure that the solar simulator delivers the appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, the emission spectrum of the solar sim-ulator should be measured at least an-nually with an appropriate and accu-rately calibrated spectroradiometer system (results should be traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Technology). In addition, the solar simulator must be recalibrated if there is any change in the lamp bulb or the optical filtering components ( i.e., fil- ters, mirrors, lenses, collimating de-vices, or focusing devices). Daily solar simulator radiation intensity should be monitored with a broadband radiom-eter with a response weighted to match the erythema action spectrum in ISO 17166 CIE S 007/E VerDate Drug Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.327 reference action spectrum and standard erythema dose,'' which is incorporated by reference in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. If a lamp must be replaced due to failure or aging during a phototest, broadband device readings consistent with those obtained for the original calibrated lamp will suffice until measurements can be performed with the spectroradiometer at the ear-liest possible opportunity. (2) SPF standard \u2014(i) Preparation. The SPF standard should be a formulation containing 7-percent padimate O and 3- percent oxybenzone. C OMPOSITION OF THE PADIMATE O/OXYBENZONE SPF Percent Purified water USP ..................................... QS1 1Quantity sufficient to make 100 grams. Step 1.

Use the following high performance liquid chroma-tography (HPLC) procedure to verify the concentrations of padimate O and oxybenzone in the SPF standard: (A) Instrumentation. (1) Equilibrate a suitable liquid chromatograph to the following or equivalent conditions: (i) Column .. C-18, 250 millimeters (mm) length, 4.6 mm inner diameter (5 mi-crons) (ii) Mobile Phase.85:15:0.5 methanol: water: acetic acid (iii) Flow Rate.1.5 milliliters (mL) per minute (iv) Tem- perature.Ambient (v) Detector UV spectrophotometer at 308 nanometers (vi) Attenu- ation.As needed (2) Use HPLC grade reagents for mo- bile phase. (B) Preparation of the HPLC reference standard. (1) Weigh 0.50 gram (g) of oxybenzone USP reference standard into a 250-mL volumetric flask. Dis-solve and dilute to volume with isopropanol. Mix well. (2) Weigh 0.50 g of padimate O USP reference standard into a 250-mL volu-metric flask. Dissolve and dilute to volume with isopropanol. Mix well. (3) Pipet 3.0 mL of the oxybenzone so- lution and 7.0 mL of the padimate O so-lution into a 100-mL volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with isopropanol and mix well. (C) HPLC system suitability. (1) Make three replicate 10-microliter injections of the HPLC reference standard (de-scribed in paragraph (i)(2)(ii)(B) of this section). The relative standard devi-ation in peak areas should not be more than 2.0 percent for either oxybenzone or padimate O. (2) Calculate the resolution (R) be- tween the oxybenzone and padimate O peaks from one chromatogram as fol-lows: Where t o= retention time for oxybenzone tp= retention time for padimate O Wo= oxybenzone peak width at baseline Wp= padimate O peak width at baseline VerDate Sep<11>2014 Edition) \u00a7 201.327 If the resolution (R) is less than 3.0, ad- just the mobile phase or replace the column. (D) SPF standard assay \u2014(1) The SPF standard is diluted to the same con-centration as the HPLC reference standard according to the following steps: (i) Step 1. Weigh 1.0 g of the SPF standard (described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section) into a 50-mL volumetric flask. (ii) Step 2. Add approximately 30 mL of isopropanol and heat with swirling until contents are evenly dispersed. (iii) Step 3. Cool to room temperature (15 to 30 \u00b0C) and dilute to volume with isopropanol.

(2)(i) Inject 10-microliter of diluted SPF standard from paragraph (i)(2)(D)( 1) of this section and calculate the amount of oxybenzone and padimate O as follows: (ii) The percent of oxybenzone and padimate O in the SPF standard should be between 95 and 105. (3) Test subjects \u2014(i) Number of subjects. A test panel should include enough subjects to produce a minimum of 10 valid test results. A maximum of three subjects may be rejected from this panel based on paragraph (i)(5)(v)) of this section. (ii) Medical history. (A) Obtain a med- ical history from each subject with em-phasis on the effects of sunlight on the subject's skin. Determine that each subject is in good general health with skin type I, II, or III as follows: (1) Always burns easily; never tans (sensitive). (2) Always burns easily; tans mini- mally (sensitive). (3) Burns moderately; tans gradually (light brown) (normal). (4) Burns minimally; always tans well (moderate brown) (normal). (5) Rarely burns; tans profusely (dark brown) (insensitive). (6) Never burns; deeply pigmented (insensitive). (B) Skin type is based on first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure after a winter season of no sun exposure. Determine that each subject is not taking topical or systemic medication that is known to alter responses to UV radiation. De- termine that each subject has no his-tory of sensitivities to topical products and/or abnormal responses to sunlight, such as a phototoxic or photoallergic response. (iii) Physical examination. Conduct a physical examination to determine the presence of sunburn, suntan, scars, ac-tive dermal lesions, and uneven skin tones on the areas of the back to be tested. A suitable source of low power UVA, such as a Woods lamp, is helpful in this process. If any of these condi-tions are present, the subject is not qualified to participate in the study. The presence of nevi, blemishes, or moles will be acceptable if, in the phy-sician's judgment, they will neither compromise the study nor jeopardize a subject's safety. Subjects with dysplastic nevi should not be enrolled. Excess hair on the back is acceptable if the hair is clipped. Shaving is unac-ceptable because it may remove a sig-nificant portion of the stratum corneum and temporarily alter the skin's response to UV radiation. (iv) Informed consent. Obtain legally effective written informed consent from all test subjects. VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Administration, HHS \u00a7 201.327 (4) Sunscreen application. (i) Test site. Test sites are locations on each sub-ject's back, between the beltline and the shoulder blades (scapulae) and lat-eral to the midline, where skin re-sponses to UV radiation are deter- mined. Responses on unprotected skin (no test material applied) and pro-tected skin (sunscreen test product(s) or SPF standard applied) are deter-mined at separate unprotected and pro-tected test sites, respectively. Test sites should be randomly located in a blinded manner. Each test site should be a minimum of 30 square centimeters and outlined with indelible ink. (ii) Test subsite. Test subsites are the locations to which UV radiation is ad-ministered within a test site. At least five test subsites should receive UV doses within each test site. Test subsites should be at least 0.5 square centimeters (cm 2) in area and should be separated from each other by at least 0.8 cm. Each test subsite should be out-lined with indelible ink. (iii) Applying test materials. Apply the sunscreen test product and the SPF standard at 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm 2) to their respective test sites. Use a finger cot compatible with the sunscreen to spread the prod-uct as evenly as possible. (iv) Waiting period. Wait at least 15 minutes after applying a sunscreen product before exposing the test sites to UV radiation as described in para-graph (i)(5)) of this section. For water resistant sunscreen products, proceed with the water resistance testing pro-cedure described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section after waiting at least 15 minutes. (5) UV exposure \u2014(i) Definition of mini- mal erythema dose (MED). The minimal erythema dose (MED) is the smallest UV dose that produces perceptible red-ness of the skin (erythema) with clear-ly defined borders at 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The MED for unpro-tected skin (MED u) is determined on a test site that does not have sunscreen applied. The MED for protected skin (MED p) is determined on a test site that has sunscreen applied. An MED pis determined for the SPF standard (ssMED p). An MED pis determined for the sunscreen test product (tpMED p). (ii) UV exposure for initial MED u. For each test subject, administer a series of UV radiation doses expressed as J/m 2- eff (as determined according to para-graph (a)(2) of this section) to the test subsites within an unprotected test site using an accurately calibrated solar simulator. Select doses that are a geometric series represented by 1.25 n (i.e., each dose is 25 percent greater than the previous dose). (iii) UV exposure for final MED u, ssMED p, and tpMED p. For each subject, determine the final MED u, ssMED p, and tpMED pby administering a series of five UV doses to the appropriate test sites. The middle dose (X) in each of these dose series ( i.e., the third dose) should equal the initial MED utimes the expected SPF. Note that the ex-pected SPF equals 1 and 16.3 for the final MED uand ssMED p, respectively. The remaining UV doses in the series depend upon the expected SPF value of the sunscreen test product(s). For products with an expected SPF less than 8, administer UV doses that increase by 25 percent with each suc-cessive dose ( i.e., 0.64X, 0.80X, 1.00X, 1.25X, and 1.56X). For products with an expected SPF from 8 to 15, administer UV doses that increase by 20 percent with each successive dose ( i.e., 0.69X, 0.83X, 1.00X, 1.20X, and 1.44X). For prod-ucts with an expected SPF higher than 15, administer UV doses that increase by 15 percent with each successive dose (i.e., 0.76X, 0.87X, 1.00X, 1.15X, and 1.32X). (iv) Evaluation of test subsites. In order that the person who evaluates the test subsites is not biased, he/she should not be the same person who ap-plied the sunscreen drug product to the test site or administered the UV doses. After UV doses are administered, all immediate responses should be re-corded. These may include an imme-diate darkening or tanning, typically grayish or purplish in color, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes; an immediate reddening at the subsite, due to heat-ing of the skin, which fades rapidly; and an immediate generalized heat re-sponse, spreading beyond the subsite, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes. After the immediate responses are noted, each subject should shield the exposed area from further UV radiation until VerDate Sep<11>2014 13:32 Jun Edition) \u00a7 201.327 the MED is determined. Determine the MED 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. Because erythema is evaluated 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure, the final MED u, ssMED p, and tpMED pare typi- cally determined the day following de-termination of the initial MED u. Evalu- ate the erythema responses of each test subsite using either tungsten or warm white fluorescent lighting that pro-vides at least 450 lux of illumination at the test site. For the evaluation, the test subject should be in the same posi-tion as when the test site was irradi-ated. (v) Invalid test data. Reject test data for a test subject if erythema is not present on either the unprotected or protected test sites; or erythema is present at all subsites; or the responses are inconsistent with the series of UV doses administered; or the subject was noncompliant ( e.g., the subject with- draws from the test due to illness or work conflicts or does not shield the exposed testing sites from further UV radiation until the MED is deter-mined). (6) Determination of SPF. (i) Calculate an SPF value for each test subject (SPF i) as follows: (ii) Calculate the mean and the standard deviation (s) from the SPF ivalues. Calculate the standard error (SE), which equals s/ n (where n equals the number of subjects who pro-vided valid test results). Obtain the t value from Student's t distribution table corresponding to the upper 5-per-cent point with n\u20141 degrees of free-dom. Determine the labeled SPF value, which equals the largest whole number less than In order for the SPF determination of a test product to be considered valid, the SPF value of the SPF standard should fall within the standard devi-ation range of the expected SPF ( i.e., 16.3 \u00b13.43). (7) Determination of water resistance. The following procedure should be per-formed in an indoor fresh water pool, whirlpool, and/or hot tub maintained at 23 to 32 \u00b0C. Fresh water is clean drinking water that meets the stand-ards in 40 CFR part 141. The pool and air temperature and the relative hu-midity should be recorded. (i) Water resistance (40 minutes). The labeled SPF should be determined after 40 minutes of water immersion using the following procedure: (A) Step 1: Apply the sunscreen as de- scribed in paragraph (d) of this section. (B) Step 2: Perform moderate activ- ity in water for 20 minutes. (C) Step 3: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s). (D) Step 4: Perform moderate activ- ity in water for 20 minutes. (E) Step 5: Allow test sites to dry completely without toweling. (F) Step 6: Apply the SPF standard as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Step 1. Expose test sites to UV doses as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (ii) Water resistance (80 minutes). The labeled SPF should be determined after 80 minutes of water immersion using the following procedure: (A) Step 1: Apply the sunscreen as de- scribed in paragraph (d) of this section. (B) Step 2: Perform moderate activ- ity in water for 20 minutes. (C) Step 3: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s). (D) Step 4: Perform moderate activ- ity in water for 20 minutes. (E) Step 5: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s). (F) Step 6: Perform moderate activ- ity in water for 20 minutes. (G) Step 7: Rest out of water for 15 minutes. Do not towel test site(s). (H) Step 8: Perform moderate activ- ity in water for 20 minutes. (I) Step 9: Allow test sites to dry completely without toweling. (J) Step 10: Apply the SPF standard as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (K) Step 11: Expose test sites to UV doses as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (j) Broad spectrum test procedure \u2014(1) UV Spectrometry. (i) Plate. Use optical- VerDate HHS \u00a7 201.327 grade polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates suitable for UV trans-mittance measurements. The plate should be roughened on one side to a three dimensional surface topography measure (Sa) between 2 and 7 microm-eters and must have a rectangular ap-plication area of at least 16 square cen-timeters (with no side shorter than 4 cm). (ii) Sample holder. The sample holder should hold the PMMA plate in a hori-zontal position to avoid flowing of the sunscreen drug product from one edge of the PMMA plate to the other. It should be mounted as close as possible to the input optics of the spectrometer to maximize capture of forward scat-tered radiation. The sample holder should be a thin, flat plate with a suit-able aperture through which UV radi-ation can pass. The PMMA plate should be placed on the upper surface of the sample holder with the roughened side facing up. (iii) Light source. The light source should produce a continuous spectral distribution of UV radiation from 290 to 400 nanometers. (iv) Input optics. Unless the spectrom- eter is equipped with an integrating sphere, an ultraviolet radiation dif-fuser should be placed between the sample and the input optics of the spectrometer. The diffuser will be con-structed from any UV radiation trans-parent material ( e.g., Teflon \u00aeor quartz). The diffuser ensures that the radiation received by the spectrometer is not collimated. The spectrometer input slits should be set to provide a bandwidth that is less than or equal to 1 nanometer. (v) Dynamic range of the spectrometer. The dynamic range of the spectrometer should be sufficient to measure trans-mittance accurately through a highly absorbing sunscreen product at all ter-restrial solar UV wavelengths (290 to 400 nm). (2) Sunscreen product application to PMMA plate. The accuracy of the test depends upon the application of a pre-cisely controlled amount of sunscreen product with a uniform distribution over the PMMA plate. The product is applied at 0.75 mg per square centi-meter to the roughened side of the PMMA plate. The sunscreen product should be applied in a series of small dots over the entire PMMA plate and then spread evenly using a gloved fin-ger. Spreading should be done with a very light spreading action for approxi-mately 30 seconds followed by spread-ing with greater pressure for approxi-mately 30 seconds. The plate should then be allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes in the dark before the pre-irra-diation described in paragraph (c) of this section. (3) Sunscreen product pre-irradiation. To account for lack of photostability, apply the sunscreen product to the PMMA plate as described in paragraph (b) of this section and then irradiate with a solar simulator described in sec-tion 352.70(b) of this chapter. The irra-diation dose should be 4 MEDs which is equivalent to an erythemal effective dose of 800 J/m 2(i.e., 800 J/m2-eff). (4) Calculation of mean transmittance values. After pre-irradiation described in paragraph (c) of this section, mean transmittance values should be deter-mined for each wavelength over the full UV spectrum (290 to 400 nano-meters). The transmittance values should be measured at 1 nanometer in-tervals. Measurements of spectral irra-diance transmitted for each wave-length through control PMMA plates coated with 15 microliters of glycerin (no sunscreen product) should be ob-tained from at least 5 different a minimum of 5 measurements of spec-tral irradiance transmitted for each wavelength through the PMMA plate covered with the sunscreen product will be similarly obtained after pre-ir-radiation mean transmittance for each wavelength, is the ratio of the mean of the C( ) val- ues to the mean of the P( ) values, as follows: Where n 5 VerDate Sep<11>2014 I (4-1-16 Edition) Pt. 201, App. A (5) Calculation of mean absorbance val- ues. (i) Mean transmittance values, are converted into mean absorbance values, at each wavelength by taking the nega-tive logarithm of the mean transmit-tance value as follows: (ii) The calculation yields 111 monochromatic absorbance values in 1 nanometer increments from 290 to 400 nanometers. (6) Number of plates. For each sun- screen product, mean absorbance val-ues should be determined from at least three individual PMMA plates. Because paragraph (d) of this section requires at least 5 measurements per plate, there should be a total of at least 15 measurements. (7) Calculation of the critical wave- length. The critical wavelength is iden- tified as the wavelength at which the integral of the spectral absorbance curve reaches 90 percent of the integral over the UV spectrum from 290 to 400 nm. The following equation defines the critical wavelength: Where c = critical wavelength A() = mean absorbance at each wavelength d = wavelength interval between measure- ments A mean critical wavelength of 370 nm or greater is classified as broad spec-trum protection.
