It is more subtle, less tangible but can be sensed, experienced and interacted with. Over thousands of years our energy body has been studied, explored and given frameworks so that we can understand it more with our minds and learn how tending to it can help us live a more flowing, balanced and healthier life. You may have heard some of these theories and frameworks, such as the Chakra System from India or The Meridians from Traditional Chinese Medicine for example. These are energy centres or 'channels' that flow through the physical body connecting us to the essence of life and the earth. When energy flows freely through these channels then we move through life in a flowing way, with all we need to meet any life challenges and to feel fulfilled. When these channels become disrupted or blocked, through emotional or physical shock / stress / trauma, it can manifest as feeling that we are 'stuck' in life, feel disconnected, emotionally out of balance or perhaps physically unwell. So how does Energy Healing help? Energy Healing sessions create an environment where these energy blocks or disrupted energy pathways can be released and rebalanced. As an Energy Healer I am able to tune into your energy body to sense where healing is needed and connect you with the ever present healing life energy needed to bring you back into balance. What happens in an Energy Healing Session When I meet you for your Energy Healing session we will talk through the reasons you came for a session and any intentions you have. You are then invited to lie or sit comfortably and I will create the healing space for life energy to flow to where it is needed to support your physical, emotional, energetic and spiritual body. I may gently place my hands on your body or may not touch you at all and just stand or sit near to you. You may feel energy flowing through your body, or see colours or lights when you have your eyes closed. Feelings/emotions may come up or you may simply rest into a deep restful space/seem as if you are sleeping. All is really welcome and I am here to hold space for you with whatever arises. We will have time at the end to share what came up for you. Why Choose Energy Healing? - You may be feeling disconnected emotionally from yourself/others/life? - Perhaps you are struggling with low mood, anxiety or stress? - You may be feeling 'stuck in a rut' or unable to move forward in life? - Maybe you have experienced a big life event which has been a shock / caused stress / grief and you would like support as you journey through this? - Maybe you have ended a relationship in your life and feel ready to release any energetic ties/connection that may remain in your energy field? - As part of self care you may want to balance your energy body to help you move through life in a balanced way (much like we exercise to support our physical body)? - You may be experiencing a physical health concern that does not seem to get better despite trying everything and you are curious to see if Energy Healing could help things move forward? - Perhaps you are living with a chronic health condition and need some gentle support? Whatever you are experiencing in life, my Energy Healing sessions are here to support you. I aim to create the perfect space for you to rest deeply, re-connect with yourself and get the most out of our work together. I offer one to one Energy Healing sessions in-person in London (In the centres I work from in Camden and Crouch End), online and distant/remote sessions when the Energy Healing session is given at an agreed time and followed up with a phone call. Read more about me as a practitioner [here](https://www.soletransformations.co.uk/about-felicity-bevell/) and read more about my own journey with Energy Healing below. My journey with Energy Healing When I was about 12 years old, an energy healer came to our home. They came to give a healing session to my mother who was living with a chronic health condition at the time. I vividly remember feeling a kinship with this healer. I quietly observed how they stood, their hands raised just above my mother's shoulders, and there was such a sense stillness, peace and presence. After they left, I went to my mother and said 'I can do this for you too'. I placed my hands on her shoulders and felt some kind of electric current of energy flowing through my body, through my hands and into her being. From then on, over the years, I would give my own style of 'healing sessions' to friends and family, to support them physically, emotionally or spiritually (anything from alleviating back pain, reducing stress, supporting people through grief.. and even curing hangovers when at university!). Whenever I experienced a sense of feeling a bit 'stuck' in life, or had been through a challenging time, I would book an energy healing session with a practitioner and always feel a clearing happening or a sense of 'returning home to myself'. Like I am able to breathe deeply again and take the next steps in life with confidence. In 2007 I graduated as a Reflexologist and found over the years that clients tend to describe me as a 'Healer'. In recent years a new way of working has been gradually emerging and that healing energy that I channelled in my younger years is ready to be shared in a new way, through one to one Energy Healing sessions. I studied with Source Awakened Healing to give a framework for bringing my Energy Healing sessions to the wider community. I look forward to supporting you to find your centre again, to feel rebalanced and in flow with all of life. "}
