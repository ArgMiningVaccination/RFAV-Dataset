Here are some foods that can help. To boost vitamin C, a nutrient that supports immunity, snack on bell pepper slices. With the [COVID-19 pandemic](/infectious-diseases/covid-19/) still raging, it has never been more important to focus on [immune system strength](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/vaccines-immunity-protection/), especially when you have a condition like type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, may be at a higher risk for serious health problems if infected by the novel [coronavirus](https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/). Time to make your health a top priority and [armor up](https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/can-a-supplement-protect-me-against-the-new-coronavirus/). In addition to well-studied [immune [immune system](https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/ways-to-keep-your-immune-system-healthy/) by adding nutrient-rich, [low-carbohydrate](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/diet/keto-paleo-atkins-which-low-carb-diet-best-diabetes/) foods to your plate that will also keep your [A1C](/type-2-diabetes/treatment/ways-lower-your-a1c/) on target. The [American Diabetes Association (ADA)](https://www.diabetes.org/nutrition/understanding-carbs/carb-counting) emphasizes that [carb counting](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/diet/carb-counting-101/) can help people with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar, especially when injectable insulin is being used. Everyone's [carb](https://www.everydayhealth.com/carbohydrates/guide/) goals are different \u2014 it ultimately depends on your weight, age, activity level, and whether you are taking any medication. On average, though, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/eat-well/diabetes-and-carbohydrates.html) advises that people with diabetes get about 45 percent of their calories from carbs, and that most women need about 45 to 60 grams (g) per meal, while most men need about 60 to 75 g per meal. Because everyone's nutrition and carb needs can be different, talk with your healthcare team about the right eating approach for you. Then fill your plate accordingly with any of the following diabetes-friendly and disease-fighting foods. RELATED: [The Latest News on COVID-19](/infectious-diseases/covid-19/) Chickpeas Provide Satiating Fiber and Immune-Boosting Zinc Protein is essential for strengthening the immune system, as it works with key immune-boosting micronutrients like vitamins A, D, and E, as well as [zinc](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/zinc/), iron, and [selenium](/drugs/selenium), says [Julie Cunningham, MPH, RD](https://juliecunninghamrd.com/), a certified diabetes care and education specialist in Hendersonville, North Carolina. With that in mind, consider the humble chickpea, a [plant-based source of protein](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/best-plant-based-sources-of-protein/) that is also [a powerhouse when it comes to zinc](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/best-food-sources-zinc/). A \u00bd cup serving has 1 milligram (mg) of zinc, according to the [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/784271/nutrients), which is about 9 percent of the daily value (DV). White blood cells need zinc to function, according to a [review published in December 2016 in the Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003986116300741). What's more, zinc is a boon to the heart, according to a [study published online in February 2018 in BioMed Research International](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845493/). That's important for people with diabetes because the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/features/diabetes-and-heart.html) notes that over time, [high blood sugar](/hs/type-2-diabetes-management/blood-sugar-uncontrolled-pictures/) can negatively affect your heart. Although chickpeas are high in carbs \u2014 a \u00bd cup serving has about 20.2 g \u2014 they're also an excellent source of [fiber](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/), offering 6.55 g, or about 26 percent of the DV per cup, notes the USDA. The latter characteristic makes them ideal for people with diabetes, Cunningham notes. A [meta-analysis of 15 studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22218620) found that increasing fiber intake can help reduce fasting blood sugar, which is a measure of blood sugar management. A high-fiber diet is also associated with healthier weight and improved insulin sensitivity, which can further help stabilize blood sugar, according to the authors of an [article published in July 2018 in Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073249/). If you're currently following a low-fiber diet, just be sure to increase your intake gradually, and sip plenty of water while you do it. Otherwise, you may experience a stomachache, gas, and [bloating](/digestive-health/is-bloating-cause-for-concern/), notes the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983). How to enjoy them Cunningham suggests blending chickpeas into a homemade [hummus](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/best-hummus-brands-weight-loss/), adding lemon juice, and using [nonstarchy veggie](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/diet/low-carb-veggies-for-diabetic-diets/) sticks, such as celery and bell peppers, instead of crackers for a quick snack. Fatty Seafood Offers Immune-Supportive, Heart-Healthy Omega-3s The [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/omega-3s/) found in some types of fish \u2014 such as salmon, sardines, herring, and mackerel \u2014 enhance the functioning of immune cells, says the Sparta, New Jersey-based [Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES](http://erinpalinski.com/), author of [2 Day Diabetes Diet](https://www.amazon.com/2-Day-Diabetes-Diet-Just-Dodge/dp/1621452719) and a consultant for Swisse Wellness. Although a [review and meta-analysis published in August 2019 in the BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/366/bmj.l4697) found that omega-3s have little or no effect on type 2 diabetes directly, Palinski-Wade says they can have significant benefit when it comes to better immune function. EPA, a component of omega-3s, may enhance the activity of white blood cells, which strengthens the immune benefits, she notes. A [past study](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/141/5/964/4600360) suggests this effect can not only be significant, but can also happen fairly quickly \u2014 within a week, those researchers found. Plus, these seaworthy choices offer established heart benefits, notes a [review published in the May-June 2013 issue of the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3712371/). Fatty fish appear to lower inflammation, thereby improving blood vessel function and decreasing [triglycerides](/high-cholesterol/guide/triglycerides/), according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/omega-3/art-20045614). When prepared without sauces, fatty fish can be a great low-carb food to add to your [diabetes diet](/hs/managing-type-2-diabetes/best-and-worst-foods/). According to the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/512958/nutrients), a 5-ounce serving of salmon contains only 5 g of carbs. How to enjoy it Oven-baked fish is super simple and very quick, the [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/oven-baked-salmon-recipe-1911951) says. Put spices or a tablespoon of fruit salsa on top, along with a splash of lemon or vinegar, and seal the fish in an aluminum foil pouch. Bake at 450 degrees for about 15 minutes, until the fish is flaky. Carrots Are Packed With Vitamin A and Low on the Glycemic Index [Vitamin A](/drugs/vitamin-a-oral-injection) can help support the immune system through a variety of cellular processes, and one top source is carrots, says Cara Schrager, MPH, RDN, a certified diabetes care and education specialist and the clinical programs manager at the [Joslin Diabetes Center](https://www.joslin.org/) in Boston. \"Carrots contain beta-carotene, which is a major source of vitamin A,\" she says, so much so that the common garden vegetable actually gave the phytonutrient its name. Furthermore, Schrager says, they contain a low [glycemic load](/diet-nutrition/101/nutrition-basics/the-glycemic-load.aspx), meaning they are unlikely to cause a blood sugar spike. They're helpful for eye health, an important consideration for those with diabetes, according to the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/diabetic-eye-disease). Over time, diabetes can cause eye damage that leads to poor vision and puts you at higher risk for issues like [cataracts](/cataracts/guide/) and [glaucoma](/glaucoma/guide/). [Research published in Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705341/) has found that the beta-carotene in carrots, along with lutein, provides antioxidants that can help prevent eye damage. How to enjoy them Schrader suggests grating carrots into tomato sauce or ground meat, or snacking on baby carrots. According to the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168568/nutrients), about of a cup (or 85 g) offers 586 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin A, or about 65 percent of the DV. RELATED: [How to Prepare Veggies When You're Managing Type 2 Diabetes](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/diet/vegetables-diabetes-diet-steamed-roasted-sauteed-best/) Brazil Nuts Help Support Thyroid Function, Thanks to Their Selenium Selenium is another important mineral for those with type 2 diabetes, says Cunningham, because it supports thyroid health. According to the [American Diabetes Association](https://diabetesjournals.org/spectrum/article/15/3/143/665/Thyroid-Disease-and-Diabetes), both diabetes and thyroid disease are endocrine issues, so those who grapple with thyroid issues could have a more difficult time with blood glucose control. Selenium plays a critical role in regulating thyroid hormones, the [NIH says](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/). Because [research](https://diabetesjournals.org/spectrum/article/19/3/148/2031/Diabetes-Control-in-Thyroid-Disease) has found that those with diabetes have a higher prevalence of [thyroid disorders](/thyroid/guide/), it's helpful to keep your thyroid function up to scratch with good nutrition. Cunningham recommends a small serving of Brazil nuts to get what you need. According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/17283-nutrition-nuts--heart-health), that's 4 medium-size Brazil nuts (about \u00bd ounce). In addition to being a single protein serving, the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/784370/nutrients) notes that 4 Brazil nuts offer 383.2 mcg of selenium, or [nearly 7 times the DV](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/). That same serving size of Brazil nuts contains only 2.35 g of carbs. How to enjoy them Because it takes so little to get benefits from Brazil nuts, Cunningham suggests including one in your snack rotation, or you can also slice a Brazil nut in thin strips and put it on a salad or over steel-cut [oatmeal.](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/oatmeal-benefits-risks-recipes-more/) RELATED: [Processed Foods to Eat and Avoid](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/processed-foods-linked-shorter-life-span-study-finds/) Walnuts Supply Vitamin E and Healthy Fats Another important micronutrient is [vitamin E](/drugs/vitamin-e), says Schrager, because it's a powerful antioxidant that helps protect the immune system. [Research](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/27/9/2166/22595/Effect-of-High-Dose-Vitamin-E-on-Insulin) has further noted that this vitamin can improve glycemic control in people with diabetes. \"Walnuts are an excellent source of vitamin E, as well as a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation,\" she says. \"Walnuts contain very little carbohydrates, and therefore have a minimal impact on glucose levels.\" If you're aiming to lose or maintain weight, walnuts are for you. According to [a small study published in January 2018 in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715141), walnuts may activate a part of the brain involved with appetite and impulse control. According to the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170187/nutrients), 1 oz of walnut halves (about 14) offer 0.198 mg of vitamin E, which is about 5 percent of the DV. Bell Peppers Contain Vitamin C and Are Low in Carbs Bell peppers are packed with [vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/), says Schrager, and that helps boost your immune system and eliminate free radicals, which can cause damage to cells. According to the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/787812/nutrients), one cup of sliced red bell pepper offers 117 mg of vitamin C, or 130 percent of the DV. A [study in the November 2018 issue of Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism](https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.13571) involving vitamin C supplements linked the nutrient to improved blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes, and helped [manage blood pressure](/high-blood-pressure/guide/treatment/) as well. \"Because bell peppers are a nonstarchy vegetable, they have a minimal effect on glucose levels,\" she says. Another benefit to vitamin C is better skin health and wound healing, because it's involved with the formation of collagen, according to a [report published in Nutrients in 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/). The [ADA notes](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/complications/skin-complications) that diabetes can affect skin, and that skin issues are sometimes the first [sign of diabetes](/diabetes/guide/). How to enjoy them Schrager suggests chopping up raw bell peppers and adding them to a range of dishes, like scrambled eggs or a fresh veggie salsa for baked fish, or cut into thin strips as a crunchy snack. RELATED: [Which Foods Are High in Vitamin C?](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/top-foods-high-in-vitamin-c.aspx) Lentils Are Another Healthy Option for Zinc and Fiber Another good source of zinc, lentils are also full of fiber, which helps boost satiety and keeps blood sugar steady, says Schrager. Lentils come in several colors, including brown, green, red, yellow, and black. \"The fiber acts as a prebiotic for healthy gut bacteria,\" she adds. \"Our gut bacteria has been shown to strengthen our immune system.\" Lentils and legumes (beans) are a great pantry item, dried or canned, she says, and they provide a good amount of protein as well. [According to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/597467/nutrients), \u00bc cup of dried lentils contain 30 g of carbs and 15 g of fiber (60 percent of the DV). Lentils are a low-glycemic-index food, making them suitable for people with diabetes. This is another good pick for those who are trying to lose weight, since the increased satiety means you feel full for longer, and that can decrease the temptation to keep snacking, lowering your daily calories as a result, says Schrager. How to enjoy them Lentils are a great add-in for soup, especially because you can put together one that also has numerous types of veggies. For example, they pair well with onions, cauliflower, and bell peppers, as [this low-carb recipe from Wholesome Yum](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/vegetable-soup/) demonstrates.
