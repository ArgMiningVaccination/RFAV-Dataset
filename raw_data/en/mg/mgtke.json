If you are experiencing symptoms, it is recommended that you do a PCR or a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT)1. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is more sensitive and specific, which means it's able to detect low levels of the virus. PCR tests can take longer to analyse, but are referred to as the 'gold standard' when it comes to testing for COVID-19. A Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) detect the presence of proteins in the virus and are more accurate when people are experiencing symptoms. They can be used anywhere, such as at home, but are generally less accurate than PCR tests. 1Healthdirect, [COVID-19 testing](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid-19/testing), accessed 20 February 2023 How is COVID-19 spread?

Blooms The Chemist pharmacies are providing three of the TGA approved COVID-19 vaccinations, which are: - Novavax - Moderna (Spikevax) - Pfizer (Comirnaty) Why should I get my COVID-19 vaccination at my local pharmacy? Providing access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to everyone living in Australia seeking to be vaccinated is a key priority of the Australian COVID-19 Vaccination Policy. Community pharmacies are a critical partner in achieving this goal and in providing comprehensive primary health care for people in Australia. Receiving a vaccination at your local Blooms The Chemist will assist in speeding up the national rollout and may help relieve strain on other health service providers, like hospitals and GPs. What happens when I get my vaccination? Once you arrive at the pharmacy for your appointment, a team member will ask you for your name and your Medicare Card. The team member will then assess your eligibility for the vaccination and be asked to complete a pre-screening form and a consent form. After you've completed both forms, the pharmacist will invite you into the consult room for your vaccination. After you've received your vaccination, you will be asked to wait in the dedicated observation area for 15 minutes. During the 15 minutes, the pharmacist staff will assist you in booking your second appointment and you will have a chance to read the post vaccination information leaflet. Please bring your current Medicare Card and Photo ID to your appointment. How long will my vaccination take? The vaccination service should take less than 30 minutes to complete, but the timeline depends on how long it takes you to complete the pre-screening and consent form. Who will be vaccinating me? A qualified, trained Pharmacist or Nurse will be providing you with your vaccination. Do I need a Medicare card? No, it is not a requirement to have a Medicare card to get the vaccine but if you do have one, please bring it to your appointment. Do I need to pay for my COVID-19 vaccination? No. The COVID-19 vaccination is free to everyone in Australia. What happens if I react to the vaccine? Our Pharmacists and vaccination team members are trained in recognising and treating severe reactions to vaccinations, known as adverse events. Most reactions to the vaccination happen 15 minutes after you've received the vaccine, which is why our Pharmacists ask you to remain in the pharmacy for 15 minutes for observation and monitoring. If you're feeling unwell, please let our team members know immediately. If you're experiencing any severe reactions, including anaphylaxis or shortness of breath1, call 000 to get immediate medical attention. 1Health Direct, [After The Vaccination](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid-19/after-the-vaccination), accessed 24 January 2023.
