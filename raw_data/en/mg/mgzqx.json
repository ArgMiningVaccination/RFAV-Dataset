Am J Case Rep ; 23: e934833, 2022 Mar presenting with severe [pain], swelling, and stiffness. COVID-19 [infection], which originated in [China]in December 2019, required extraordinary efforts to develop and test new [vaccines]to halt the [pandemic]. The Vaxzervria [vaccine]has shown excellent [safety]and [efficacy]in phase 3 trials with a mechanism based on the expression of the [SARS-CoV-2]spike [protein] [gene] [coding]for describe event [crystal arthritis]after a [carpal [treatment]resulted in full resolution of the symptoms in 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Although most episodes of acute [arthritis]happen spontaneously, certain factors may trigger the acute CPP [crystal arthritis]such as intercurrent illnesses or surgeries. Although the [association]between [carpal tunnel syndrome]and CPP [arthritis]has been known for over 40 years, surgical release of the carpal [ligament]has always been associated with full resolution of symptoms. This is the first case [report]describing an exacerbation after carpal canal release, concomitant with the [administration]of the [vaccine].
