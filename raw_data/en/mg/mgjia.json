Provide a summary overview of the therapy. What evidence is there about providing care for patients of all cultures?

Still with these many clinical and laboratory research experiments and the reports and testimonies, people still have questions about Complementary and Alternative therapies and the benefits surrounding CAM practices as well as the safety of their techniques. Complementary medicine is becoming more integrated into our mainstream health care system largely in response to consumer demand, as well as the recognition of new scientific findings that explain the views of health and healing-which push against the limits of the current biomedical paradigm (Micozzi, 2006). There are many different types of Complementary and Alternative medicine; although they are different and diverse, all these therapies of CAM have some common ground in their views of health and healing.

Generally, it is defined as those treatments and healthcare practices not taught widely in medical schools, not generally used in hospitals and not usually reimbursed by medical insurance companies,\" (Unknown, 2003). The largest question surrounding CAM practices is whether there is enough scientific evidence to support the benefits of CAM treatments. The health benefits of CAM have not so far been fully assessed in ways that can be universally accepted as being evidence based and this is why there is skepticism about CAM practices. According to Micozzi (2006), \"Allopatic medicine is considered the \"scientific\" healing art, whereas the alternatives have been considered \"nonscientific\" (pg 3).
