The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, requires states and territories to provide early intervention and special education services to eligible children and young adults. Early intervention services, or EIS, are available for children from birth to 3 years old, and special education services are available to children from 3 to 21 years old. Installation EFMP Family Support providers can provide specific information and resources for these services. All states and territories must provide early intervention services to children who have, or are at risk for having, developmental delays, from birth to their third birthday. Most CONUS locations, local school districts or health departments provide these early intervention services. The program is called different names in different areas, but it is often referred to as Part C because that is the section of the law that pertains to early intervention. The Education Directory for Children with Special Needs has a list of resources specific to each state to help you determine who you should contact. Your installation EFMP Family Support provider can also answer your questions. If you are moving OCONUS or to a CONUS location with a DODEA school (and you live on installation), your child will receive EIS through the Defense Department's Educational and Developmental Intervention Services, or EDIS, program. When moving, you should hand carry copies of your child's most current individual family service plan, or IFSP, and the most current evaluation reports to your new home to ensure they are not lost. All states and territories provide special education and related services to eligible children between the ages of 3 through 21. When a child transfers to a different district in the same state, the new school must provide a free, appropriate public education, including comparable services, until the previously held IEP is adopted or a new one is developed and implemented. When a child transfers to another state, the receiving school must provide comparable services until an IEP review can determine if a new evaluation or IEP is appropriate. If you are moving and your child receives special education and related services, you should hand carry all necessary school and medical documents, including the most current IEP and current evaluation reports. Hand carrying these documents ensures that they are not lost and allows the new school to begin the process as soon as you arrive. If you are a parent of a child with special needs, you will find help for the correct placement of your child at the \"home school\" or assigned school that serves your housing area. As soon as you have been assigned quarters or have found housing in the community, call the office of your assigned school and make an appointment to see either the counselor or the principal. If your child has been determined to be legally handicapped, either physically or mentally, or has been diagnosed with a learning or behavior disorder, hand carry all your documentation, to include copies of IEP's, with you. Do not send this paperwork with your household goods shipment, as you will need it when you meet with the receiving school staff. This will speed up the placement process. If your child has not been officially certified as special needs, but you feel your child needs to be evaluated, ask the principal to initiate a formal assessment. It is your right as a parent to receive this service. If you arrive during the summer, many principals and permanent office staff will be on vacation. In this case, ask for a Form 0-42. Fill it out and give it to the clerk. It will be sent to the district office to start the process. It is recommended that you, as a parent, make informed decisions regarding your child's accommodations in the public school system. There is currently a critical shortage of teachers with certifications in Special Education, Learning Disabilities and Emotional Handicaps. Before enrolling your child in a school, it is recommended you become familiar with the particulars of their Special Education program and staff. The schools are required by Federal law to meet certain time requirements in regards to the evaluation, placement, and implementation of a student's individual education plan (IEP). These federally mandated procedures are meant to allow the parents to play an active role in the initial decision-making process, the creation of the IEP (individual education program), and regular assessment of progress.
