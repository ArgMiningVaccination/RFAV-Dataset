Exhaustion and fatigue have become so commonplace that we think they're normal. If you've ever found yourself wondering \"why am I always tired?\" it may be time to reevaluate your lifestyle and see how you can improve your energy levels. Though burnout is common, it's not something we should simply accept; and at [North Alabama Spine and Rehab](https://ihurtdoc.com/), we believe that there's always room for improvement in our health and well-being. If you're always tired or feeling exhausted, it's not normal. When the body is taxed beyond its ability to function optimally, fatigue sets in. This can happen to anybody at any time, and because fatigue and exhaustion are so common, they're often ignored or treated with substances like caffeine. Chiropractic care can resolve the root cause of exhaustion and fatigue by restoring optimal function to the body. Why am I always tired? Though there are several potential explanations for always feeling tired, some of the most frequent reasons are overwork, inadequate sleep, too much coffee or other stimulants, and stress. If you often feel overwhelmed or constantly on-the-go, it's easy to write off being exhausted as simply a repercussion of your hectic lifestyle. While it's common to feel beat after a day or week full of commitments and engagements, chronic fatigue is not normal. How can I be less stressed? Stress is a leading cause of exhaustion and fatigue. If stress seems to be taking over your life, it's crucial to find ways to reduce it. However, as we all know, reducing stress is much easier said than done. So let's explore some of the simpler methods for improving your health and well-being while decreasing stress. You need to make sure you're sleeping well. Get enough rest every night so you can wake up feeling refreshed. Decreasing stress levels begins with receiving a restful, comfortable sleep each night. This means finding the right mattress and sleeping surface that promotes deep, high-quality sleep without interruption. When your body doesn't get enough sleep, your nervous system can become stressed. A stressed-out nervous system can't handle the day-to-day stresses of life or additional stressful situations very well. So getting good quality sleep becomes even more important to reduce stress. There are things you can do to help make sure that your sleeping environment promotes deep, restful sleep so you get the most benefit from it: If you want to get proper sleep, invest in a good mattress that suits your sleeping style, keep the room dark and cool, and avoid blue light from electronics an hour before bed. It is important to have enough food to eat throughout the day. This will help you feel your best and have enough energy. Make sure to include a variety of foods from different food groups at each meal. Once you're attuned to your body's needs, it becomes second nature to fuel yourself with the right amounts of food. Managing stress levels then comes more easily because you know that part of taking care of yourself is not just eating - it's also about ensuring that your diet consists of adequate micro- and macro-nutrients. The ratios of fat, carbs, and proteins (macros) as well as vitamins and minerals (micros) are both essential in maintaining a healthy balance. Not sure where to start? A rule of thumb is consuming no fewer or more calories than what your body requires for optimal functioning throughout the day - but remember that this number will be different for everyone! You should do some exercise every day, but not too much. Make sure to include activities that are good for your body and mind. It's not only important to get enough rest and eat well throughout the day, but you should also incorporate physical activity and limit mental stimulation. Although exercise is inherently stressful to the body, that's one of its main benefits! Damaging muscles is technically what helps them grow stronger, so it's natural to expect some level of stress to the body with any amount of exercise. Always aim to strike a balance with your exercises; too much can yield negative consequences and produce heightened levels of adrenaline and cortisol. As long as you ensure that your exercise is moderate, this shouldn't be an issue. Gauge what is appropriate for you according to your health level. To similarly decrease mental stress, take time for moderate mental activity when possible. This can include naps, journaling, meditation, and other activities that help to relax the mind. When we have racing thoughts, it releases adrenaline and cortisol in the body similar to over-exercising. Receive high-quality chiropractic care. After you've put all the other pieces in place for a healthful lifestyle, it's time to add high-quality chiropractic care to start reaping the full benefits. Tiredness affects everyone at some point in their lives, but what many don't know is that chiropractic care can help to refresh your quality of life by treating the root cause of fatigue. Even when you have a good night's sleep and everything else in your life seems perfect, sometimes our bodies just don't respond the way we want them to. This is common after traumatic events or chronic periods of stress. If you are doing everything right but still not feeling your best, chiropractic care may be able to help. Your spine and joints are connected to your central nervous system, which manages all the electrical activity in your body. When the central nervous system isn't functioning as it should, it can cause fatigue, mental fog, and a general lack of energy.
