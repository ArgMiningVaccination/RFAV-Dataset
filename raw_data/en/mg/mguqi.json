MURANISHI COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR Honorable Board of Supervisors - 2 - June 28, 2019 ii DISCUSSION/SUMMARY : The FY 201 9-2020 Final Budget , which incorporates adjustments approved by your Board during budg et deliberations, is balanced . The Final Budget for all funds totals $3.5 billion and provides funding for 9, 887 full-time equivalent positions (FTEs). The General Fund Budget totals $3.0 billion and supports 7, 931 FTEs. FY 2018 -19 Approved FY 2019 -20 Proposed FY 2019 -20 Final Adjustments FY 2019 -20 Final Budget Change from FY 2018 -19 closes a $60.4 million funding gap through a combination of spending reductions, revenue increases and the use of Fiscal Management Reward (FMR) program savings. To the extent possible, your Board's Values -Based Budgeting (VBB) criteria and Vision 2026 priorities were considered to propose reduction s within each program area. Budget balancing strategies include the elimination of 7.00 vacant funded positions in the Sheriff's Office. The following table summarizes net cost reductions required to close the funding gap: General Fund Reductions General Fund Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) General Government $19.0 Health Care $12.0 Public Assistance $12.3 Public Protection $13.2 Non-Program Revenue $3.9 Total $60.4 The Final Budget is balanced with $25.2 million or 42% in ongoing strategies and $35.2 million or 58% in one -time strategies, with most of the one -time savings coming from the Fiscal Management Reward Program (FMR). Board Policy Directives and Funding Priorities During formal deliberations on the FY 2019 -20 Proposed Budget your Board endorsed the recommendations from the Auditor -Controller and County Administrator to designate residual tax proceeds and other capital project funds in an estimated amount of $62.5 million in next year's budget Honorable Board of Supervisors - 3 - June 28, 2019 iii to support and sec ure funding availability for Board -approved multi -year initiatives of housing and homelessness; children, youth and families; and infrastructure investments. State and Federal Budget Impact/Pending Factors The current decade -long economic expansion is p oised to become the longest in U.S history next month, and we know that a recession is inevitable. The County's heavy reliance on federal and State revenue requires that we closely monitor potential funding cuts to the safety net and proposed program/cost shifts to counties. On June 27, 2019, the Governor signed a $215 billion State budget for FY 2019 -20 that leverages new revenue to build reserves, pay down liabilities, and fund one -time investments. There are a series of key priority areas for countie s: New funding of $1.0 billion for homelessness services, including one -time Homeless Housing, Assistance, and Prevention program funding of $640 million to local jurisdictions which includes $190 million for Continuums of Care, $275 million for 13 'big c ities' and $175 million for all 58 counties; An investment of $1.75 billion to increase housing production, including $250 million in Housing Planning Grants to local jurisdictions; A reduction of the Maintenance of Effort base and inflation factor for mandated In -Home Supportive Services payments by counties; An expansion of full -scope Medi -Cal to cover undocumented young adults; The establishment of a State individual health care insurance mandate coupled with additional subsidies for eligible indivi duals purchasing health insurance on the Covered California health insurance exchange; and Additional funding of $87.3 million for counties to upgrade voting system infrastructure. At the federal level, with split control in Congress, it is not expected that there will be any major legislation passed prior to the 2020 elections. Despite that, federal actions on immigration, tax reform, and trade policy are of significant concern to the County. In particular, the County is closely tracking the following items: In December 2018, a federal District Court judge ruled the Affordable Care Act (ACA) unconstitutional. If the ruling is upheld, insurance coverage gains - including those achieved through the Medicaid expansion - would be lost. The County estimates over 193,000 Alameda County residents could lose their health insurance coverage if the ACA is invalidated. In addition, all County residents would lose protection from being denied health insurance due to Honorable Board of Supervisors - 4 - June 28, 2019 iv pre-existing conditions. The County will continue to work with stakeholders, including the California Attorney General who has challenged the District Court ruling, to protect the ACA. In 2020, the federal government will conduct its decennial census. Census data determines funding formulas for safety net programs, and an undercount of Alameda County residents would have a significant negative impact on the County's ability to deliver se rvices. Approximately 25% of the County's population are considered \"Hard -to-Count\" residents, and an undercount of only 3% of the County's population would result in an estimated funding loss of $1 billion over 10 years. The Supreme Court decision on Ju ne 27 to strike the census question about citizenship will facilitate the County's intensive efforts to ensure every Alameda County resident is counted in the census through the Alameda County Complete Count Committee established by your Board. Medi -Cal i s currently operating under a federal waiver that expires in 2020. Provisions in the Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver provide a significant amount of supplemental funding to the County, the Alameda Health System, and other health care delivery partners, including the $140 million Whole Person Care pilot program. The State is exploring options, including a new type of Waiver that would allow California to explore a single payer system, however, recently approved Waivers in other states include provisions that limit co verage, such as work requirements. Without viable solutions to sustain Waiver funding, the County's ability to deliver services to our most vulnerable residents will be adversely affected. Alameda County has been operating under a federal Title IV -E Waiv er since 2007 that has allowed the County to invest in foster care prevention services and programs that would otherwise not be eligible for federal reimbursement. The Waiver is set to expire in September 2019 and without a reauthorization, the County may need to consider alternatives to continue child welfare services at the current level. The County continues to oppose federal administrative rule changes to the Title X Family Planning Grant Program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP ). Over 30,000 low -income County residents receive family planning services funded by Title X, and the proposed rule change would eliminate funding for many of the services those residents receive. The proposed administrative rule change to SNAP would lim it eligibility for some of the County's lowest -income residents. Due to the vulnerability of the County's finances to State and federal funding and policy decisions, continued uncertainty and budget challenges will require sustained vigilance and active e ngagement in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. to help protect the safety net and core services. The Innovation Journey and Vision 2026 The County's Innovation Journey started over a decade ago with your Board's creation of Vision 2016, a ten -year strategi c vision that identified long term goals and priorities based on future trends and a commitment to collaboration, partnerships, innovation and sustainability. The journey continues with Vision 2026, a refreshed and updated strategic vision that is the fou ndation of our FY 2019 -20 Final Budget and guides our decisions throughout the year. Honorable Board of Supervisors - 5 - June 28, 2019 v Alameda County Vision 2026 articulates a Shared Vision for Alameda County that contains four distinct elements: Healthy Environment, Safe and Livable Communities, Thri ving and Resilient Population , and Prosperous and Vibrant Economy. Vision 2026 seeks to achieve these Shared Visions through six 10X Goals that reflect the County's core services and community priorities: Eliminate Homelessness, Healthcare for All, Employ ment for All, Eliminate Poverty and Hunger, Crime Free County , and Accessible Infrastructure. The Final Budget highlights the alignment of program goals and objectives with the County's 10X Goals in support of the four Shared Visions, and are also highlig hted in the Human Impacts, Children's Services, and Unincorporated Services budgets. The County continues to invest in strategic partnerships and collaborations involving our agencies and departments, community -based providers, labor organizations , and other stakeholders to advance your Board's Vision 2026. Below is a sample of just a few of the County's many valuable partnerships and innovations: Eliminate Homelessness In the first year of the County Homelessness Council, your Board approved a Three -Year Homelessness Action Plan in support of our 10X Goal Pathway of Eliminating Homelessness. The Action Plan invests $340 million in both ongoing and one -time funding to ad dress the homelessness crisis, and supports homelessness prevention, outreach to homeless residents, health care, temporary shelter , and other assistance. The County is convening a regional meeting of all mayors and city managers in Alameda County this Ju ly to provide an update on the Action Plan. The cities will also have the opportunity to share the program and financial investments included in their FY 19 -20 approved budgets. The convening will also be a forum to share best practices and challenges as we work together to identify innovative solutions and funding opportunities to address the regional homelessness crisis. The FY 2019 -20 Final Budget includes over $130 million in funding to address homelessness. The County Homelessness Council has guide d the opening of the County's first safe-parking site, where homeless residents can live safely out of their vehicles while engaging in efforts to find permanent housing. The Council is also spearheading plans by the County to establish a Navigation Cente r - a temporary shelter for up to 50 homeless individuals, near the Fairmont campus in San Leandro. Aligned with the Shared Vision for Safe and Livable Communities and in support of our most vulnerable populations, the Social Services Agency (SSA) has been awarded a two -year grant from the State for the Home Safe Pilot Program (Home Safe). Grant proceeds from Home Safe will serve Adult Protective Services clients - elders and dependent adults who are victims of abus e, neglect, or financial exploitation - experiencing or facing imminent risk of homelessness by linking them to appropriate services to stabilize their housing and reinforce their safety. Alameda County is also driving efforts to address the housing and h omelessness crisis by boosting the availability of affordable housing , in support of our Shared Visions for Safe and Honorable Board of Supervisors - 6 - June 28, 2019 vi Livable Communities and Thriving and Resilient Populations. Measure A1 , the County - sponsored $580 million General Obligation Bond for affor dable housing that was approved by voters in 2016, is driving the creation and preservation of numerous housing options for our most vulnerable residents. To date the County has committed $245 million in Measure A1 funds to specific affordable housing pro jects, leveraging more than $1.5 billion to support the development of over 2,400 new, affordable units throughout Alameda County, including over 700 units for individuals experiencing homelessness. These funds provide opportunities to continue working wi th cities and other partners to improve coordination and collaboration to address homelessness and the regional housing crisis. Other significant investments to address homelessness include nearly $70 million in funding from the Mental Health Services Act , and almost $43 million in No Place Like Home funding to build 175 units of affordable housing throughout the County. Healthcare for All A partnership to address the opioid epidemic led by the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) and supported by the Probation Department and the Sheriff's Office is achieving promising outcomes in support of the Health Care for All 10X Goal. Last year, HCSA reported a 49% decrease in opioid overdose deaths since 2015 - strong evidence that the County's extensive partnership with local health providers has been effective in reducing the misuse of opioid medications and curbing overdoses. Our AC Care Connect pilot initiative is making significant strides in its comprehensive effort to improve care for people who are homeless or are frequent users of local emergency rooms. In September, the project is scheduled to launch a Social/Health Informatio n Exchange (SHIE) that will allow authorized health and human service agencies to share information via a secure platform containing important data about thousands of clients in the community and how their challenges are being addressed. The process of de veloping the SHIE has been deliberate and time-consuming, given the need to reach consensus among many participants and to minimize privacy concerns. This effort is bringing a powerful tool to AC Care Connect as it continues to improve the coordination of care for vulnerable residents of our community. Crime Free Community In support of the Shared Visions of Safe and Livable Communities and a Prosperous and Vibrant Economy , the Sheriff's Office Youth and Family Services Bureau in partnership with the Dep uty Sheriff's Activities League (DSAL) has developed a Community Capitals Policing model to support targeted investments towards economic development, arts, cultural and political capital, and social cohesion. Initiatives that have emerged from this model include the Dig Deep Farms urban social enterprise and Food Hub, a boxing gym, a soccer park, and a sports facility. The Health Care Services Agency, in partnership with Probation, the District Attorney, and the Public Defender, has obtained a three -year, $6 million Prop 47 grant from the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) to provide targeted mental health, substance use disorder treatment, and housing support services to members of the adult reentry population in the County. Honorable Board of Supervisors - 7 - June 28, 2019 vii Employment for All The County continues providing opportunities and access to employment for all; attracting and retaining a diverse multi -generational workforce and developing innovative programs to train and employ individuals including veterans, foster youth, CalWORKs clients, developmentally disabled , and justice -involved individuals through creative partnerships and initiatives like Step Up and Pathway to Success. Eliminating Poverty and Hunger ALL IN Alameda County continues to develop innovative solutions while building resiliency and self -sufficiency among vulnerable populations. ALL IN programs aim to address food insecurity and health as well as the implementation of neighborhood -based strategies to increase family well -being and school readiness. ALL IN provides the organizational backbone of Food as Medicine, a multi -sector initiative that partners with local hospitals and community clinics to deliver high -quality nutritious food to families to improve their health and well -being. Healthy Environmen t Alameda County continues to demonstrate State and national leadership in sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. Our employees have access to 396 all - electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid -electric vehicles for on -the-job travel. Over the past six years, the County has installed 151 EV charging ports - with 106 available to the public. The County's network of \"green\" certified buildings and enrollment in the Brilliant 100 energy option with our local electricity supplier, East Bay Community Energy, means our purchased electricity is now 100 percent carbon -free: at least 40 percent renewable from solar or wind, with the remainder from large hydropower, at a lower cost as our former pricing with PG&E. Accessible Infrastructu re The Capital Improvement Plan for FY 2019 -2024 estimates a total five -year capital project cost of $1.61 billion. Identified financing for the projects totals $1.46 billion, leaving an unfunded balance of $153 million. The County Administrator's Finan ce Advisory Committee will be evaluating the County's capital and infrastructure needs and advancing recommendations to the full Board for approval. On top of the $2.9 million annual allocation for major maintenance, the Final Budget includes a one -time a llocation of $2.1 million to help address deferred maintenance and growing needs for capital investments. Your Board recently approved additional capital investments to replace aging equipment such as the purchase of new election equipment, funded in part by a State grant, and the replacement and upgrade of radios used by County agencies. In line with the operating principle of Fiscal Stewardship and guided by your Board's adopted financial management and capital improvement policies, the budget before yo u is balanced. Our credit ratings remain at the highest AAA level and the budget includes funds to reduce our debt through sound financial planning, management , and discipline. Additionally, your Board's Honorable Board of Supervisors - 8 - June 28, 2019 viii commitment to designate $62.5 million of residual tax proceeds and capital project funds in next year's budget to secure funding availability for Board -approved multi -year initiatives of housing and homelessness; children, youth , and families; and infrastructure investments demonstrates your steadfast adh erence to fiscal prudence and the delivery of core programs and services to our most vulnerable residents. CLOSING REMARKS Your Board continues to provide strong financial and strategic leadership while uncertainties at the federal and State level pose significant challenges for the County. Weaker economic data and the escalation of trade tensions have increased the risk of a recession in the near future. Nevertheless your Board's commitment to Vision 2026 and the resources that will be required to ach ieve that vision has helped Alameda County become a State and national leader in innovation and collaboration, economic and workforce development, and community engagement and investment. Looking ahead, global shifts in demographic trends, big data, new t echnologies, growing income inequality , and climate change will exert an accelerating influence on economic and social outcomes as we strive to retain flexibility and make strategic investments to maintain our core programs and services, support our divers e workforce and communities, upgrade our infrastructure, and protect our fiscal integrity and financial sustainability. Once again, I extend my gratitude to all Agency and Department Heads for their ongoing efforts to curtail expenditures in the face of g rowing concerns about the long -term sustainability of the current economic growth cycle, and for their significant contributions toward achieving a balanced budget. I also would like to acknowledge the guidance and support of the Budget Workgroup members. Finally, I thank your Board for the strong support and leadership you have provided during the FY 2019 -2020 budget process, as well as your ongoing commitment to an open and inclusive process that has involved all stakeholders. Very truly yours, /s/ Susan S.

MURANJSHI COUNT Y ADMIN ISTRATOR Honorable Board of Supervisors Administration Building Oakland, CA 94612 AGENDA ____ June 25,2019 COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR June 25,2019 SUBJECT: BOARD PRIORITY MULTI- YEAR INITIATIVES RECOMMENDATION Authorize the Auditor-Controller and County Administrator to designate residual tax proceeds and other Capital Project Funds in an estimated amount of$62.5M in next year's budget to support and secure funding availability for the Board-approved multi-year initiatives of housing and homelessness ; children, youth and families; and infrastructure investments. DISCUSSION/SUMMARY: During adoption of the FY 2018-19 Final Budget, your Board approved funding for priority initiatives subsequent to your formal budget deliberations that increased the commitment of residual property tax funds (\"Boomerang \") for housing and homelessness; capital projects to address homelessness ; children, youth and family services in each supervisorial district; and economic development/infrastructure projects in East County. The total funding commitment approved by your Board for these priority initiatives was $97.5 million over 9 years through FY 2026-27. Funding of $17.5 million to support the housing/homelessness , capital projects to address homelessness and East County infrastructure initiatives were authorized in the Final FY 2018-19 Budget. The Proposed FY 2019-20 Budget includes $17.5 million to fund housing/homelessness , capital projects to address homelessness , and the new children, youth and family services initiatives in the coming year. Given your Board's commitment to fund these multi-year priority initiatives, the Auditor and CAO are recommending that residual property tax proceeds from former redevelopment agencies and other capital project funds be designated in next year's budget to ensure funding availability. Since the residual property tax revenue source defined as \"Boomerang \" funds are contingent on the completion and phase-out of former redevelopment projects and will likely be impacted by an economic downturn , this is a prudent proactive approach that is consistent with your Board's prior actions and reaffirms your Vision 2026 commitment to fiscal stewardship. 1221 OAK STREET SUITE 555 OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA 94612 (510) 272-698 4 FAX (51 0) 272-378 4 ix/s/ /s/Honorable Board of Supervisors Page 3 June 25, 2019 ATTACHMENT RESIDUAL PROPERTY TAX (BOOMERANG) BOARD INITIATIVES Affordable Housing Trust Homelessness Capital Fund Enhancing Vision 2026 Fund East County Economic Development Fund Total Allocations 11, 2019 xii C O U N T Y A D M I N I S T R A T O R June 11, 2019 Honorable Board of Supervisors Administration Building Oakland, CA 94612 SUBJECT: FISCAL YEAR 2019 -2020 PROPOSED BUDGET Dear Board Members: The Proposed FY 2019 -2020 Budget recommends a balanced $3.4 billion spending plan for County programs and services, including an increase of $130.4 million for the General Fund, and supports a workforce of over 9,780 employees. The Proposed Budget closes a $60.4 milli on funding gap through a deliberate and public process, and reflects the invaluable input provided by your Board, agency and department heads, and other County stakeholders. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK The local economy remains strong, driven by a robust labor mark et. The County's April 2019 unemployment rate of 2.7% is about half of what it was five years ago. Despite record low unemployment rates, the impact on County residents is uneven with labor demand driving up wages in growing sectors like technology, while wage growth in more traditional sectors remains sluggish. The most recent UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts that the job market will experience a steady slowdown in its rate of growth over the next few years. The rise in real estate values led to a 7.1% increase in the FY 2017 -2018 assessment roll, resulting in much -needed general purpose revenues for the County. The State economic outlook cautions that anemic housing growth can constrain further economic growth. Absent adequate housing stock to accommoda te job growth, rising home prices and the increase in cost of living puts middle and low -income workers at risk of displacement as they are forced to pay a larger share of their incomes for housing costs. The \"human impacts\" of federal and State budget dec isions on our most vulnerable residents are again highlighted in the Proposed Budget. As the recent economic expansion nears record length, there are several indicators warning that the inevitable downturn may occur in the near future. Short -term U.S. Tre asury bond yields have risen to levels above longer -term yields. Many economists believe the inversion of the yield curve SUSAN S. MURANISHI COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR xiii Honorable Board of Supervisors -2- June 11, 2019 is a leading indicator of a recession occurring within the following 12 to 24 months. Economic data from Europe and Asia suggests the economies in those regions are weakening, and the International Monetary Fund has reduced its global growth forecast. An i ncrease in trade tensions also poses risks to global, national, and local economies. Finally, the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Situation Report showed a slowdown in job creation and wage growth. STATE BUDGET The Governor's May Revis ion reflects the State's healthy economy, with the Governor raising his revenue projections through Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 -20 by $3.2 billion versus the January Budget forecast. The main sources of the revenue growth are Personal Income Tax and Corporation Tax, with the increases being driven by highly volatile capital gains and one -time payments from the repatriation of foreign earnings associated with federal tax law changes in late 2017. Due to the one-time nature of these additional funds, as well as inc reasing concerns about long -term economic growth, most of this increased revenue is allocated to reserves, paying down debt, meeting Prop 98 education mandates, and other one-time investments. The Governor also downgraded the longer -term revenue outlook, with a FY 2022 -23 revenue projection $1.6 billion lower than the January Budget forecast. The Governor cited lower long - term revenue projections as the reason for only temporarily restoring the 7 percent cut in In -Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program h ours versus the January Budget proposal for a full restoration. Particularly concerning to counties is the Governor's lower sales tax revenue projections in every year of his forecast, including FY 2018 -19, as statewide sales tax receipts provide significa nt funding for counties through Proposition 172, 1991 realignment, and 2011 realignment revenue. The May Revision maintains the $1.75 billion investment to increase housing production that the Governor proposed in his January budget. Also, the May Revisi on contains over $1 billion in funding for homelessness services, with the largest investment being $650 million to local governments to provide Homelessness Emergency Aid. The Homelessness Emergency Aid funding contains a $275 million allocation to 'Big C ities' and a $275 million allocation to counties, with the remaining $100 million allocated to Continuums of Care. While the Governor is proposing to make significant resources available to combat the statewide homelessness crisis, it must be noted that mo st of this funding is one -time and subject to approval by the legislature. BUDGET OVERVIEW The FY 2019 -2020 Proposed Budget for all funds totals $3.4 billion, a decrease of $40.2 million, or 1.2%, attributable to the timing of debt financing for affordable housing. The FY 2018 -19 Final Budget includes the issuance of the first tranche of Measure A1 General Obligation bonds for affordable ho using, and the County does not anticipate issuing the next tranche until after FY 2019 -20. The General Fund, which supports most County operations, totals $3.0 billion, an increase of $130.4 million, or 4.5%. xiv Honorable Board of Supervisors -3- June 11, 2019 All Funds ($ in millions) 2018 -19 Final 2019 -20 MOE 2019 -20 Proposed Change from 2018 -19 in millions) 2018 -19 Final 2019 -20 MOE 2019 -20 Proposed Change from 2018 -19 included in the Proposed Budget to provide mandated and essential services, meet debt service obligations, maintain infrastructure and capital funding, and adhere to the Board's financial management policies. The Proposed Budget supports a work force of 9,786 full -time equivalent (FTE) positions and reflects a net increase of 24 FTE, all of which were approved by your Board mid-year and are fully offset with new revenue. The Proposed Budget funds cost -of-living adjustments (COLAs) for most of o ur employees based on negotiated labor agreements, and for many of our community -based organizations (CBOs). The Proposed Budget includes $625 million, an increase of $57.5 million from FY 2018 - 19, for services provided by 287 CBOs. This includes $81.5 m illion for services provided by the Alameda Health System (AHS). Other CBOs funded in the Proposed Budget include non -profit service providers, cities, school districts, and other local hospitals. A list of all CBO contracts with funding recommendations is included in the Appendix of the Proposed Budget document. Measure A, the voter -approved half -cent sales tax for essential health care services, which was reauthorized through 2034 by over 75% of the voters in June 2014 as Measure AA, provides over $150 million a year in crucial funding for health services. AHS receives 75% of the revenue directly and the remaining 25% is allocated by the Board of Supervisors to support other essential health services. The Proposed Budget includes $38.4 million in Meas ure A funds for non -AHS essential health services, an increase of $5.4 million in Measure A base allocations with the new three -year cycle beginning FY 2019 -20 and ending in FY 2021 -22 as approved by your Board on January 15, 2019. This increase includes a n augmentation of $3.5 million to the Measure A base allocation funding for St. Rose Hospital. xv Honorable Board of Supervisors -4- June 11, 2019 In November 2016, over 73% of the voters approved the County's $580 million Measure A1 General Obligation (GO) Bond for affordable housing. The first tranche of financing is reflected in the FY 2018 -19 budget and will continue to fund the creation and protection of affordable housing options for the most vulnerable populations. To date the County has committ ed $245.9 million of these funds which has leveraged over $1.5 billion to support the development of over 2,400 new, affordable units in Alameda County. These funds provide opportunities to continue working with cities and other partners to improve coordin ation and collaboration to address homelessness and the housing crisis. Consistent with your Board's financial management policies, the Proposed Budget recommends designating $7.7 million \u2014the equivalent of 1% of discretionary revenue \u2014for both capital pr ojects and the general reserve. Contingencies for pending labor negotiations, benefit cost increases, and other contractual obligations are also included in the Proposed Budget. CLOSING THE GAP The Proposed Budget closes a funding gap of approximately $ 60.4 million that was projected based on the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funding requirement. The funding gap was determined by identifying the difference between the cost of maintaining existing programs and projected revenues. The MOE Budget for the Ge neral Fund is over $3.04 billion, an increase of $146.7 million, or 5.1%. Available revenues to finance the projected MOE costs totaled about $2.98 billion, an increase of just $86.3 million, or 3.0%. Your Board's Values -Based Budgeting (VBB) priorities and Vision 2026 initiatives were considered in developing balancing strategies within each program area. The table below summarizes the total proposed net cost reductions to close the funding gap: Proposed Budget Balancing Strategies (General Fund) Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) General Government $19.0 Health Care $12.0 Public Assistance $12.3 Public Protection $13.2 Non-Program Revenue $3.9 Total $60.4 Proposed solutions to close the $60.4 million funding gap include a combination of spending reductions, revenue increases, and one -time strategies. The Proposed Budget recommends the use of $25.2 million or 41.7% in ongoing strategies and $35.2 million or 58.3% in one -time strategies, with most of the one -time savings coming from the Fiscal Management Reward Program (FMR). xvi Honorable Board of Supervisors -5- June 11, 2019 The FMR net savings have been generated through the efforts of County agencies/d epartments to operate their programs well within budget, to avoid future funding cuts and maintain the continuity of services. FMR is considered a one -time funding source as these savings may not be available to assist with balancing budgets in future y ears. A structural imbalance between ongoing revenues and expenditures remains, largely due to the State's ongoing shift of property taxes from local governments. Proposed Budget Balancing Strategies Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) Ongoing Strategies Program appropriation reductions $16.3 Program revenue increases 5.0 Non-Program revenue increases 3.9 Subtotal Ongoing Strategies $25.2 One-Time Strategies Fiscal Management Reward (FMR) $28.8 One-time revenues 6.4 Subtotal One -Time Strategies Balancing Strategies $60.4 VALUES -BASED BUDGETI NG (VBB) NET COST RE DUCTIONS General Government - The General Government program area contributed net cost savings of $19.0 million through $0.2 million in appropriation reductions, $1.0 million in increased revenue, and $17.8 million in FMR savings. Health Care - The Health Care Services Agency contributed net cost savings of $12.0 million through $0.3 million in appropriat ion reductions, $4.7 million in increased revenue, and $7.0 million in FMR savings. The spending reductions consist of a decrease in the children's services medical therapy program based upon current utilization. Revenue increases include $2.0 million in 1991 and 2011 Realignment revenue, $1.5 million in Medi -Cal funding, $0.8 million in Medi - Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) funding, and $0.4 million in one -time Measure A revenue. Public Assistance - The Public Assistance program area achieved net cost savings of $12.3 million through $10.9 million in appropriation reductions and $1.4 million in revenue increases. The primary adjustment was appropriation and revenue decreases consistent with the In -Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program in the Governor's May Revision resulting in $2.0 million in net cost savings. Other appropriation adjustments reflect a $5.0 million reduction in unallocated Title IV -E waiver contracts. Revenue increases include $2. 0 million in Title IV -E waiver reserves and $1.7 million in 1991 Realignment funds, and $1.6 million due to allocation increases for CalFresh. xvii Honorable Board of Supervisors -6- June 11, 2019 Public Protection - The Public Protection program area achieved net cost savings of $13.2 million through $4.9 million in appropriations reductions, $4.3 million in revenue increases, and $4.0 million of FMR savings, most of which was contributed by the Probation Departmen t. Appropriation reductions include decreased operating expenses in the Sheriff's Office of $4.7 million, and a $0.2 million reduction in indigent defense to align with contract utilization. Revenue increases include $0.15 million in anticipated funding f or the Public Defender, $2.3 million in one -time revenue for the District Attorney, and $1.9 million in additional revenue from a negotiated contract with the United States Marshals Service. Non-Program Revenue - In addition to the net cost reduction cont ributions from all Program Areas, a $3.9 million increase in interest earnings on investments is recommended based upon an updated analysis of current year data. FISCAL MANAGEMENT RE WARD (FMR) SAVINGS Your Board's FMR Program allows General Fund departments to carry over net savings each fiscal year to be used in subsequent years for budget balancing, one -time expenditures and/or program enhancements. Through ongoing cost -saving and revenue generation efforts, County agencies/departments contribut ed $28.8 million in prior -year FMR saving s to help balance the FY 2019 -20 budget. Program Area Use of FMR ($ millions) General Government $17.8 Health Care $7.0 Public Assistance $0.0 Public Protection $4.0 Total FMR $28.8 Ongoing efforts by agencies and departments to reduce spending and conserve resources have enabled the County to mitigate major program reductions and maintain vital services. However, departments must continue to balance these efforts with the need to fund increased cos ts and meet the growing demand for essential services in all program areas. BOARD INITIATIVES Pursuant to your Board's final direction with the adoption of the FY 2018 -19 Budget last June, the FY 2019 -20 Proposed Budget reflects the following funding c ommitments: The first allocation of $5.0 million ($1.0 million for each supervisorial district) designated annually for three years starting in FY 2019 -20 through FY 2021 -22 for the Enhancing Vision 2026 Fund for children, youth, and families . xviii Honorable Board of Supervisors -7- June 11, 2019 The second year of an increased allocation of $7.5 million for the Affordable Housing Trust which will continue through FY 2020 -21; $5.0 million added to the Homelessness Capital Projects Fund to establish a $10.0 million capital designation to support housing for unsheltered residents; and Establishment of the East County Economic Development/Infrastructure Improvement Fund with $5.0 million designated annually starting in FY 2018 -19 for a total of eight years through FY 2026 -27, with the suspension and redirection of funding to the Homelessness Capital Projects Fund for one year in FY 2019 -20. FUNDING CHALLENGES While each of the departments has identified strategies to close the funding gap and maintain core staffing, programs and services, there are several key funding challenges facing the County that could have significant impacts in the budget year and beyond . Homelessness continues to be a top priority at the State and local level . The current local housing crisis requires collaboration with cities and community partners to provide critical support services while increasing housing capacity. The Board -appro ved Homelessness Action Plan invests over $340 million over three years towards the Vision 2026 10X goal of eliminating homelessness in the County. To date, your Board has further increased funding to address homelessness bringing the total to $90 million annually including about $14 million in Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) funds and $9.7 million allocated directly to cities . This does not include funding that goes to public housing authorities, community -based organizations serving a specific city, or County programs serving specific geographic areas. At the State level, the Governor's May Revision provides over $1 billion in funding to address homelessness. This included $650 million in Homelessness Emergency Aid, with $275 million dedicated to counti es, $275 million committed to \"Big Cities\", and $100 million for Continuums of Care. The Budget Conference Committee recently passed the $650 million homelessness appropriation but did not include the allocation of funding among the \"Big Cities\", counties and Continuums of Care which will be addressed in a budget trailer bill. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Point -In-Time Count indicates an increase in homelessness of 43% in Alameda County over the last two years, with 80% unshel tered. While the State's investments are crucial for the County to respond to the shelter crisis, the use of one - time funding restricts the County's ability to effectively respond to a deepening ongoing crisis and provide sustainable services. xix Honorable Board of Supervisors -8- June 11, 2019 Federal actions that weaken the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may negatively impact the County's health care delivery system. In December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled the ACA unconstitutional on grounds that the individual mandate penalty is no longer enforceable. If this decision is upheld, health insurance coverage gains achieved through the ACA - including the Medicaid expansion, would be undone. Absent other federal or State action, an estimated 176,000 Alameda County residents could lose health insurance coverage. While the Governor's proposed changes t o the In -Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program will provide temporary financial relief, the cost to counties will continue to grow over time. In addition to increased costs driven by caseload growth, counties will also assume a larger share of costs associated with provider wage increases due to changes in the cost sharing formula in future years. Without additional State relief, growing IHSS costs will continue to be a significant concern. The Title IV -E Waiver has provided the County with flexibility t o invest in foster care prevention services and programs that would not otherwise be eligible for federal reimbursement. The Waiver is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2019, and pending federal reauthorization, the County may need to consider alternati ves to continue providing prevention services at current levels. Public Safety programs continue to experience increased costs due to inadequate State and federal funding. Most recently, cost increases associated with digital discovery due to the use of b ody- worn cameras by law enforcement have strained resources. There is currently no State or federal funding source to mitigate these costs. In addition, Public Safety programs funded by state sales taxes and Vehicle License Fees would feel an immediate im pact in the event of an economic downturn. Lastly, County General Fund support for the State Courts continues to increase significantly due to the ongoing reduction in Trial Court Funding revenue resulting from a growing decline in the Courts' collections of fines and forfeitures. LONG -TERM OBLIGATIONS In February 2018, Standard and Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings announced it had upgraded Alameda County's credit to the highest possible AAA rating and Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service reaffirmed t heir AAA ratings for the County. Alameda County is now one of only two California counties - along with San Diego County - to attain this rare \"triple -triple\" designation. While our credit rating upgrades are primarily attributable to your Board's adheren ce to your long - standing financial management policies, which include strategies and guidelines to build and maintain prudent reserves, the County has some long -term and unfunded obligations that must also be considered. Other outstanding debt includes th e County's shared ownership of the Coliseum/Arena and other prior capital commitments for essential facilities like the Highland Acute Care Tower Replacement project for the Alameda Health System, the Juvenile Justice Facility , and other capital projects. xx Honorable Board of Supervisors -9- June 11, 2019 The debt incurred by the County for capital improvements was based on responsible financial plans that identified revenue sources to retire the debt over time and ensure that the County was also able to maintain its core services and other mandated commitments. The Proposed Budget includes funds for annual debt service payments and the County's annual required contributions to the pension fund through the Alameda County Employees' Retirement Associati on (ACERA). Last year, ACERA lowered the discount rate from 7.6% to 7.25%, and the County anticipates that ACERA may continue to lower the discount rate in future years. Other actuarial changes such as increased life expectancy also increase pension liabi lities for the plan. As of December 31, 2018, ACERA's total unfunded actuarial accrued liability is over $2.1 billion. In response to significant increases in the County's unfunded pension liability, your Board has now authorized the transfer of up to $7 00 million into a designation to reduce the County's portion of the unfunded pension liability. Your Board's extension of the policy in June 2018 to annually augment the Designation for Unfunded Pension Liability by up to an additional five years is a significant factor in achieving and maintaining our strong credit ratings. Paying down future liabilities will reduce annual principal payments and interest, and will ultimately improve the County's ability to plan for and invest in future capital projects a nd initiatives while maintaining our strong credit ratings. While the Proposed Budget includes an increase of $2.1 million for major maintenance and the annual 1% contribution for capital projects, t he five -year Capital Improvement Plan to be presented t o your Board identifies over $150 million of unfunded capital projects and deferred major maintenance on County -owned properties that, if not addressed, will increase dramatically as buildings and infrastructure continue to age. Maintaining our strong cred it ratings will enable us to finance essential projects if necessary, and at lower interest rates, given the growing need for deferred maintenance and capital investments. PENDING FACTORS The current economic expansion is on track to soon become the lon gest ever recorded in the nation's history. Historical patterns confirm that expansions inevitably end, and the impact of the next downturn on the County - as safety net providers - will require balancing the increasing demand for services amidst declining revenues. The State's tax structure is highly sensitive to economic volatility, and a recession will likely result in a steep decline in General Fund dollars, constraining the State's ability to fund the cost of program responsibilities transferred to cou nties for health care, public assistance and public safety. The County's growing reliance on federal and State funding is increasingly concerning in the context of unprecedented federal deficit spending, which could result in funding cuts to the safety net or further program shifts to counties. As we prepare for the next recession, it is critical that we evaluate the continued use of short -term measures to balance the budget. Relying on short - term measures during an expansion results in the loss of those funding sources for future needs that intensify during a downturn. xxi Honorable Board of Supervisors -10- June 11, 2019 Other longer term issues such as health care and pension costs will continue to challenge our limited resources. Despite longstanding and ongoing support from the County, the Alameda Health System (AHS) is experiencing a major structural deterioration in i ts financial performance. AHS estimates that by the end of FY 2021 -22, it will not be able to achieve the declining negative net balance limit set forth in the Permanent Agreement with the County. AHS also anticipates it will have to repay up to $100 mill ion in Medicaid waiver overpayments. The County will continue to evaluate AHS's fiscal condition and will monitor progress towards developing a viable multi -year plan to address the structural financial deficit. VISION 2026 The Proposed FY 2019 -20 budget is an expression of Alameda County's values and is guided by your Board's Vision 2026 initiative that identifies the County's Shared Visions, 10X Goals and associated objectives within the Strategic Focus Areas that reflect c ore services provided by the County. Vision 2026 consists of six 10X Goals that reflect the County's core services and community priorities: Eliminate Homelessness; Healthcare for All; Employment for All; Eliminate Poverty and Hunger; Crime Free County; a nd Accessible Infrastructure. The Proposed Budget highlights the alignment of program goals and objectives with the County's 10X Goals in support of the four Shared Visions of a Healthy Environment; Safe and Livable Communities; a Thriving and Resilient Po pulation; and a Prosperous and Vibrant Economy, and are also highlighted in the Human Impacts, Children's Services, and Unincorporated Services budgets. RECOMMENDATIONS The FY 2019 -20 Proposed Budget is balanced and reflects the collective effort and c ontributions of County stakeholders to develop a sustainable approach to providing services in the coming year. In addition, balancing the budget using a significant amount of one -time funds will necessitate careful monitoring throughout the year to ensur e that expenditures remain within budget and revenue estimates are fully realized. As you conduct public hearings and deliberate on the FY 2019 -20 Proposed Budget, your Board's leadership and strong fiscal management will assist the County in once again m aintaining that critical balance between service demands and limited financial resources. Therefore, it is recommended that your Board: 1. Accept the FY 2019 -2020 Proposed Budget for review pending public hearings; 2. Set public hearings on the Proposed Budget to commence on Tuesday, June 25, 2019 as outlined in the Attachment; and xxii Honorable Board of Supervisors -11- June 11, 2019 3. Schedule public hearings and/or public meetings to consider charges for the Emergency Medical Services District, Vector Control Services District, Fire Department Emergency Medical Services, Flood Control District, Clean Water Protection, Public Works Agency - administered County Service Areas, and Lead Abatement as detailed in the attached budget hearing schedule.

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 -19, the Board of Supervisors adopted a three -year Homelessness Action Plan that outlines $340 million of ongoing and one -time investments to address homelessness in the County. The three -year Unincorporated Homelessness Action Plan devotes $10.6 million of the res ources in the Homelessness Action Plan to the unincorporated areas of the County. The County has also issued the first tranche of the $580 million Measure A1 general obligation bond to support the construction of affordable housing across the County. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY GENERAL GOVERNMENT 44 To da te, nearly $240 million of bond fund commitments have leveraged over $1.5 billion to support over 2,400 affordable units. The FY 2019 -20 State budget contains over $2.75 billion in new funding to address homelessness and housing. In keeping with the Govern or's concerns about the long -term sustainability of State revenues, most of the new funding is one -time. Included in the housing and homelessness appropriations is $640 million allocated to local jurisdictions for the Homeless Housing, Assistance, and Prev ention Program - with $175 million in funds allocated to counties, $275 million for large cities, and $190 million to Continuums of Care. While the State's investments are crucial for cities and counties to respond to the shelter crisis, the use of one -time sources restricts the County's ability and flexibility to effectively respond to the ongoing and worsening crisis. In addition to the funding for homelessness services, the State is providing $1.75 billion of additional funding and implementing various policy changes to spur the production of affordable housing. These new funds will support various housing programs, including grants and tax credits, to increase production and improve housing infrastructure. The County continues to be concerned about ade quate funding for systems and internal infrastructure for the General Government departments. While the $134 million in the FY 2018 -19 State budget and the additional $87.3 million in the FY 2019 -20 State budget to replace voting systems and strengthen ele ction technology security is welcome, local governments continue to operate with dated financial software in many key areas. As these systems reach the end of their useful life, the County will need new funding to replace them. The County will also continu e to monitor legislation that will impact how the County conducts its business as well as newly -created local mandates without sufficient funding.

In December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled ACA unconstitutional on grounds that the individual mandate penalty is no longer enforceable. The mandate was repealed effective 2019, and although the rest of the law is currently intact, the U.S. Department of Justice has urged a federal appeals court to strike down the ACA, arguing that e limination of the most significant provision of ACA makes the entirety of the law unconstitutional. If the lower court's decision is upheld, every ACA provision would be repealed, including but not limited to: Medicaid expansion; payment incentives and pr ovisions to increase quality of care; preexisting condition protections; provisions that improve the quality of health insurance plans; exchange subsidies; and establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Without State intervention, 193,000 Alameda County residents could lose coverage gained through Medicaid and Covered California, and the State's uninsured rate could rise from an all -time low of nine percent in 2016, to 11.7 percent in 2020, and 12.9 percent by 2023. California's Medi caid health care program, Medi -Cal, is currently operating under two federal waivers that are set to expire in 2020. The 1915(b) waiver funds services for Medi -Cal beneficiaries with severe and persistent mental illness. The 1115 Waiver (also known as Me di-Cal 2020) provides vital funding for the County's Whole Person Care program, AC Care Connect, a critical component of homelessness services and coordination. The Whole Person Care Pilot grant funds have supported the County's Vision 2026 10x Goal to El iminate Homelessness and the work of the Homelessness Council through initiatives that include a short -term housing assistance fund, supportive services including housing navigation and legal aid, and the creation of the Shared Health Information Exchange/ Community Health Record. The 1115 and 1915(b) Waivers have provided consistent sources of funding for the County to strengthen efforts to provide complex, supportive services for vulnerable residents including homeless individuals whose needs intersect mu ltiple health care program areas. These anticipated changes to federal law and State -administered programs create funding and operational challenges for the County and its health care partners, including Alameda Health System, to provide needed care to ch ildren, youth, seniors, adults with serious mental illness, those experiencing homelessness, and other vulnerable populations who rely on the County as the local safety net.

The Maintenance of Effort (MOE) that was implemented by the State as part of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 -18 Budget provided short -term relief to counties, but res ulted in significant cost increases in later years. While it is welcome relief to the County that the FY 2019 -20 State Budget will reduce the MOE inflation factor and set counties' MOE \"base\" at a lower level than under current law, the County is concerne d that the FY 2019 -20 State Budget only temporarily restores the 7% IHSS service hours reduction due to concerns about future revenue levels. The new MOE could also be ended by the State in future budgets, and statewide demographic and economic changes ma y cause the State to take that action. Since FY 2007 -08, the Department of Children and Family Services (CFS) has operated under a federal Title IV-E waiver. The Waiver provides a fixed funding allocation that provides the County flexibility in the use of federal funds for foster care and other child welfare services, including programs and services that would not be eligible for federal reimbursement absent the Waiver. Under the Waiver, the County has achieved improved outcomes for children and families involved in the child welfare and juvenile probation systems. The Waiver is set to expire on September 30, 2019, and without an extension of the Waiver or an alternate funding source, CFS is projected to receive less federal funds and may not be able to c ontinue certain programs and services. With the implementation of 1991 and 2011 Realignment, most State allocations have been replaced with direct funding from statewide Sales Tax and Vehicle License Fee receipts. During times of economic growth, counties experience revenue growth, but during an economic downturn, counties immediately see the loss of revenue at a time when Public Assistance programs are also encountering a spike in demand for services. The County understands that it is a matter of when, n ot if, the next recession will occur, and will continue to budget prudently to ensure the County can provide services through good and bad economic times.

Reduced travel and training for all personnel means only mandatory training will be allowed in all major service units. There may be reducti ons in necessary equipment and supplies for administrative staff and sworn personnel in Management Services, Detentions and Corrections, and Law Enforcement Services. Reduced Fixed Assets may necessitate that capital projects in Management Services be post poned until funding is made available. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs.

The Sheriff's Office has seen similar cost increases r elated to California Public Records Act information requests for personnel records and release of body camera footage. There is currently no State or federal funding source to help mitigate these costs. Since Fiscal Year 2007 -08, the Probation Department has operated programs under a Title IV -E Waiver (Waiver), a federal capped allocation program that allows the County flexibility in the use of federal funds for Foster Care and other Child Welfare services. With the Waiver set to expire in September 2019, the Probation Department's related revenue may decrease and impact related programs. The Probation Department is also heavily reliant on Vehicle License Fees (VLF) to fund Juvenile Probation programs. VLF will decline significantly in the event of an ec onomic slowdown. Several pending court cases may have an impact on the Sheriff's Office requirements for staffing at both court and detention facilities, potentially increasing Salary and Employee Benefits costs. The District Attorney and Public Defender are also facing additional State mandates that would strain existing staffing levels, with no identified funding source to mitigate these costs. State revenue from fines continues to decline, particularly for Trial Court Funding. Trial Court Funding reduct ions are due to motor vehicle fines which have seen an annual decline for several successive years, resulting in decreased resources available to the County.

ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPAR TMENT SUMMARY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS 110 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Board of Supervisors is the governing body of Alameda County and also serves as the governing board of the Flood Control and Water Conservation District, Alameda County Fire Department, and a number of other public entities. In addition, Board members serve on policy boards of regio nal and district organizations. Roles and Responsibilities The Board of Supervisors sets policy for County government, subject to a variety of changing demands and expectations. Each Board member shares a responsibility to represent the County as a whole, while representing a specific district from which he or she is elected. Fiscal Responsibilities The Board of Supervisors is responsible for helping to develop, adopt, and oversee the County budget, balancing expenses against revenues and reflecting mandat ed obligations as well as locally -identified priorities. As a primary management tool, the budget serves as a reflection of values and is subject to adjustment as conditions warrant and collective policy decisions dictate. Management Responsibilities A fu ndamental responsibility of each Supervisor is participation in the development and, from time to time, modification of policy. While a myriad of factors and forces influence the legislative process, key resources for advice and counsel are available from the County Agency/Department Heads who possess professional knowledge and procedural skill in evaluating policy options. An extension of this key function is the oversight of County operations to assure that policy, once adopted, is fully and appropriate ly carried out by the Department Heads, in collaboration with the County Administrator. By working with Agency/Department Heads, both elected and appointed, the Supervisors can assure themselves and their constituents that policy intent is fulfilled. Comm unity The needs and interests of constituents represent a significant area of responsibility for a Board member. Being available and responsive to their constituents is a high priority for all Supervisors and consistent with the tradition of good governan ce in Alameda County.

The survey is a requirement from the State Department of Health Care Services, which oversees all California counties' behavioral health departments. The survey asks a number of questions that consumers provide responses to on a 0 -to-5 Likert scale. Below are the satisfaction rates from the most recent MHSIP survey results from Fall 2017; each rate is the percentage of consumers who responded with a 4 (\"agree\") or 5 (\"strongly agree\") for a given question. The survey is administered to families of children, young adults, adults, and older adults who receive services from ACBH.

The Children's Services Budget highlights how the resources of the Co unty are allocated for services that protect and promote the well -being of children and demonstrates the County's commitment to children. Appropriations and revenues for children's services are budgeted in many County agencies and departments. Each Count y agency and department carefully analyzes its total budget to identify the dollars appropriated for children's services to produce the Children's Services Budget. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 -20 Children's Services Budget is showing a reduction in spending of nearly $24.5 million. It is important to note that the County maintains its commitment to providing children's services, and that this reduction is not due to County service cuts. The spending reduction is primarily due to lower caseloads in a few prog rams: Reduction in CalWORKs spending: $9.7 million Reduction in CalWORKs Child Care spending: $3.9 million Reduction in Child Welfare Services spending: $6.3 million California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) and CalWORKs Child Care caseloads fluctuate with economic conditions, and the continuing recovery has allowed more parents to enter the workforce and/or increase their wages. The County has also seen a steady decrease in Foster Care caseloads since the implementation of the Title IV-E Foster Care Waiver (Waiver) resulting in lower Child Welfare Services spending. The Waiver has allowed the County to invest more in preventative services and innovative programming that is not eligible for reimbursement without the Waiver. These inve stments, as well as a focus on family reunification, may be driving the lower caseload trend. ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ _________________ A NOTE ON THE CHILDR EN'S MEMORIAL COMMIT TEE In an annual public ceremony, the Alame da County Children's Memorial Project remembers child victims of violence by installing a permanent plaque with the names of the children who died the previous year, and reading aloud the names of all children who have died by violence in the County in the past decade. County programs work to promote the well -being of children and prevent child abuse, reduce youth violence, provide mental health services, and raise public awareness to help reduce these rates. ____________________ ____________________ _______ ____________________ __________ FINANCIAL SUMMARIES Children's Services 2018 -19 Budget Maintenance Of Effort Change from MOE VBB Final 2020 Budget Change from 2018 -19 Budget SERVICES 337 The FY 2019 -20 Children's Services Budget reflects a $ 24,499,482 , or 3.4 percent, decrease in spending and a $21,484,449 decrease in revenue compared to the prior year. The decrease in spending is primarily driven by Public Assistance and lower CalWORKs caseloa d from the Social Services Agency (SSA), which may be driven by the improved economy, the lower unemployment rate, and a decrease in new applications and approvals. Foster care caseloads have also decreased by 11.9 percent, reducing spending by nearly 15 percent compared to last year. SSA Children & Family Services has also reduced spending in anticipation of the Title IV -E Waiver set to expire in September 2019. Both Public Protection and Health Care program areas include budget adjustments that result in a r elatively flat children's service s budget compared to the prior year. Public Protection is budgeting decreased spending in the Probation Department for Community Probation and the Delinquency Prevention Network, returning these programs to their nor mal funding levels after one -time increases the prior year. Public Protection reductions are offset by overall budget increases for the District Attorney, mainly driven by increased spending to support the Human Exploitation and Trafficking (H.E.A.T.) pro gram, and increased spending for the Public Defender Juvenile Division. The $21,484,449 revenue reduction is driven by Public Assistance, Public Protection, and General Government offset slightly by increased funding in Health Care. A number of SSA progra ms are driven by cost reimbursement. As the County sees lower caseloads due to less need from the community - for example, the projected FY 2019 -20 decrease in foster care cases, CalWORKs cash aid, and child care cases - program expenses are incurred resu lting in less federal and State revenue available as reimbursement. The federal Title IV -E Waiver has provided SSA flexibility to fund child welfare services. With the Waiver expiring in September 2019, SSA is faced with identifying alternate funding sou rces to maintain critical services to children or restructuring programs to meet budget limitations. Public Protection, most ly attributed to Probation, is budgeting decreases in revenue , shifting costs back to County General Fund due to loss in one -time State revenue from the prior year. In General Government, revenue decreases are from the Community Development Agency's Lead Hazard Control program, County Library services, and the Early Care and Education Planning Council budgeted unde r the General Services Agency. Highlights from Health Care revenue increases include: Measure A base allocations for Latino Men and Boys and Unaccompanied Immigrant Youth programs ; Alameda County Behavioral Health Mental Health Services Act - Prevention & Early Intervention funding for school -based mental health services ; the Health Pipeline Partnership program; and the Public Health Department's Special Start revenue aimed to maximize health, social, and developmental outcomes for at -risk infants and supp ort for their families. The adjustments made in the Values -Based Budgeting (VBB) stage of the budget process were primarily within Public Health and Public Assistance due to additional State revenue and reduced spending to decrease net county cost. Final a djustments were solely from the Probation Department's decreased funding related to Juvenile Hall and general supervision. The net C ounty cost for Children's programs is $3,015,133 lower in FY 2019 -20 versus the prior year. The programs with the largest d ecrease in County General Fund con tribution are from Health Care Administration, Child Welfare Services (non -Title IV -E Waiver), and the CalWORKs program. For FY 2019 - 20, the largest increases in County investment are for School Health Cente rs, Zero to Fiv e Services, and Public H ealth programs that coordinate services for families to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities.

Since that time, the number of children in Out -of-Home Foster care and the number of children receiving In -Home Services has stabilized. In 2014, the County began a new Waiver cycle (2014 -19), renamed The California Well -Being Project, which is focused on improving internal child welfare practices. In Janua ry 2017, California began implementing Continuum of Care Reform (CCR) ushering in a series of significant changes to the Child Welfare system aimed at improving outcomes for children, youth, and their families. The federal Title IV -E Waiver is set to expi re in 2019. A strong commitment of State and federal resources is needed to continue reforms and maintain existing programs. 268 245 231 211 209 142153 152 90 78 66 050100150200250300 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Average Daily Population at Juvenile Justice Center (Juvenile Hall) Source: Alameda County Probation Department Robust county wide d iversion efforts and Probation -funded program initiatives, in co njunction with an overall reduction in the number of juvenile arrests, have contributed to the decline in the average daily population in the Juvenile Hall.

NOTES ON DEFINITIONS AND METHODS The Alameda County Children's Services Budget reports all budgeted appropriations and revenues administered or provided by the agencies and departments of the County for children's services. It is compiled from data provided by County agencies and departm ents and is a complex and careful extrapolation of the portion of an agency or department's total budget that is for children's services. The County does not maintain a separate budget for children's services. The Children's Services Budget includes ser vices that directly benefit children, such as child and youth health services, child welfare and juvenile justice services, as well as services provided to parents or families on behalf of, or because of, the presence of a child, such as CalWORKs grants, c hild care, and child support services. The County maintains its 1970 -71 Child Development Services Maintenance of Effort (MOE) amount of $139,592 per the mandates of California Education Code 8279 and 8279.1 and meets the California Department of Educatio n MOE requirement through the Children's Services Budget. A child is defined for the majority of services, as being age 0 -17 years (that is, up to the eighteenth birthday). However, services provided to youth over the age of 18 (for example, for youth emancipating from foster care) are also included in the Children's Budget. Admi nistrative costs of services, such as support staff, operating costs, etc., are not identified in this report. ALAMEDA COUNTY SPECI AL BUDGETS CHILDREN'S SERVICES 373 A mandatory service is defined as a service or program that is required to be provided by law. Such services are frequently, although not always , funded by the federal and/or State government, and usually require matching County funding. A discretionary service is a service that is not required to be provided by law. Discretionary services may be funded entirely by the County or by a combination of sources including federal, State, or other sources. Not included in the Children's Services Budget are allocations of universal expenditures that benefit all citizens uniformly, such as, environmental protection or countywide law enforcement services. Also excluded are parts of programs such as CalWORKs fraud prevention, job training, or substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental health programs that are provided for the adults in the programs. Budget versus actual spending is reported and reader s should note that the amount appropriated for a program or service may differ from what is ultimately spent in the Fiscal Year. State funding in this document includes State General Fund as well as 1991 and 2011 Realignment revenue.

CBOs eligible for the COLA are those whose contracted allocations are funded in whole or part with County General Fund revenue. The 3.5% COLA was calculated solely on the General Fund amount. Those CBOs under contract for sp ecific rate or payment amounts are not eligible for the COLA. General Government CBO expenditures increased by $5. 8 million due to increases in Housing & Community Development contracts. The $67.2 million increase in Health Care Services CBO contracts is l argely driven by increases in mental health services ($27.4 million), alcohol and drug programs ($19.9 million) and Alameda County Care Connect ($11.1 million). Of the $496.7 million in health care service s contracts, approximately $81.2 million is for con tracted health services delivered by the Alameda Health System. CBO funding includes $24 .3 million for Measure A funded contracts in the Health Care Services Agency. The $2.4 million increase in Public Assistance CBO contracts includes approximately an $88 0,000 increase to Area Agency on Aging programs and $1 million increase to Children & Family Services. The $85. 2 million in Public Assistance CBO Contracts includes $10.5 million in Emergency Food & Shelter Services. Public Protection CBO contracts include a $4.1 million decrease, driven by a $3.4 million decrease in Community Probation Programs and a $2.3 million decrease in AB 109 Realignment Adult Services, partially offset by a $660,000 increase in Sheriff's Office programs and a $77 0,000 increase in Ju venile Probation and Camps Funding Program. The following list of Alameda County CBO contracts for FY 2019 -20 is organized by program area and service/program.
