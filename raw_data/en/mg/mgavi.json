Prior to implementing the trial, a Phase 1 study was required and approval from FDA thatan IND application was not required since the end point beingmeasured was reduction in hot flashes in menopausal women.Menopause, for purposes of FDA is not considered a disease. Thestudy was delayed for more than a year in order to prepare a bota-nically authenticated and chemically and biologically standardizedextract. It was ascertained that the biological endpoint for purposesof the study would be interaction with certain serotonin receptors,in vitro. The study preparations had to be formulated and were sub-jected to accelerated stability studies. During the recruitment ofsuitable subjects the results of the WHI (Women s Health Initiative) caused difficulty in the ability to recruit suitable women since thestudy had four arms, i.e. Black Cohosh, Red Clover, Placebo andPrempro and many women were reluctant to enter the trial if therewas a possibility that there would be taking Prempro. Because ofthis, only 88 subjects were recruited of the 128 initially planned.However, the study was powered sufficiently if the dropout ratewas less than 15%. In the final analysis, Red Clover was shown topositively affect cognition but neither test preparation reducedhot flashes. A discussion of these results will be presented. S-2Botanicals and NMR-based Metabolomics: A Perfect Holistic Match Verpoorte YH, Choi HK 1Department of Pharmacognosy, Leiden,The Netherlands, Email: VERPOORT@LACDR.LeidenUniv.nl An estimated 40,000 -70,000 plant species are used as medicines worldwide. Some of these are extensively studied and their use issupported by clear clinical evidence. But in fact most have not beenstudied in any detail, and little is known about their activity, modeof action and possible active compounds. This poses two major problems, one is the acceptance of botanicals that are not yet evi-dence-based, the other is quality control. In fact acceptance is ham-pered by the fact that no methods for proper quality control areavailable if no active compound(s) is/are known. With globalizationthe use of botanicals is clearly increasing. Pharmacognosy has thusa major task in developing medicinal plants into evidence-basedmedicines. This will include both mentioned aspects: evidence foractivity and quality control. In the past decades drug developmenthas gone from in-vivo testing into molecular based assays (High Throughput Screening, HTS) for finding new leads. Certainly byHTS one may find active compounds in medicinal plants, but syn-ergy and pro-drugs will certainly not be found in such an approach.We pharmacognosists should thus rethink our approaches forproving activity of medicinal plants. This is where systems biologyand metabolomics do offer interesting options. It means going backtoin-vivo pharmacology in combination with the \"-omics \"technol- ogies to measure the response of a test organism on treatment withthe medicinal plant, and metabolomics to phytochemically charac-terize the medicinal plant. By chemometric methods, such as mul-tivariate analysis, links can be made between compounds presentin the plant and activities observed in the model organism. Thatmeans that not only active compounds, but also synergy and pro-drugs can be found. This approach will also be the basis for qualitycontrol. By using metabolomics in combination with multivariateanalysis one can define the required profile for activity. ParticularlyNMR-based metabolomics has a great potential for both qualitycontrol and identification of compounds related to activity. S-3Evaluation of the Anti-inflammatory Potential of Chinese Botanicals Bauer R1, Adams M, Fischer M, Gusenleitner S, Sch\u00fchly W 1Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, Karl-Franzens-University Graz,Universit\u00e4tsplatz 4, 8010 Graz, Austria Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been using about 1300 plants for anti-inflammatory purposes. Activity guided isolation ina medium throughput approach has resulted in the discovery of anumber of new drug leads.

Overexpression of this transcription factor is associatedwith inflammatory diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, atheroscle-rosis, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.

S-5Ethnobotany, Traditional Medicine and Dietary Supplements:Research Priorities and Lessons to be Learned Balick MJ1 1Institute of Economic Botany, The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, New York 10458, U.S.A. There are estimated to be 420,000 species of higher plants on earth, about half of which are found in the tropics. Over millennia, peoplehave learned to use plants to sustain their lives. Ethnobotany is ascience that studies the relationship between plants, people andtraditional culture. This presentation discusses the study of plantsused in traditional healing, with examples from Belize, CentralAmerica, The Pacific Island region of Micronesia, and New York Cityby a Dominican immigrant community. Traditional knowledge inmany parts of the world, including our own, has \"devolved \", or dis- appeared when its practitioners die without teaching the knowl-edge to the next generation. The implications of this for naturalproducts research and development and safe and proper use ofnew plant species as dietary supplements will be discussed. Herbsused by traditional peoples have been subjected to many genera-tions, even centuries of trial and error experimentation, and thereis much that these people can teach us about their efficacy and use.Ethnobotanical knowledge can be of great value in addressing con-temporary issues in supplement and drug development, publichealth and sustainable resource use and conservation. However, inseeking to fulfill this potential, scientists find themselves in a raceagainst time, with both habitats being destroyed and indigenousknowledge about the uses of the plants and their environment rap-idly being lost. There are ways to reduce this destruction of human-ity s collective wisdom before it is too late. S-6Known Natural Products with Austria To date more than 170,000 natural compounds [1,2] are published. The main part of these compounds belongs to secondary metabo-lites, which provide living systems with their characteristic fea-tures mandatory for surviving. They contain an inherently large-scale of structural diversity. About 40% of the chemical scaffolds ofpublished natural products (NPs) are unique and have not beensynthesized by any chemist [3]. Accordingly, a large number of drugleads and hits are conserved in the inexhaustible pool of NPs pre-screened by evolution. But how to dig out and to recognize the re-spective drug leads is a challenging task. Although a random selec-tion of plant materials seems not to be a very efficient strategy for the discovery of new biologically active compounds, many todaywell-known natural drug leads are based on a serendipitous find-ing. An example of a successful random study will be presentedfrom our laboratory, which has recently resulted in the identifica-tion of isogentisin, a secondary metabolite of Gentiana lutea L., as a novel compound for the prevention of smoking-caused endothelialinjury [4]. A more rationalized access to bioactive compounds of-fered by in silico tools e.g. pharmacophore-based virtual screening,docking experiments and the parallel screening concept. Screeningof compounds against a set of models representing a large numberof targets aims to predict the pharmacological profiles of thesemolecules including desirable activities and undesirable effects. Inthis presentation an example application employing a virtual paral-lel screening approach with a collection of 2208 in-house gener-ated pharmacophore models on constituents of the aerial parts ofthe medicinal plant Ruta graveolens L. will be illustrated [5].

S-7Antimalarial Agents from Plants: Neocryptolepine Derivatives and StandardisedExtracts from Traditional Medicine Pieters L1 1Laboratory of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Analysis, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1,2610 Antwerp, Belgium Plants are still an important resource for the discovery of new drugs, such as new antimalarial agents. In search for novel antima-larial compounds, we focused on neocryptolepine (5-methyl-5 H- indolo[2,3- of the minor alkaloids of Cryptolepis sanguinolenta , a plant used in traditional medicine in Central and West Africa. A series of chloro- and aminoalkylamino-substitutedneocryptolepine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated asantiplasmodial agents. The evaluation included cytotoxicity(MRC5 cells), inhibition of -hematin and DNA-interac- assay). of aminoalkylaminochains increased the antiplasmodial activity of the neocryptolepinecore substantially. The most active compounds showed antiplas-modial activities in the nM range. Nevertheless, some compoundsthat were selected for in vivo evaluation in infected mice were not sufficiently active, or toxic to the animals. A different approach todevelop antimalarial drugs from nature is the standardisation ofplant extracts with a proven efficacy used in traditional medicine.Nauclea pobeguinii (Rubiaceae) is a tree from which the bark is widely used in African traditional medicine against malaria-likesymptoms. Alkaloids such as the major compound strictosamideare expected to be responsible for the activity. An HPLC methodwas developed and validated for the quantification of strictosamidein an 80% EtOH extract of the stem bark of N. pobeguinii . This ex- tract, containing 5.6% (w/w) strictosamide, was evaluated in vivo in the Plasmodium berghei mouse model in a suppressive treatment regimen. It was orally dosed (PO) at 300 mg/kg 2 \u00d7/day during 5consecutive days. Another group was treated intraperitoneally (IP)at 50 mg/kg using the same dosing regimen. Treatment with thecrude extract, either after oral or intraperitoneal dosing, resultedin moderate depression of parasitaemia during dosing, howeverquickly followed by a full relapse (mean survival time = about 13days). At termination of the experiment at day 21, a single survivorin the PO group was apparently cured (no parasitaemia), the singlesurvivor in the IP group showed high parasitaemia and was in amoribund state. It can be concluded that the crude extract of N. po- beguinii has slight antimalarial potential when administered orally in a suppressive dosing regimen of 2 \u00d7 5 days at York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

S-8Triterpenoids as Anti-inflammatory Compounds of Natural Simmet 1Institute of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 20,D-89081 Ulm, Germany Despite the progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation, the current treatment optionsare not satisfactory. The transcription factor NF- B, a key player in the development and progression of chronic inflammation, is con-sidered a promising target for therapeutic intervention. In Ayurve-dic medicine, extracts from the oleogum resin from Boswellia ser- rata are being used as anti-inflammatory remedies. After purifica- tion to chemical homogeneity, we have pen-tacyclic triterpenoids including acetyl-boswellic acids (ABAs). Us-ing LPS of human monocytes, we found that ABAsinhibit NF- B signaling. We identified specific inhibitory effects on IB kinase (IKK), which is pivotal for the degradation of the NF- B inhibitor I B, as well as the phosphorylation of p65, two steps es- sential for NF- B activation and the subsequent cytokine expres- sion. Using active human recombinant IKK and IKK , we posi- tively confirmed the direct effect of the ABAs on the IKK complex.We further studied the effects of systemically applied AK BA on the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E-de-ficient (apoE /) mice. Atherosclerotic lesion in those animals by weekly intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide(LPS) injections. LPS alone increased the atherosclerotic lesion sizeby two-fold and treatment with AK BA significantly reduced it by about 50%. Daily treatment of the mice with AK BA potently inhib- ited the NF- B activation in atherosclerotic to sig- nificant down-regulation and TF. By contrast, AK BA did not affect the plasma concentrations of triglycerides, total cho-lesterol, and various subsets of lymphocyte-derived cytokines.Thus, the inhibition of NF- B signalling by constituents of the oleo- gum resins from Boswellia species might represent an alternative for conventional treatments of chronic inflammatory diseases suchas atherosclerosis.

S-9Scientific Studies of a Popular Sri Lankan Indigenous Therapeutic Agent Rathakalka Used in Pediatric Practice Amarasinghe APG1 1Institute of Indigenous Medicine, University of Colombo, Rajagiriya, Sri Lanka The test drug Rathakalka, selected for these studies, is a popular Sri Lankan indigenous medical recipe specially used for children. Aclinical study of the Rathakalka recipe revealed significant changesin and serum comple-ments C4) levels in infants and young children. Animal experi-ment with albino rats showed its highest anti-inflammatory activ-ity 3 after induction of edema. In-vivo experiment demon-strated that Rathakalka reduced yeast induced elevation of thebody temperature in rats. In-vitro experiment revealed that therecipe has anti-bacterial effect Listeria monoytogenes . In-vivo experiment showed that the prolong administration does not produce any tox-icity changes in rabbits. Microbiological study indicated that themicrobial colony counts observed in this study were with in thelimits acceptable by the World Health Assembly (W.H.A.). Theseresults scientifically evaluate that the drug samples are tested anddeemed microbiologically safe and up to the microbial qualitystandards. These studies confirmed the presence of immune en-hancing effect, anti-bacterial effect, anti pyretic effect, anti-inflam-matory effect, non toxicity, and microbiological safety in Rathakal-ka.Acknowledgements : Thanks to the support and advice given by Prof. S.

S-10Antidepressant New Herbal Product Development Wang EZ, Jiang Y1 1Suzhou Yi-hua Biomedical Technology Co. Ltd, PRC Depression related disorders are among the most common psychi- atric disorders that affect all age groups of the general population.Currently, the preferred treatment is with pharmacological drugsthat have antidepressant or anti-anxiety properties. However,these synthetic antidepressants have numerous and often seriousadverse effects, including impaired cognition, ataxia, aggression,sexual dysfunction, tolerance dependence and so on. Withdrawalreactions on termination after long-term administration are also amajor limiting factor in the use of these agents. Herbal remedies,for example St. John s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or Kava has re- cently gained popularity as an alternative treatment for mild tomoderate depression. Excitingly, we have discovered a medicinalplant named ADP, Chinese traditional medicine, used for inflamma-tion and rheumatic conditions. Its extracts showed significantlyantidepressant effect, and minor analgesic, tranquilizing actions, si-multaneity, without exciting effect. We believe that it could soonbecome \"Chinese St. John sw o r t \". Pharmacodynamics-experiment (positive control is fluoxetine and Venlafaxine) showed the curativedose (amount to clinical mimic-dose 80 times) ADPwas safety. The safe index of ADP for mouse is LD50/ED50 = 152 - 162 (TST) (Fluoxetine s LD50/ED50=62). The in vitro test and the mechanism of action test indicate that ADP obtained through themethod for this invention has prominent (re) uptake inhibiting ef-fect on noradrenaline (NA) and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT),and when compared with the extract prepared by using the exist-ing reflux method, it has the advantages of increasing the alkaloidcontent and the biological activity of the extract. Therefore, ADPmay serve as the noradrenaline and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine and/or dopamine (re) uptake inhibitor for development into antidepres-sant drug, anti-anxiety drug, sedative hypnotic, and anti-seniledementia drug. By now, we have executed 2 applications for Chinainvention patents and authorized by Chinese Patent Bureau(ZL03115911.7; ZL200410084791.7). Meanwhile, we have exe-cuted 1 PCT application at 2005, and entered into U.S.A, Japan, Can-ada, Korea, India, Russia and European Union from 2007(WO2006/058487 A1). S-11Quality Control and Standardisation of Botanicals -From Cultivation of Medicinal Plants up to its Clinical Application Kamil M1, Naji MA 1Zayed Complex For Herbal Research & Traditional Medicine -WHO Collaborative Centre, DPH & P-Health Authority Abu Dhabi, P.O. Box: 29300, Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates In the recent years with ever growing commercialization in the field of herbal medicines, there has been an instant demand forquality control of the drugs used in this system. In the present pa-per an attempt has been made for a sequential study of the qualitycontrol protocols for the herbal medicinal products from selectionof medicinal plants, good agricultural practices, cultivation, goodfield collection practices, source and period of collection, identifi-cation and authentication, storage, chemical standardization, assay,good manufacturing practices, pre clinical studies up to clinical ap-proach, with special reference to maintain standardization at allstages. Besides the above protocols, this study deals with ap-proaches towards establishing the quality and safety -starting from preliminary examination of the botanicals, York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Chemical assay and phytochemicalscreening of different extracts using modern extractors and recentChromatographic and spectroscopic techniques have been de-scribed. Different stages, i.e. quality control studies of raw botani-cals, method of processing, finished herbal products, standardiza-tion procedures at all stages from birth of the botanicals up to itsclinical application will be discussed. Practical experiences for theidentification of non-prescription and prescription syntheticchemical medicines (illegal addition) in quite a large number of re-cent herbal medicinal products will be described in detail.

S-13Eliminating Analytical Ambiguity in the Scientific Study, Development and Quality Control ofNatural Health Products and Dietary Supplements Brown PN1 1Integrative Bioscience Research Cluster, British Columbia Institute of Technology, 3700 Willingdon Avenue,Burnaby, British Columbia, V5G 3H2, Canada Recent surveys have shown that upwards of 71% of Canadians con- sume natural health products (NHPs) either on a daily or seasonalbasis [1] and 73% of American adults surveyed reported takingsome type of non-prescription vitamin, dietary supplement or min-eral supplements over the course of a year [2]. The prominence ofthese products in the health care setting is further buoyed by thecurrent deluge of adverse drug effects in conventional medicines.Yet 48% of Americans surveyed believe supplements are not ad-equately tested [3] and 46% of Canadians agree that a lot of claimsmade by NHP manufacturers are unproven [1]. In 2002, the WorldHealth Organization attributed problems related to TraditionalMedicines, including poor quality research, to a paucity of soundmethodology and short-supply of resources [4]. A fundamental sci-entific flaw of much of the clinical research on botanical-basedproducts has been the failure to characterize the study material, anomission that renders resulting data meaningless [5,6]. Adequatelyvalidated methods are an essential prerequisite for producing fair,objective evaluations. A shared feature of CGMP for NHPs and Die-tary Supplements is establishment and demonstration of confor-mity to specifications for identity, purity, and content of defined at- tributes. This system disintegrates if the analytical methods em-ployed to ensure products meet specifications are not fit for theirintended purpose, i.e. validated. A validation study is the scientificprocess for demonstrating that a test is transferable and will reli-ably deliver the correct or \"true \"analytical value. The ICH and U.S. Law (Federal Register 60:11259 -11262) mandate determination of accuracy, precision, specificity, detection limit, quantitation lim-it, linearity, and range of any test used for determination of con-formity to content (assay) specifications. This review will explorethe role of validation and show how failure to properly validate testmethods impacts both scientific study and product quality in themarketplace.

S-14Traditional Knowledge Guided Research to Identify Legitimate Rareand Unavailable Herbs Venkatasubramanian P1, Subrahmanya Kumar Attur Post, via Yelahanka,Bangalore 560064, India As per the principles and practice of Ayurveda, herbs with similar pharmacological properties can be used as substitutes wheneverthe original herb is in short supply. There are at least 30 pairs ofherbs and substitutes that are mentioned in classical Ayurveda texts[1].Cyperus rotundus L. (Cyperaceae) is claimed to be a legitimate substitute for Aconitum heterophyllum Wall. ex Royle (Ranuncula- ceae). A. heterophyllum is a rare and expensive Himalayan herb while C. rotundus is a common, tropical, marshy weed. Going by published literature, the two herbs are taxonomically unrelatedand dissimilar in major chemicals. However, our preliminary stud-ies indicate that the chromatographic profiles [2] and pharmacolog-ical (anti-diarrhoeal) activity are similar in the two drugs makingfurther exploration worthwhile. Research of this kind is essentialto identify new substitutes for unavailable herbs and to throw lighton the Ayurvedic strategy adopted for selecting substitute drugs.Acknowledgements : Thanks go to Al-Ameen College of Pharmacy for conducting the animal studies.

The overall objective of the MedicinalPlant Metabonomics research program is to assess the capacity forcompound discovery by mass spectrometry and NMR-based met-abolomics technologies and to quantitatively compare metabolitesspecific to individual medicinal plants. An extract of a single leaf ofSt. John sw o r t( Hypericum perforatum L) has been found to contain more 2,500 unique phytochemicals while extracts of species in thegenus Scutellaria contain more than 4,200 individual compounds. A simple cup of coffee from a commercial retailer can contain be-tween 8,000 -10,000 distinct phytochemicals. Efforts to understand this phytochemical complexity and to develop models for study ofchemodiversity form the foundation of future research in com-pound discovery, medicinal plant development and optimized di-ets. S-16Quality Evaluation and Quality Control of Botanicals and Traditional Chinese Medicine Luo GA1, Liang QL, Yang HH, Wang YM 1Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, P.R. China This presentation will introduce a systemic strategy and relative technologies for the quality evaluation of Traditional Chinese Med-icine (TCM), including the identification and differentiation of bo-tanicals and also the quality standard of TCM products. The empha-sis will focus on the quality control of manufacture of TCM prod-ucts, especially to introduce an application of NIRS online analyticaltechnique and quality-based control system into the extractionprocedure of TCM. The system hardware was composed of the ex-traction equipment, the online sample pre-treatment subsystem,the NIRS subsystem, the online NIRS analysis and subsystem, and the automatic control subsystem. A diagramof the system is shown in Fig. 1. The whole system includes cooper- ative-working hardware and software components. The extractionprocess of TCM was analyzed using online NIRS, and the resultsdemonstrated that NIRS was feasible to be applied to online moni-toring and controlling in the manufacturing of TCM. Based on theonline NIRS analysis technology, the real-time monitoring of the ef-fective components or indicative components in the extractionprocedure, the analysis of the extraction ratios, the diagnosis ofthe extraction procedure, and the real-time feedback control basedon the quality status were actualized.S-17HPTLC for Quality Control of Traditional Chinese Medicines: Identification Switzerland For cGMP compliance of dietary supplements and quality control of herbal medicinal products, proper identification of herbal raw ma-terial is of great importance. In this respect Traditional ChineseMedicines (TCM) can present challenging tasks because pharmaco-poeial drug monographs may include multiple species and oftendon t provide sufficient analytical methods. High Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) is a very suitable tool for di-rect comparison of fingerprints from multiple samples side by sideand allows determining similarities and differences of related spe-cies. Using \"BEIMU \"(Fritillaria spp.) and \"CANGZHU \"(Atractylodes spp.) as examples, the development and use of validated methodsfor this purpose is illustrated. The traditional approach of associat-ing the quality of an herbal medicine with the quantity of a markerbecomes questionable, if the product contains more than one plantmaterial. CANGZHU XIANGLIAN SAN berberin as principal marker. Berberin ispresent in Coptis only. This creates the possibility for adulteratedproducts, missing either of the other two plants to enter the mar-ket. We propose an HPTLC method that allows a more completemonitoring of quality by ensuring the presence of all species in theappropriate quantity. S-18Relative and Absolute Structures of Diospongin A, B and C Jun Yin, Zhihui Liu, Na Han, Bin Xiao College of TCM, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University,103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, China While screening 60 extracts for their stimulatory activity on prolif- eration of osteoblast-like cell line and on inhibition of osteoclasticformation, the water extract of Dioscorea spongiosa displayed the strongest stimulation on osteoblastic proliferation and strong in-hibition on osteoclastic formation. This water extract was sepa-rated using bioassay-guiding fractionation and three new diaryl-heptanoids were isolated and purified. The structures of threenew diarylheptanoids were elucidated by analysis of NMR, IR spec-tra and high resolution FAB MS. The relative stereochemistry of diospongin A and B was determined by ROESY spectra and couplingconstants in 1HNMR spectra and their absolute structures were Fig. 1 The system framework of the NIRS analysis and intelligent control system for York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

So there was some difficulty in the decision ofits relative and absolute configuration. The relative configurationof diospongin C also can be determined by analysis coupling con-stants of two protons of C-2, C-4 and C-6 in projections ofone acetonide derivative and optimizing dihedralangles [1]. Its absolute stereochemistry was identified by the CDspectrum of its dibenzoat product [2]. All the three compoundswere examined the inhibitory activity on osteoclast formation andbone resorption induced by PTH in bone organ culture system. Ex-cept for diospongin A, diospongin B and C showed potent inhibitioneven at a concentration of 20 \u00b5M, which demonstrates that the ste-reochemistry was important to structure-activity relationship ofthese diarylheptanoids.

S-19Sourcing of Quality Raw Materials for Indian System of Medicine (ISM) and Botanical Drugs Bedi YS1, Dutt HC 1Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR), Canal Road, Jammu Tawi-180001, India Globally, there has been an unparalleled growth in the plant-de- rived medicinally useful formulations, drugs and health care prod-ucts, with annual growth rates between 10 -20% in most of the countries. According to WHO, the international market of herbalproducts is estimated to be US$ 62 billion which is poised to growto US$ 5 trillion by the year 2050. This has attracted many largepharmaceutical and consumer product companies worldwide tohave herbals/botanicals in their product portfolio. India is no ex-ception to it and has a competitive edge as Indian Traditionaldrugs/products, have their roots in time tested systems of medicinenamely, Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Renewed interest in botanicalproducts has resulted into a huge international trade in raw plantmaterial, feeding a range of such industries, including the $20 bil-lion botanical medicine market. Presently between 75 and 85% ofthe raw materials for the botanical industry are sourced from wild.Due to the increasing public demand for quality botanical products,some companies are now making efforts to acquire at least a por-tion of their raw material from sustainable and ethical sources, butmost invest little in this side of their business. The existing industrypractice often promotes poor management of species and few ben-efits for the collectors and cultivators, and many companies remaindistant and unaware of the conditions under which raw materialsare sourced. However, there also exist opportunities to createchange in this sector. The source and quality of raw materials, stor-age, post-harvest handling play a pivotal role in guaranteeing thequality and stability of ISM & botanical preparations. In India, in ad-dition to the promotion of cultivation of medicinal and aromaticplants (MAPs) by certain government departments and R&D insti-tutes, of late some private herbal drug industries have also startedsourcing their requirement of herbal raw material from cultivated sources. The cultivation of MAPs, on the other hand, would not onlylead to better control over quality of the end products but will alsoreduce anthropogenic stress on wild stands. The presentation willillustrate the efforts being made in India in general and at the Indi-an Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM -CSIR) in particular for the sourcing and sustainable supply of raw materials for ISM & Bot-anical industry. S-20The CIHR Team in Aboriginal Antidiabetic Medicines: A Community-Based CollaborativeApproach Uniting Healers and BiomedicalScientists to Validate Cree Traditional Medicine Haddad PS1 1CIHR Team in Aboriginal Anti-diabetic Medicines, Department of Pharmacology, University of Montreal,Montreal, Quebec, Canada Obesity and Type 2 diabetes are considered as global epidemics by the WHO. Aboriginal populations such as the Cree of Eeyou Istchee(James Bay area of northern Quebec) are particularly affected andsuffer greater complications, in part because of the cultural inad-equacy of modern pharmaceutical therapies. A multidisciplinaryteam was therefore put together to explore the antidiabetic poten-tial of Boreal forest plants stemming from Cree Traditional Medi-cine (TM). The team is composed equally of scientists with exper-tise in botany, phytochemistry, nutrition, pharmacology, biochem-istry, toxicology and clinical endocrinology as well as Cree Eldersand members of various Cree health-related institutions, notablyincluding the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of JamesBay (CBHSSJB). A novel ethnobotanical approach based on diabetessymptoms was used to identify potential antidiabetic plants. A totalof 17 species were characterized phytochemically and screened forprimary and secondary antidiabetic activity, toxicological potentialand mode of action using a comprehensive platform of bioassays.Most promising species were subjected to bioassay-guided frac-tionation to identify active principles. Bioavailibility as well as anti-hyperglycemic and anti-obesity efficacy are then confirmed usingin vivo animal models of obesity, insulin resistance or diabetes.Clinical studies are also underway to document the safety and effi-cacy of selected species using a culturally-adapted, all-inclusive,observational protocol. Finally, our project represents a pilot studyfor the integration of Cree TM into diabetes care for the CBHSSJB.Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. S-21Understanding Botanical Dietary Supplements: The Research Need for Well-Characterized TestMaterials -Research Grade Botanicals Miller JS1 1Dean and Vice President for Science, The New York Botanical Garden Interpreting research on botanical dietary supplements, and also replicating research from other labs to confirm results, is compli-cated by the dietary supplements themselves, which are complexchemical mixtures with composition that may vary dependent onthe source of the raw materials, processing and formulation, andstability of the final product. All pharmacological research requiresthat the substances being tested be characterized sufficiently sothat studies can be interpreted as well as replicated and confirmedby other research groups. The chemical composition of botanicaldietary supplements is influenced by a wide variety of factors in-cluding identity of the source plant material, geographical originand environmental factors, methods of harvest and processing, for-mulation, and age of the processed materials. The influence ofthese factors is reviewed, recommendations are provided for con-trolling the effect of each variable, and a means of presenting theseresearch results is York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

S-22Screening the Efficacy of an Ayurvedic Botanical Formula: \"Shothahara Compound \" through Scientific Kumari MWSJ1, Ravishankar B2, Dewedi RB2 1Institute of Colombo, Rajagiriya, Sri Lanka 2Institute of Post Graduate Teaching and Research inAyurveda, Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar, India Ayurveda is an essentially authentic practical science and all the fundamental principles ascertain in it have initiated from a philo-sophical background and passing through the science to accom-plish its ultimate goal. The main objective of this research was totest the efficacy of an Ayurvedic botanical formula \"Shothahara Compound \"via scientific and philosophical approaches considering the Ayurvedic form of dried water-soluble extract. The study wasspecially planned to evaluate Ayurveda principles in the light of sci-entific testing by the animal and clinical experiments. The assess-ment of Dipana Pachana activity, Muthrala activity, Amahara effect,Rasayana effect and Shothahara effect were evaluated by using afood consumption test, effect on fecal output, effect of food conver-sion ratio, body weight changes, diuretic activity, effect on serumtotal cholesterol and high-density cholesterol, adoptogenic activity,carrageenan induced hind paw edema in rats and capillary perme-ability in mice. Charles foster strain albino rats and mice in eithersex, bred in animal house of Institute of Post Graduate Teachingand Research in Ayurveda -India, were used for animal trials. Pa- tients suffering from different types of oedema were subjected forclinical study. The data generated from the studies clearly indicatedthat the subjective Ayurveda basic principles can be tested more ef-ficiently and interpreted logically using modern scientific parame-ters and results can be expressed objectively to open discussions inthe scientific forums for the advancement of science. S-24Application of Proteomics in Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Guo DA1, Liu X, Yue QX, Ma C, Guan SH, Yang M, Jiang BH 1Shanghai Research Center for TCM Modernization, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academyof Sciences, 201203, P.R. China Proteomic method (two-dimensional electrophoresis and MS/MS) was used in studying the mechanisms (TCMs) including Ganoderma lucidum, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Panax the effects of Sal- via miltiorrhiza, a TCM popularly used for treating cardiovascular diseases, on the protein expression profiles of platelets, cardiomyo-cytes and heart tissues were checked. The results indicated that sal-vianolic acids from Salvia miltiorrhiza could inhibit the aggregation and adhesion of platelets, migration of cardiomyocytes and couldprotect from ischemia-reperfusion injury both in vitro andin vivo . The effects of salvianolic acids might be based on regulation of expression of proteins related to calcium ion binding,cell skeleton structure, elimination of reactive oxygen species, re-sponse to stress, etc. Furthermore, combined effects of salvianolicacids and notoginsengnosides, a TCM formula were also studied.The proteomic results showed that, in adjusting the un-normalprotein expression profiles caused by ischemia-reperfusion injuryback to normal, Fufang had better effect than either salvianolicacids or notoginsengnosides. Our results indicated the usefulnessof proteomic technology in TCM research.S-25Therapeutic Products from Botanical Scenario Taneja SC1 1Indian Institute of Integrative medicine (CSIR), Canal Road, Jammu Tawi, India The drug and pharmaceutical industry is one of the most rapidly growing and R&D intensive industries in the world. The search fornew therapeutic agents and drugs from natural sources, such asplants, received a boost in the recent past due to increased aware-ness of side effects and toxicity associated with the allopathicdrugs, coupled with the belief that botanicals products are greenand more acceptable to humans. India, being the fertile ground ofseveral medicinal systems, has given birth to a multitude of medic-inal practices, some of them have survived with intact traditionalknowledge. The rich Indian heritage associated with prevailinghealing practices led to the identification of several medicinalplants and formulations that were traditionally used for curativepurpose. Botanicals, as a source of small molecules with a view toidentify new therapeutic agents, remains as one of the major devel-opmental as well as academic activities pursued by several insti-tutes and universities in the post independent era in India. How-ever, the resurgence of natural products in the last decade has alsoforced the participation of private industry in this race. Though In-dian contribution in the area of therapeutics agents, may it be a sin-gle molecule or standardized botanical preparations, have been farand few. Yet some of the leads generated have been noticed globallyand developed into useful products. The present review will coversome of the past and recent efforts made by various agencies in thedevelopment of new leads or therapeutics in the Indian context. Itwill also include the research and development work being carriedout at the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine at Jammu.

China 2Chinese Medicine Laboratory, Hong Kong Jockey ClubInstitute of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong, P.R. China 3Hubei University of Chinese Medicine,Wuhan, Hubei,430065, P.R. China DNA barcoding has been proposed as a novel and powerful taxo- nomic tool [1,2]. The universal primer COI has been widely appliedin animals, but there is no such universal barcode for plants [3]. Inthis study, we examined the possibility of utilizing DNA barcodemarkers to identify labiatae medicinal herbs. First, we rpoB, rpoC1, labiatae. Ourfindings were as follows: (1) PsbA-trnH was amplified much easierthan the other seven; (2) PsbA-trnH spacer is one of the most vari-able regions of the plastid genome in labiatae; and (3)Different species of labiatae can be differentiated effectively bycomparing the PsbA-trnH intergenic region. Comparison of PsbA-trnH intergenic region among 71 species of 30 genus has providedsolid and practical evidence for applying DNA barcoding on speciesidentification. In summary, DNA barcoding was proven to be usefulin identifying different species of labiatae medicinal herbs.

S-27Implementation of Sustainability Standards that Contribute to Assurance of PharmacopoeialQuality of Wild Collected Medicinal Plants Brinckmann JA1 1Traditional Medicinals, Research and Development Department, 4515 Ross Road, Sebastopol, California, USA The majority of commercially traded medicinal and aromatic plant species are wild collected as opposed to being produced throughcontrolled cultivation. In order to assure a consistent supply of uni-form botanical raw materials of defined pharmacopoeial quality,long-term relationships, planning, technical cooperation and trans-parency are necessary throughout the supply chain between thewild collection firms, the intermediate buyers and processors, andthe end-user finished product manufacturers.

Many medicinalplants have pharmacological activities and may, thus, be a sourcefor novel treatment strategies. We have systematically analyzedmedicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine during thepast decade and focused our interest on Artemisia annua L. (qinhao,sweet wormwood). We found that the active principle of Artemisiaannua L., artemisinin, exerts not only anti-malarial activity but alsoprofound cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The inhibitory activity ofartemisinin and its derivatives towards cancer cells is in the nano-to micromolar range. Candidate genes that may contribute to thesensitivity and resistance of tumor cells to artemisinins were iden-tified by pharmacogenomic and molecular pharmacological ap-proaches. Target validation was performed using cell lines trans-fected with candidate genes or corresponding knockout cells. Thesegenes are from classes with different biological functions; for of proliferation (BUB3, cyclins, ferases) as well the epidermal factor receptor confer re-sistance to artesunate.

KG, Dutendorfer Str. 5 91487 Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany Reference substances are used to calibrate and validate the testing methods that are applied within the framework of quality controlthroughout all of the stages in the production and manufacture ofherbal products. The quality of these reference substances is there-fore of prime importance to the quality and associated safety andefficacy of these products. Manufacturers of herbal drugs, and diet-ary supplements in particularly, are now also being confrontedwith a strong increase in the regulations that apply to the referencesubstances used to analyze their products. While the legal frame-work and detailed requirements for evidence of quality are clearlyregulated for herbal medicinal products these have not yet beendefined to the same extent for dietary supplements. However, ashealth-promoting functions and effects are being claimed to an in-creasing extent for such products, we must expect the require-ments for evidence of their quality to be tightened up as well. Thishas already taken place in the USA with the introduction of thecGMP for dietary supplements in June 2007. The presentation willfocus on the requirements for the analytical characterization of pri-mary reference substances. The necessity to determine not only or-ganic impurities but also water, residual solvents and inorganic im-purities will be illustrated by presenting a number of examples ofcommon compounds such as hypericin, hyperforin, hyperoside, si-lybin and others and by pointing out the crucial points encounteredduring the establishment, documentation and maintenance ofthese reference substances. Alternatives, such as quantitative NMRfor content assignment of reference substances will be discussed aswell. S-31Summary on Quality Control of TCMs in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2010 version) Qian ZZ1 1Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, Division of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Building 11,Fahua Nanli, Chongwen District, Beijing,100061, China The main aim of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP 2010 version) is to build up a quality controlling module that is in accordance withthe characteristics of TCMs and is different from that of chemicalmedicines. It will change gradually from using single ingredient in-to using active, multiple ingredients, fingerprint or bio-determina-tion to totally control the quality of TCMs. For the safety control ofTCMs, the species of pesticides were determined examining thepesticides residues according to the actual utility of chemical pesti-cides. This residue determination is required in more and moremonographs within the Chinese material medica. The pesticidesresidue limits have been established in the ChP (2010 version). Oth-er pollutants, such as heavy metals, sulphur dioxide, etc., were de-termined, controlled, and their acceptable limits established in theChP (2010 version). The efficacy control of TCMs, TLC-bioautogra-phy and bio-activity determination techniques were used to estab-lish the quality of TCMs. These results may reflect the true qualitymore directly and precisely than using a single ingredient. For well-controlled quality TCMs, DNA molecular marking and fingerprinttechniques were adopted by ChP. DNA molecular marking tech-nique was also used in Chinese material medica monographs todefine their species which can not be identified by microscopic,chemical or chromatographic methods, especially in multi-originCMMs. Fingerprinting techniques were used to control the uni-formity and stability of TCMs in order to reflect the integrity of theherbs and their complex ingredients.S-32Quality Aspects in the Production of Herbal Extracts Roth-Ehrang R1 1Finzelberg GmbH & Co. KG, 56626 Andernach, Germany While in Europe products containing herbal extracts as active in- gredients are generally handled under the pharmaceutical lawand require a marketing authorization, it seems that so-called Bo-tanicals are handled less strictly in the United States and othercountries, where Botanicals are marketed as food supplements. In2007, the U.S. FDA published the current Good Manufacturing Prac-tice (cGMP) for manufacturing dietary supplements in addition tothe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)[1]. Currently, Europe s Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is evaluating for food and for supplements submissions for health claims withthe intention to legalize claims for risk reduction and for reductionof disease risk [2]. Furthermore the Council of Europe and the Euro-pean Federation of Associations of Health Product Manufacturersmade proposals for quality guides for plant based food supple-ments [3,4]. Both the U.S. and E.U. approaches to handle productscontaining herbal ingredients have proven their suitability but stillattitudes to Botanicals are in motion. Taken together, though theapproaches on how to deal with food supplements containingherbal ingredients in the United States and in Europe seem to con-verge, the question about the future position of Botanicals arises.This talk will shed light on different producer related aspects ofquality as this debate will consequently also affect GMP for themanufacturer of herbal extracts.

S-34Organic and Inorganic Arsenic Directorate, Health Products and Food Branch, Health Canada, 2936 Baseline Road,Ottawa, Ontario, Canada KIA 0K9 Arsenic is present in the environment in both organic and inorganic forms. While organic arsenicals are generally considered to havevery low toxicity, the inorganic species is widely recognized as acarcinogen in addition to causing numerous other adverse healtheffects following acute or chronic exposure [1,2]. The tolerance lim-it for arsenic as a contaminant in natural health products (NHPs)currently recommended by Health Canada s Natural Health Prod- ucts Directorate (NHPD) is 0.14 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day [3]. How-ever, this limit represents total arsenic and does not distinguish be-tween organic and inorganic arsenical compounds. Consequently,this current limit may be unnecessarily restrictive for the NHP in-dustry as certain products may contain high levels of relativelynon-toxic organic arsenic forms, but only minimal amounts of thetoxic inorganic arsenic. NHPD investigated this issue in order to de-termine whether there is substantial scientific evidence to supportseparate limits for inorganic and organic derivatives of arsenic, andwhether suitable analytical methodology exists to distinguish be-tween these forms in finished NHPs. The review involved assessingarsenic toxicity, analytical methodology, and exposure scenariosfor natural ingredients used in dietary supplements (e.g. kelp).NHPD recommends maintaining the current tolerance limit of0.14 \u00b5g/kg bw/day for total arsenic in NHPs at the finished productstage. However, if total arsenic content in a particular NHP exceedsthe current tolerance limit of 0.14 \u00b5g/kg bw/day (taking into ac-count dosage and subpopulation), the applicant may undertake ad-ditional arsenic speciation testing to demonstrate that inorganic ar-senic consumed by ingesting the product would be < 0.03 g/kg bw/day and that organic arsenic consumed by ingesting the prod-uct would be < 20 \u00b5g/kg bw/day.

S-35The Impact of Global Supply and Trade on Botanical Ingredients and Industry Practices Israelsen LD1 1United Natural Products Alliance, 1075 Hollywood Avenue, Salt Lake City, Utah 84105, U.S.A. More than ever, the global botanical industry faces unprecedented challenges with respect to quality standards, intentional adultera-tion, analytical method development, as well as an array of regula-tory issues. Understanding global supply, global trade and consum-er demand for botanicals is essential if quality, safety and efficacyare to be respected. This presentation will provide an internationalperspective of leading issues and their implications for botanicaltraditional medicines and dietary supplements.S-36The Anatomy of Spontaneously Reported Dietary Supplement Adverse Events and a StandardizedProcess to Score and Interpret Collected Events Kingston RL1,2, LeMaster S1,2 1SafetyCall International Poison Center, 8009 34th Ave S. Ste. 875, Bloomington MN 55425 2University of Minnesota, College of Pharmacy, MinneapolisMN 55455 Enforcement of the 2006 Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (DSNDCPA) began in December2007. FDA published guidance documents regarding complianceand reporting of \"serious \"events but there has been no guidance on how \"serious \"and \"non-serious \"reported events are being eval- uated by FDA or others so as to insure that products are meetingexpectations of safety, warranting consumer confidence. Experi-ence to date demonstrates a high variability in quality and integrityof reported incidents and there is no recognized method regardingscoring of events by experts so as to assess potential associationsbetween alleged adverse events and product use. Without such ascoring and evaluation system, collected data represents uncon-firmed allegations of product use and injury, rendering bench-marking between and across product lines an exercise in futility.The SafetyCall International Poison Center, an academically affili-ated, multidisciplinary, triple licensed medical practice composedof clinicians with specific expertise in clinical medicine and toxicol-ogy, natural product pharmacology and consumer product safetyhas designed a system to score spontaneously reported adverse in-cidents involving botanicals containing dietary supplements. Usingsix common parameters association expected-ness, temporality, biologic de-challenge, re-challenge,and consideration of confounding variables, a standardized scoringsystem has been developed. The system was successfully pilotedwith a proprietary blend dietary supplement and provides a meansfor manufacturers to benchmark their product safety experience.Description and application of the scoring system will be presentedalong with representative scoring of actual adverse events repre-sented in the new FDA adverse event database. S-37Recent Developments in Regulatory Matters on Herbal Medicinal Products in Europe Vlietinck AJ1 1Laboratory of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Analysis, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1,2610 Antwerp, Belgium Within the group of industrially prepared herbal or botanical prod- ucts there is a large variation worldwide with regard to the proper-ties and the legal status of these products. Some herbal productsare close to or are medicines, while others are close to or even iden-tical to foods such as dietary supplements, functional foods, novelfoods, etc. and still others are considered as cosmetics or medicaldevices. Therefore it is not surprising that recently appropriate reg-ulatory actions have been undertaken to regulate and harmonizethe legal status of these various groups of plant preparationsthroughout Western countries. The European Union (EU) has re-cently considered herbal products in several legislative texts. Me-dicinal use has been harmonized for herbal medicinal products(HMP) with regard to well-established (WE) and traditional (T)uses through Directives 2004/27/EC and 2004/24/EC amending Di-rective 2001/83/EC. Use of herbal preparations in unit dose formunder food law is covered in the Food Supplements Directive(FSD) 2002/46/EC. Regulations on nutrition and health claims andthe addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substancesto foods have been adopted on December 12, 2006. (Council Regu-lations (EC) n\u00b01924/2006 and 1925/2006). Nevertheless, the dis-tinction between traditional herbal medicinal products and foodsupplements containing herbal products without nutritional valuebut having physiological effects remains vague and controversial.In this presentation the implementation of the current Europeanregulations at the level of the EU Member State authorities Planta Med 2009; 75: 399 -457 York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

A comparison will be made with oth-er concepts existing worldwide, taking into account not only theabove mentioned properties, but also aspects such as access to themarket, cost price, and prospects for innovation of herbal products. S-38FDA s Dietary Supplement Good Manufacturing Practice Regulatory Requirements for GloballyMarketed Botanicals Frankos VH1 1Division of Dietary Supplement Programs, U.S. FDA The Dietary Supplement (DS) CGMPs should help prevent inclusion of the wrong ingredients, too much or too little of a dietary ingre-dient, contamination (e.g. natural toxins, bacteria, pesticides, glass,and heavy metals such as lead), and improper packaging and label-ing. Following DS CGMPs will increase consumers confidence in the quality of the dietary supplement products that they purchase.The CGMPs apply to all domestic and foreign companies that man-ufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplements, includingthose involved with the activities of testing, quality control, pack-aging and labeling, and distributing them in the U.S. The final DSCGMP rule does not apply to raw ingredient manufacturers,although they will continue to need to meet the food CGMP regula-tions. This presentation will provide an overview of the key CGMPrequirements that foreign suppliers of botanical ingredients and di-etary supplements should be aware of. S-39Adverse Event Reports Submitted to U.S. Food & Drug AdministrationAssociated with Dietary Supplements McGuffin M1 1American Herbal Products Association. 8630 Fenton St., #918, Silver Spring, MD 20910 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was amended in 2006 to require marketers of dietary supplements and nonprescriptiondrugs to submit to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), asof December 22, 2007, all reports of serious adverse events associ-ated with and received by marketers of products in these regula-tory categories. The new law established additional responsibilitieswith regard to follow-up reports and recordkeeping. Adverse eventreports submitted to FDA during 2008 by marketers of dietary sup-plements were obtained from FDA through requests under theFreedom of Information Act. Analysis of these records shows thatmost reports are submitted by marketers, though reports are alsosubmitted by individual consumers and health care practitioners.There are more reports associated with women than with men,and with individuals between the ages of 50 and 79 than with olderor younger consumers. FDA s issuance on March 27, 2008 of a warning to advise consumers to refrain from purchasing productssold as Total Body Formula followed the agency s receipt of 25 ad- verse event reports associated with the products, indicating thatthe reporting system is functioning as a signal generator that as-sists FDA in acting promptly to protect the public health. S-40Improving the Odds of Developing New Drugs from Botanicals: Botanical Review Team s Perspectives Dou J1, Chen S1 1Botanical Review Team, Office of Drug Evaluation I (HFD- 101), CDER, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring,MD There is no doubt that plants and animals have provided human- kind with numerous purified small molecule drugs and there isreason to hope that botanical mixtures will have more to give us.Botanical mixtures, are widely used as dietary supplements in theUnited States or as herbal medicines elsewhere, have, for the mostpart, not been extensively studied through well-controlled clinicaltrials to show beneficial effects. We hope this will change and thatmore botanical derived pure compounds as well as botanical mix-tures will be developed as drugs. The publication of FDA s\"Guid- ance for Industry-Botanical Drug Products \"(drafted in 2000 and fi- nalized in 2004) paved the regulatory pathway for developing bot-anical mixtures as new drugs. The first botanical drug (Veregen \u00ae, derived from green tea) approval through investigational new drug(IND) and new drug application (NDA) processes in 2006 showsthat well defined botanical mixtures can be approved as new drugswith demonstration of safety and efficacy through well-controlledclinical trials. Since the publication of the guidance, there has beena growing interest in botanical drug development judged by the in-creasing numbers of botanical INDs and pre-IND consultations,with a cumulative total of over 350 and growing. Few of the botani-cal INDs with phase 1 and/or 2 clinical trials have, to date, advancedinto late-phase clinical trials. So far, the Veregen \u00aeNDA remains the only one submitted and subsequently approved. Although the rea-sons for this are no doubt different in different cases, several com-mon issues related to quality control and trial designs, amongothers, have been observed by the Botanical Review Team. A dis-cussion of these issues could shed light on the seemingly low per-centage of botanical INDs entering late-stage drug development.We would love to see more botanicals being further developed asnew drugs with more success. S-43Novel Active Constituents ofMomordica Charantia China Momordica charantia L. (Cucurbitaceae) is tradi- tional medicine, having antidiabetic, antitumor, antiviral activitiesand so on. Many triterpenoids and other components had beenfound from M. Charantia. In our present work, the fruit of Momor- dica Charantia L. were extracted by alcohol then purified by D-101 macro porous absorptive resin followed by chloroform extraction.Isolation and purification were carried out by silica gel chromatog-raphy resulting in nine compounds: three novel cucurbitane-typetriterpenoids, named charantagenins A( 1), B( 2) and C( 3), (+)-eduesmin( 4) and bluemenol A( 5) are being reported for the first time from Momordica Charantia L., and four known 9). The compounds were identified and elucidated by spectral and chemical methods.In addition, they were tested for their cytotoxicity against six cancercell lines by MTT assay. Test solutions were given to cells in variousfinal concentrations such as 0, 1, 10, 50, 100 mol/L. The cytotoxic potential of the isolated compounds was investigated by determin-ing the concentrations required for 50% growth inhibition (IC cell line (IC 5050.96 mol/L), only towards MCF-7 (IC mol/L).

S-44Analysis and Screening of Bioactive Components in Chinese Herbal Medicinesby HPLC and Hyphenated Techniques Li P, Qi LW, Zhou JL Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicines,China Pharmaceutical University, Ministry of Education;Nanjing 210009, China The idea of combination therapy has been practiced in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years, and has been gainingever-increasing acceptance in the world. During the past decade,owing to changes in the types of disease and limitations of Westernmedicine, the usage of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) has ex-panded globally. CHMs are complex mixtures consisting of thou-sands of compounds. Getting useful chemical and bioactive infor-mation from these highly complicated matrices has long been oneof the major challenges to chemists, analysts, biologists and phar-macologists. The speaker, Prof. Li, is the head of Key Laboratory ofModern Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Education, and the directorof Department of Phamarcognosy at the China Pharmaceutical Uni-versity and has been working in the field of CHMs for over 20 years.The most often used instrumental technique, high-performanceliquid chromatography (HPLC) remains unchallenged for the analy-sis of CHMs, because of it is low-cost, readily availability and easy ofuse. This report covers current HPLC-based strategies for the analy-sis of CHMs, and is divided into three major sections. These are si-multaneous qualitation and quantification of various componentsin CHMs (in vitro), metabolite identification and pharmacokineticinvestigation of CHMs components in biological samples (in vivo), and biomacromolecule (protein and DNA) affinity/LC MS for screening of multiple bioactive candidates in CHMs. Acknowledge- ments : Financial support for this research from the National Sci- ence Foundation of China (No. 90709020, 30530870) is gratefullyacknowledged.S-45Anti-tumor Constituents of Four Medicinal Plants from Lysimachia Genus Yang SL1,2, Lihua Tang LH1, Tian Xie C2,X uQ M1, Xu LZ2 1School of Pharmacy, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, P.R. China 2Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Peking UnionMedical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,Beijing 100094, P.R. China Lysimachia is a large genus of medicinal plants belonging to the PRIMULACEAE family, with about 180 species distributed world- wide. It is a folk medicinal plant used in some syndromes such ashypertension and rheumatic disease. There are limited studies onthe chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of plantsin this genus. Since 1994, a systematic study on the bioactive con-stituents ried out by our group. Till now 86 compounds have been purifiedand identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and chemicalmethods, with saponins and flavonoids as the major constituents.Among them, 28 new oleanane triterpenoids and 4 new flavonoidswere first reported, and two kinds of new saponin aglycones werefirst revealed as 3 ,1 6,2 3 ,2 2, a plant extract from Lysimachia L1210 cell linesboth in vivo and . It also induces cell apoptosis in HL-60, SMMC-7721 and cell, inhibited metastasis on hepatoma anduterine cervix cancer. ZTF has potential to be developed as an anti-tumor drug, and its preclinical research is now underway. S-46Study on Bioactive Compounds with Molecular Diversity from Toxic Plants in China Yu SS1 1Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry ofEducation; IMM, CAMS & PUMC, 100050, Beijing, China Natural products play a dominant role in the discovery of leads for the development of drugs for the treatment of human diseases. InChina, much of natures sources remain to be explored, particularlythe toxic plants, that no doubt host novel, bioactive chemotypesthat await discovery. There are more than 900 species of toxicplants in our country. The bioactivities of extracts of over 150 toxicplants were investigated in our group. It was found that more than20 toxic plants showed vasodilator activities and anti-tumor activ-ities, of which 7 toxic plants were further studied by bioassay-guided technique. From the five toxic plants, more than 250 com-pounds were isolated, including 9 new skeleton compounds andmore than 80 novel compounds, of which more than 50 com-pounds exhibited significant bioactivities to different targets. It laysa foundation for the study of innovative drugs and the elucidationof bioactive substances from toxic plants. S-47Authentication of Fruit Gaertn 19/2, Main, II Phase, Peenya Industrial Area, Bangalore 560 058, India The fruit extract of Emblica officinalis Gaertn. (Euphorbiaceae), commonly known in India as amla (Indian gooseberry), has beenpopularized as a dietary supplement in the United States and else-where, with its antioxidant benefits being attributed to a high con-tent of ascorbic acid. The presence of ascorbic acid in the extractwas questioned by earlier researchers, and hydrolysable tannins,emblicanins A and B were identified [1] and structurally defined[2]. Our investigations on the emblicanins and ascorbic acid con- Planta Med 2009; 75: 399 -457 Georg York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Only trace amounts of free ascor-bic acid were detected. -glucogallin is therefore a more relevant and optimal biomarker in Emblica officinalis extract, than ascorbic acid.

China Salvia \"Dan-Shen \"in Chinese as a tradi- tional Chinese medicine, is used for improving body function, aswell as for cardiac symptoms treatment for hundreds of years inChina. The phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid (RA) and its de-rivative lithospermic acid B (LAB) aroused scientists interest in the last twenty years because of their notable pharmacological ac-tivities [1]. In our present study, abiotic elicitors such as methyljasmonate (MeJA) and Ag +were found to enhance the phenolic acids at various levels. Meantime, based on the profiling changesof several related gene transcripts and metabolites (intermediates)accumulations, in response to elicitors, a gene-to-metabolite net-work for understanding of global responses to abiotic elicitation inS. miltiorrhiza is established (1), and a potential (putative) biosyn- thesis process form RA to LAB was presumed (2), which promptedthe possibility of a key gene-based metabolic engineering for thesynthesis of active pharmaceutical compounds in S. miltiorrhiza , and would certainly help us to globally and deeply understandmetabolic flux of RA synthesis, both at stressed-elicitation and ge-netic-regulation levels.

S-49Studies on the Chemical Constituents and Biological Activities of Four MedicinalPlants from Ilex Genus Tu PF1, Zhou SX, Xie GB, Zheng J, Tang L, Lei Y 1State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, 100083, P.R. China There are about 204 plant species of Ilexgenus in China, and more than 30 of which are used as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) orfolk medicines to treat various diseases [1]. In order to systemati-cally find out the chemical constituent s and bioactives of Ilexplants, and lay a foundation of discovering leading compounds, we carried out an investigation on several medicinal plants of Ilex ge- nus. Herein, we report the research results of 4 medicinal plants of which, 194 compounds were isolated and identified from the above 4 plant species, 61 of those are new compounds, and 98of those are triterpenoids or triterpenoid saponins. of triterpenoids and triterpenoid saponins thatare the primary and typical constituents of Ilexgenus, were assayed for their affect on the cell s absorption of aggregated low density lipoprotein (aggLDL). A cell based-screening model was onaggregated LDL induced-lipid deposition in macrophages to testthe inhibitory effects of these compounds. The compounds with in-hibitory effects on the intracellular accumulation of aggLDL in mac-rophages could be regarded as having the potential bioactivity ofanti-atherosclerosis. The data indicated that 19 compounds havean inhibition effect on aggLDL absorption. Remarkably, kudinosideA, C and show the significant bioactivity, whose inhibitionratio is 81%, 92%, and 85% at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml respec-tively. Thus, the three compounds could the potential candidate forthe treatment of arteriosclerosis. Acknowledgements : Thank the National Science Foundation of China for financial support(No. 30672608).

Poster Session P-1Effects of Nitrogen on the Yield and Quality of Selected Chinese Medicinal Plants of theLamiaceae Family Gardner Z1, Jun Pill Baek JP, Donia AER, Craker LE 1Medicinal Plant Program, Department of Plant, Soil, & Insect Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, 01003 With many of the practicing acupuncturists in the United States prescribing herbal formulas, the demand for Chinese medicinalplants has been increasing. In the past several years, however, qual-ity concerns have been raised about medicinal plants importedfrom China. To assure the safe and efficacious care for patients,practitioners need good quality plant material produced undercontrolled and documented conditions in accordance with goodagricultural practices. The objective of this research was to deter-mine whether quality plant material of selected species of Chinesemedicinal plants could be cultivated in the northeastern UnitedStates and whether such cultivation was economically feasible. Forthese reasons, rugosa (Fisch. L., Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq. were field grown in a randomized complete block design us-ing 0, 100, and 200 kg ha 1of nitrogen supplied as soybean meal. The nitrogen treatments resulted in dose-related increases in yieldin all species. Preliminary organoleptic evaluation (color, aroma,taste, cleanliness) suggests the cultivated Chinese medicinal plantswere of higher quality than commercially available plant materialimported from China.

Yacon, Smallanthus is root crop and is a rich source of phenolic compounds anddietetic oligofructans with low glucose content [2]. These constitu-ents have shown efficacy in the treatment and prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders anddiabetes. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated sys-tem that promotes yacon as a sustainable root crop industry in Mis-sissippi, including root and leaf production, as well as processingyacon into value added commodities as functional food. Yacon isnative to Peruvian Andes and originally grows at elevation 1800 - 2800 of meters above sea level (masl) [1]. The purpose of our workis to evaluate Yacon growth in Mississippi during the hot and drysummers at elevation of 137.8 masl. Yacon propagules were pro-duced by tissue culture and by stem cuttings. Miicropropagatedplantlets adapted to soil conditions at an average of 90%. A signifi-cant difference on plant height, number of roots, leaf and root bio-mass was noticed for plants cultivated in pots which were pro-duced by tissue culture. Only plants produced from stem cuttingswere planted in the field and during the first growing season theaverage yield reached 0.755 kg of fresh weight per plant.

Welater showed that the activity of diverse commercial Echinacea bulk material varied substantially (up to 200-fold), and that the majorityof this activity was also due to these two bacterial components (2).The objective of this study was to determine the contribution ofhost plant genetics and time of harvest as factors influencing thevariation of E. purpurea root and leaf activity. The immune enhanc- ing activity of the aerial part was substantially higher when har-vested during the onset of leaf/stem senescence and was the onlyharvest time where genotypic differences were evident. There wasless variation in root activity due to harvest time and genotypic di-versity. Although these two factors may have contributed to thelarge variation in immune enhancing activity previously observedin bulk E. purpurea material obtained from different suppliers in North America, other environmental and agronomic factors mayhave a greater influence.

However, there is al-ways a concern of potential differences due to mutation and theireffect on the chemical constituents of in vitro propagated (IVP) and vegetatively propagated (VP) plants from same source (MP). Clonalfidelity was tested among the three groups of plants (MP-indoor,IVP and VP). After the plants were well established in the soil [1,2]samples from all three groups of plants, were periodically analyzedfor their cannabinoids content to determine if differences in secon-dary metabolites exist within and among these groups of plants.The content of six major cannabinoids: D 9-THC, THCV, CBD, CBC, CBG chromatogra-phy/flame ionization detection (GC/FID). In general, THC content inall groups increased with plant age up to a highest level during bud-ding stage where the THC content reached a plateau before theplants were harvested. The pattern of changes occurred in the con-centration of other cannabinoids content relative to the plants ageand has followed a similar trend in all groups.

These results confirm the clonal fidelity of tissue culture raised plants of Cannabis sativa and suggest that the biochemical mechanism followed to producethe micropropagated plants does not affect the metabolic contentand can be used to produce true-to-type plants of this species forcommercial pharmaceutical use.

P-5Variations in Temperature Response of Photosynthesis in Drug and FiberType Varieties of Cannabis sativa MA1,3 1National Center for Natural Product Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi,University, MS, 38677, USA 2Department of Pharmacognosy, University USA 3Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy,University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA The effect of temperature on photosynthetic characteristics of three high yielding drug type (HP Mexican, MX and W1) and threefiber type (Kimpolty, Zolo 11 and Zolo 15) varieties of Cannabis sa- tiva, originally from different agro-climatic zones worldwide were studied. The results clearly indicate that among three drug typeclones, high potency Mexican (HP Mex) clone was found to be themost thermotolerant. Optimum temperature for photosynthesis(T opt) was observed around 30\u00b0C in HP Mex whereas, T optwas ob- served in the range of 25 to 30\u00b0C in W1 [1]. A comparatively lowervalue (25\u00b0C) for T optwas observed in MX. Among fiber type clones, Toptwas observed around 30\u00b0C in Zolo 11 and Zolo 15 (Ukrainian origin) whereas, in Kimpolty (from Switzerland) it was observedaround 25\u00b0C. Differences observed in water use efficiency (WUE)among the clones at lower temperature were less pronounced athigher temperatures. Higher WUE and, lower stomatal conduc-tance and transpiration in HP Mex indicate that this clone may besuitable for the plantation in relatively dry and exposed sites. Bothstomatal and mesophyll components seemed to be responsible forthe temperature dependence of photosynthesis (Pn) however, theirmagnitude varied with the clones. A two to five fold increase indark respiration with an increase in temperature was observed inclones. However, higher increases were associated with clones hav-ing higher rate of photosynthesis, indicating an association be-tween photosynthetic and respiratory rates. The results provide avaluable indication regarding clonal variations in temperature de-pendence of Pn in Cannabis sativa and may be used as a tool for ini- tial selection of suitable clones for outdoor cultivation or to providesuitable indoor environment depending upon a particular variety/clone.

The genetic stability of the micropropagated plants was evaluated upto thirty passages in culture and hardened in soil for 8 months us-ing the method of Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) DNA finger-printing. ISSR profiles of micropropagated and hardened plantletswere compared with the mother plant grown indoor. A total of 15ISSR primers resulted in 115 distinct and reproducible bands. Allthe ISSR profiles from micropropagated plants were monomorphicand similar to the mother plants. No variation was detected withinthe micropropagated plants. These results suggest that the cultureconditions used for shoot proliferation are appropriate for clonalpropagation of the elite variety of C. sativa as they do not seem to interfere with the integrity of the regenerated plants.

The differences in chemical composition of 15Salvia species will be presented in this study. Short Single Re- peat (SSR) Microsatellite loci are highly informative geneticmarkers useful for population genetic studies, molecular breedingand parentage determination. Microsatellites, short nucleotide (1 - 6 bp) sequences, are the current DNA marker of choice because oftheir highly polymorphic distribution within the genome. In thisstudy we also report the isolation and characterization of microsat-ellites from 15 Salvia species from Turkey and other countries. The utility of SSR loci as possible method in determining chemotypeand authentication of plant species was evaluated and discussed.References: [1] Demirci B, Tabanca York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

The aerial parts of five Achillea biebersteinii ac- cessions were collected from different locations in Central Turkeyto study the essential oil composition and their genetic fingerprint-ing. Hydrodistilled essential oils were analyzed by GC FID and GC/ MS techniques. Essential oils from plants obtained from Konya re-gion were rich in 34 -37% 1,8-cineole and oil from plants obtained from the Ankara region contained 27% p-cymene as the major con- stituent. Achillea oils were also evaluated for their antimalarial, antimicrobial and antifungal activities. Detailed chemical profilewill be presented in this study. An increasing application of DNAfingerprinting is the use of marker assisted breeding and authenti-cation/identification of (plant) species used in pharmacology or incommercial available food products. In this study we also describethe construction of a genomic library from Achillea biebersteinii en- riched for Short Single Repeat (SSR) microsatellite loci. We have iso-lated several hundred clones with distinct SSRs fragments and de-signed oligonucleotides based on the identified sequence. The ef-fectiveness of genetic markers as possible methods in determiningspecific chemotypes and authentication of plant species from Tur-key and USA was evaluated and discussed in this study.

We have devel-oped a method that allows highly efficient ligation to genomic improves recovery of sequences biotinylated oligos. The method improves current repeat-enrich-ment strategies, resulting in representative small-insert librarieswith a very high proportion of positive clones. The effectiveness ofgenetic marker associated to determining three different chemo- types in Cannabis was evaluated and discussed, as possible method in marker-assisted breeding of Cannabis in the pharmaceutical field. P-10Application of DNA Barcoding to the Medicinal Plants of the Araceae Family Luo K1,2,Chen SL2, Chen KL1, Medicine,Wuhan 430061, P.R. China 2Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academyof Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, P.R. China The medicinal plants of the Araceae family are distributed widely throughout China and more than half of them are medicinal plants,whereas materials of similar morphology and chemical finger-prints are often misidentified. DNA barcoding is a new techniquethat uses DNA sequences from a small fragment of the genome toidentify species. rbcL, psbA-trnH [2]) of 34 genus were amplified and sequenced. We found that the psbA-trnH is difficult to sequence through PCR product, because this region is A, T rich (70%, aver-aged). The amplification 100%, respectively. However the matK was variable enough to identify species, and the intra-specific di-vergence from 0 to 0.20% was significantly less than the inter-spe-cific divergence from 0.42% to 19.4%. The results indicate that thepsbA-trnH is not suitable to identify the medicinal plants of the Araceae family. The matK can be used as a barcoding to identify all species of Araceae.

The rapid and accurate identification ofspecies is critical to Salvia L. medicinal herbs. DNA barcodes andchemical fingerprint are two approaches that have recently gar-nered much attention [2,3]. Here we compared these two methodsfor identification of the genus of Savlia L. First, we sequenced thenucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region 2amplified from 32 medicinal plants belonging to Salvia L. and sevenother groups of labiatae medicinal plants. By using neighbor join-ing analyses, phylogenetic trees were mapped by their sequence di-versity. Secondly, we tested the water-solution bioactive compo-nents (Rosmarinic acid, acid soluble components (TanshinoneI and Cryptotanshinone)of every sample by HPLC. Additionally, we compared the relation-ship between the sequence of ITS2 and the components of everybranch in NJ tree, and found regular relationship between them.By contrast, DNA barcoding was sequencing-based and thereforecould provide more accurate and fast results in large-scale studies.This is the first paper to show the relationship between DNA bar-coding and chemical components.

(2008) J SL1 1Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking UnionMedica College, 100193 Beijing, China DNA barcoding has recently been proposed as a technique that em- ploys a short, standardized gene region to identify species. DNAbarcoding is well established in animals because of a widely appro-priate sequence for them, the cytochrome coxidase 1 [1], but thereis not any universally accepted barcode for plants till now. There-fore, the primary task for barcoding plants is to find more usefulbarcodes that can identify as many species as possible. Medicinalplants have been used as traditional Chinese drugs for treating dis-eases, some of them are similar in morphology, and are often mis-identified by chemical fingerprints. Rosaceae includes many medic-inal plants with similar morphology and are usually hard to beidentified. Here, we chose five potential barcodes, Universal (ITS), to identify species fromdifferent genera in Rosaceae. The results suggest that the nuclearribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is a candi-date to discriminate all of plant species in Rosaceae.

Fabaceae is the third largest family of flowering plants, with a large number of medicinal plants. However, it is arduous to identifysome of the species in this family because of morphological similar-ity and frequent variation. The DNA barcode, a short DNA sequenceoriginating from the genome, was first investigated for the medici-nal plant in Fabaceae. Now we have completed 86 species of medic-inal plants in Fabaceae including over 30 genera. Through six identified poten-tial barcodes of the medicinal plants in Fabaceae by comparing DNAbarcoding sequences. The results indicated, efficiency of amplifica-tion for six candidate DNA barcodes range from 100% (ITS2) to 93%(matk ). Intraspecific interspecific variation for six chloroplast regions derived Wilcoxon signed rank tests of diver-gence showed that rpoC1 was the least discriminatory region, while ITS2 was the potential candidate of medicinal plant barcod-ing in Fabaceae in our study. Overall, our findings showed that DNAbarcoding is an efficient and powerful tool for the identification ofthe medicinal plants in Fabaceae.

(2007)PNAS, 1 for Drug The Netherlands 2Bedrocan BV, Veendam, The Netherlands In this research we investigated the biosynthesis and accumulation of cannabinoids during the growth phases of Cannabis sativa leavesand flowers. Flowers from standardized indoor breeding were ana-lyzed for transcription and expression of identified genes [1 -5] from the cannabinoid pathway and the accumulation of the canna-binoid metabolites [6]. The correlation between the various mea-surements should give more information on the regulation of thecannabinoid production process within the plant. Plant sampleswere taken randomly during standardized cultivation. Every week,for eight weeks in a row, three plants were sampled, and materialswere treated for analysis by QRT PCR, HPLC, and genes cloned genes. 2D-electrophoresis was used to detectany specific protein expression during the cultivation period. Fromthis ongoing study, we have indicated that the amount of THCA inthe leaves stays in certain ranges throughout the sampling periodand is not dependant on the vegetative or flowering status of theplant. In contrast, the content of THCA in the flowers is dependingon the growth period, which is in line with previously reported da-ta on the correlation of trichoma and cannabinoids. The informa-tion obtained from this study is used as a profound basis for furthergenetic and metabolic analysis. References: [1] -1582. [3] 17411 -17416. [6] -1604.

China Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Dan-shen in Chinese), is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine for improving body function, aswell as for the treatment of cardiac symptoms. The phenolic acidssuch as rosmarinic acid (RA) and its derivative lithospermic acid B(LAB) aroused scientists interest in the last twenty years because oftheir notable pharmacological activities [1]. As for S. miltiorrhiza , hairy root cultures have been suggested to be more stable and effi-cient than cell suspension cultures in active constituent accumu-lation [2]. In our present study, we found that methyl jasmonate(MeJA) and Ag+ could greatly enhance the phenolic acids at variouslevels. Meantime, several related gene transcripts and metabolites(intermediates) accumulations involved in RA synthesis pathway(1), in response to elicitors, were determined by real-time quantita-tive PCR and liquid chromatographic mass spectrometry, respectively. Therefore, a gene-to-metabolite network for under-standing of global responses to abiotic elicitation in S. miltiorrhiza is established, and a potential (putative) biosynthesis process formRA to LAB is presumed (2), which is now under intensive investiga-tion by analysis of differential expression protein and precursorfeeding experiment in our laboratory.

According to Dias [1] estima- tion, the Cerrado contains 160,000 species of plants, fungi and ani-mals. This proposed research program will expand and upgrade theconservation effort. The project will: 1) build an International Part-nership on Conservation and Natural Product Discovery; 2) mapand protect the genetic resources by establishing germplasm bankof two endemic families Leguminosae and Combrestaceae; 3)search for new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals to control trop-ical diseases, and agricultural pests and pathogens, 4) create anEco-extract-library and ex situ collections for future studies; 5) es-tablish a microbial library of plant associated microorganisms. As the establishment of in vitro germplasm bank progresses, endo- phytic microbes commonly associated with plants will outgrowthe host tissues and allow us to detect and identify them. Some ofthese organisms are responsible for production of secondary me-tabolites [2,3]. Clonal propagation by in vitro methods will supply the biomass for fractionation and isolation of the active metabolite(s) and future developments. In addition, micropropagation willprovide a unique opportunity to identify and evaluate the contribu-tion of plant associated microorganism to the biological properties.References: [1] cerdeira@cnpma.embrapa.br Preto, SP, 14049-900, Brazil Stryphynodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville, is a medicinal plant that belongs to Mimosoideae. It is also known as barbatim\u00e3o. Itsaqueous extract has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial proper-ties [1]. This study was conducted to evaluate the phenols and tan-nins content and the antifungal activity of the aqueous extractagainst rubrum. A clinical isolate of T. rubrum (ATCC MYA3108) was obtained from a patient admitted to the Uni- versity Hospital of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto University, SP, Brazil. The mutantstrain TruMDR2 was obtained from the disruption of the TruMDR2 gene from isolate MYA3108. Phenol concentrations were deter-mined by colorimetric method and the antifungal potential was de-termined in bioassays measuring the minimal inhibitory concen-tration (MIC). The antifungal activity of the extracts was confirmedagainst T. rubrum. The aqueous extract S. adstringens contains and a minimal inhibitory concentration(MIC) of 156 \u00b5g /mL for both isolates of T. rubrum (Table 1), as com- pared to fluconazole at 75 \u00b5g /mL.

It is a unique index used for the evaluation of Chinese ma-teria medica in traditional Chinese medicine and is nearly com-pleted after a long-time clinical experience evaluation of practi-tioners. The fruit of Arctium lappa is a generally-used herbal medi- cine in TCM for the treatment of flu, diabetes, etc. [1]. Modern re-search indicated that the lignans from the fruit of A. lappa account for most of the associated activity, especially the compound arctiin,that possesses anti-virus, anti-cancer and anti-diabetes activity byway of its primary metabolite arctigenin [2]. To explore the ecolog-ical suitability and appropriate cultivation regions, 34 samples ofA. Lappa , including fruits and its rhizosphere soil, were distributed to four principal cultivation regions for A. lappa in China. The con- tents of arctii and arctigenin were selected as index markers tomeasure the pharmacological actions of the fruits of A. lappa and were determined by HPLC. In addition to these markers, the massof a thousand seed, seed germination rate and energy, were chosenas indicators to evaluate the seed quality. The trace elements in soiland seeds were determined, the pH, total nitrogen and anions, suchas Cl ,N O 3,C O 32,S O 42etc., in soils and rhizosphere microorgan- ism were also analyzed. In addition the information on ecologicalfactors encompassed longitude, latitude, temperature in Januaryand July, slope orientation, rain volume/year was collected fromGISTCM. The mathematic statistic analysis indicated that the heavymetals in soil increased the seed germination rate and the rain vol-ume and temperature in July have a great effect on the content ofarctii. In addition a probiotic fungus and a inhibition fungus forthe growth of A. lappa were identified from its rhizosphere soil. The suitable cultivation regions of A. lappa in China were divided based on the comparison of ecological suitable factors by TCMGISsystem.

The usage of herbal drugs has increased in bothdeveloping and developed counties due their natural origin andminimal side effects. At present, the standardization of herbal drugsand herbal preparations is a priority area for Nigerian governmentand also Nigerian pharmaceutical industries. The Aloe plant (family, Aloeceae) has been used all over the world for many years for vari-ous medicinal and health purposes. Studies on the macro- and mi-cro-morphology of the leaves of Aloe schweinfurthii Baker and those of Aloe vera (Linn.) Burm. f., (a world acknowledged Aloe spe- cies), were carried out for comparative identification, authentica-tion, chemo-microscopy, quantitative microscopy and phytochem-ical profiles that could be incorporated into their monographs inthe proposed Nigerian Herbal Pharmacopoeia (NHP). The results showed that both Aloe species possessed many similarities in epi- dermal characteristics with the ranunculaceous stomata that ismore A. schweinfurthii A. vera is clearly dis- tinguished from A. schweinfurthii with the presence of calcium oxalate and raphides. Physical evaluation points out that the totalash value of the dried leaf, acid insoluble ash, water soluble ash,water soluble extractive and alcohol soluble extractive values ofA. schweinfurthii are greater than that of A. vera . General phyto- chemical analysis of the methanolic extracts of both Aloe species re- vealed similarities in the presence of free and combined anthraqui-nones, starch, flavonoids, steroidal and phenolic compounds.

In this re- search, a plant from the family Cucurbitaceae was studied. Mo- mordica foetida Schumch. Et Thonn is a climber commonly found in swampy areas in Central and Southern Africa. It has medicinaluses ranging from spiritual and psychiatric conditions to physicaldiseases. Drinking of aqueous leaf extracts of the plant for the treat-ment of malaria is reported in East and Central Africa [1,2]. Theleaves were extracted using 70% ethanol aqueous then antimicrobial activity against 32 bacterial strains for both stan-dard and isolates. Thus, ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions werechosen for further studies due to higher antimicrobial activity withminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for 32 bacterialstrains ranging from 0.156 and 2.5 mg mL 1. Active fractions were further purified using chromatographic techniques. A detailed phy-tochemical investigation resulted into isolation of four curcubitanetriterpenoids and flavonoids compounds from chloroform and eth-yl acetate fractions respectively. The chemical structures of the iso-lated compounds were established through UV, IR, MS, 1H,13C, COSY and 2D NMR spectroscopic data.

P-29Bioactivity of 54 Essential Oil Extracts Topically Applied to Adult Lacebugs Stephanitis pyrioides West, Poplarville, MS 39470, USA 2USDA ARS-NPURU, The University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA Concern about genetic pest resistance and poisoning of non-target organisms are spurring the search for \"softer \"insecticides with greater selectivity and multiple modes of action. Essential oils areblends of secondary metabolites that serve plants as deterrentsagainst insect herbivores, but remain relatively safe and even vertebrates [1]. We used serial-time mortality bioassays toscreen the essential oils from 54 representative plant species from30 genera comprising 13 families of gymnosperms phanitis pyrioides (Scott). The principal developmental stages of bugs exposed to the essential oils were the adults-long-lived indi-viduals that provide parental care to their leaf-infesting brood. Cle-venger-type distillation extracted essential oils from dried plantmaterial and lead components were purified and identified withgas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC MS). Oils were mixed with a non-toxic emulsifier 0.9 -9.0% dimeth- ylsulfoxide (DMSO). All oil emulsions and sometimes their fraction-ated components were topically applied to adult bugs in random-ized blocks at concentrations of 0, 650, 1300, 2500, 5000, and10000 ppm. Overall bug mortality, as well as LD 50,L D 95and LD 99 values were calculated after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours of exposure. Mor-tality data were analyzed using multivariate probits [1] and pre-liminary data show thion-DMSO emulsions (66.1%) and are four promising botanicalsources from which to isolate compounds useful for developingnew biorational crop protectants.

The active compo-nent of Salvia divinorum , salvinorin A ( 1) has a potent affinity to kappa opioid receptor in CNS. We studied the biosynthesis of thisditerpenoid through the isolation of RNA and construction of cDNAlibrary. Sequencing of the genetic material resulted in building anEST library containing all genes involved in biosynthetic assemblyof1. We then cloned and overexpressed carboxy methyltransferase(CMT) gene in Escherichia coli to determine the substrate for the en- zyme, and biochemically characterize it. We have employed 14CSAM, and five different substrates to test for the CMT activity in the cell free assay. We observed methylation of C-18 carboxylicgroup in divinatorin notin highly oxygenated substrates like salvinorin A and B acids. Thisstrongly suggests that CMT is substrate specific and that it is in-volved in the early stage of the pathway.

These industrially produced com-pounds were ubiquitously used in capacitors, transformers and fre-quently as coolants. PCBs were prized for their stability and lack ofreactivity; however, these same properties allow PCBs to becomepersistent organic pollutants (POPs) in many environments. Anumber of different bioremediation strategies have been proposed,but as yet, no one method has been completely successful for PCBremoval in the environment. Studying the microbial communitiesthat survive within the PCB containing sediments may allow a bet-ter understanding for the anaerobic dehalogenation of these con-taminants. In this study sediment samples were collected fromeight locations with varying levels of PCB contaminants. MicrobialDNA extractions, followed by PCR amplifications were successfullypreformed utilizing a previously designed primer set used for am-plifying known dechlorinating anaerobes. Restriction length poly-morphisms (RFLP) analysis of the constructed clone library hasshown that the diversity of this population is quite limited in anumber of the Chesapeake Bay sediments. The limited diversifica-tion of anaerobes within the sediments may imply that the PCBsare acting as selection factors to facilitate the more adaptive anaer-obes. Our future work will be focused on closer examination of thedominate anaerobes. Examination of the microbes associated withPCB dechlorination in contaminated sediments will provide a bet-ter understanding of this process in the environment.P-58Investigation on Processes of Degradation of N-Methyl York Road, Towson, Maryland 21252 Carbamate compounds are useful pest control agents because they are alternatives to ozone-depleting organochloride pesticides, andbecause they are active against organophosphate-resistant pests.As a result, the use of carbamate pesticides has increased globallyin recent years [1]. Despite this increase in use, there remain fewaccurate descriptions of the chemical fate of carbamate pesticidesunder environmental conditions. We report on studies on theaquatic chemical fate of three N-methyl carbamate pesticides used extensively in both urban and rural environments: carbofuran, car-baryl, and propoxur (Fig. 1). UV vis and NMR spectroscopy were utilized to identify and monitor products of decomposition undervarious conditions. The results from characterization and kineticsstudies, suggest that the degradation rates of these carbamate pes-ticides are governed by the identity of the substituent group on thebenzene ring: carbaryl was found to hydrolyze fastest, followed bypropoxur, and finally carbofuran. A mechanism for the pesticidedecomposition is postulated and an explanation for the trend isproposed. Future work will investigate the reactivity of degradationproducts, in particular with water -soluble metals like copper (II), which are themselves components of pesticides. Thus, unexpectedenvironmental coordination and/or organometallic reactions maybe revealed in the future. References: [1] Hideyuki K, et al.

Fresh Aloe vera consists of three major components: acetylates polysaccharides, glucose,and malic acid, which are markers for good aloe materials. Highcontent of lactic acid and acetic acid indicate bacterial degradation,hydrolysis and thermal degradation of the material. A proton NMRmethod was developed by Dr. Bernd Diehl at Spectral Service, K\u00f6ln,Germany, and accepted by IASC as an analytical method to certifyaloe based ingredients and finished products. This presentationwill report the validation of the quantitative NMR method accord-ing to the AOAC guidelines. The validation includes specificity, line-arity, accuracy, robustness, repeatability and reproducibility, limitof detection and limit of quantification. Data was collected withtwo different NMR instruments in two independent NMR labs. Thissimple and non-destructive 1H NMR method was able to quantify the amount of acetylated polysaccharides, glucose, malic acid, lacticacid and acetic acid in Aloe vera powder.

P-61Quality Control of Botanicals through Identification iP1 1Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Ministry of Education;Nanjing 210009, China Over the last decades, the usage of botanicals for herbal medicines has expanded globally. Safety and efficacy as well as quality controlof botanicals-derived products have become important concerns.Addressing these topics usually relies on validated analytical meth-ods, which allows rapid and sensitive identification and quantifica- tion of relevant constituents. Botanicals are complex mixtures con-sisting of thousands of compounds, and getting useful chemical in-formation from these highly complicated matrixes has long beenone of the major challenges to chemists and analysts. In this report,we introduced two most potential and prospective methods forquality control three important aspects: (i) We applied ultra-fast HPLC system to routineanalysis and quality control of botanicals, providing up to 5 -20 times faster analysis and 60% higher resolution than conventionalHPLC without sacrificing resolution, precision or sensitivity(Fig. 1). (ii) We connected UV/DAD with ELSD for simultaneous de- termination of various compounds in one run. UV could detectstrong UV absorbing compounds such as isoflavonoids, phthalides,and phenolic acids, while as a complementation role, ELSD coulddetect non- or poor UV absorbing compounds such as saponins(Fig. 2). (iii) We suggest that TOF MS provides much higher sensitiv- ity and selectivity, as well as accurate mass measurement. It enablesthe simultaneous identification and determination of compoundsin botanicals even with trace contents.

P-62Qualitative and in Fritillaria Species by Solid-Phase Extrac- Resolution LC/TOF MS Zhou JL1,L iP1 1Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Ministry of Education;Nanjing 210009, China Steroidal alkaloids are naturally occurring nitrogen-containing compounds in many edible or medicinal plants, such as potato, to-mato, Fritillaria and American hellebore, which possess a variety of toxicological and pharmacological effects on humans. Such biolog-ical effects of these compounds create a critical demand for devel-oping a sensitive and selective analytical method to accurately eval-uate the presence and content of the major and minor steroidal al-kaloids in these plants. In this report, we present a high-selectiveand sensitive method for rapid analysis of steroidal alkaloids in Fri- tillaria species, utilizing selective solid-phase extraction and rapid resolution liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrome-try (SPE-RRLC/TOF MS). The selective solid-phase extraction step was developed using a mixed-mode cation-exchange/reversed-phase cartridge (Oasis MCX). The strong cation exchange capacityof MCX can selectively capture basic analytes and acidic York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

The sam-ple recoveries on Oasis MCX cartridges were found to be > 80%. Theanalysis of steroidal alkaloids was carried out by RRLC/TOF MS. The use of RRLC can shorten analytical time and improve chromato-graphic resolution, and TOF MS provides abundant structure infor- mation by accurate mass measurements for each molecular ion andfragment ions at different fragmentor voltage. As a result, the SPE-RRLC/TOF MS was successfully used for simultaneous determina- tion of 26 steroidal alkaloids in different Fritillaria species in a sin- gle run within 18 min (Fig. 1), which is 5-times faster than conven- tional HPLC/TOF MS method [1].

Commercial ginkgo products are usu-ally standardized to the levels of flavonoids and terpene lactones(ginkgolides A, B, C, J, and bilobalide) based on the biological activ-ities. Flavonoids have strong UV absorption. However, terpene lac-tones are very inactive to UV, refractive index, detectionstherefore their quantitation requires complicated pre-purificationand difficult HPLC separation to eliminate interferences and to re-solve all analytes even though their concentrations are high in gink-go extracts. In this study, we developed and validated a sensitive,accurate and reliable assay method for determination of terpenelactones in ginkgo products using HPLC-electrospray tandem massspectrometry (LCMSMS) technique, which minimized the require-ments of major sample cleanup and chromatographic resolution.The validation of the method showed that the analyte recoveriesare in the range of 90 -110%, and the relative standard deviations are less than 10% for all five analytes, ginkgolide A, B, C, J and bilo-balide.

The program is stakeholder drivenand provides a coordinated approach to validation that facilitatesmethods validation and production of reference materials. The ma-jor accomplishments of the first five years of the AMRM programinvolve collaborative efforts with FDA, AOAC, and NIST. The pro-gram has resulted in 18 collaborative studies of analytical methods.Twelve methods have been approved as Official Methods of Analy-sis (OMA), and 3 of these are final action OMA. The NIST referencematerials project has resulted in the production of 5 suites ofstandard reference materials, with an additional 12 suites in vari-ous stages of completion. The NIST has also created a pilot Labora-tory Quality Assurance Program that will assist laboratories to be-come proficient at analysis. A more detailed account of these ac-complishments and an outline of the future scope and direction ofthe program will be presented.

P-65Determination of Trace Element Contents in Solid Environmental Matrices Center Natural Products Research Program and 2Environmental Toxicology Research Program,The School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, MS 38677 Objectives of this study were to: a) optimize EPA-3052 microwave digestion method using a c/r ICP MS method by adjusting combina- tions of acids, digestion temperature and duration; b) validate the c/rICPMS method for multi-element analyses to determine their total concentration in solid matrices; and c) set up a robust single-steppartial extraction method by using the c/r ICP MS method. Here, special emphasis has been given to total trace element analyses ofmarine sediment samples from the Back Biloxi Bay, MS to monitorthe effects of Hurricane Katrina on the region. This study confirmedthat the amount of acid extraction not only depends on the applieddigestion method including different types and combinations ofacids, but also the type of element, its origin (natural or anthropo-genic) and its chemical form. Optimized conditions for total diges-tion have been diluteacid (single-step) microwave digestion methods extract a signifi-cant amount of trace elements from sediment solid matrices, there-fore these methods can lead to overestimation of the amount oftrace elements that might be released into the environment. The di-lute acid (0.5 M HCl) (single-step) \"cold \"extraction method can pro- vide valuable information for evaluating the amount of trace metalthat might become remobilized and/or bioavailable. Total trace ele-ment contents of marine sediments from Back Biloxi Bay, collectedmonthly following Hurricane Katrina, revealed a wide range of var-iation, but no apparent temporal trends.

C. thalictroides is known to contain saponins which are considered to be responsible for the uterine stimulant effects together with tera-togenic alkaloids [1]. A comparison study between HPLC UV-ELSD, and HPTLC methods was presented determi- nation of major alkaloid and triterpene saponins from roots of Cau- lophyllum thalictroides (blue cohosh) and dietary supplements claiming to contain blue cohosh. The procedure involves the com-mon extraction of the alkaloid and saponins from the plant and di-etary samples. By liquid chromatography method with PDA andELSD, C18 column, mobile phase consisted of solvent A (10 mM am-monium acetate) and solvent B (acetonitrile). Owing to their lowUV absorption, the triterpene saponins were detected by evapora-tive light scattering. Within 35 minutes for HPLC UV-ELSD method and within 8.0 minutes for UPLC triterpene magnoflorine could with detection limits of 1-5 \u00b5g/mL for saponins and 0.05 \u00b5g/mL for magnoflorine by UPLC method, respectively. The methods were successfully used to ana-lyze different dietary products. For the products containing blue co-hosh, there was a significant variability in the amounts of the triter-pene saponins. The compounds in plant materials and commercialproducts of blue cohosh were further confirmed by LC MSD TOF.

Some heavy metals such as selenium, iron, cop-per, chromium and zinc are essential at low concentrations, otherssuch as arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury are toxic. Determina-tion of 11 metals (including arsenic, chromium, mercury, iron, cop-per, nickel, zinc, selenium, lead, cadmium and thallium) in botani-cals and dietary supplements were carried out by using ICP MS. Closed vessel microwave digestion of two plant samples and oneproduct assisted by HNO were used de- termine the recovery of 11 metals by ICP MS. Sample digestion was done in a MARS 5 microwave. Elemental measurements wereperformed using Agilent 7500 ce CRC ICPMS operating in hydro- gen mode for Se and Fe, and He mode for As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Cd to re-move spectral interferences. The method was validated for linear-ity, repeatability, limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantifica-tion (LOQ). The limits of detection and limits of quantification forthese heavy metals were found to be 0.004 -0.51 ppb. Digestions A, D and F gave significantly higher recoveries than compared withother digestions. Microwave digestion followed by analysis by IC-PORS MS has been shown to be a simple, reliable method for the multi-element determination of trace metals in dietary supple-ments and botanicals. About 12 plant samples and 22 dietary prod-ucts were analyzed and all were found to contain Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, andNi. Four samples for As and one sample for Cr were found to containelevated concentrations above the recommended limit.

This fragment bears the core skeleton of dominant ions in hydrastinine.However, for highly unsaturated isoquinoline alkaloids, its skeletonis relatively stable. this major ions, such as pre-senting ions at m/z308, 294 and 292 in palmatine, jatrorrhizine and beberine respectively, may involve the re-arrangement of D-ring. The results of the current study have classified the fragmenta-tion pathway of each sub-group into isoquinoline alkaloids. It canbe used to characterize the structures of trace isoquinoline alka-loids in dietary supplements that claimed to contain goldenseal,and will benefit to identify adulterant in dietary supplements.

The fragmentation patterns of these alkaloids are dominated by the ex-istence of bridge between C-2 and C-4, and less affected in accor-dance with structural variations of substitution at C-2 and C-12.When forming the lactone bridge between C-2 and C-4 over a bi-phenyl moiety, a neutral loss of 44 Da corresponding to carbon di-oxide is easily generated. Moreover, the product ions will furtheryield fragment ions related to the cleavage of A-ring at C 1/C-2 and C-4/C 5.

Galacto- lipids are a class of acylated membrane lipids with a sugar moleculeattached to the third carbon of the glycerol molecule. These com-pounds are associated primarily with plastid membranes in seedplants [1]. The fruit of Lycium barbarum L. has been widely used in the health food industry because of its possible role in the preven-tion of chronic disease like age-related macular degeneration. Inaddition, it may possess antioxidant and antitumor neu-roprotective effect, and enhance immunity [2]. An SPE assistedHPLC/ELSD method has been developed for the quantitative deter-mination of galactolipids from Lycium barbarum L. fruits. The sepa- ration of six galactolipids and one steroid were achieved by usingC-18 column material in HPLC method coupled with an ELS detec-tor. A water/acetonitrile mobile phase, both containing 0.1% aceticacid, was selected for the outlined method. The column tempera-ture was maintained at 25\u00b0C. The method was validated for loga-rithmic linearity, repeatability, limits of detection (LOD) LOD and LOQ of galactolipids werefound to be in the range from 10 -20 \u00b5g/mL and 20 -50 \u00b5g/mL, re- spectively. The structures of six galactolipids and one steroid werefurther characterized by ESI MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) in-terface method is described for the identification of compounds inL. barbarum . The developed HPLC-ELSD method has been success- fully applied for determination of target analytes in different popu-lations of same species.

P-81Isolation and Qualitative Characterization of Antidepressant Marsiline by LiquidChromatography systematics and Molecular Taxonomy Laboratory, Vidya-sagar University, Midnapore-721 Bengal, India 2Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, JadavpurUniversity, Kolkata-700 037, West Bengal, India 3Department of Zoology, Lady Brabourne College,Kolkata-700 017, West Bengal, India Anxiety, depression and mental health problems constitute the sec- ond most common chronic condition in clinical practice. Varioustypes of herbal medicines are being used as anxiolytic drugs, which necessitates the development of newer and more effective antide-pressants from traditional medicinal plants whose psychothera-peutic potential needs to be assessed in a variety of animal models[1,2]. The main objective of this work was to develop a simple, sen-sitive, rapid and reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-trometry (LC MS/MS) method for the simultaneous identification of Marsiline (Fig. 1), a major central nervous system active principal, that has been found to be responsible for sedative and anticonvul-sant activity in Marsilea sp. (1, 2). The LC MS/MS system (API 2000) with triple quadruple tandem mass spectrometer (AB Sciex Instru-ments, Foster, Canada) was used for qualitative determination ofMarsiline from methanolic extract. The most active ingredient Mar-siline was extracted by simple liquid-liquid extraction with organicsolvent Fig. 1 chromatograms of standards (A) and extracts of L. barbarum L.

Acrylamidealso finds its way into the human diet when amino acids and sugarspresent in food are heated at high temperature during food pro-cessing. Earlier studies have demonstrated that chronic acrylamidetreatment produced tumors in rats and mice; yet, the mechanismof acrylamide carcinogenicity remains unresolved. The aim of thepresent study was to investigate the biologic consequences of acryl-amide exposure both in vitro and in vivo animal models. Animals were subjected to bone marrow micronucleus assays, chromosom-al analysis, and flow cytometry analysis. Significant increases ofchromosomal aberrations, in a dose dependent manner, were ob-served in human leukocytic culture and bone marrow cells of mice.There was also an increase in micronucleus frequency in bone mar-row cells of mice. Flow cytometry analysis showed a reduced DNAcontent in liver cells of treated mice indicating acrylamide clasto-genicity. Although acrylamide is a common laboratory reagent, itsrole as an environment contaminants will only be resolved withfurther investigations of its detrimental effects. P-83Localization of NAD+Synthesis Enzymes in the Pathogenic Yeast Candida glabrata Addison A1, SJ2, MD 21252 2Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics,Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, Baltimore, MD 21205 Candida glabrata is an opportunistic yeast pathogen of humans and accounts for approximately 4% of all catheter associated urinarytract infection. It is normally controlled by the body s immune sys- tem and the body s bacteria flora, but can cause serious mucosal and systemic infecitons. C. glabrata is a nicotinamide adenine dinu- cleotide (NAD +) auxotroph, which depends of NAD+precursors using nicotinamide riboside (NR), nico- tinic acid (NA), and nicotinamide (NAM) as NAD+precursors. These precursors are used in a functional Preiss-Handler pathway to pro-duce NAD +. We focused on the location of enzymes used in the Preiss-Handler pathway of C. glabrata under conditions replete for NAD+precursors and under extreme conditions such as NAD+pre- cursor starvation. The C-terminus of the Npt1, Qns1, Nrk1 and Pnc1was tagged with GFP to identify the location of the enzymes in theyeast before and after starvation of NA and NR. Under the fluores-cent microscope, localization of enzymes was found in the cyto-plasm before and after starvation. Therefore, within the limits ofour assay, we conclude that localization of the Preiss-Handler path- way enzymes in C. glabrata is unaffected by environmental condi- tions. We intend to confirm and extend these results by exploringthe subcellular localization of pathway enzymes using differenttags for localization. P-84Vaccine Created to Defend Against Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms in Cases of Severe Osteomyelitis Newman of Dental School, Baltimore, MD 21201 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that causes infections to be especially difficult to treat. S. aureus hasbecome a particularly significant problem in hospitals, where theyoften grow as biofilms and are currently the largest contributor tonosocomial infections. In previous experimentation, multiplestrains of immunogens were found to be upregulated in biofilmgrowth. In this experiment, the antigens to four of these immuno-gens were grown in culture and combined to create a vaccine. Thisvaccine was administered to New Zealand white rabbits that werelater infected with S. aureus tibial osteomyelitis. The initial vaccinewas given on day zero of the experiment. The rabbit titer wasboosted with a second injection after ten days. The animals werechallenged after ten days with MRSA introduced to the left tibia.Responses to vancomycin were evaluated by examining osteomye-litic infection in the rabbit tibias. The combination of vaccine andvancomycin treatment significantly lowered levels of biofilm infec-tion. From these results, we postulate that the vaccine was able toprevent the formation of the biofilm and vancomycin was able todestroy the remaining bacteria. From the positive results of this ex-periment, we plan on expanding this study to mouse models. P-85Determining the Sensitivity of Gustatory Neurons in MD 21252 Gypsy moth larvae, Lymantria dispar (L.), are highly polyphagous and display a wide host preference, feeding on the foliage of manyspecies, but favoring leaves of deciduous hardwood trees, such asoak, maple, and sweet gum. Gypsy moth larvae are major pest de-foliators in the United States and destroy millions of acres of treesannually. These lepidopteran insects possess gustatory sensory or-gans located on the maxillae, namely the medial and lateral galealstyloloconic sensilla, which play an important role in host-plant se-lection. Using a single cell electrophysiological recording method,this study characterized the sensitivity of the receptor cells housedwithin each sensillum of gypsy moth larvae when exposed to apanel of selected phytochemicals by performing dose response ex-periments. Electrophysiological tip recordings from these sensillarevealed that medial styloconic sensilla responded to the while lateral styloconic sensilla re-sponded to aristolochic acid and atropine. In general, these differ-ent taste cells exhibited characteristic temporal firing patterns.Thus, this study provides correlative insights into the feeding be-havior and taste physiology of this larval insect.

P-86Carbohydrate Specificity of the Oyster ( Crassostrea virginica ) Galectin Wendland 8000 York Road, Towson, Maryland 21252 2Center of Marine Biotechnology, University of MarylandBiotechnology Institute, Columbus Center, Suite 236,701 East Pratt Street, Baltimore, MD 21202 It is widely accepted that recognition of exposed glycans on the cell surface of potential pathogens by host humoral or cell-associatedlectins is a key component of the innate immune response of verte-brates and invertebrates. However, the protozoan parasite Perkin- sus oyster Crassos- trea virginica , and is responsible for catastrophic damage to shell- fisheries in North America. Until recently, the parasite s mecha- nism(s) for entry into the hemocyte had remained obscure. The re-cent results suggest identification and characterization in oysterhemocytes a galectin (CvGal) with a unique carbohydrate-recogni-tion domain (CRD) organization that, mammalian ga-lectins, recognizes exogenous carbohydrate Perkinus trophozoites, suggesting that it functions as a hemocyte surface receptor for this parasite, and facilitates its en-try into the host cells. Unlike all galectins known so far, CvGal dis-plays four CRDs that contain seven of the nine amino acid residuesthat bind ligand in the bovine galectin-1. Because the CvGal CRDsare similar, but not identical to each other, their carbohydrate spe-cificities may be also different. To characterize their carbohydratespecificity, we initiated the recombinant expression of the CvGalCRDs, individually and as combinations of 2 and 3 CRDs to enablethe rigorous analysis of their binding specificity and affinity. Wedeveloped expression constructs into a pET expression vector forall four individual CRDs, as well as CRDs 2-3 and CRDs1-2-3. Ex-pression, purification, and characterization of each recombinantCRD are underway.

Several studies indi-cated that BC was not absolutely safe for the fetus and able to in-duce perinatal stroke and ischemia in newborn babies [1]. A recentchemical analysis identified 15 alkaloid-triterpene compoundspresent in BC [2] and some of to verify the teratogenic potencyof BC during embryogenesis. We observed that BC was able to in-duce cardiovascular defects in medaka embryo during develop-ment; however, total protein, RNA in central nervous system (CNS) of medaka embryo duringembryogenesis remained unaltered. Further, we have used subtrac-tive hybridization technique to identify BC-sensitive genes in me-daka embryogenesis. We have observed that transcription factorGATA2 was over expressed by BC and in situ hybridization analysis indicated that GATA2 over expression was occurred in CNS. Analy-sis by semi-quantitative transcriptase polymerase that GATA2 mRNA expression was veryrapid (significantly increased within 15 min of BC exposure). Wepredict that teratogenic effects of BC are due to over expression ofGATA2 gene that can induce the expression of endothelin-1 mRNA in the cerebral microvessels and peripheral vessels, and thus causedysfunction of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular system of Japa-nese Medaka during development.

We have evaluated thepotency of Radix puerariae (RP), the root extracts of a legumi-nous creeper kudzu (Pueraria montana), as an FASD using Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes)embryo-larval development as the model. Previously, we have ob-served that ethanol was able to induce skeletal dismorphogenesisin medaka by reducing skeletal growth in a dose-dependent man-ner [2]. In this experiment we have used RP and puerarin (Sigma-Aldrich) as preventive agents of ethanol-induced skeletal dismor-phogenesis in medaka. RP was collected from the Lafayette Countyof Oxford and HPLC analysis indicated that puerarin is the majorisoflavone present in the methanolic extract of RP. Fertilized me-daka eggs in standard laboratory conditions (16 L: 8D, 25 0C) wereexposed to RP extract (0 -1.5 mg/ml) for 6 day post fertilization (dpf) and then maintained in 48 well tissue culture plate in hatch-ing solution (one embryo/ml/well). Embryo mortality was ob-served on 10 dpf. In separate experiments embryos were exposedto RP (0 -0.5 mg/ml), Puerarin (0.25 -1 mM) with or without ethanol (300 mM) for 2 dpf and then transferred to hatching solution. Thecalculated IC 50of RP as determined on 10 dpf is 785.3 \u00b1 2.66 \u00b5g/ml (n = 5). Hatched embryos on 10 dpf were used for morphometricanalysis of skeletal features including the skeleton, cranium, jaw,ethmoid and hypophyseal plate. It was observed that ethanol wasable to reduce the growth of all these skeletal features, however,RP or puerarin alone has no effect. When the embryos were treatedtogether with ethanol and RP or puerarin, ethanol-induced skeletalgrowth reductions were attenuated specifically by puerarin. concluded that puerarin, the major flavonoid has the potency to prevent ethanol-induced teratogenesis dur-ing development and can be used as an alternative natural medi-cine for the prevention of FASD or other alcohol related disorders.Acknowledgements: This work is supported in part by the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research SpecificCooperative Agreement No 586408-2-0009, National Center forNatural Product Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Missis-sippi, National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (1RO3AA016915) and from The Center of Research Excellence in Naturalproducts Neurosciences (P20RR021929).

Alkaloids and saponins are considered to be responsible for its pharmacological effects. In thisstudy the effects of methanolic extract of the roots of blue cohosh,alkaloidal fraction and isolated constituents on major drug metab-olizing cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes were evaluated.

Among the constituents, caulophyllumine weakly inhibited CYP3A4 (32% in- hibition \u00b5M). A more pronounced inhibitory effect on allthe four enzymes was observed by an equimolar mixture of alka-loids. Among the saponins, caulosides C and D inhibited CYP3A4 atthe highest test concentration of 100 \u00b5M (43% and 35% inhibition,respectively). Other enzymes were not affected.

P-90Preformulation Characterization of a Novel Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Amino The University of Mississippi, MS, 38677 2The National Center for Natural Product Research,The University of Mississippi, MS, 38677 3ElSohly Laboratories Inc., Oxford, MS, 38655 The current study evaluates the preformulation characteristics of THC-Serine, a novel prodrug of the poorly soluble compoundDelta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Aqueous 2-hydroxypropyl- - cyclodextrin (HP CD) were studied. The LogP and pKa were calcu- lated using computer modeling. Chemical, thermal and enzymaticstability of the prodrug was assessed at different pH (25\u00b0C), ele-vated temperature (120\u00b0C) and in human saliva, respectively. THC-Serine demonstrated pH dependent solubility. Highest solubilitywas observed at pH 2.0 (92-fold greater \u00b5g/ ml) than With increasing concentrations of HP CD solubility of THC-Serine was also observed to increase. Log P and pKa of THC-Serine were 3.18 and 7.05, respectively. Prodrug was most stable atpH 2.0, with a degradation rate constant of 3.17 \u00d7 10 4h1. Almost 80% of the prodrug remained intact after heating at 120\u00b0C for 8minutes. The degradation rate constant in saliva was found to be11.52 \u00d7 10 2h1. The above results indicate that THC-Serine is a lead candidate for transmucosal THC delivery and warrants further in-vestigation.

While THC in mar-ijuana is mainly known for its abuse potential, it also exhibits thetherapeutic effects in the treatment of nausea and vomiting duringcancer chemotherapy. The only dosage form currently approved byFDA is an oral, soft gelatin capsule (Marinol \u00ae). This dosage form is expensive, resulting in inconsistent pharmacological effects andpharmacokinetic profiles. Hence, prodrugs of THC are synthesizedfor the delivery by transbuccal route.

We determined the contributionmade by these bacterial components to the overall immune en-hancing activity detected in E. purpurea and E. angustifolia from bulk root and aerial material obtained from six major growers/sup-pliers in North America. Substantial variation in activity (up to 200-fold) was observed in extracts of these materials when tested intwo monocyte/macrophage cell lines. The majority of activity wasnegated by treatment with agents that target bacterial lipoproteins(lipoprotein lipase) and lipopolysaccharides (polymyxin B). Experi- ments comparing the activity of freeze dried, freshly harvestedEchinacea plants with those harvested and dried using various commercially relevant conditions, suggest that post-harvestingprocedures do not substantially contribute to the variation ob-served in the commercial material.

Hammad M1, Haron M1, Madgula L1, Ashfaq MK1, Walker LA1 1National Center for Natural Product Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677 Acute pancreatitis is a local inflammatory process that could occur due to multiple causes. This condition is diagnosed by elevatedplasma amylase. In mice there is only one predominant model ofacute pancreatitis, in which hyper-stimulatory doses of cholecysto-kinin or its analog caerulein are administered [1]. Nothing is knownabout herbs and botanicals for their potential to cause acute pan-creatitis. We report a suspected potential of green tea extract tocause acute pancreatitis in mice. Balb/C mice 20 -25 g was adminis- tered by oral gavage 200 uL of commercially available green tea ex-tract. After 18 hours blood samples were taken and were analyzedfor plasma chemistry profile and complete blood picture. Mice thatwere given green tea extract showed elevated plasma amylase(mean = 1428 \u00b1 546.27 U/L) whereas in the normal mice the meanwas 58.0 \u00b1 0.4 U/L. In addition, slight elevation of plasma AlanineAminotransferase (ALT) was observed (mean 127 York \u00b7 ISSN 0032 09438th Annual Oxford International Conference on the Science of Botanicals This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Green tea administered mice showed hyperactivity orrestlessness compared to normal controls. The blood pictureshowed slight elevation of granulocytes (ranging from 26.8 to83.2% Mean54%) as compared to normal that range between 8 to48%. Plasma amylase elevation is a good indicator of acute pancrea-titis. An increase in BUN and BUN: Creatinine (CRE) ratio is one ofthe manifestations of dehydration. In our study, plasma amylasewas remarkably increased in mice administered green tea. The caf-feine in the green tea extract may have caused dehydration due toincreased urination hence increasing BUN and BUN: CRE ratio. Weconclude that green tea extract in the doses administered in thisstudy could lead to acute pancreatitis.

Absent in garlic cloves,they are rapidly produced from alliin when endogenous alliinase isactivated crushing the produc-tion allyl thiosulfinates (hereafter called allicin) is known to becompletely inhibited by heat and acid (pH 3.5) in vitro, bringing into question any allicin-related health benefits of cooked garlic orgarlic powder supplements not protected from gastric acid. Indeed,most supplement brands have been shown to produce little allicinunder USP/NF-defined simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Todetermine if allicin production in the human body might be differ-ent from in vitro predictions, a method for measuring allicin bio-availability was developed (breath AUC of its main metabolite, and applied and bioavailability from the alliin of boiled garlicwas found to be 18% (14 -25%), much higher than expected, with a similar result for garlic powder suspended in 1 N HCl (pH 0.6).When garlic powder was consumed in capsules with a low proteinmeal (expected gastric pH < 3), 34% of the alliin was converted toallicin, indicating that the local pH is increased by the dissolvingcapsule. When pure alliin was consumed, only 4% of it was con-verted to allicin, probably by intestinal bacteria. The substantial dif-ference in allicin between heat- or acid-inactivatedgarlic (18%) alliin body has theability to partially reactivate inactive alliinase. This work has im-portant implications: (1) the health benefits of raw garlic can beobtained with cooked garlic, if consumed in larger amounts, as isoften the case, and (2) allicin bioavailability from garlic powdersupplements may be considerably higher than predicted in vitro,depending on how they are made and consumed. P-96Anti-Biofilm Activity of Marrubium vulgare CL1, Smeltzer M1 1University of Arkansas for Medical Department of Microbiology and Immunology, 4301 W Markham St.,Mail Slot 511, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA Many plants possess potent antimicrobial agents and provide effec- tive remedies for skin conditions. Infusions of the aerial parts ofMarrubium vulgare (white horehound) are used in the south Italian pharmacopoeia as a rinse for skin rashes and wounds [1]. Staphylo- coccus aureus , a common cause of skin infections, has generated in- creasing concern among health care professionals due to the prev-alence of drug resistant strains. Identification of novel antibioticsand anti-biofilm agents for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is important to healthcare on a global scale. The aim of this studywas to evaluate extracts from Marrubium vulgare forin vitro inhi-bition of planktonic growth, adherence in MRSA. A broth microtiter dilution method was employed to deter-mine the MIC after 18 hours growth using an optical density(OD 600 nm ) reading using a MRSA isolate (ATCC 33593). The impact of extracts on biofilm formation and adherence was tested bygrowing biofilms for 40 hours, then fixing and staining with crystalviolet. After washing, 10% Tween 80 was added and OD 570 nm read- ings were taken. A crude ethanolic extract of the roots was the mosteffective at inhibiting both biofilm formation (IC 50= 32 \u00b5g/ml) and adherence (IC 50= 8 \u00b5g/ml). A significant dose-dependent response for the inhibition of both biofilm formation and adherence was evi-dent.

P-99Biomarker Compounds in Muscadine and their Effects on Colon Cancer Cells Ranwala D1,L a n eH2, Wargovich M2, Gangemi J1 1Clemson University Institute for Nutraceutical Coastal Research & Education center, Charleston, SC 29414,USA 2Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology, Charleston, SC 29425, USA Muscadine (Vitis rotundifolia) is a native and valuable fruit crop in Southeastern US. Today muscadine products are commerciallyavailable as nutraceuticals. Major concerns in nutraceuticals areproduct quality and their effects on human health. This study wasconducted to evaluate muscadine nutraceutical powder derivedfrom pomace (cv. Noble) for biomarker compounds and their ef-fects on colon cancer cell lines. The powder was extracted after acidhydrolysis. The extract (CE) was further fractionated to obtain contents, were using colorimetric assays and HPLC PDA, respectively. The TP and TF contents in the fractions were highercompared to those of CE. The main polyphenol present in CE wasellagic acid, not resveratrol as in table grapes. The major anthocya-nins present were 3,5-diglucosidic anthocyanins in contrast tomonoglucosidic anthocyanins present in table grapes. The effectsof CE and FAF were tested in two colon cancer cell lines, HT-29and HCT-15, for cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest. Cell proliferationassays and flow cytometry data showed that FAF decreased viablecell proliferation in both cell lines, and evidence of G1 arrest ascompared to CE. These results indicate the bioactivity of fractionsrich in flavonoids and anthocyanins may be higher than that of CEin inhibiting colon cancer cell growth. P-100Anti-inflammatory, Analgesic Pharbitis Seeds (English) and Kala-Dana in local lan-guage. It is found wildly and cultivated throughout India. Tradition-ally, the seeds of this plant are used in severe headache, fever, in-flammation, and as a blood purifier [1,2]. Considering the tradi-tional uses of this drug, preliminary phytochemical studies andpresence of polyphenolic contents, this study was conducted antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities ofI. hederaceae . Methanolic seed extract was screened to evaluate its free-radical scavenging effect at different concentration (100 - 500 \u00b5g/ml) by using various in vitro methods [3]. The extract exhib-ited significant reducing power and free scavenging effect on theDPPH, \u00b5g/ml. Subsequent quantification showed the presence of0.82% w/w phenolics (calculated as garlic acid) per 100 g of drymass of I. hederaceae. The methanolic seed extract was also screened for analgesic effect by hot plate, tail immersion, tail flickand writhing syndrome at various doses (100, 200 and 500 mg/kg). The results were also compared with standard drug diclofenacsodium. The extract showed significant activity (p < 0.001) at500 mg/kg [4,5]. The extract at various doses (100, 200 and500 mg/kg) was also screened for anti-inflammatory activity bycarrageenan induced rat hind paw oedema method. Oedema by injecting 0.1 ml carrageenan suspension (1%) subcuta- neously into the sub-plantar side of hind paw [6].

Withania somnifera L. is reported to have anti-carcino- genic effects in animal and cell cultures by decreasing the expres-sion of nuclear factor-kappaB, suppressing intercellular tumor ne-crosis factor, and potentiating apoptotic signalling in cancerous celllines [1]. The present study was carried out on the purification,characterization and in vitro cytotoxicity of L-asparaginase fromWithania somnifera L., a popular medicinal plant. L-asparaginase was purified from the crude extract of the fruits of Withania somni- feraL. up to 95% through column chromatography. The purified L- asparaginase was characterized by size exclusion chromatography,PAGE and 2-D PAGE. The antitumor and growth inhibition L-asparaginase was assessed using MTT colorimetric dye reduc-tion method. The purified enzyme is a homodimer, with a molecu-lar mass of 72 \u00b1 0.5 kDa, and pI value of the enzyme was around 5.1.It is the first report for plant L-asparaginase with antitumor activ-ity. Data obtained from the MTT assay indicated that L-asparagi-nase significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the viability of lymphocytecells in a dose-dependent manner, showing a LD50 value of1.45 \u00b1 0.05 IU/ml. Withania somnifera L. proved to be an effective and a novel source of L-asparaginase, furthermore it shows lot ofsimilarity with bacterial L-asparaginases which have already beencommercialized for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.References: [1] Ichikawa sandalwood (English), Safed Chandan (Hindi) and Srigandha(Sanskrit).

Our objective was to investigateethanolic extract of the root part of Withania somnifera (WS) on hematological parameters as as serum and serum proteinin iron deficiency anaemia induced using haloperidol and observethe morphological changes in red blood cells. The animals weredivided into five groups. Group I acted as control, group II was hal-operidol control (0.2 mg/kg body weight i.p.), group III was treatedwith ethanolic extract alone (200 mg/kg body weight i.p.), group IVand V were given HP and ethanolic extract at the doses of 100 and200 mg/kg body weight i.p., respectively [1]. Effect of haloperidolon group II showed significant (P < 0.05) decrease in blood parame-ters, serum iron and serum protein, as compared to control animalsgroup I. Comparison of group II with group III, IV and V exhibitedsignificant (P < 0.05) increase in hematological parameters, serumiron and serum protein after four days and after recovery periodstudy (on 19th day). This effect may be due to presence of iron inextract (947 \u00b5g in 50 ml.) estimated quantitatively by spectropho-tometric method. Effect of ethanolic extract of Withania somnifera on morphology of blood cells was observed. It accelerated the oxy-gen carrying capacity of red blood cells and showed increasednumber of RBCs with normal counts and normocytic shape.

Inthis study polyphenolic extract (PPE) of leaves of Ichnocarpus tescens was evaluated for antitumor activity in vivo. Murine Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) model was used to assess PPE antitumoractivity in vivo [2]. PPE cytotoxicity was determined in vitro in U-937 monocytoid leukemia and K-562 erythroleukemia cell lines. The total phenolics content was quantified by the Folin-Ciocalteumethod [3]. Results of in vivo study showed a significant decreasein tumor volume, viable tumor cell count and a significant increaseof life span in the PPE treated group compared to untreated one:the life span of PPE treated animals increased by 53.41% (50 mgPPE/kg) and 73.95% (100 mg PPE/kg). PPE (5, 10 and 20 \u00b5g/mL) ef-fectively inhibits in vitro proliferation of U-937 and K-562 cell lines.The in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of PPE from Ichnocarpus frutescens could be due to rich polyphenols and flavonoids [4].

P-105Obesity Associated Dementia Among Elderly - Role of a Plant Based Formulation Agrawal University, Varanasi 2Centre for Advanced Research in Indian Thanjavur The main object of the present study was to evaluate association between obesity and dementia in elderly people and its preventionand management by a herbal formulation. Under this clinical trial80 men and women (aged 61 to 79 years,) underwent a detailedhealth evaluation, showing a high BMI with a major complaint ofloss of memory and deterioration of other cognitive functions weretreated with a novel herbal formulation Salacia oblonga andHippophae rham- noides in effective doses. Normal 58 aged (31 male and 27 female, BMI 18 -25) with normal cognitive functions, and 57 (33 male and 24 female) underweight aged (BMI < 18 with poor mental abilities)were also treated with test formulation. The test drug exerted ben-eficial effects on BMI, mental functions particularly on memory andattention span, inflammatory marker CRP including Homocysteine,plasma leptin and adiponectin levels during six months of studyperiod. It is concluded that test formulation enhanced the satiety,decreased appetite and fat absorption through regulation of 5-HT,leptin and adiponectin receptors involved in the onset of obesity.Thus, by regulating adipokines, memory, attention span and othercognitive impairments significantly improved among obese elderlydemented subjects. Improvement in mental performance was alsonoticed in normal as well as under weight aged also following testformulation treatment. Pre-clinical toxicity studies revealed thatdrug is safe and can be given for longer time.

After deter- mination of safety and efficacy profile in various animal studies, thedrug was slated for human trials. The beneficial role of the test drugwas validated on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk biomarkers par-ticularly lipid profile, homocysteine, C-reactive Protein, Interleu-kin-6, along with anxiety and depression among 65 menopausalwomen. A group of 38 menopausal women were kept on placebotherapy to compare results. It is observed that the novel test formu-lation has potential effect in reducing the elevated plasma homo-cysteine, C-reactive protein and Interleukin-levels. It also regulatedthe abnormal lipid levels, and thus, the future incidence of athero-sclerotic vascular disease can be prevented among menopausalwomen without any adverse effect. P-107Pharmacokinetic Pradesh, India Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) usage has recently gained interest among herbalists and modern medical practitioners because of itsunique pharmacological actions that are attributed to active sub-stances such as flavonoids and terpenoids [1]. It is commonly pre-scribed for improvement of cerebral circulation, memory improve-ment and antioxidant activity. Epileptics have a greater chance ofoxidative stress and memory impairment. G. biloba can be used as an alternative remedy in specific conditions such as oxidative stressand memory impairment [2]. This study aims to evaluate the phar-macokinetic interaction between the aqueous extract of Ginkgo bi- loba and carbamazepine. Two groups of animals, each containing 6 animals were used. The Group 1 and Group 2 received pretreat-ment with two different doses of extract for 7 days and on day 8the extract was co -administered with carbamazepine. The Group 3 (control) received carbamazepine alone on day 8. The blood sam-ples were collected for 24 hours. Samples were analyzed by HPLC[3] and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Analysis ofthe data reveals that there was very significant decrease (p < 0.05)in the C h) of C max (6.76 \u00b1 0.40 \u00b1 1.23 \u00b5g/ml h) of control. There was also a significant de-crease in the and MRT(3.53 \u00b1 0.24 h) of \u00b1 0.24 h) of con- trol. There was no significant difference in the t 1/2of the drug in both study groups when compared with control. This data suggestthat Ginkgo biloba reduced the bioavailability and increased the rate of elimination of carbamazepine which confirms that there issignificant herb-drug interaction between the two.
