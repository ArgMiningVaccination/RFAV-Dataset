Commissioner Comments : Commissioner Green noted that it is a credit to the ZSFG staff that there are only a small number of incidents. Dr. Ehrlich stated that ZSFG takes each event seriously and endeavors to learn what can be done to prevent similar incidents in the future. 4) TRUE NORTH SCORECARD PRESENTATION Chris Ross, MSIE, Strategic Planning Manager , presented the item. Commissioner Comments : Commissioner Green asked for clarification regarding the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the current diversion rate. Dr. Ehrlich stated that in general the pandemic has impacted all areas of ZSFG. She also stated that ambulance diversion has been a stru ggle for ZSFG. She noted that diversion levels were lower earlier in the pandemic. At a city - level, EMS is sponsoring a city -wide work group to address diversion throughout the city. Within ZSFG, focused data - driven work is being conducted in this area. Commissioner Green asked for more information regarding the current ZSFG star ratings. Dr. Ehrlich stated that there is a growing movement to better accommodate social determinants of health since public health hospitals serve patients who are much more co mplex and often have additional behavioral health and substance use issues. She noted that ZSFG choses metrics which may impact its star ratings. She added that it takes several years to see an impact on start ratings. 5) ZSFG CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REPORT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT NEWSLETTER Susan Ehrlich, Chief Executive Officer , presented the item. San Francisco, similar to the rest of California, the U.S., and the world, is in a rapidly changing environment with respect to COVID -19. The following are the latest changes and updates in our COVID -related operations; we are continually assessing these p olicies and practices: Omicron Coronavirus Variant Update The Omicron variant remains the primary variant causing disease in S.F. In response, ZSFG activated surge level red on January 18th - with 27% of our inpatients having COVID -19. At this time, the hospital is not only concerned about caring for our patients but also managing the staff exposure and risk. Additional countermeasures have been implemented to combat the surge such as decreasing number of in -person specialty care visits, outpatient/electi ve procedures/surgeries and come and stay surgeries; updating return to work policy; and revisiting our visitor policy. Fortunately over the past couple of weeks, ZSFG has seen a dramatic decline in the number of COVID -19 hospitalizations. In the course o f 10 days, the hospital went from a surge level red to a level yellow on February 7th, with a nearly 50% decrease in COVID -19 hospitalizations. Many thanks to all staff for continuing to adapt to the constantly changing circumstances! COVID -19 Contact Tra cing and Healthcare Worker -to-Patient Exposures On January 18th, Dr. Lisa Winston and Dr. Lukejohn Day announced that in order to effectively maintain the safety of our staff and patients, Infection Prevention & Control (IC) will concentrate contact tracin g resources within areas of increased risk for severe disease in the primary patient population. IC will, however, continue to receive and review all new positive employee information. As a result of this change, the team anticipated that there will be fe wer quarantined patients, without sacrifice of safety because: (1) the majority of our patients are in a single rooms, so there is little concern for patient -to- patient transmission; and (2) all staff are wearing N95 respirators for patient encounters, so there is little concern for patient -to-staff transmission. Nevertheless, to ensure patient safety in double -occupancy rooms, a separate protocol has been established and IC will initiate quarantine when appropriate. Additionally, to protect our patients, our staff were asked to observe the following: Patients must consistently wear isolation masks; Staff must wear N95 respirators; Staff must maintain distance from patients when possible and appropriate; and SAFETY 1. COVID -19 -Returning Safely Together Staff must monitor all patients for any symptom change and test promptly should any occur. After a long planning, design, construction and licensing journey, our Department of Rehabilitation is moving to Building 5, 3rd floor. The location is a brand new, bright, open, and lovely new space , designed by our rehab team that honors their work and the patients they serve. They are departing from the ground floor space that they have occupied since the late 1970s. The Rehabilitation Department provides Occupational, Physical, Speech Therapy and Psychiatric services to adult and pediatric patients of all ages in Acute Care, ICU, Short -Term Skilled Nursing, as well as outpatients. The Department's objective is to help restore functional abilities to individuals with physical, cognitive, communicat ive and/or sensori -perceptual impairments and facilitate their ability to achieve their maximal potential and their ability to function within the community. Whether it is treatment for knee arthritis, assisting post -stroke recovery, making recommendation s about swallowing function, or assessing for assistive devices like canes or walkers so patients can stay active and independent, this team provides essential services that keep our patients living safe and high -quality lives. The Department performs abo ut 150 inpatient evaluation and treatment sessions per day, and schedules about 120 outpatient evaluation and treatment sessions per day. This translates into 40,000 inpatient sessions and 20,000 outpatient sessions each year. In response to the COVID -19 p andemic, the team has creatively converted many of their services into telephone and telehealth visits. The sheer volume of work is a testament to the important function in the community. Congratulations to the Rehab team for moving into their new space a nd our deepest appreciation for all that they do! QUALITY2. Rehabilitation Department Opening On January 25th, Sophia Lai became ZSFG's new Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion! Sophia is a civil rights attorney who was recently employed with the Alameda Health System where she served as the Interim Privacy Officer and directed criminal justice reentry programs. Prior to serving in that role, Sophia was a consultant for homeless services across Northern California and a civil rights and labor attorney with the Bay Area public interest organizations. Sophia received her JD from Harvard Law School and her B.A. in Social Studies with a focus on Ethnic Studies from Harvard College. Additionally, Sophia is very passionate about making healthcare more equitable, efficient, and effec tive for all. Congratulations and many thanks to Sophia Lai for filling this incredibly important role! In February, Black History Month is celebrated to honor the extraordinary contributions that Black Americans have made to our country since its inception. Black Americans have achieved remarkable success in all domains, including healthcare; business; politics and social movements; and arts, sports and entertainment -- despite confronting many barriers due to individual, institutional, and structu ral racism. In spite of this success, all these types of racism continue to abound in our country. Collectively, we are indebted to Black American resiliency. When reflecting on the history of Black Americans nationally and locally in San Francisco, we rec ognize that racism, both past and present, is still the direct cause of significant health inequities in our communities. The first step to becoming an anti -racist individual and organization is to learn. ZSFG encourages members of our community to take advantage of the many opportunities available to learn more about both the historical struggles and achievements of Black Americans through programs such as the Equity Learning Series sponsored by the SFDPH Office of Health Equity's Black African American Health Initiative (BAAHI). All are welcome to also view the Black History Month display on the second floor of Building 25 - here's a sneak peek: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE4. Celebrating Black History MonthEQUITY 3. ZSFG's New Director of Diversity, Equity & InclusionZSFG is actively addressing these inequities through our Equity True North pillar. Our goal: in all ou r divisions and departments we identify health disparities, disparities in our workforce and in our staff and patient experience, and then eliminate them through data -driven improvement efforts. All staff are able to join in these efforts by speaking to th eir managers or supervisors. As Omicron starts to recede from our community, it's a perfect time to renew our commitment as individuals and as an organization to become anti -racist. To do so, ZSFG must be committed to driving out structural racism and anti-Blackness wherever we encounter it. Our privilege as health care professionals gives us the opportunity and the obligation to foster a work environment that is inclusive, free from bias, and without structural racism. Our deep gratitude to Sophia Lai, Di rector of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Andrea Turner, COO, for leading these important efforts! On February 1st, many members of our ZSFG community and billions of people throughout the world celebrated the Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival (Chinese), Tt (Vietnamese), Seollal (Korean), and other names, depending on tradition. For many cultures, Lunar New Year is the most important holiday of the year, and a time when extended families gather to celebrate. Many families practice traditional customs to bring good luck into the next year, including giving out red envelopes (with money) to younger generat ions and eating \"lucky\" foods such as dumplings, whole fish, and noodles. This year is the Year of the Tiger for the Chinese and Vietnamese zodiacs. To some, the tiger represents recovery and growth, important and powerful symbols for us as we begin recove ry from two years of pandemic and a very difficult January, with our fifth and most challenging COVID surge. Moving out of this surge, it is a great symbol for all of us - that of recovery and hope, along with the opportunity to honor our Chinese, Vietname se, Korean, and other communities who celebrate this holiday. (Lunar New Year Celebration Feb. 2020) On February 10th, our remarkably supportive San Francisco General Hospital Foundation celebrated ZSFG in a beautifully produced hour plus long virtual event at the 2022 Hearts in SF event. Our celebrators included Mayor London Breed, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and more than a thousand people who tuned in for this free event that raised more than $1 million for the work we do here on campus. DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE5. Celebrating Lunar New Year DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE6. 2022 Hearts in SFThe Found ation gave special awards to Drs. Neil Powe, Geoff Manley and Malini Singh. These incredible researchers, educators and care providers are truly exceptional and have contributed so much to our mission and vision here at ZSFG. The Foundation's CEO, Kim Mere dith, facilitated a powerful conversation with Dr. Priscilla Chan, who articulately and authentically spoke about her life's work and her experience with and devotion to ZSFG. Additionally, environmental service workers, facilities and engineering teams, S ojourn chaplains, and H66 -68 nurses had the opportunity to share exactly how they've stepped up to serve our community during the past two years. Whether they are carefully cleaning an exam room, setting up a vaccination tent in a parking lot, holding hand s and praying with a family member of a critically ill patient, or providing loving nursing care for a patient acutely ill with COVID, they were all extremely passionate about the work that they do. Although their scopes of work are very different, they ar e united by their devotion to our teams and our patients here at ZSFG. Finally, Dr. Sue Carlisle was celebrated on the occasion of her upcoming retirement. With over 40 years of service to public health there is no better hero to spotlight at Hearts in SF this year than Dr. Sue Carlisle, Vice Dean of the UCSF School of Medicine at ZSFG. Congratulations and many thanks to all our special heroes! This past month, ZSFG celebrated the following healthcare recognition in honor of our staff and the incre dible work they do every single day! Perianesthesia Nurse Week February 7 -13 is Perianesthesia Nurses Week! This week celebrates the nurses in preanesthesia and postanesthesia care, ambulatory surgery, and pain management and provides an opportunity to ed ucate nursing colleagues and the community about the professionalism and passionate care that is delivered by perianesthesia nurses. Cardiovascular Professionals Week February 13 -19 is Cardiovascular Professionals Week! This week recognizes Cardiovascular Professionals' compassion, consistency, and commitment to delivering emergent and routine cardiology care, always and especially during the pandemic. Many thanks to all our wonderful staff in all departments that go above and beyond to provide the highest level of care to our patients and community ! DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE7.
