There aren't many musicians who can create music that moves you on a deep spiritual level, cracks you wide open, and is chart-toppingly epic at the same time... But Nick Broadhurst does exactly that! Also known as [BROADHURST](https://iamnickbroadhurst.com/), not only is this man an incredible musician, he's also an amazing husband, father and entrepreneur who has so many genius insights into getting the most out of life. Paying close attention to what he has to say is, in many ways, like a shortcut for your own personal growth. Nick has been on a fascinating journey: from being a founding member in the pop sensation Sneaky Sound System, then becoming Australia's top real estate agent, to being bedridden for three years with Lyme disease, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and now finally living out his true passion as a popular musician. And today, not only do we get to hear this divine human speak about the creative power of love and relationships, we are also celebrating the release of his latest single and music video, The One, featuring... me!
