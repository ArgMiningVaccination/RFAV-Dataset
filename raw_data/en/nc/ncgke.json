A claim for a credit or refund must include documentation supporting the claim. 3. If the overpayment is due to an error or omission in a previously filed return, the claim should be in the form of an amended return, as prescribed by the Department, for each period in which the tax was originally reported. The amended return must specify the original amounts reported, the correct amounts and the differences. 4. The person requesting the credit or refund must be the person who was legally obligated to remit the tax to the Department or the person's legal successor or authorized representative.5. Upon a determination by the Department that an overpayment was made by the taxpayer and upon the approval of the State Board of Examiners or board of county commissioners, as appropriate, the Department shall issue a statement to the taxpayer allowing a credit in the amount of the overpayment unless the taxpayer specifically requests a refund on the claim. The credit may be applied to any future tax liability of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer requests a refund, the Department shall issue a refund to the taxpayer in an amount which is equal to the amount of the credit owed to the taxpayer at the time the request for a refund is made. When applicable, the Department shall deduct from the credit or refund an amount equal to the amount deducted and withheld by the taxpayer for reimbursement pursuant to NRS 372.370 or 374.375, as appropriate, for the cost of collecting the tax being credited or refunded in accordance with this section. 137360.492 Provision of credit or refund to customer; resale of returned property.1.

A retailer shall file a return as required in NRS 372.360 or 374.365, as appropriate, even if, as a result of providing a credit or refund to a customer, there is no tax due from the retailer. (b)After the retailer has remitted the tax to the Department, the retailer may deduct the amount of the sales price so credited or refunded from gross receipts on the return filed by the retailer for the period in which the credit was given or refund was made if the tax rates in the two periods are the same. If the tax rates are not the same, the retailer must submit to the Department an amended return for the period in which the original sale was made. If a retailer has insufficient gross receipts during the period in which a credit or refund has been made to a customer to offset the credit or refund so made, the retailer may take that amount as a credit against gross receipts and report a negative amount. Unless the retailer has requested a refund, the Department shall issue a statement to the retailer allowing a credit that may be applied against future tax liability of the retailer. If the retailer requests a refund, the Department shall issue a refund to the retailer in an amount that is equal to the amount of the credit owed to the retailer at the time the request is made. 3.

If the customer attempts, but is unable, to receive the credit or refund from the retailer, the customer may apply for the credit or refund directly from the Department. When applicable, the Department shall deduct from the credit or refund to be paid to the customer an amount equal to the amount deducted and withheld by the retailer for reimbursement pursuant to NRS 372.370 or 374.375, as appropriate, for the cost of collecting the tax being credited or refunded. 4.

If sufficient sales of comparable properties which were vacant at the time of sale are available, a county assessor shall determine the full cash value of land by applying the sales comparison approach using: (a)A mass appraisal technique in accordance with the provisions of NAC 361.11795 to 361.1188, inclusive; or (b)A single property technique in accordance with the provisions of NAC 361.118 to 361.1188, inclusive. 2. If insufficient sales of comparable properties which were vacant at the time of sale are available to carry out subsection 1, a county assessor shall determine the full cash value of land as provided in NAC 361.119. 67361.11795 Land: Sales comparison approach using mass appraisal technique. A county assessor shall apply the sales comparison approach using a mass appraisal technique as follows: 1. The county assessor shall stratify the properties being appraised into groups based upon location, zoning, use or other relevant characteristics. Sufficient strata must be established to ensure that all types of property subject to appraisal are appropriately represented. 2. After stratification pursuant to subsection 1, the county assessor shall: (a) For each stratum: (1) Analyze sales of comparable land; and (2)Make adjustments to the sales prices as necessary to eliminate any nonrealty components of value and any differences resulting from the real property rights conveyed, financing terms, conditions of sale, market conditions, location, physical characteristics, size, zoning, use, governmental restrictions, sales concessions and expenditures made after sales that influence sales prices; and (b)Determine an appropriate base lot or comparative unit value to be used as a benchmark for valuing the properties in each stratum and, if appropriate, market adjustments to the base lot or comparative unit value for differences in physical characteristics, size, zoning, use, view, governmental restrictions and other attributes that affect value. The adjustments: (1)Must be mathematical changes made to the base lot or comparative unit values to account for differences in the elements of comparison between the base lot or comparative unit and the subject property; (2) May be made only to the base lot or comparative unit value in order to reflect the value of the subject property; and (3)May be made by adding or subtracting lump-sum dollar values, or by applying positive or negative percentage differentials, to the base lot or comparative unit values. 68361.118 Land: Sales comparison approach using single property technique.A county assessor shall apply the sales comparison approach using a single property technique as follows: 1. The county assessor shall adjust the sales prices or unit values of comparable properties as necessary to eliminate differences between the comparable properties and the subject property that affect value. The adjustments: (a)Must be mathematical changes made to the sales prices or unit values of the comparable properties to account for differences in elements of comparison between the comparable properties and the subject property; (b)May be made only to the comparable properties, and not to the subject property; and (c)May be made by adding or subtracting lump-sum dollar values, or by applying positive or negative percentage differentials, to the sales prices or unit values of the comparable properties. 2. The elements of comparison between the comparable properties and the subject property that may be used by the county assessor include, without limitation, the real property rights conveyed, financing terms, conditions of sale, market conditions, location, physical characteristics, size, zoning or use, governmental restrictions and nonrealty components of value. 3. After adjusting the comparable properties for differences that affect value, the county assessor shall analyze the range of adjusted sales prices of the comparable properties to arrive at an estimate of value for the subject property. 69361.1182 Land: General requirements for sales comparison approach.For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of NAC 361.11795 or 361.118: 1. If the subject property is improved land, the comparable properties must have a use that is consistent with that of the improved land. 2. The elements of comparison used and adjustments made by the county assessor must be identifiable and supported by verifiable market data. 3. If it is necessary to make an adjustment to recognize the view influence or any other property attribute associated with the subject property, the county assessor shall: (a)Make a physical determination of the view influence from the land of each respective view parcel. The county assessor shall make the view influence determination from any area on the parcel that is capable of development. This would exclude legally required setbacks or portions of the parcel subject to applicable land use restrictions or applicable deed restrictions that prohibit development. (b)Upon the written request of the owner, provide to the owner as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after receiving the request, current market evidence for each adjustment for the view influence or other property attribute. In a county whose population is 40,000 or more, \"current market evidence\" as used in this paragraph means sales data concerning sales of improved or unimproved parcels that occurred during the 36-month period immediately preceding July 1 of the year before the lien date,unless the Commission has approved the petition of the county assessor to consider sales that occurred before that 36-month period. (c)Upon the written request of the owner, provide to the owner as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after receiving the request, a comprehensive written analysis describing any mass appraisal or single property technique used, written in such a manner that the taxpayer can determine whether the value of the parcel has been appropriately adjusted by the county assessor. For an appraisal made using a: (1)Single property technique, the written analysis must describe each adjustment, whether attributable to view influence or another property attribute, and how each adjustment was made. (2)Mass appraisal technique, the written analysis must describe the stratum in which the parcel was included, the comparable sales and any adjustments thereto used to develop a base lot or comparative unit value for the stratum, and any adjustments made to the base lot or comparative unit value to determine the value of the property. (d)Consider whether an adjustment is necessary because of impairments caused by obstructions or aesthetic criteria, including, without limitation, tree growth, utility lines, water tanks or the presence of other improvements. 70361.1184 Land: Stratification for purposes of sales comparison approach. 1. For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of NAC 361.11795 or 361.118, a county assessor: (a)Must stratify comparable properties into the primary categories of land use prescribed by the Department pursuant to NAC 361.1178; and (b) May also stratify those properties: (1) Into any secondary categories of land use prescribed by the Department pursuant to NAC 361.1178; and (2)If those properties are used in a similar or competitive manner, into geographic market areas. Geographic market areas must be initially defined by major natural, political or human-constructed boundaries and then further defined by areas of complementary land uses or neighborhoods, in which all the properties are similarly influenced by environmental, governmental, social and economic forces. Additional criteria may be considered for defining a geographic market area, including, without limitation, the size of the parcels or subdivisions of land. 2. For the purposes of carrying out this section, a county assessor: (a)Must determine the number of land use categories and geographic market areas to use in the stratification of comparable properties based upon on the size and diversity of the geographic area being analyzed and the number of sales available within each proposed stratum; and (b)May, if a geographic market area crosses county boundaries, cooperate with other county assessors in the exchange of information. 71361.1186 Land: Sales data for purposes of sales comparison approach.For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of NAC 361.11795 or 361.118: 1. In determining whether the sales price of each comparable property is representative of the full cash value of the subject property, the county assessor must acquire sufficient sales data concerning the comparable property. The sales data may include, without limitation: (a)The total amount paid for the property and the terms of sale; (b)The names and contact information of the buyer and seller; (c)The relationship of the buyer and seller; (d)The legal description, address and parcel identifier of the property; (e)Information concerning the type of transfer that is sufficient to enable the county assessor to determine whether the transfer was at arm's length; (f) The length of time the property was on the market; (g) The extent of the interest transferred to the buyer; (h) The nature of nonrealty items; and(i) The date of the transfer. 2. The county assessor may determine the accuracy of the sales data acquired pursuant to subsection 1 by: (a)Contacting the buyer, seller, title company or any other knowledgeable participant in the transaction; (b)Using sales questionnaires; (c)Conducting personal interviews; or (d)Reviewing declarations of value. --- The county assessor shall disclose to each person he or she contacts for information pursuant to this subsection that the information provided by the person will only be used to establish value for the purposes of property taxation. 3. The following types of sales may provide unreliable information regarding full cash value and require additional verification to determine whether the sale represents full cash value: (a)Sales involving governmental agencies and public utilities; (b)Sales involving charitable, religious or educational institutions; (c) Sales involving financial institutions;(d) Sales between relatives or corporate affiliates;(e) Sales of convenience, including, without limitation, a sale intended to correct a flaw in title; (f) Sales settling an estate; (g) Forced sales, including, without limitation, a sale resulting from a judicial order; and (h)Sales involving doubtful title. 4. The county assessor may sort sales and other market data into homogeneous groups to reflect different market influences and variations in zoning, other land-use controls and probable use, and to ensure that land values will reflect market data for parcels with similar or competitive uses in the same area. 72361.1188 Land: Adjustments for purposes of sales comparison approach. 1. For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of NAC 361.11795 or 361.118: (a)The amount of the adjustments to comparable sales or to the base lot or comparative unit value must be determined using paired sales analysis, sales-resales analysis, regression analysis or another model calibration technique in accordance with the provisions of chapters 6 and 15 of Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration, as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. (b)If multiple types of adjustments to comparable sales or to the base lot or comparative unit value are necessary, those adjustments must be made as follows: (1) Any transactional adjustments must be made to the total sale price in the following sequential order: (I) Adjustments for the real property rights conveyed. (II) Adjustments for the financing terms. (III) Adjustments for the conditions of sale, including any sales concessions. (IV) Adjustments for expenditures made immediately after the purchase. (V) Adjustments for market conditions. (2)After making all the applicable transactional adjustments described in subparagraph (1), units of comparison must be calculated based upon the adjusted sale price, and then adjusted for differences in location and any physical, economic and other characteristics which affect value. 2. For the purposes of this section: (a)\"Adjustments for market conditions\" means adjustments to reflect increases or decreases in property values in the market for property over time. (b)Adjustments for market conditions must not be made unless property values for the same general area and classification of property have increased or decreased since the transaction dates. To make such an adjustment, the difference in sales prices of the same or similar properties over time must be measured to extract a rate of adjustment to apply to comparable sales to improve comparability. 73361.119 Land: Alternate methods to sales comparison approach.1. If a county assessor is not able to use the sales comparison approach for land pursuant to NAC 361.11795 or 361.118 because sufficient sales of comparable properties which were vacant at the time of sale are not available, the county assessor shall determine the full cash value of land through any of the following methods, either in combination with available land sales or as the sole method of valuation: (a)Abstraction method; (b)Land of development method; (e) Allocation method, if the properties are substantially similar; and (f) Regression analysis. 2. The use of sales of comparable improved properties pursuant to subsection 1 is subject to the provisions of NAC 361.11795 or 361.118, as applicable, NAC 361.1182 to 361.1188, inclusive, and the following: (a)Sales of comparable improved properties must be adjusted to remove the full contributory value of all items attributable to the improvements, including, without limitation, direct and indirect costs, soft costs, entrepreneurial profit, and personal property and other nonrealty components of value. The costs may be reported in a lump-sum basis per unit. (b)The complete obsolescence of an improvement for purposes of analyzing the sales price of a comparable improved property is best determined when the improvement is demolished or removed, but may be considered when: (1)Sufficient evidence demonstrates an intention to demolish or remove the improvement, which evidence may include, without limitation, evidence that: (I) A permit has been issued for the demolition of the improvement; (II)A disclosure concerning the demolition or removal of the improvement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; (III) An order has been issued for the condemnation of the improvement; or (IV)Construction and development financing has been obtained with respect to the comparable property which establishes that the demolition or removal of the improvement is intended; and (2)No occupancy or no use is established before the completion of the demolition or removal of the improvement. (c)Sales of comparable improved properties may be used in determining valuation regardless of whether the complete obsolescence of an improvement may be determined or considered pursuant to paragraph (b). 74361.1192 Land: General requirements for use of alternative methods.If a county assessor uses any of the methods described in subsection 1 of NAC 361.119 to derive the value of land, the county assessor must: 1. Examine and evaluate: (a) The reliability and accuracy of the method used;(b) The characteristics of the subject property; (c)The sufficiency and quantity of the data used to derive the value; (d)The reliability and accuracy of the data used and any pertinent adjustments made to comparable property; (e) The relative validity of each comparable sale used; (f)The number and magnitude of any adjustments made to comparable property or the reasons why no adjustments were made; and (g)The relative importance of individual elements of comparison; and 2. Determine whether: (a)The derived value is accurate for the type of property being valued; or (b)Another method must be used or additional data must be obtained to derive the value accurately. 75361.1194 Land: Abstraction method. When using the abstraction method, a county assessor must: 1. Perform that method in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 of Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration, as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. 2. Apply accrued depreciation, in accordance with the provisions of NAC 361.1225, when calculating the full contributory value of the improvements to be subtracted from the sale price of the improved parcel to derive the residual land value. 3. Analyze the residual land values obtained in the same manner as sales of vacant land to establish comparative unit or base lot values. 76361.1196 Land: Land residual technique. When using the land residual technique, a county assessor must perform that technique in accordance with the provisions of chapter 12 of Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration, as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. 77361.1198 Land: Capitalization of ground rents. 1. A county assessor may use the capitalization of ground rents to derive the value of land only when there is sufficient information regarding land rentals or leases which are independent of improvements, such as, without limitation, a rental of farmland or commercial land which is leased on a net basis where the lessee is responsible for property taxes and all other expenses. 2. When using the capitalization of ground rents to derive the value of land: (a)A county assessor must perform that method in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 of Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration, as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. (b) If a lease: (1) Has been recently negotiated or is still representative of current market rents, a county assessor may directly capitalize the net rent into an indicated land value; or (2)Is outdated or no longer representative of current market rents, a county assessor must reject the lease or adjust the lease to current market conditions using verifiable market data. 78361.1202 Land: Cost of development method.When using the cost of development method, a county assessor must: 1. Perform that method in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 of Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration, as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. 2. Deduct the following costs from an estimate of the probable proceeds to be obtained from selling the land as developed parcels: (a) The direct costs of site preparation; (b)The costs for utility hookups; (c)Any other direct and indirect costs of development; and (d)A reasonable allowance for entrepreneurial profit. 79361.1204 Land: Allocation method. When using the allocation method, a county assessor must: 1. Estimate the logical and proportionate relationship of the value of land to the total value of real property by analyzing: (a)Historical sales of vacant land and improved land in the same geographic market area as the subject property, without limitation as to the dates of those sales; (b)Sales of vacant land and improved land in similar or competitive geographic market areas; (c)Sales of vacant land compared to subsequent sales of the same or substantially similar parcels after improvements have been built; or (d)Residual land values obtained using the abstraction method; 2. Apply the resulting ratio of land to total value to sales of comparable improved land to determine the portion of the sales prices attributable to land; and 3. Analyze the land values obtained in the same manner as sales of vacant land to establish comparative unit or base lot values. 80361.1206 Land: Regression analysis. When using regression analysis to derive the value of land, a county assessor must: 1. Base that analysis on the principle of contribution to value, pursuant to which the major characteristics of a site and any improvements must be analyzed to determine how much each component characteristic contributes to value. 2. Apply that analysis in accordance with the requirements of NAC 361.1216. 81361.121 Obtaining and maintaining sufficient data regarding characteristics of property.A county assessor shall: 1. Obtain, in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Standard on Mass Appraisal of Real Property, as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177, a sufficient amount of data regarding the characteristics of property to determine the appropriate classification and valuation of property in the county.2. Maintain the data obtained pursuant to subsection 1 on electronic media. 82361.1212 Use of appropriate units of comparison.When comparing sales of properties for the purpose of property valuation, a county assessor must use units of comparison which conform to the basis upon which those properties are analyzed and sold in the market. CHAPTER 361 - PROPERTY TAX83361.1214 Consideration of influence of on-site and off-site enhancements.Since on-site enhancements and off-site enhancements may affect the uses to which a parcel of land is being or may lawfully be put, a county assessor shall consider the influence of on-site enhancements and off-site enhancements when determining the value of the land. 84361.1216 Development of mass appraisal model to explain or predict market value from real estate data.When developing a mass appraisal model to explain or predict the market value of properties from real estate data, a county assessor must build and calibrate the model in accordance with the provisions of chapters 14 and 15 of Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration and the provisions of the Standard on Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. 85361.1218 Determination of whether sufficient sales of comparable properties are available.For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of NAC 361.106 to 361.1315, inclusive, a county assessor must determine whether sufficient sales of comparable properties are available based upon: 1. The nature and complexity of the subject property to which the sales are being compared; 2. The degree of homogeneity of elements of comparison between the subject property and the comparable properties; 3. Market conditions; and 4. The reliability of the information regarding each sale from which a credible conclusion may be obtained. 86361.122 Valuation of improved land. 1. If improved land is being put to a use that is: (a)Consistent with the zoning of the land or with the general use of land in the surrounding area, the value of the improved land must be established by using comparable sales from a stratum with similar zoning and location in accordance with NAC 361.11795 or 361.118 or, if appropriate, NAC 361.119; or (b)Not consistent with the zoning of the land or with the general use of land in the surrounding area, the value of the improved land must be established, in accordance with NAC 361.11795 or 361.118 or, if appropriate, NAC 361.119, by using comparable sales from a stratum that: (1) Is most comparable to the improved land; (2) Has the same or a similar use; and (3) Is affected by the same or similar restrictions. 2. The area of land to be valued according to the use of the improvements is the area actually covered by each improvement, plus the surrounding area necessary to support the use of the improvement, as determined in accordance with any zoning restrictions and other legally enforceable restrictions on the current use of the land. Any excess or surplus land must be valued as if vacant in accordance with NAC 361.11795 or 361.118 or, if appropriate, NAC 361.119. 3. As used in this section: (a)\"Excess land\" means land that is not currently needed to serve or support an existing improvement, and which has the potential to be sold separately from any land that is needed to serve or support an existing improvement. (b)\"Surplus land\" means land that is not currently needed to serve or support an existing improvement, but which does not have an independent use separate from an existing improvement and does not have the potential to be sold separately from any land that is needed to serve or support an existing improvement. 87361.1225 Accrued depreciation: Application; calculation.A county assessor: 1. Shall apply accrued depreciation when determining: (a)The value of improvements using the abstraction method pursuant to NAC 361.1194 or paragraph (d) of subsection 1 of NAC 361.1204; and (b)The contributory value of improvements pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 5 of NRS 361.227. 2. Shall calculate accrued depreciation by:(a) The market extraction method; (b)The economic age-life method; or (c)The observed condition breakdown method, --- in accordance with the provisions of chapter 8 of Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration, as adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. When calculating accrued depreciation by the economic age-life method, a county assessor may use the life-expectancy tables provided in the most recent version of the Residential Cost Handbook, Marshall Valuation Service, Residential Estimator software or Commercial Estimator software, as appropriate, adopted by reference in NAC 361.1177. 3. Shall not apply accrued depreciation when determining the taxable value of any improvements pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 361.227. 88361.123 Contaminated property: Definitions.As used in NAC 361.123 context otherwise requires: 1. \"Contaminated site\" means: (a)Land on which the release of a hazardous substance has been verified pursuant to NAC 361.1232; or (b)An improvement for which permeation or incorporation into construction by a hazardous substance has been verified pursuant to NAC 361.1232, --- on or before the assessment date of the property. 2. \"Cost-to-cure\" means the present value of the remedial work to be performed to remove, contain or treat a hazardous substance on the property being valued. The term includes the cost of continued monitoring of the site after the remedial work has been completed if such monitoring is required. 3. \"Hazardous substance\" means a hazardous material or hazardous waste as those terms are defined in NRS 459.428 and 459.430, respectively. 89361.1232 Contaminated property: Burden of proof; documentation required. 1. The burden of proving that property has been contaminated and documenting the proof of contamination to support a possible reduction of the assessed value of the property lies with the owner of the property. 2. To verify the release of a hazardous substance on land or the permeation or incorporation into the construction of an improvement by a hazardous substance, the owner of the property must: (a)Submit reliable, objective information, such as an engineering study, environmental audit, laboratory report or historical record, which proves to the satisfaction of the assessor that a hazardous substance has been released on the land or has permeated or been incorporated into the construction of an improvement; (b)Show that the release, permeation or incorporation was reported to an appropriate governmental agency such as the National Response Center or the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; and (c)Provide sufficient data to the assessor to indicate the status of a proposed or ongoing cleanup plan. 3. To document the proof of contamination to support a possible reduction of the assessed value of the property, the owner of the property must submit to the assessor: (a) A list of available comparable sales of similarly contaminated property, if any; (b)Any pertinent information concerning the cleanup of the hazardous substance; and (c)Where there is an existing business operating on the contaminated site, records of income and expense necessary to allow the assessor to estimate the value of the real property, as if uncontaminated, by the income approach. 90361.1234 Contaminated property: Determination of full cash value.In determining, pursuant to NRS 361.227, the full cash value of property that has been determined by the assessor to be a contaminated site: 1. The sales comparison approach may be used by comparing verified sales of similarly contaminated sites; 2. Where applicable, the income approach may be used by utilizing rent, vacancy and expense data derived from a survey of similarly contaminated sites with similarly used improvements; or 3. Where no sales or rental market exists for similarly contaminated properties: (a)The value of the property for a specific use, or a specific user, reflecting the extent to which the property contributes to the utility or profitability of the enterprise of which it is a part may be determined by using the income approach, except that the value so determined must not exceed the full cash value of the property; or (b)The present worth of the contaminated site may be determined by: (1)Discounting the present worth of the property if it was contaminated by an off-site source or the cost-to-cure is not being borne by the current owner, or both, on the basis of the length of the delay caused by the contamination until the property can be developed to its highest and best use, readily sold or financed on the open market; or (2)Using the present cash equivalency which represents the future reversionary value of the contaminated site after it is cleaned up to an extent that it is usable or developable to its highest and best use less the present worth of the yearly costs-to-cure if the current owner is incurring the remedial costs and an accurate forecast of the year-to-year costs to be incurred and the estimated date of the completion of the cleanup are available. 91361.1236 Contaminated property: Annual review.The assessor shall review annually the assessment of any property which has been valued as a contaminated site pursuant to NAC 361.123, 361.1232 and 361.1234 to ensure that the remedial work, if any, is being performed as scheduled and to verify the actual yearly cost-to-cure. 92361.124 Determination of actual age of improvement or newly constructed addition to improvement.In determining the actual age of: 1. An improvement or newly constructed addition to an existing improvement, the county assessor shall use the actual year of construction, if it is available, or else an estimated year of construction. 2. An improvement that has been constructed over a period of years, the county assessor shall use the weighted average age of the improvement. 93361.125 Improvement: Initial taxable value. 1. In determining the initial taxable value of an improvement, the rate of depreciation is set forth in NRS 361.227. 2. If obsolescence, deterioration or wear and tear causes the taxable value calculated pursuant to subsection 1 to exceed the full cash value of the improvements, the additional depreciation and obsolescence may be calculated separately. 94361.127 Improvement: Replacement. 1. If the use or quality of an existing improvement is changed by a replacement, the county assessor shall revalue the improvement according to the new use or quality as of the time the replacement occurs. 2 . Each county assessor who determines the percentage of the replacement made to an improvement: (a) May use the \"Percentage Breakdown of Base Cost\" published in the version of the Marshall Valuation Service adopted by reference pursuant to NAC 361.1177 as of January 1 of the year immediately preceding the lien date for the current year. (b)Must consider the total replacements made to an improvement which have been accumulated since its construction or the last computation of replacement if one has been made. 3. As used in this section, the term \"replacement\" includes items of remodeling or renovation which extend the useful life of an improvement, other than those items excluded by the provisions of NRS 361.229. 95361.128 Improvement: Calculation of cost of replacement. 1. The cost of replacement of an improvement must be calculated: (a)Without including any costs attributable to land enhancements; and (b)Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2, 3 and 4, using: (1)The standards and modifiers of local costs published in the version of the Residential Cost Handbook, Marshall Valuation Service, Residential Estimator software or Commercial Estimator software, as appropriate, adopted by reference pursuant to NAC 361.1177 as of January 1 of the year immediately preceding the lien date for the current year; or (2)With the prior approval of the Executive Director, other computer programs for determining cost which are based on costs published by Marshall & Swift. 2.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the cost of replacement of a farm building, a shed or another rustic structure constructed by a person who regularly performs construction work and earns a substantial portion of his or her income as a licensed contractor must be calculated using: (a)The standards and modifiers of local costs published in the version of the Residential Cost Handbook, Marshall Valuation Service, Residential Estimator software or Commercial Estimator software, as appropriate, adopted by reference pursuant to NAC 361.1177 as of January 1 of the year immediately preceding the lien date for the current year; or (b)The manual of rural building costs adopted by the Commission, except that the costs therein must be adjusted upward by 33 percent. 4. If no publication or manual required to be used pursuant to the provisions of this section applies to improvements of a particular occupancy or construction type, the county assessor may apply to the Executive Director for permission to use alternative recognized cost manuals, cost determinations or subscription services. If the Executive Director finds that no publication or manual required to be used pursuant to the provisions of this section applies to such improvements and that the alternative recognized cost manuals, cost determinations or subscription services are suitable, the Executive Director shall, within 30 days after receiving an application pursuant to this subsection, approve the use of the alternative recognized cost manuals, cost determinations orsubscription services and notify each county assessor of that approval. The Executive Director shall submit to the Commission annually a list of the alternative recognized cost manuals, cost determinations and subscription services that the Executive Director has approved for use. 96361.1285 Common-interest communities. 1.

The Department will annually publish a Personal Property Manual which describes the methods and standards that must be used for the valuation of personal property. The manual must include, without limitation, annually updated: (a)Cost-index factors that must be used in the conversion of acquisition cost into an estimate of replacement cost new; (b)Expected-life schedules that indicate the category of expected life for each type of property or type of industry in which the property is used; and (c)Percent-good tables which indicate the rate of depreciation that must be applied. 2. The Personal Property Manual must be approved by the Commission before publication. The Department, at least 1 month before presenting the manual to the Commission for approval, must disclose all proposed modifications to the manual and hold a public workshop on the modifications. 3. Each county assessor shall use the Personal Property Manual in determining the taxable value of personal property. 114361.1371 Procedure for determination of taxable value. 1. The taxable value of personal property must be determined by adjusting the acquisition cost of the property by a cost-index factor and reducing the adjusted acquisition cost by an estimate of applicable depreciation. The taxable value so determined shall be deemed to be the indicator of value of replacement cost new less depreciation. 2. In determining taxable value, a county assessor shall use the schedules in the Personal Property Manual that show the cost-index factors, the rates of depreciation and the percent good by year. The assessor shall use the schedules by: (a)Selecting the appropriate expected useful life of the personal property; and (b)Selecting the appropriate cost-index factor, based on the year of acquisition of the property, and applying it to the acquisition cost of the property. --- The result shall be deemed to be the replacement cost new of the property. 3. The assessor shall select the method of applying depreciation to the personal property by either: (a)Multiplying the adjusted acquisition cost of the property by the rate of depreciation and subtracting the result from the adjusted acquisition cost; or (b)Multiplying the adjusted acquisition cost of the property by the percent-good factor. --- The result from either approach shall be deemed to be the taxable value of the property. 115361.1375 Determination of expected life, cost-index factors and depreciation. 1. Personal property must be categorized by the specific type of property that it is or by the type of industry in which it is used. Each category must be assigned to a schedule of expected life which is based on commonly available sources of information,including, without limitation, the life expectancy guidelines published by the Marshall and Swift Valuation Service and any other sources published in the Personal Property Manual. 2. The cost-index factors published in the Personal Property Manual must be determined by calculating the average change in costs over time. The Department shall identify the sources used to calculate the average change. 3. For purposes of calculating the amount of applicable depreciation, personal property must be assigned to one of the following expected lives: (a) Thirty-year life. 4. Depreciation must be calculated over the expected life of the personal property by using the declining balance method, except that tables which provide a method other than the declining balance method for calculating depreciation may be used if the tables have been approved by the Commission and included in the Personal Property Manual. 5. For purposes of calculating the rate of depreciation, a residual amount of 5 percent must be used. Percent-good tables using a residual amount other than 5 percent may be adopted by the Commission if the Department has conducted a market study or has otherwise obtained information which indicates that a different residual amount is appropriate for the category in which the personal property is placed pursuant to subsection 1. 116361.138 Reported acquisition cost for leased equipment.For leased equipment, the reported acquisition cost is the cost which the user of the property would incur if the equipment were purchased, less any discount customarily allowed by a seller. 117361.139 Personal property acquired with real property for lump sum; use of other valuation techniques. 1. In determining the taxable value of personal property which was acquired with real property for a lump sum, the assessor may refer to appropriate guides which list the cost of equipment to determine the value of the personal property in relation to the value of the real property. In addition, the assessor may estimate the age of the equipment by inspecting it or discussing the approximate value of the equipment with manufacturers, dealers or other persons in the business who have knowledge of the value of the equipment. The serial number, if it exists, may enable a manufacturer to determine the date of manufacture and the original cost. 2. If sufficient data is not otherwise available to establish acquisition cost, or if the assessor determines that a reported acquisition cost is not equal to the fair market value of the property at the time of acquisition plus any costs of transportation and costs of installation, the assessor may use any nationally recognized valuation technique to determine the acquisition cost, including, without limitation: (a)Establishing the current cost of replacement of the property with new property by reference to current manufacturing costs. If the current cost of replacement is known, the assessor shall apply depreciation to that cost to determine the taxable value. (b)Using a guide which lists the cost or a procedure recognized by businesses which use such equipment to determine the taxable value. Before such a guide or procedure may be used, an assessor must receive approval from the Executive Director. (c)Using information based on current market data. 3. Upon request, the Division of Local Government Services of the Department will provide information on various guides which may be used to determine original cost. 118Aircraft 119361.1401 Definitions.

The simplest form of band-of-investment computation requires estimating the appropriate ratio of debt to equity, the interest cost of debt and, typically the most subjective element, the rate of return on equity capital. The weighted rates on debt and equity are added to obtain the band-of-investment rate. 163361.228 \"Bond discount\" defined. \"Bond discount\" means an amount in dollars subtracted from the face value of a bond because the market discount rate is greater than the coupon rate. 164361.230 \"Bond premium\" defined. \"Bond premium\" means an amount in dollars added to the face value of the bond because of issuing costs or a market discount rate less than the coupon rate. 165361.232 \"Bond rating\" defined. \"Bond rating\" means a classification assigned by financial reporting institutions reflecting relative standings as to risk.

The first type of factor, present worth of 1, is derived from the formula: 1 n ________________ (1 + r) Where \"r\" is the discount (capitalization) rate and \"n\" is the number of periods. All other factors are derived from the mathematical manipulation of this formula. Other names are sometimes given to some of the factors such as \"reversion\" for present worth of 1, \"Inwood\" for the present worth of 1 per annum and many names for mortgage repayment. 178361.258 \"Construction work in progress\" defined.\"Construction work in progress\" means the total of the balances of work orders for plant, road and equipment including expenditures on research, development and demonstration projects for construction of facilities. 179361.260 \"Contribution in aid of construction\" defined.\"Contribution in aid of construction\" means a plant which has been contributed to a utility by a prospective customer or which has been constructed by the utility and paid for by the prospective customer for which no reimbursement is required to be made by the utility to the prospective customer as a prerequisite to obtaining service. 180361.262 \"Debt\" defined. \"Debt\" is money owed.

CHAPTER 361 - PROPERTY TAX183361.268 \"Discount rate\" defined. \"Discount rate\" means the annual percentage rate used to select present worth factors. The discount rate is one form of capitalization rate. A discount rate can be derived in two ways: 1. By use of the band-of-investment method; or 2. From sales data using the discounted cash flow rate of return method. --- The discounted cash flow rate of return method consists of finding the annual rate at which future income must be discounted so that the total present worth equals the proposed investment in the sale price of a property. The present worth of a given year's income automatically provides for recapture of capital. The difference between the income itself and its present worth provides for the return (yield) on the capital. The term \"discount factor\" is sometimes erroneously used instead of \"discount rate.\" Actually, the factors used in discounting are present worth factors. 184361.270 \"Earnings-price ratio\" defined. \"Earnings-price ratio\" means the ratio of earnings per share available to common stockholders of a specific company for an accounting period to the market price per share of the common stock of that company.

Typically, the ratio is based upon the current market price and the most recent 12-month period for which the earnings are known. 230361.360 \"Rate base\" defined. \"Rate base\" means the amount in dollars established by a regulatory agency upon which a return is allowed. 231361.362 \"Rate of capitalization\" defined.\"Rate of capitalization\" means the ratio of income to value. Such a rate can vary widely in quality depending upon the elements that are included such as interest, recapture, ad valorem taxes and income taxes. 232361.364 \"Rate of performance\" defined. \"Rate of performance\" means the actual income earned compared to an investment in contrast to a rate of return allowed or permitted but not necessarily accomplished. 233361.366 \"Rate of return\" defined. \"Rate of return\" is a general term that means: 1. The yield to an investor variously on the investor's net investment or on the property value; or 2. The ratio of either the net operating income or the before-tax cash flow to either the total property value or the initial investment or the average investment during a given period. 234361.368 \"Recapture\" defined. \"Recapture\" means the recovery of a capital investment. More specifically, it is the portion of the net operating income or the cash flow that provides for the periodic repayment of invested capital. Recapture may also be achieved, wholly or in part, through the resale of the property. The words depreciation and amortization are sometimes used as synonyms for recapture. However, depreciation is also both an accounting term and a word that means a loss from original value and amortization is commonly used to signify debt retirement. Recapture does not have these multiple meanings and is more desirable for use in income appraisal. 235361.370 \"Remaining economic life\" defined.\"Remaining economic life\" means the difference between the economic life and the present effective age of an income producing property. 236361.372 \"Replacement cost\" defined. \"Replacement cost\" means the cost of acquiring or constructing, at current prices, a property which is the functional equivalent of an existing property. 237361.374 \"Reproduction cost\" defined. \"Reproduction cost\" means the cost of acquiring or constructing, at current prices, a property identical to an existing property. 238361.376 \"Reserve life\" defined. \"Reserve life\" means an estimated number of years that the gas reserves of a natural gas transmission company will last. For example, the remaining life of a natural gas transmission company would be the estimated number of years a company can deliver gas at a given annual volume of gas divided by the total gas reserves. 239361.378 \"Retirement depreciation\" defined.\"Retirement depreciation\" means a method of accounting for the total depreciation expense at the date of retirement rather than by systematic additions to a depreciation reserve during the life of the property. 240361.380 \"Return on equity\" defined. \"Return on equity\" means the ratio of earnings on the common equity divided by the book value of the common equity interests. 241361.382 \"Revenue\" defined. \"Revenue\" means the gross dollars received for materials furnished or services rendered. The term is usually used in conjunction with business sales as opposed to the earnings of a natural person. 242361.384 \"Risk\" defined. \"Risk\" means the degree of uncertainty regarding the receipt of future income, whether in the form of interest or of net operating income. The higher the risk, the greater the annual percentage rate of return demanded by investors. Interest on a government bond or on a bank deposit has a high degree of certainty of receipt and therefore offers a low rate of return compared to other investments. At the other extreme is the high risk equity portion of a commercial enterprise with a high debt equity ratio. 243361.386 \"Sinking fund\" defined. \"Sinking fund\" means the fund to which periodic cash deposits are made for ultimately repaying a debt or replacing an asset. Usually, a sinking fund receives equal periodic deposits upon which interest is compounded at a stated rate so that the fund will accumulate to a predetermined amount at the end of a stated period. 244361.387 \"Statistical median\" defined. \"Statistical median\" means the representative intermediate value calculated for a distribution or range of data usually grouped in several intervals of equal value lying between the two extreme values. CHAPTER 361 - PROPERTY TAX245361.388 \"Straight-line depreciation\" defined.\"Straight-line depreciation\" means the accounting practice of recording equal annual increments of depreciation over the estimated life of an asset. In an appraisal it means equal annual increments of loss in value. 246361.390 \"Summation method of valuation\" defined.\"Summation method of valuation\" means the combining of fractional valuations into one value such as the addition of the value of a house to the value of the lot to produce a total residential value. 247361.392 \"System\" defined. \"System\" means an integrated operation of units which may be related entities or may be property elements such as machinery, buildings, land and other property used in the performance of a service or the manufacture of a product. 248361.394 \"Tariff\" defined. \"Tariff\" means the compilation of the schedules of rates applicable to each of the products or services supplied to the public and the regulations governing other aspects of the sale. 249361.396 \"Taxable value\" defined. \"Taxable value\" means the value of a property determined by using the cost, income and market approaches as described in NAC 361.200 to 361.508, inclusive. 250361.398 \"Times interest earned\" defined.\"Times interest earned\" means the ratio of earnings before the interest expense to the interest expense. The factor is an element used in determining risk by the purchaser of debt issues of a company. Generally, the lower the factor the greater the risk. Also called interest coverage, it may be the ratio of earnings before interest and income taxes to interest expense. 251361.400 \"Uniform system of accounts\" defined.\"Uniform system of accounts\" means the prescribed method of accounting adopted by a state regulatory agency, such as a public service commission, or by a federal regulatory agency such as the Department of Transportation, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Surface Transportation Board. 252361.402 \"Unitary method of valuation\" defined.\"Unitary method of valuation,\" as used in the central assessment of utilities, is a method of valuation which recognizes that a utility is an integrated enterprise and that its market value is not a summation of the values of its various physical components but its value as a whole as a going concern. 253361.404 \"Variable expenses\" defined. \"Variable expenses\" means those expenses of a business enterprise which vary with changes in the volume of output such as outlays for fuel to generate electric power. 254361.406 \"Yield to maturity\" defined. \"Yield to maturity\" means the computation of the average rate of return on outstanding debt issues taking into consideration the current price, interest payments and capital gains or losses at the maturity of the issue. 255361.408 Indicators of value: Cost approach; income approach; market or stock and debt approach; reconciliation.1. The cost approach consists of that cost of all operating assets subject to the ad valorem property tax pursuant to NRS 361.315 and 361.320 that most closely reflects the taxable value of these operating assets. 2. For the income approach, the adjusted net operating income either after or before an allowance for depreciation and federal income tax will be capitalized (converted to value) through the use of an appropriate capitalization rate for the industry group. The income of the property to be capitalized will be determined as follows: (a)With regard to those industry groups in which annual earnings are reasonably stable, the most recent year's earnings may be capitalized. (b)For those industry groups in which annual earnings vacillate frequently over a period of years, an average of past earnings may be used. 3. The market approach or stock and debt method of valuation is a technique that is applicable to valuing railroads and utilities, and it results initially in an enterprise value which encompasses the entire unit. The stock and debt indicator will be determined by multiplying either the average monthly, quarterly or annual high and low market price quotations of all the securities which are actively traded in the market place including common stock, preferred stock and long-term debt, by the number of sharesoutstanding at the end of the year. With regard to those securities which are not actively traded, computations of the present worth of the income flows may be made for the determination of their value. To this amount will be added short-term debt, together with other applicable adjustments. From this amount will be deducted the nonoperating and nonassessable assets for the indication of the value of those assets encompassed within NRS 361.315 and 361.320. 4. A review will bemade of the one or more available indicators of value. These indicators of value will then be reconciled to derive the final estimate of value. 256361.410 Use of unit rule of valuation. In the valuation of those properties which are listed in NRS 361.320, the unit rule of valuation will be used when considered applicable. The unit rule generally applies to companies which own or operate lines or roads which lie partly within and partly without Nevada. In these cases, the Department will only value and assess the property within the State. In determining the value of the portion within the State, the Department may take into consideration the value of the entire system, the mileage of the whole system and of the part within the State, together with such other information, facts and circumstances as will support a substantially just and correct determination. 257361.411 Reports of construction work in progress.Construction work in progress must be reported to the Department to the extent to which it provides additional capacity even though part of the new construction replaces existing property. 258Communications, Electric, Gas Transmission, Pipeline and Railroad Companies 259361.421 Cost approach indicator of value: Determination.The cost approach consists of: 1. Determining the gross book cost for financial reporting purposes of all taxable operating property, including, but not limited to, all property relating to rail transportation, utility plant in service, plant held for future use, contributed plant, nuclear fuel, construction work in progress, experimental plant, acquisition adjustments, materials and supplies, plant and other property leased from others and common plant. 2. Deducting from the gross book cost the accrued book depreciation recorded for financial reporting purposes, which may include physical, functional and economic obsolescence. Additional obsolescence must be deducted when adequately quantified. 260361.4215 Cost approach indicator of value: Optional cost information.The taxpayer may present and the Department shall consider, in addition to the information required by NAC 361.421, one or more of the following alternative cost indicators of value: 1. A calculation of the reproduction cost new less depreciation for all taxable operating property of the collective unit being assessed. The calculation must have been performed in accordance with generally accepted appraisal methodology. 2. A calculation of the replacement cost new less depreciation for all taxable operating property of the collective unit being assessed. The calculation must have been performed in accordance with generally accepted appraisal methodology. 3. Any other relevant and verifiable information, such as rate base for regulatory purposes. 261361.423 Income approach indicator of value: Formula for determination.1. The capitalized income approach consists of deducting from the normalized and annualized gross operating income any direct and indirect normalized and annualized operating expenses specifically related to the normalized and annualized gross operating income including any annualized book depreciation. Deferred income taxes will be treated as an operating expense. Normalized and annualized rental expense on operating property leased from others, less imputed depreciation, income taxes and other applicable expenses, will be disallowed as an operating expense. 2. The resulting adjusted net operating income will be capitalized (converted to value) using an appropriate capitalization rate for the industry group. The capitalization rate for the typical company will be used for the firms being appraised in each industry group. The market capitalization rate will be derived from calculations made for selected companies in each industry group. 3. The operating income to be capitalized into taxable value will be normalized and annualized based on the most recent year's adjusted net operating income. When the most recent year's net operating income is not a reasonable representation of a company's net operating income, such as where a company's net operating income tends to be cyclical, a 3- or 5-year average of adjusted net operating incomes will be normalized and annualized and may be used. 4. Construction work in progress is not a factor in applying the income approach to value. 5. Any normalization or annualization adjustments to a company's net operating income must be based on known, measurable and experienced changes in a company's operation or taxable property as of the current year's reporting date. 262361.425 Income approach indicator of value: Capitalization rate.The capitalization rate will be established from a selected number of firms to derive the rate for the typical company in each industry group when the information is available: 1. The band-of-investment method will be used in the compilation of the capitalization rate. 2. The band-of-investment method represents the cost of the money needed by the typical company in each industry group to acquire its operating plant and carry on its operations. It is composed of two factors: (a) The capitalization ratios of the typical company; and (b)The cost of the items which comprise the total capital structure of the typical company. 3. A \"typical company\" means a theoretical company which is representative of the firms within an industry group. The selected firms in the industry group will be comparable in amount of revenues, bond ratings, nature of operations and regulatory environment. Certain nonutility conglomerates which have utility operations in Nevada will be studied in the light of other similar conglomerates. Conglomerates will not be grouped with nonconglomerates where possible. The development of the typicalcompany will reflect input by the companies within the industry group which are centrally assessed. 4. The items which comprise the total capital structure of the typical company are those amounts as recorded for financial reporting purposes that represent the sources of the money or capital funds made available to acquire the taxable operating property of the industry group. For the purposes of this subsection, \"capital funds\" means money obtained from: (a)Creditors through (b)Stockholders through stocks, paid-in capital and undistributed retained earnings; and (c)Similar financial capital accounts, except not from the Federal Government through deferred income taxes. --- The total capital structure of the typical company will be derived through the use of a statistical median from the selected sample of firm calculations. 5. In addition to the total capital structure of the typical company derived pursuant to subsection 4, the taxpayer may present and the Department shall consider the total capital structure of the typical company based upon common equity, preferred equity and the long-term debt percentages as developed from market information for comparable companies in the industry group. The total capital structure of the typical company must be derived from the use of market information from the selected sample of firmcalculations. 6. The annual average of high-low monthly yields to maturity compiled by Moody's Investors Service (Public Utility and Transportation), or another accepted service approved by the Executive Director of the Department, will be used for the assignment of a cost to the long-term bonded indebtedness component of the total capital structure. CONT... 263 7. The assignment of cost to preferred stock will be determined in a manner consistent with subsection 6. 8 . The assignment of cost to that portion of the total capital structure which represents equity for the typical company in each industry group will be determined in the following manner: (a)The Department shall develop an equity rate for each industry group based on one or more of the following models: (1) Discounted cash-flow method.(2) Capital asset-pricing.(3) Risk premium analysis. (b)The Department shall also consider the results of cost of equity studies provided by members of the industry group based on the models set forth in paragraph (a). (c)When considered applicable, the cost of equity capital established for the industry group may be determined by using additional models, such as direct capitalization, accepted in the appraisal and financial communities and approved by the Executive Director of the Department. 9. The capitalization rate of the typical company for the industry group will be calculated by using a weighted method (band-of-investment) which is the total capital structure percentage times the component rate percentage. The weighted values are then totaled and rounded to four decimal places to get the capitalization rate. EXAMPLE: MEDIANCAPITAL WEIGHTED TYPICAL COMPANY STRUCTURE X RATE = RETURN Common Equity 42.50% 11.20% 4.76000% 4.55963% Capitalization Rate for Industry Group 10.1845% 10. The determination of the income value indicator requires the capitalization of the adjusted net operating income at the current capitalization rate. Financial data for selected companies in each industry group, as presented in the latest annual reports by Moody's Investors Service (Public Utility and Transportation), or another accepted service approved by the Executive Director of the Department, will be used in the compilation of the capitalization rate of the typical company. 11. An alternative to the capitalization rate method in subsections 1 to 9, inclusive, may be the use of a rate for the industry group as published by the Western States Association of Tax Administrators, or another recognized tax related organization approved by the Executive Director of the Department. 264361.427 Stock and debt approach indicator of value. 1. The stock and debt approach proposes a value for the entire firm, but is generally recognized as a less applicable methodology for determining the value of taxable property. 2 . The stock and debt indicator is determined by multiplying either the average monthly, quarterly or annual high and low market price quotations, when available, for all the securities which are actively traded in the market place, including common stock, preferred stock and long-term debt, by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the year. Computations of the present worth of income flows may be made to determine values for securities which are not actively traded. 3. The value of the stock of a holding company is apportioned among its operating companies according to the ratio of: (a)Each operating company's property to the aggregate property of all of the operating companies, valued at historical cost and weighted at one-third; and (b)Each operating company's net income before income taxes to the aggregate net income of all of the operating companies, weighted at two-thirds. --- For the industry group of rail transportation, the direct deduction method to eliminate nonoperating assets will be used when the information is available and considered applicable. 4. To this amount will be added items such as customer advances for construction which are nontaxable for federal income tax purposes, current liabilities less dividends declared, the present worth of leased property over the period of the lease together with any other items conforming to the theory that if a person were to purchase all the stock and assume all the outstanding liabilities of a company, the person would have acquired all the assets which appear on the asset side of the balance sheet and, therefore, own the company. 5. From this amount will be deducted the market value of all exempt or nonoperating property, including, but not limited to, cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, miscellaneous investments, temporary investments, nonoperating properties and other current and accrued assets and properties not subject to the ad valorem property tax imposed by NRS 361.315 and 361.320. 265361.429 Reconciliation of indicators of value. 1. Immediately related to the valuation process is the reconciliation of one or more indicators of value to reach the final estimate of value for the system. 2 . For multiple departmental companies, when considered applicable, the utility analyst will either reconcile the indicators of value for allocation of the value of the system to the value to the various departments, or use the adopted Western States Association of Tax Administrators formulas, approved by the Executive Director of the Department, to allocate the Department and stock and debt values based on the cost and income data. 3. The utility analyst will reconcile in writing to the taxpayer the relative significance, applicability and defensibility of the indication of value derived from each approach to arrive at, in the utility analyst's professional judgment, the appropriate final estimate of value for the system. 4. The utility analyst will reconcile, in writing to the taxpayer, the facts, trends and observations developed in the analysis and review the conclusion and the probable validity and reliability of the conclusion. 266361.431 Allocation of value of interstate and intercounty properties. 1. Since the unit rule of valuation will be used for all interstate and intercounty properties, an allocation of those properties operating in Nevada will be made. 2. The allocation will: (a) Total 100 percent for all states in which the company operates; and (b) Reflect the quantity of property in each state, as well as the use or value of the property in each state. 3. Allocation factors will be those that are readily available rather than requiring some new or additional statistic and the factor will not be an allocation in and of itself. 4. The interstate allocation will be made in proportion to the contribution to the unit value made by the property in Nevada. The allocation will be a reflection of the property value. It is the value of the existing property which is being allocated, not merely the amount of the physical property. 5. Available quantity elements such as cost and economic or use elements such as revenue will be used in the determination of the allocation. 6. The interstate allocation formulas adopted by the Western States Association of Tax Administrators will be approved by the Executive Director of the Department and used when the information is available and considered applicable. 267361.433 Deductions from taxable value. 1. The value and not the cost of any vehicles licensed in Nevada will be deducted from the taxable value of the property which was allocated to Nevada. 2. For telecommunications companies, property on lands ceded to the United States Government before 1936 will also be deducted. Cost less depreciation as reported by the company will be used. 3. The value and not the cost of certified pollution control equipment directly related to the operation of the firm will be deducted from the taxable value to the extent allowed pursuant to statute. 268Air Transportation Companies Generally 269361.451 Applicability. Except as specifically provided in NAC 361.4685, the provisions of NAC 361.452 to 361.468, inclusive, do not apply to a taxpayer whose property is assessed pursuant to NAC 361.4685, 361.469 and 361.4695. 270361.452 Cost approach indicator of value.The cost approach consists of: 1. Determining the gross book cost for financial reporting purposes of all taxable operating property, including, without limitation, airframes, engines, propellers, radio equipment, miscellaneous flight equipment, spare parts and assemblies, leased aircraft, improvements to leased equipment, construction work in progress, ground property and equipment, land, expendable parts, materials and supplies, and leased property; and 2. Deducting from the gross book cost the accrued book depreciation recorded for financial reporting purposes, which may include, without limitation, physical, functional and economic obsolescence. Additional obsolescence must be deducted when adequately quantified. 271361.454 Income approach indicator of value: Formula for determination. 1. The capitalized income approach consists of deducting from the normalized and annualized gross operating income any direct and indirect normalized and annualized operating expenses specifically related to the normalized and annualized gross operating income, including, without limitation, any annualized book depreciation. Deferred income taxes will be treated as an operating expense. Normalized and annualized rental expense on operating property leased from others, less imputed depreciation, income taxes and other applicable expenses, will be disallowed as an operating expense. 2. The resulting adjusted net operating income will be capitalized (converted to value) using an appropriate capitalization rate for the airline industry group. The capitalization rate for the typical company will be used for the carriers being appraised in each airline industry group. The market capitalization rate will be derived from calculations made for selected carriers in each airline industry group. 3. The operating income to be capitalized into taxable value will be normalized and annualized based on the most recent year's adjusted net operating income. When the most recent year's net operating income is typically not a reasonable representation of the net operating income of an airline, such as where the net operating income of the airline tends to be cyclical, a 3- or 5-year average of adjusted net operating incomes will be normalized and annualized and may be used. 4. The net operating income may be capitalized before deducting any book depreciation or income tax if the normalized and annualized net operating income results in a negative amount. If any book depreciation or income tax is added to the net operating income before the net operating income is capitalized, the capitalization rate must include a component for that book depreciation or income tax. 5. Any normalization or annualization adjustments to the net operating income of a carrier must be based on known, measurable and experienced changes in the operation or taxable property of the carrier as of the current year's reporting date. CHAPTER 361 - PROPERTY TAX272361.456 Income approach indicator of value: Capitalization rate.The capitalization rate will be established from a selected number of carriers and determined in the following manner to arrive at the typical company in the airline industry group when the information is available: 1. The band-of-investment method will be used in the compilation of the capitalization rate. 2. The band-of-investment method represents the cost of the money needed by the typical company in the airline industry group to acquire its operating plant and carry on its operations. It is composed of two factors: (a) The capitalization ratios of the typical company; and (b)The cost of the items which comprise the total capital structure of the typical company. 3. A \"typical company\" means a theoretical company which is representative of the carriers within an airline industry group. These carriers will be comparable in amount of revenues, bond ratings and nature of operations. Certain nonairline conglomerates which have airline operations in this State will be studied in light of other similar conglomerates. Regular carriers will not be grouped with conglomerates where possible. Development of typical company factors will reflect input by the carriers within the airlineindustry group which are centrally assessed. As used in this subsection, \"nature of operations\" includes, without limitation, the size, route structure and fleet diversification of the air carrier. 4. The items which comprise the total capital structure of the typical company are those amounts as recorded for financial reporting purposes that represent the sources of the money or capital funds made available to acquire the taxable operating property of the airline industry group. As used in this subsection, \"capital funds\" means money obtained from: (a)Creditors through (b)Stockholders through stocks, paid-in capital and undistributed retained earnings; and (c)Similar financial capital accounts except not from the Federal Government through deferred income taxes. --- The capital structure of the typical company will be derived through the use of a statistical median from the calculations of the selected sample carriers. 5. In addition to the total capital structure of the typical company derived by the Department pursuant to subsection 4, the taxpayer may present and the Department shall consider the total capital structure of the typical company based upon the common equity, preferred equity and the long-term debt percentages as developed from market information for comparable carriers in the airline industry group. The total capital structure of the typical company must be derived from using market information from the selected sample of carrier calculations. 6. The annual average of high-low yields to maturity compiled by Moody's Investors Service (Public Utility and Transportation) or another acceptable service, approved by the Executive Director of the Department, will be used for the assignment of a cost to the long-term bonded indebtedness component of the total capital structure. CONT... 273 7. The assignment of cost to preferred stock will be determined in a manner consistent with subsection 6. 8. The assignment of cost to that portion of the total capital structure which represents equity for the typical company in each airline industry group will be determined in the following manner: (a)The Department shall develop an equity rate for each airline industry group based on one or more of the following models: (1) Discounted cash-flow method. (2) Capital asset-pricing. (3) Risk premium analysis. (b)The Department shall also consider the results of cost of equity studies provided by a carrier of the airline industry group based on the models set forth in paragraph (a). (c)When considered applicable, the cost of equity capital established for the airline industry group may be determined by using additional models, including, without limitation, direct capitalization, accepted in the appraisal and financial communities and approved by the Executive Director of the Department. 9. The capitalization rate of the typical company for the airline industry group will be calculated by using a weighted method (band-of-investment) which is the total capital structure percentage times the component rate percentage. The weighted values are then totaled and rounded to four decimal places to get the capitalization rate. EXAMPLE: MEDIAN CAPITAL WEIGHTED TYPICAL COMPANY STRUCTURE X RATE = RETURN Common Equity 42.50% 11.20% 4.76000% 4.55963% Capitalization Rate for Industry Group 10.1845% 10. The determination of the income value indicator requires the capitalization of the adjusted net operating income at the current capitalization rate. Financial data for selected carriers in each airline industry group as presented in the latest annual reports by Moody's Investors Service (Public Utility and Transportation) or another accepted service, approved by the Executive Director of the Department, will be used in the compilation of the capitalization rate of the typical company. 274361.460 Reconciliation of indicators of value. 1. Immediately related to the valuation process is the reconciliation of one or more indicators of value to reach the final estimate of value for the system. 2. The analyst will reconcile in writing to the taxpayer the relative significance, applicability and defensibility of the indication of value derived from each approach to arrive at, in the professional judgment of the analyst, the appropriate final estimate of system value for the air transport company. 3. The analyst will reconcile in writing to the taxpayer the facts, trends and observations determined in the analysis and review the conclusion and the probable validity and reliability of that conclusion. 275361.462 Deduction of depreciated cost of nonallocable flight equipment. 1. The depreciated cost of the nonallocable flight equipment will be deducted from the total depreciated cost of the flight equipment. 2. For the purposes of this section: (a)\"Flight equipment\" includes, without limitation, airframes, engines, propellers, radio equipment, miscellaneous flight equipment, spare parts and assemblies, leased aircraft and improvements to leased equipment. (b)\"Nonallocable flight equipment\" means only that property or equipment which is not attached or required to be aboard or part of an aircraft which is ready for flight. 3. Every item of property which is required to be aboard for the operation of the aircraft will be classified as allocable flight equipment. 4. The only instances when an aircraft will be classified as nonallocable are when:(a) The carrier purchased an aircraft which was not delivered or was delivered too late to have participated in the creation of the allocation statistics; or (b)An aircraft which is owned by the carrier was leased to and operated by another party. 5. The percentage of the total amount of tangible personal property of the carrier which the allocable flight equipment represents will be calculated and applied to the total estimate of value of the assessable property of the carrier. 276361.464 Allocation of value of interstate companies.1. Since the unit rule of valuation will be used for the described properties, an allocation of those properties operating in Nevada will be made. 2. The allocation will: (a) Total 100 percent for all states in which a company operates; and (b) Reflect the quantity of property in each state, as well as the use or value of the property in each state. 3. Allocation factors will be those that are readily available rather than requiring some new or additional statistic, and a factor will not be an allocation itself. 4. The interstate allocation will be made in proportion to the contribution to the unit value made by the property in Nevada. Allocation will be made in the light of the property value. It is the value of the existing property which is being allocated, not merely the amount of the physical property. 5. Available quantity elements such as cost and economic or use elements such as revenue will be used in the determination of the allocation. 6. The following elements will be considered in the allocation of allocable flight equipment to Nevada and are assigned the following weight: (a)Air and ground time weighted to the original cost of allocable flight equipment, 50 percent; (b)Originating and terminating tonnage, 15 percent; and (c) Revenue ton miles flown, 35 percent. 277361.466 Development, application of factor for property located in Nevada.1. The depreciated cost of the total tangible property of the carrier will be related to the estimate of value for the system for that same property in the form of a percentage. (This estimate of value will be determined by using the three approaches to value divi ded by the depreciated cost of the total tangible property.) 2. The factor so developed will be applied to that ground property having situs in Nevada. 278361.468 Addition of property located in Nevada.The adjusted estimate of value for the situs property in Nevada will be added to the flight equipment which was allocated to Nevada for the final estimate of value for Nevada. 279Certain Air Transport Companies, Airline Industry Groups, and Unscheduled or Charter Air Carriers 280361.4685 Applicability. 1. The provisions of NAC 361.469 and 361.4695 apply to each air transport company or airline industry group, including, without limitation, regional airlines or unscheduled airlines, for which information is insufficient to complete a valuation pursuant to NAC 361.451 to 361.468, inclusive. 2. The property of an unscheduled or a charter air carrier which is not domiciled in Nevada may be valued pursuant to this section and NAC 361.469 and 361.4695 and placed on the unsecured tax roll. 281361.469 Formula for assessment. 1.

Each new parcel for development must be separately evaluated to determine whether there has been any change in the use of the property that comprises the parcel. 2. A determination that there is a change in the use of the property must be based on a finding that: (a)The property was being used as vacant land as of the commencement of the prior year and: (1)As the result of the recording of a subdivision map creating individual lots for residential development, the property is held for residential use as of the commencement of the current year; (2)As the result of the recording of a subdivision map creating a new commercial or industrial subdivision or the creation of new parcels within such a subdivision, the property is held for commercial or industrial use as of the commencement of the current year; or (3)As the result of new construction on the parcel sufficient to allow for an identification of the use of the property, the property is in agricultural use, open-space use, residential use, commercial or industrial use, institutional use or recreational use as of the commencement of the current year; or (b)The use of the property as of the commencement of the current year for agricultural use, open-space use, residential use, commercial or industrial use, institutional use or recreational use is different from the use of the property as of the commencement of the prior year. 3.

If the use of the property: (a) Has not changed, the parcel is a remainder parcel. (b)Has changed, the parcel is a new parcel for development which is not eligible for the partial abatement of taxes provided by subsection 2 of NRS 361.4722. 5.

(b) Multiply the net property taxes determined in accordance with subsection 1 by the abatement percentage applicable to the remainder parcel for the current year. (c)Add the amounts determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b). If the sum is: (1) Less than the amount of taxes that would have been assessed on the remainder parcel for the current year without the abatement, the difference constitutes the amount of the partial abatement for the remainder parcel for the current year.(2) Greater than or equal to the amount of taxes that would have been assessed on the remainder parcel for the current year without the abatement, then there is no partial abatement for the remainder parcel for the current year. 2. The maximum amount of property taxes which may be levied on a remainder parcel for the current year must be calculated as follows: (a)Determine the amount of property taxes to be added to the tax roll in the current year attributable to: (1)An incremental change in land value resulting from a change in the actual or authorized use of the remainder parcel; or (2) A new improvement to the remainder parcel, --- that would not have been included in the calculation of the assessed value of the remainder parcel for the prior year had a separate valuation for the remainder parcel been established in the prior year. (b)Add the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (a) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 1 to determine that maximum amount. 370361.61038 Determination of amount of net property taxes attributable to remainder parcel for prior year; appeal of determination. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the amount of net property taxes attributable to the land area of and any improvements to a remainder parcel for the prior year must be determined as follows: ( a) Identify each of the parcels which contained the land area of the remainder parcel in the prior year.

(c)Determine the total amount of taxes levied, or which would have been levied but for any exemptions from taxation, in the prior year on each of the parcels identified in paragraph (a) for the prior year. (d)Calculate the effective tax rate for the remainder parcel for the prior year by dividing the total amount of taxes determined pursuant to paragraph (c) by the total of the taxable values identified pursuant to paragraph (b). (e)Determine the taxable value that the remainder parcel would have had if a taxable value for the remainder parcel had been separately established for the prior year based upon all the assumptions, costs, values, calculations and other factors and considerations that would have been used for the valuation of that property for that prior fiscal year. (f)The amount of net property taxes attributable to the remainder parcel for the prior year is the amount obtained by multiplying the effective tax rate for the remainder parcel calculated pursuant to paragraph (d) by the taxable value of the remainder parcel determined pursuant to paragraph (e). 2. The owner of a remainder parcel may appeal to the Nevada Tax Commission pursuant to NRS 361.4734 and any regulations adopted to carry out that section to show that the method prescribed in subsection 1 produces an inequitable result. Pursuant to such an appeal, the Nevada Tax Commission may use an alternative method that provides an equitable result. 3.

Notwithstanding any specific statutory provision to the contrary, the following types of activities which may appear to be agricultural in nature do not by themselves qualify as an agricultural pursuit, including, without limitation: (a)Grazing on land by any animal kept as a hobby; (b)Harvesting shrubs or seeds that grow wild on the land; and (c)Hunting or harvesting game animals or birds. --- Such an activity may qualify as an agricultural pursuit if the activity is accompanied by other agricultural activities which would generate an expectation of profit consistent with the land. 4. In determining whether an activity qualifies as an agricultural pursuit, the assessing authority shall consider whether the activity occurs after the agricultural product has been raised and harvested or whether the activity is a process or step necessary and incident to the preparation and storage of products raised on the property. Processing activities, including, without limitation, pasteurizing and bottling milk, cheese making,honey or candy manufacturing, and slaughtering, dressing and packing meat, do not qualify for the agricultural use assessment. 5.

Upon a determination that an activity on the land qualifies as an agricultural pursuit, the assessing authority must then determine whether the operator is engaged in the agricultural pursuit as a business venture for profit. When determining whether an operator is engaged in a business venture for profit, reasonable profit and the expectation of a reasonable profit are not affected by any independent intervening causes of production failure or nonproductive use that are beyond the control of the operator, including, without limitation, land idle under government programs. Property not otherwise fulfilling the requirements to be considered as land on which an agricultural pursuit is conducted may still qualify as such if there are extenuating circumstances, including, without limitation, use of the land for an orchard or other perennial crops with a long maturation period that have not yet matured. 2. To qualify as a business venture for profit, an agricultural pursuit must raise the expectation of profit consistent with: (a)The size of the property used in the operation; (b)The capacity of the property, including, without limitation, suitability, terrain, availability of water, soil capabilities, type of vegetation grown, growing season, animal unit months, animal units and animal unit equivalents; (c)The viability of the property, including, without limitation, the cost and availability of water, soil capacities, market proximity, fencing and suitability of the property for other uses; and (d)Any other factors or criteria that the assessing authority deems appropriate under the circumstances. 3. In making a determination about whether the operator is engaged in a business venture for profit, especially in cases where the size of the land appears to be too small to sustain a monetary profit from agricultural pursuits, the assessing authority may consider whether a reasonable effort has been made to care for the land sufficiently and adequately, as evaluated in time, labor, equipment, management and capitalconsistent with accepted agricultural practices for the type of agricultural operation involved. 4. Gross income derived from nonagricultural uses of the land must not be included in the requirements for the total minimum gross income, including, without limitation: (a)Leasing of the land for billboards; (b)Leasing of the land for roadside produce stands; (c)Leasing of the land for hunting; (d)Income derived from the mineral estate, whether severed or not; (e)Income from the extraction of sand and gravel or other operations relating to products from the earth; (f)Interest income from a loan or investment, royalties or dividends; and (g)Transfer or sale of property rights such as conservation easements or severed mineral rights. 5.

On or before the first Monday in October of each year, the Department shall conduct a study of the value of lands designated for agricultural use and present the study for approval by the Commission. The Commission will incorporate the results of the study so approved into the bulletin prepared pursuant to NRS 361A.140 for use by county assessors. 2. The study conducted by the Department must, in accordance with NRS 361.325, be based on the productivity of the land. Productive capability of land may be determined by the classification of land and application of a capitalized earnings approach as follows: (a)For cultivated and native meadow or wild hay lands: (1)Agricultural income for lands designated as cultivated may be projected by developing estimates of gross income based on average commodity prices. Sources of commodity prices of agricultural products which the Department may use include, without limitation, the Nevada Agricultural Statistics Service and a survey of growers and local buyers. (2)A net operating income must be determined by subtracting an estimated allocation for expenses from the gross income. Expenses for lands must be appropriate to the type of land being valued and may include the typical costs for water and the maintenance of irrigation systems, and loss in production due to necessary management practices, such as loss in production during the seed year or the first year of the hay stand. The expenses subtracted from the gross income results in a net operating income. (3)A 5-year weighted average of net operating income may be capitalized into an indication of the value of the land per acre by multiplying the yield per acre, measured in tons per acre, by the net income per ton and then dividing the result by the capitalization rate. The result must be multiplied by the level of assessment to obtain an assessed value per acre. (b)For pasture and grazing lands: (1)Agricultural income for lands designated as pasture may be projected by developing estimates of gross income based on the carrying capacity of the land as measured by rentals per animal unit months per acre. Sources of rental prices for pasture and grazing lands which the Department may use include, without limitation, the Nevada Agricultural Statistics Service and a survey of growers and local buyers. (2)A net operating income must be determined by subtracting an estimated allocation for expenses from the gross rent per animal unit month. Expenses for lands must be appropriate to the type of land being valued and may include typical miscellaneous costs, including costs for management, insurance, stock water and maintenance of fences. The expenses subtracted from the gross income results in a net operating incometo land. (3)A 5-year weighted average of net operating income must be capitalized into an indication of land value per acre by multiplying the net income per acre and then dividing the result by the capitalization rate. The result must be multiplied by the level of assessment to obtain an assessed value per acre. 3. As used in this section, \"carrying capacity\" means the measure of the capacity of grazing land to provide adequate forage to sustain livestock for a given period. 23Conversion to Higher Use 24361A.210 \"Physical alteration\" interpreted.The Commission will the term \"physical alteration,\" as used in NRS 361A.031, to mean the application of man-made changes, including, without limitation, changes in the contour of the land, removal of native plant life, diversion of water channels and building site improvements intended to enable the land to be used for purposes other than agricultural uses. 25361A.220 Determination of whether final map or parcel map creates parcels not intended for agricultural use.If a final map or parcel map has been recorded, the county assessor must determine whether the map creates one or more parcels not intended for agricultural use. In making such a determination, the county assessor must consider: 1. The size of the parcel or parcels being created; 2. The capacity of the property, including, without limitation, suitability, terrain, availability of water, soil capabilities, type of vegetation grown, growing season, animal unit months and animal units; 3. The viability of the property, including, without limitation, cost and availability of water, soil capacities, market proximity, fencing and suitability of the property for other uses; and 4. Any other factors or criteria that the assessing authority deems appropriate under the circumstances. 26361A.230 Conversion of property by county assessor.If the county assessor finds that a property has been converted to a higher use or otherwise becomes aware that such a conversion has taken place, the county assessor must convert the property, or that portion of the property no longer qualifying as agricultural property, to a higher use. 27361A.240 Calculation of deferred tax when property is converted.To calculate the amount of deferred tax that must be assessed when property is converted to a higher use: 1. The county assessor must determine what the taxable value of the property would have been pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and NRS 361.227 for the fiscal year in which the conversion took place and for the 6 previous fiscal years. The value of the land must be established based on the taxable value of comparable property for the 6 previous fiscal years. 2. Using the taxable value so derived, the amount of taxes for each fiscal year in which taxes would have been due and payable must then be calculated. The tax rate to be applied to the assessed value must be the rate used in the year for which the taxable value is established. 3. The amount of taxes paid or payable based on the agricultural use assessment must then be subtracted from the amount of taxes calculated pursuant to subsection 2. The resulting difference is the amount of deferred tax which must be added on the next property tax statement pursuant to NRS 361A.280 if the deferred tax has not already been paid. 28GOLF COURSES 29361A.310 Definitions.

If the value calculated pursuant to subsection 1 is: (a)Greater than or equal to the value calculated pursuant to subsection 2, use the value calculated pursuant to subsection 2 as the taxable value for open-space use of the golf course land; or (b)Less than the value calculated pursuant to subsection 2, use the product obtained by multiplying the value calculated pursuant to subsection 1 by an open-space discount factor of 0.74 as the taxable value for open-space use of the golf course land. 38361A.400 Golfing improvements: Determination of taxable value for open-space use.A county assessor shall: 1. Determine the replacement cost of the golfing improvements as provided in NAC 361A.410; 2. Subtract from the amount determined pursuant to subsection 1 an amount for the depreciation of the golfing improvements, calculated at 1.5 percent of the amount determined pursuant to subsection 1 for each year of the adjusted actual age of the golfing improvements, up to a maximum of 50 years; and 3. Multiply the remainder determined pursuant to subsection 2 by a factor for the obsolescence of the golfing improvements, calculated as provided in NAC 361A.420. 39361A.410 Golfing improvements: Determination of replacement cost.1. For the purposes of subsection 1 of NAC 361A.400, a county assessor shall determine the replacement cost of the golfing improvements for a golf course in accordance with the provisions of this section. 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the class of a golf course must be determined by the sum of the number of points assigned to the golf course in accordance with the following criteria: (a)A golf course must be assigned the number of points which is most nearly equal to the amount calculated by: (1)Dividing the number 18 by the number of holes on the golf course; and (2)Multiplying the figure obtained pursuant to subparagraph (1) by the total acreage of the golf course land. (b)If the slope rating of a golf course, as designated by the United States Golf Association, exceeds 94, the golf course must be assigned the number of points which is equal to the amount calculated by subtracting 94 from that slope rating and multiplying the remainder by 5. (c)If the total yardage of a golf course exceeds 5,000 yards, as determined from the tee which is farthest from each hole, the golf course must be assigned the number of points which is most nearly equal to the amount calculated by subtracting 5,000 from that total yardage and multiplying the remainder by 0.05. ( d) If par for a golf course: (1)Is 72 or more, the golf course must be assigned 80 points; (2)Is 71, the golf course must be assigned 60 points; (3)Is 70, the golf course must be assigned 40 points; (4)Is 60 or more but less than 70, the golf course must be assigned 30 points; or (5)Is less than 60, the golf course must be assigned 20 points.

The tax is based on $250,000, the amount paid for the property.2. \"A,\" the owner of certain real estate, sold it to \"B\" for $144,000. \"B\" paid the amount of $25,000 in cash, leaving a balance of $119,000, and \"A\" gave \"B\" a deed to the property. The tax is computed on $144,000, the amount paid or to be paid.3. The holder of a trust deed in the amount of $120,000 foreclosed upon the property securing the deed. At the foreclosure sale, because of taxes and additional expenses incurred, the trustee bid $122,500, and a trustee's deed was issued to the beneficiary. The beneficiary then accepted a mortgage in the amount of $125,000 as consideration for the retransfer of the property to the former owner. The tax on the trustee's deed should be computed on the amount bid for the property plus any costs, in this example $122,500. The deed from the beneficiary to the former owner of the property is a conveyance of realty sold, and the taxshould be computed upon the amount paid, namely $125,000. 4. For a full purchase price of $500,000, \"A\" conveys to \"B\" land on which there is an encumbrance of $410,000 at the time of sale. \"A\" signs a contract agreeing to pay off the encumbrance at a later date. The deed of conveyance from \"A\" to \"B\" is subject to tax on the full purchase price of $500,000. The fact that the seller retained a contractual obligation on the property does not diminish the amount that \"B\" will pay, $500,000. 5. \"A,\" the owner of certain real estate, sold it to \"B\" for a consideration of $240,000. \"B\" paid the amount of $125,000 in cash, leaving a balance due of $115,000. \"A\" accepted bonds of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation for the balance of $115,000 and gave \"B\" a deed to the property. The tax is based on the total purchase price of $240,000, the $125,000 in cash and the $115,000 value of the bonds. 6. Two corporations that do not have identical ownership exchange properties worth $450,000 each. Each transfer is taxable on the $450,000 value. Each corporation is receiving something of value in exchange for the property it is transferring.7. To qualify for a loan to refinance their home, a married couple adds the husband's parents to the title, with the married couple and the husband's parents all as joint tenants. The value of the property is $145,000. Because the transfer to the husband's parents from the wife is not exempt from the tax and the joint tenants each have a right to the whole property, the transfer is taxable on the $145,000 value. 8. A couple buys a home from the Veteran's Administration for $97,142.36. The transfer is taxable on the amount of purchase, $97,142.36.9. A university foundation receives property valued at $1,000,000. The transfer is exempt from taxation pursuant to subsection 15 of NRS 375.090. The university foundation sells the property to another party in a transaction that is not exempt pursuant to NRS 375.090 for $750,000. The second transfer is taxable on the amount of purchase, $750,000. 10. A corporation owns property valued at $180,000. To refinance the property, the corporation transfers the property to one of its shareholders pursuant to the requirements of the lender. The transfer is taxable on the value of the property, $180,000.11. \"A\" owns property worth $50,000. \"B\" owns property worth $75,000. \"A\" and \"B\" form a limited-liability company and are the only two members. \"A\" and \"B\" transfer their properties to the limited-liability company. Each transfer is taxable for the value of the properties, $50,000 and $75,000, respectively.12. \"A\" and \"B,\" who are not married and not related within the first degree of consanguinity, own two identical properties, each worth $50,000, as joint tenants. \"A\" and \"B\" wish to transfer their interest in each property to the other so that \"A\" owns one property as the sole owner and \"B\" owns the other property as the sole owner. Because \"A\" and \"B\" are giving up their respective rights in the other parcel, the transfers are made with consideration and thus each transfer is taxable for the $50,000 value. If \"A\" and \"B\" held title to each property in 50 percent fractional interests, each transfer would be taxable for $25,000. 13. \"A\" and \"B\" are joint tenants of a 10-acre parcel that is worth $150,000. \"A\" and \"B\" are not married and are not related within the first degree of consanguinity. They wish to partition the property with each receiving a 5-acre parcel in his own name. The transfer of each 5-acre parcel is taxable at a $75,000 value. If they each owned a 50 percent fractional interest in the parcel, the transfer of each 5-acre parcel would be exempt from taxation, but if 6 acres were transferred to \"A\" and 4 acres were transferred to \"B,\" the transfer to \"A\" would be taxed on the value of 1 acre, $15,000. 14. A partnership owns real property worth $100,000. There is a mortgage on the property, and the partnership wishes to refinance the mortgage. As a condition of refinancing, the lender requires the property to be held in title by only one partner. The transfer from the partnership to the single partner is taxable on the entire $100,000 value. Once the refinancing is complete, any transfer of title back to the partnership is also taxable on the entire $100,000 value. 15. \"A\" and \"B\" own adjoining lots. \"A\" agrees to buy part of \"B's\" lot for $1,500,000. To expedite the mapping requirements, \"B\" transfers 100 percent of his lot to \"A,\" but retains a contractual obligation from \"A\" that after all mapping and adjustments to the legal description of the lot are complete, \"A\" will transfer back to \"B\" the property outside the purchased area. The first transfer is taxable on the $1,500,000 amount. Because the second transfer is made without stated consideration, the transfer back to \"B\" of the excess area is taxable based on the fair market value of that area. 23375.160 Examples of methods of determining value or tax base.The following are examples of transfers or conveyances subject to any tax imposed by chapter 375 of NRS: 1.

A transfer by which a contract for deed is recorded which sets forth the purchase price, legal description, the buyer and the seller and which provides that the buyer has received custody of the real property and a deed will be delivered to the buyer when he fulfills his contractual obligations.
