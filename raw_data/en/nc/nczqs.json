We are also committed to using patient and system data to improve models of care delivery, understand conditions that affect our patients, and, most recently, establish standards of care for patients with COVID-19. Hospitalists are encouraged to pursue their own areas of research that include topics from education and care delivery to health care disparities to steroid treatment for COVID-19. Our goal is to allow opportunity for personal and professional development that may include published papers or presentations at conferences. Some hospitalists have completed the [Clinical Research Training Master's Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einsteinmed.edu/centers/ictr/education/clinical-research-training-program/) to further their ability to effectively perform research. Hospitalists also support research projects by students, residents, and fellows.
