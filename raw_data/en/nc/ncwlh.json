[ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)20:41, 3 January 2019 (UTC) - The problem is that you're saying \"are more likely to be\", which means you can't build any sort of formal logical argument. There's no fallacy for this that I know of, it's just that you aren't able to use any formal logic (and because it isn't formal there's no formal fallacy). Let me go back to your original syllogism: - P1: Working as a nuclear engineer correlates with higher lifetime radiation exposure - P2: Lifetime radiation exposure correlates with lower lifespan - C: Therefore, working as a nuclear engineer correlates with lower lifespan - This isn't a formal argument and so we can't draw conclusions from it. That's the main problem I see. All your terms are the same (so no four-term fallacy) and your middle term is distributed (if I assume you're using all A-type statements) but your propositions aren't logically formal. That's the problem. You can't draw conclusions from \"A correlates with B and B with C so A necessarily correlates with C.\" Here's the most glaring problem I see with this syllogism when I translate it formally: - P1: All people working as nuclear engineers are people with higher lifetime radiation exposure - P2: Some people with higher lifetime radiation exposure are people with lower life spans - C: Some people working as nuclear engineers are people with lower life spans - I took \"correlates with\" in the second premise to be an I-type statement as I think an A-type statement is too strong a claim and certainly can't be substantiated. Now on to the glaring problem: an undistributed middle. The middle term is undistributed in the first premise and in the second so you can't come to the conclusion. You could make a formally valid argument if you did some heavy lifting with the premises but it wouldn't be worth it and I'm 99.999% sure it wouldn't be sound. Undistributed middle holds for your cat/cow data table too. Nowhere did you distribute the group \"black and white things.\" Had you done so, it would have been valid but unsound. [I have been known](/wiki/User:Koidevelopment) [to impulse buy books](/wiki/User_talk:Koidevelopment)00:22, 4 January 2019 (UTC) - I have little to add to this. I would agree that horoscopes are more often marketed to women. I mean, the history of the idea of \"how to choose a man\" as nuance runs deeper than \"how to choose a woman.\" It's not correct, and maybe we're getting ahead of that line of thinking. Guys don't have a lot of \"how to choose a woman\" advice, and it's not comparable to the superstitious \"you must have a husband\" outlook of a couple generations ago. I mean, how long ago were the 1950's in America, [when men and women were supposed to marry by the age of twenty-five](http://digg.com/2017/average-age-marriage-chart)? Having suitors/suitoring doesn't carry the weight/necessity/gender binary as it used to, but Astrology became a cultural movement that applied more heavily to one gender role. And caring about the superstitions of elders you respect will never go out of fashion. I mean, this to me is like saying \"Pink is the favorite color of more adult women than adult men.\" It's not exactly a meaningful claim, whether statistically it shakes out or not. Favorite colors are a pet peeve of mine either way. [Gol Sarnitt](/wiki/User:Gol_Sarnitt)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Gol_Sarnitt)) 03:14, 4 January 2019 (UTC) - @ [Koidevelopment](/wiki/User:Koidevelopment)\"The problem is that you're saying 'are more likely to be', which means you can't build any sort of formal logical argument.\" As I have already pointed out, the fallacy posed by @ [Ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed)is not about Logic, it is about Probability. - The concept of \"more likely\" makes sense in the language of Probability: we say that \"an event A is more likely to occur when the event B occurs\" whenever P(A|B) > P(A) (see [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conditional_probability)). Then, the posed ikanreed the \"P(Y|X) > 08:20, January 2019 (UTC) - Also \"more likely to be\" was kind of a simplification to make the concept clear. I really wanted to focus on numeric correlation. My cat/cow example was reduced to a binary measure to make the wrongness of the effect clear. My nuclear engineer example was closer to the kind of fallacious thinking I meant. One where y appears in naive analysis to be a function f(x) with some error, and z appears, in naive analysis, to be a function g(y) with some error, that you can then expand that to suggest that a naive analysis of z with respect to x will find a naive z=f(g(x)) where you just multiply error bars or something to bridge the gap. - God, that probably makes no sense the way I'm writing it.

[ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)20:55, 2 January 2019 (UTC) - You know, I've actually grown somewhat more sympathetic to Hoover over time. He at least tried to help with limited public works projects, and had to fight his own Treasury Secretary's advice to \"Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate.\" He's by no means a good President, but putting him below Buchanan and Nixon seems pretty damn harsh. - With regards to Wilson, he strikes me more as one of the \"Worst People to Have Been President\" than a bad President. If we want to consider Debs as an indictment of his legacy, then we should also examine John Adams of Alien and Sedition Acts fame. - Buchanan watched the country burn and didn't lift a damn finger. He deserves to be considered the worst President, moreso than even Trump. Though perhaps when we're fleeing from the Second American Civil War in eight years, I'll reevaluate my views. - Kind of agree with your assessment with Jackson, in that I'm not that much of a fan of wannabe autocrats and racists. - If I may be so bold as to suggest a new candidate for \"worst President,\" Richard Nixon. He did pretty severe damage to American democracy with his abuse of executive privilege, and sowed the seeds for the modern conservative movement as defined by Trump. While he did institute OSHA and the EPA, the brand of conservatism he planted the seeds of is directly opposed to those and other agencies.

Bizarre Cochrane report on artificial sweeteners[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive299&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Report finds no benefit from sweeteners, recommends people eat less and drink water. [[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/02/no-evidence-of-sugar-substitutes-health-benefits-finds-study) This is incredibly poor science, and reminds me of the classical economic theory that assumes everybody makes all their decisions based on total knowledge of the utility of everything, and no other criteria whatsoever. If you have a choice between soft drinks and water, maybe you think soft drinks taste nicer, but based purely on medical evidence your choice is illogical and you have failed in life. In the real world, people pay money for diet drinks which have similar nutritional value to water, but they have now been informed that is not a valid lifestyle option and they shouldn't make selections of food or beverage based on taste. -- [Annanoon](/wiki/User:Annanoon) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Annanoon)) 00:43, 3 January 2019 (UTC) - The problem is that your weight is actually linked to the amount of food you eat, not really the amount of sugar you eat. All that has actually happened is that this real world study has not taken into account modern food design. Yes the amount of sugar has been decreased, but the amount of complex carbohydrates and highly processed flour hasn't, and these will both act like sugar when digested. In general the more processed the foodstuff, the faster your blood sugar goes up an the more weight you gain. \u2014 Dysk ( [contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/D)) 01:25, 3 January 2019 (UTC) - the real problem is we all know what we should be eating and what we should be doing to keep weight off or lose it. eat less, move more. we all know this. its been known for years. popping diet coke instead of the full fat version not going to help if you still stuffing your face and not exercise. it might help, but its not a magic bullet. it might not help though if you use it fool yourself into thinking you are being healthy and thus can have more cake. i can appreciate healthy eating habits are difficult to form. i can appreciate exercise can be a pain the arse. and i understand that its harder to lose the weight than is to keep it off. reports like this one about sweetners should not effect us at all. all you really need to know is are you exercising enough and is your diet (everyday not weight loss) up to scratch? and if the exercise part is sufficient you can get away with eating all sorts of crap. everything else is an after thought. we've known this stuff for years [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 16:33, 3 January 2019 (UTC) - \"It might help\".

Here I think the answer is probably no, and the new Canadian review does not change this conclusion. Randomized controlled trials in humans supersede cohort studies and animal studies in addressing this question. Those studies find, if anything, a modest benefit to consuming LES. It is obviously possible to disagree about whether or not this benefit is real, given that there are inconsistencies in the data. The randomized trials clearly do not show any disadvantage - no backfire effect. What I think this means is that, if you are trying to lose weight replacing sugary drinks with low calorie drinks can be a helpful part of your overall strategy. It will not be a panacea, or make weight loss easy. The research shows the most effective strategies involve making permanent changes to your lifestyle regarding food consumption and exercise. Avoiding sugary drinks can be part of those lifestyle changes, and you should not fear drinking LES because of an alleged backfire effect. The research, including this recent review, does not show such an effect in humans. --It's-a me, [Lefty](/wiki/User:LeftyGreenMario) [Green](/wiki/User_talk:LeftyGreenMario) [Mario](/wiki/Special:Contributions/LeftyGreenMario)!( [Mod](/wiki/RationalWiki:Moderators)) 20:10, 4 January 2019 (UTC) Volunteers[ Who wants to volunteer for getting slaughtered today?

This phenomenon happens especially for the annual country balance, but also in general when other types of resources are assigned, and the assignment is compared to previous years. Same pattern happens when commenting votes redistribution among parties from one election to another, especially when there are more than two parties, like in my country. The pattern is as follows. Say you have balance entries x_1, ..., x_n = B as of year 2018, where B is total budget. The x_i's can be say, defence expenses, education, and so on. In 2019 balance entries are subject to re-allocation, so you have y_1, ..., y_n = B (for simplicity, assume to have same B from year to year), where, say y_education can get a cut from x_education of the previous year. So some entries can be significantly smaller, there will be other y_i's which are increased with respect from the homologous x_i's of the previous year. Clearly, media can say (and actually say), \"oh, all the x_2 cut has been shifted to y_1. What a bad left wing/bad right wing. \". Feel free to decline this in your own setting, say \"space research budget cut has been shifted to defense budget\". Point is that there are infinitely many interpretations of budget redistributions, all of which make perfect mathematical sense, all of which can be exploited by media. For instance I could say that cuts on space research totally shifted on another budget entry which increased in the new year, like \"We cut space research for having funding for small farmers. Actually the defence budget raise comes from drug dealers huge confiscations\" etc. This can create an arbitrarily large number of [False dilemmas](/wiki/False_dilemma), putting education against defense, etc. I'm looking for opinions and pointers about that. Has this manipulation technique a name, already?

It's just muddy talking about allocation and deviation from what's \"expected\", with all the political assumptions that go into those assumptions. [ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)19:59, 4 January 2019 (UTC) - I'll try to be more precise by using a more neutral scenario. Say, in year 2018, universities A,B,C,D take money for funding 5 researchers each from federal budget. A and B are northern universities, C and D are southern. Also, B and D are STEM oriented universities, and A and C are stronger in art and humanities. In 2019, A gets 8 researchers, B gets 4, C gets 6 and D gets 2. Now there can be many, mathematically consistent ways of interpreting the shift of budget, each of which can be used for argumenting in favor or against the new budget distribution. Blog 1 titles \"Government privileges northern universities with no reason (A+B=12)\". Blog 2 titles \"No regional bias. Government downfunds STEM universities (B+D=6)\". Baddest above all, Blog 3 break the news with \"University C steals one researcher from neighbor university D. No loyalty for the regional neighbor\". Another blog might well announce that \"A stole 3 researcher from the good university D\". All of these arguments/interpretations of the budget shifts have mathematical sense, but they play over an unproven causality over shifts of resources. Press can manipulate opinions and, at will, put emphasis over \"North vs South\" or \"STEM vs Art&Humanities\". Or, fallaciously, put emphasis on local shifts (\"D transferred resources to C\") which have no sense in the global scale. All that we know is that A+C have 4 researchers more, and B+D have 4 researchers less. The example is oversimplified, but think at the number of false polarizations that can be observed with, say 60+ universities. Same happens if one, willingly and with no statistical analysis, wants to give his desired explanation of votes shift from one election to another. Say A,B,C,D are political parties, then the number of \"shift\" explanations from one election to another are many. In this case there is one true vote shift mapping that usually can be reconstructed almost accurately with polls, etc. Nonetheless, liars on the web exist and can manipulate interpretations at will.

And it's important that you've put it in the university sense, and not the elementary school, because you're not talking about public schooling. The same thing doesn't apply, because money can flow into and out of universities based on alumni and sports teams and yes, government funding, as the government may misguidedly apply itself, but it is not a lock system for destined money that can be applied to any university to lift or sink it.

And it's important that you've put it in the university sense, and not the elementary school, because you're not talking about public schooling. The same thing doesn't apply, because money can flow into and out of universities based on alumni and sports teams and yes, government funding, as the government may misguidedly apply itself, but it is not a lock system for destined money that can be applied to any university to lift or sink it. And it definitely sucks when a smart person can't get publicly funded. It's a hard world. I'd rather talk about fixing public schooling.

And especially, is there any evidence to think on space(-time) being not continuous but being formed by tiny components?. - You guys are all asking research-level questions here. Good job! - At present, we lack a complete quantum theory of gravity. So what physicists do is trying to work on an approximate version thereof, namely, quantum field theory in curved spacetime. In this framework, one treats elementary particle interactions in the backdrop of curved spacetime. In order to this to work, the scale must be sufficiently large and the strength of gravity must be sufficiently weak. - The possibility of spacetime being quantized is being actively pursued by many theoretical physicists. However, the statistical mechanics of granular spacetime does not yet have any substance. [Nerd](/wiki/User:Nerd)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Nerd)) 15:12, 6 January 2019 (UTC) - You need to distinguish space-time as a mathematical abstraction from the physical world whose idealised behavior is described (in part) by the abstraction. The history of physics is about building more and more powerful abstractions. Newton thought of space-time as being a 3D Euclidean/Cartesian space through which objects move. It's easy to visualise Newtonian space as being like a room with nothing in it. But that's not really an accurate model, as you can see in the way physicicists spent hundreds of years thinking about how to detect and measure the substance behind this vacuum, which was variously viewed as something through which waves propagate (that must be like air or water or other things through which soundwaves propagate), or something that must be dragged along with moving objects, or as a fixed frame of reference we can measure objects against. The moral being, you may think you can understand something intuitively, but your intuition only goes so far. - Physics is ultimately equations which tells us how things behave, it doesn't tell us what their essence is, or what they are like beyond the behaviours we can model and predict. This is really unintuitive because we're used to the idea that objects are made of a substance (wood, stone, water, flesh and blood, etc) and we can find out what they're made of (by poking, kicking, inspecting, taking samples), as well as understanding how they behave. This applies to billiard balls, boiling water, and even to animals. But we can't do that in fundamental physics - all we can know is behavior. Physics can tell us how particles and energy interact and change, but it can't give us the nature of the mathematical abstraction of space-time, any more than it can tell us what the number line is made of or what kind of thing the square root of -1 is. -- [Annanoon](/wiki/User:Annanoon)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Annanoon)) 17:09, 7 January 2019 (UTC) - @ [Annanoon](/wiki/User:Annanoon)Hold on. I detect quite a few misconceptions here. First, if by \"substance behind this vacuum\" of space you mean the luminiferous ether, attempts to detect it and measure its properties originated from otherwise sound understanding of physics that is now known to be mistaken. This is perfectly normal in science, which is inherently progressive. The vacuum of outer space on average contains no matter. This means it can only support fundamental interactions, namely, gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear. - Physics can tell us not just how something behave, but also why it behaves that way and what it is made off. Witness the success of the periodic table of the elements and the Standard Model of particle physics. - I can tell you what the square root of -1 is. But I think you already know the answer, since you mentioned it. Don't make it more complicated than it needs to be. As you mentioned, conventional geometric intuition can only go so far. Take a course on complex analysis and you will learn a lot more. You will, for example, learn an elegant proof (by contradiction) of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. But before that, you may want to take a course on real analysis, which will teach you quite a bit about the real number line. Depending on where or who is teaching, you may even learn how to construct it.

I was asked in the downtime at work if I thought a transgender person also ought to disclose their sex-change in this fashion. I said, no, it's not a legal thing, but I was also caught unaware by the legality of HIV disclosure. But now that I know, the answer is definitely no. If you do not get an STI from it, and if a trans woman does not get you so drunk you cannot consent, then no, you have gone to bed with a person you perceived was a woman. If that upsets you, first think about the scenario where you decide to have homosexual relations, just for the experience of it. You spend all night hitting on a man, go home with a man, find out it's a trans man, he never had the genitals you wanted to play with. Is it an \"aw, shucks,\" scenario, or a \"this is a crime\" situation? This, of course, is based on a discussion I had with other men who have a particular attitude about sex. It makes it all the more perplexing to me that they don't understand if they go to a bar trying to have sex with a woman, and they have sex with a woman who was born a man, the issue is with the woman. I mean, I tell these guy's they'd stick it in mud if they thought it would wiggle, and they laugh. Their problem is needing to have sex with something, not needing to have sex with a woman as they define it. Just utterly frustrated, probably shouldn't even share this grossness.

And yet, while it's not praiseworthy to full out lie about it, the person is pretending to be someone with x sexual experience shouldn't be obliged to admit their status as a virgin before sex, or at least it sounds a little absurd to expect that by law. You can say that consent is contingent upon certain knowledge, but its pretty hard to argue that your consent is revoked once you realize that person wasn't a virgin. Why would it be the other case if we are taking about changed genitals? Especially if the person has never claimed to have always been a woman or man (as that kind of question rarely comes up anyways). The same would go for a man or a woman who is so promiscuous the number of their sex partners is in the triple digits (or imagine 4 digits). For the majority of people this would constitute a person who. sexually. is pretty experienced, in colloquial terms amongst binary genders using the nasty pejoratives of whore or a man-slut. If someone acts as though they choose their partners sparingly, project an image of innocence etc and enter a long term relationship with them, if the other partner finds out the truth it can be devastating, relationship ending and until recently, in some jurisdictions, justification for divorce and getting child custody.

The worst that can happen is a man has anal sex with a trans-woman that he believed was a woman. I mean, that's THE WORST scenario here. It's fucking childish to want a legal protection for that, the legal protection against an STD/STI makes more sense. You shouldn't know you have herpes and not care. But you should be able to go to a bar, as a man or woman, and take somebody home for sex. At the same time, if you are going to a bar with that intention, you have so much responsibility to protect yourself, unfortunately more for a woman than a man. I think that's where the honesty about anything comes into play. - I mean, it's illegal to have sex without a condom in Sweden unless there is explicit consent to sex with no condom. One gender is affected more heavily than the other by this law, and it's women, a woman's responsibility is more defined by this law. If you didn't see that coming, take a lap.

[ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)06:09, 6 January 2019 (UTC) @shabidoo - while we are talking about disclosures in general, there is such a thing as rape by deception. it generally requires a concerted effort to deceive. that said, what people choose to reveal about themselves and at what stage is entirely up to the individuals involved. the reasons why folk would choose to disclose or not disclose are entirely their own. if something is of concern to you, its really on you to ask rather than hope information will be volunteered. much of the stuff mentioned about sexual history and the like would not seem appropriate to ask outside of a long term relationship. its more about trust and honesty in the relationship rather than legal requirements. for issues of consent, you need to ask if its an issue, but refusing to answer such a question or knowingly lying - depends on whats being asked and why as if its legally suspect. some things are going to be fundemental to consent others more trivial. the legal 'grey area' is the individuals involved and the context is different each tine. is it reasonable to have long check lists of things for consent in all situations? hooking up with a stranger in a club the list is very short indeed, while you might expect more formal matchmaking to be more stringent. i dunno, this all makes it seem very complicated when in reality its really simple. lies and dishonesty are usually over things that have minimal bearing on consent - they result in shitty sex rather than a sense of violation. i can think of few things that would. i mean, if i were a straight male, i would assume i would prefer to be with a woman. who in their right mind would ask 'are you sure you are not a man?'. you wouldnt ask. you'd make the assumption. its not an issue of consent. if anyone is outraged or sickened on discovery of such a situation, thats on them. i think what im saying is, if you dont explicitly make something an issue of consent, that you dont ask or check, then its not an issue of consent. [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 10:32, 6 January 2019 (UTC) it occurs to me that, while i have no idea if anyone is actually proposing such a law (the one case i am aware of fell foul of the rape by deception), if one were to appear, how would it work in districts that have no or make difficult to get legal recognition of trans status? can you be legally expected to disclose something that is not legally recognised? [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 01:21, 7 January 2019 (UTC) - \"can you be legally expected to disclose something that is not legally recognised?\" - I guess it would be about legally disclosing your sex. [Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 09:34, 7 January 2019 (UTC) - It would only work in a defense of an offense, I think, i.e. \"I beat her up because she wasn't a girl!\" While I disagree with the idea that STI/HIV disclosure laws are useless, that if somebody did not disclose herpes or HIV, and transmitted it during consensual unprotected sex, it could be argued that the damages caused by said transmission of the STI or HIV are harmful enough that one partner in the act behaved irresponsibly and should be subject to some sort of reparational social responsibility. Whether it actively helps or not, it's harder for me to say \"knowingly having unprotected sex while you have genital herpes does not carry a physical risk to your sexual partner.\" Disclosure of your condition does benefit, not disclosing can potentially do irreversible harm, and I don't think it's weighted much by gender. So, is it reasonable to say \"If you know you have herpes, and you don't disclose that fact, somebody you transmit herpes to unwittingly could take you to court for, say, medical treatment of herpes,\" versus \"If you were born a gender, and you now identify as a different gender, and somebody you have sex with is upset about your birth gender could take you to court over psychological damages?\" I mean, you can argue that the former doesn't benefit anyone because people make bad choices on their own, but I'd poo-poo that, because unprotected sex isn't always a bad or dangerous choice. There are pills and IUDs and vasectomies and hysterectomies that make unprotected sex a perfectly viable choice in plenty of circumstances that CAN occur, even if a person makes all the best choices up until unprotected sex. I'd agree that rarely is anyone benefitted by the STI/HIV laws, but I wouldn't call them huge piles of shit or a double standard. Trans disclosure, though, yeah, huge pile of shit.

If you don't and if you transmit HIV to some of them, then you are legal responsible.\" It sounds good, but in real life there are a lot of complications: Proving that one knows he was HIV-positive is difficult because of privacy; Proving that one tells he was HIV-positive to his sexual partners is often a \"one person's word against another's\" situation; What if they, aware of the risk of contagion, used a condom but it broke?; What if one purposely does not get tested to avoid being legally obliged to tell he is HIV-positive?

I'm sounding like Jordan Peterson over here, boooo. - It would only work in a defense of an offense, I think, i.e. \"I beat her up because she wasn't a girl!\" While I disagree with the idea that STI/HIV disclosure laws are useless, that if somebody did not disclose herpes or HIV, and transmitted it during consensual unprotected sex, it could be argued that the damages caused by said transmission of the STI or HIV are harmful enough that one partner in the act behaved irresponsibly and should be subject to some sort of reparational social responsibility. Whether it actively helps or not, it's harder for me to say \"knowingly having unprotected sex while you have genital herpes does not carry a physical risk to your sexual partner.\" Disclosure of your condition does benefit, not disclosing can potentially do irreversible harm, and I don't think it's weighted much by gender. So, is it reasonable to say \"If you know you have herpes, and you don't disclose that fact, somebody you transmit herpes to unwittingly could take you to court for, say, medical treatment of herpes,\" versus \"If you were born a gender, and you now identify as a different gender, and somebody you have sex with is upset about your birth gender could take you to court over psychological damages?\" I mean, you can argue that the former doesn't benefit anyone because people make bad choices on their own, but I'd poo-poo that, because unprotected sex isn't always a bad or dangerous choice. There are pills and IUDs and vasectomies and hysterectomies that make unprotected sex a perfectly viable choice in plenty of circumstances that CAN occur, even if a person makes all the best choices up until unprotected sex. I'd agree that rarely is anyone benefitted by the STI/HIV laws, but I wouldn't call them huge piles of shit or a double standard. Trans disclosure, though, yeah, huge pile of shit.

These straight lines are called geodesics. [[1]](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/192318/can-anyone-explain-me-how-time-can-bend-according-to-einstein-in-simple-way) Somebody explain this. How is this possible? [](/wiki/User:BobRoss) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:BobRoss)) 00:34, 6 January 2019 (UTC) - Let's begin with the basic definition. A geodesic is simply a curve of shortest length that connects two points on a surface. On a plane, a geodesic is a straight line. On a cylinder, a geodesic is either vertical straight line, a circular arc or a helical path with the same radius as the cylinder. On a sphere, a geodesic is an arc of a great circle, or one with the same radius as the sphere. - In general relativity, the presence of mass, energy, momentum, and/or pressure curves spacetime. Therefore, the shortest path between two points is necessarily no longer a straight line. Since general relativity does not envision gravity as a force, unlike Newton's theory of gravity, objects under the influence of gravity must move as if there is no force acting on them. That is, they must move along a geodesic. - This also explains, for example, why gravity bends light. Light travels in a straight line, but only through a homogeneous medium in flat spacetime. The effect of gravity bending light is similar to light passing through a lens, such as a magnifying glass, hence the name gravitational lensing. What is always true is that light travels between points A and B along a path of least time (Fermat's principle).

[](/wiki/User:BobRoss)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:BobRoss)) 02:50, 6 January 2019 (UTC) The best answer one can give to your question is based on experimental evidence. At present, as far as we can \"see\" with the detectors in our particle accelerators, quarks are fundamental particles, just like photons, and electrons. The question of whether or not fundamental particles are point particles is another tough research question. Again, experimental evidence suggests it is permissible to treat them as points, as long as we keep wave-particle duality in mind. Physicists have tried to mathematically model certain fundamental particles as extended objects, but without much success. For example, an attempt to (semiclassically) model the electron as a spinning sphere of charge failed because it predicted that that the surface of the electron is spinning faster than the speed of light in vacuum, which cannot happen. [Nerd](/wiki/User:Nerd) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Nerd)) 03:24, 6 January 2019 (UTC) - Why would being an extended object make it faster than light? [](/wiki/User:BobRoss)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:BobRoss)) 03:53, 6 January 2019 (UTC) - Why would being an extended object make it faster than light? - In this semiclassical model, an electron is treated classically in that it has a definite position and momentum. Its spin, however, is quantized; the only allowed values are and (or up and down). These values come from experiment. Quantum-mechanical spin is a measure of intrinsic angular momentum, and angular momentum is always related to rotation in classical mechanics. Using upper-undergraduate-level electrodynamics, one can calculate the so-called classical electron radius, or the Lorentz radius, after Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, who first performed the calculation. Knowing the radius, and given the angular momentum, one can then compute the rotational speed. Plugging in the numbers, one finds that such an electron would have its surfacing spinning faster than light, which is absurd. - The moral of this story is that quantum-mechanical objects should not be thought of in classical terms. Quantum-mechanical spin is anything but classical. Thus, an electron is, as far as we can tell, a point particle with an intrinsic angular momentum. Classically, this of course makes no sense. A point is zero-dimensional and as such cannot support rotation.

It is. Visualizing things may be fun and helpful in classical physics, but in quantum physics, such attempts at intuitive understanding run straight into a brick wall. We are thus even more heavily reliant on mathematics to tell us what is going on or what theory predicts. If you compare a textbook in higher physics with introductory physics, especially high school or freshman physics vs. graduate physics, you will find that the former contain a lot more illustrations and diagrams than the latter.

However this is not the case. Denominations such as the snake handling Baptists you show on the right are micro religions within the realm of Christian based religions such as Catholicism or Mormonism. Religion is a man made set kf rituals, gatherings, traditions, and beliefs that if adhered to get the practitioner closer to God. Christianity in pure form is simply following Christ. The writer shoukd also not that Christ is unrelated to Old Testament tradition. He was from the lineage of Melchizedek who was a high priest not of the named and required lineage of high priests making him a rogue priest. His death ended the Mosaic old testament covenant between God and man (the vengeful, retalitory agreement God had with Hebrews/ what atheists throw up in your face when you say Jesus is love) With his shed blood on a cross he sealed a new covenant between God and man. This new covenant gives a path to salvation, and an indwelling of Christ within the believer aka that ghost you hear about. Its also important to note that Christ only has one commandment vs the 300 some odd commandments of the old covenant (this includes the 10 foundational commamdments) People do become disilusioned with religion, I was. But a learned who Jesus is, how he sees me and how he views me as a sinner in a fallen world. Christ requires no church buildings (that a religious thing, church is a gathering of Christ followers) No freqent repentance after sinning aka religious follow the 10 origional laws but Christians arent bound by them instead they are spirit driven (which means though they are no longer under the law the spirit is their moral compas and c conviction. No required baptism or Lords supper, no tithe or required dress, i can drink beer, i can have sex with my wife however I want. You may ask well what about Sin, Sin degrades and rots humanity it destroys you but by the iindweling of Christ we are new creatures not driven by the flesh but by his spirit. I simply follow Christ and try to learn mote through his spirit and through his word. The author should actually research the Bible, covenants, Christianity vs denominationalism... its laughable that no biblical sources are pulled. Those who have not had an encounter with Christ don't know and those who have cant explajn the awesomeness of it.\" So many fallacies in this \"disclaimer\"... To start off, [no true Scotsman](/wiki/No_true_Scotsman), followed by [But that was the Old Testament](/wiki/But_that_was_the_Old_Testament) (not a fallacy per se, but definitely stupid. i.e. if the old testament isn't applicable why include it? Seriously, it's over 60% of the book.) Next up we have \"The writer shoukd also not that Christ is unrelated to Old Testament tradition. He was from the lineage of Melchizedek who was a high priest not of the named and required lineage of high priests making him a rogue priest\" Which is both an [argument by assertion](/wiki/Argument_by_assertion) and heretical according to most strains of Christian doctrine. It's also just plain bullshit from a plain reading of the text. Skipping over most of the testimonial, though it does seem to have an implicit [I used to be an atheist](/wiki/I_used_to_be_an_atheist) in there. \"No freqent repentance after sinning aka religious follow the 10 origional laws but Christians arent bound by them instead they are spirit driven\" So, basically a \"once saved always saved\" version of salvation doctrine. Also, apparently this person has been living under a rock, because according to Evangelicals (who I suppose aren't Real Christians.) legal law as a whole is derived from the [Ten Commandments](/wiki/Ten_Commandments). \"No required baptism or Lords supper, no tithe or required dress, i can drink beer, i can have sex with my wife however I want.\" Good for you buddy, you found a relatively moderate denomination and/or church. \"You may ask well what about Sin, Sin degrades and rots humanity it destroys you but by the iindweling of Christ we are new creatures not driven by the flesh but by his spirit.\" Not really, given that \"sin\" has no real value as concept and basically amounts to \"things I think my god doesn't like this week, except if I want to do them badly enough.\" \"The author should actually research the Bible, covenants, Christianity vs denominationalism\" Most of us have. Some of the most prominent members of the Atheist community have studied this book in depth, some of them being ex-preachers, ex-fundamentalists, ex-literalists, and/or ex-seminary students. As for the second half of that, no. You have to prove that claim first, not expect others to do the research for your ill-fleshed idea. \"its laughable that no biblical sources are pulled\" Unless you're asking that the article reference the sections it's criticizing, that's [circular reasoning](/wiki/Circular_reasoning) and ain't going to happen kiddo. \"Those who have not had an encounter with Christ don't know and those who have cant explajn the awesomeness of it.\" This right here is what set this whole saloon post off.

[Bongolian](/wiki/User:Bongolian)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Bongolian)) 03:42, 8 January 2019 (UTC) - I think I remember pretty basic introduction to a physical system is actually pointed out somewhere here. [There it is.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Global_warming#Antarctic_sea_ice_is_increasing)The earth isn't a completely closed system, but it is darn near it. The sun is the major external force, and the atmosphere is the catalyst, and the distance and composition of the planet are all major players in how the energy from the sun is absorbed/used in, what can be best described as entropy. Being said, putting an ice cube into a hot cup of coffee is a lot smaller of a system. The ice cube was formed under different circumstances than the water for the coffee was boiled, but I mean, if you were really all about getting that coffee without burning your mouth, you could take a straw and sip at whatever's right next to the cube before it fully melted and settled on a different temperature. But you're mostly getting watered down coffee, bad data about the overall temperature of your coffee. So ice, which we know is a structure salt inhibits, forms with a lower concentration of salt than the water around it that doesn't freeze. Melting ice that formed from salt water around it (during a real ice age, not a little one) is inherently less salty, so when it melts it desalinates the water around it, which makes a larger surface area more prone to freezing, at least at its closest point to the freezing threshold. But it's kind of a death-throe, it doesn't mean there is something within the system that will cool everything out to normal and then STILL EXIST, which is why the ice cube in coffee analogy was so stupid, I'm so stupid, damn it. As the pure-water ice dissipates, it acts more like pure-water. Ice is not colder than salt-water, it just [has less salt in it](http://blog.science-matters.org/2011/09/26/chemistry-the-effect-of-salt-on-the-freezing-point-of-water/), so it can form the structure of ice. The fact that it is melting in places where it really shouldn't is alarming, even if this has a dissipating cooling effect in places in a relatively short term. Hand of God dropping a new ice cube in the ocean is the only thing that can quickly/effectively cool the entire planet at this point.

Electromagnetic Field[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive299&action=edit\u00a7ion=31)] I got the following words from Quora, The magnetic field from our heart has been measured up to around three feet away and our brain waves which produce much smaller measurable fields are measurable up to 1/10 of an inch from the skull.\" [[1]](https://www.quora.com/Do-humans-give-off-an-electromagnetic-field-If-so-how-is-it-measured) So do our brain waves produce electromagnetic fields? What exactly does \"brain waves\" refer to of nerve cells? [](/wiki/User:BobRoss) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:BobRoss)) 18:28, 8 January 2019 (UTC) - That's complicated. First off, since this is RW, let's get a few things out immediately, brain waves are useless for much of anything besides measuring if someone is alive and/or conscious. There's a lot of woo, and most of it is bullshit. - Gross simplificaiton incoming: The term \"brain wave\" refers to the measurable magnetic fields coming out our skulls. The reason there's a measurable electromagnetic field that comes in \"waves\" from the brain is because of how neurotransmission works. Brain cells use the chemical energy they have in ATP(gotten the same way every other cell gets it, breaking sugar apart with oxygen, both coming from blood) to pump sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium ions across the cell membrane. When they receive an electrical message from one or more neighboring neurons, they, based on certain individual cell attributes(and moderated by neurotransmitter chemicals such as serotonin) that are way more complex than I understand, decide to either fire or stay silent. If they \"fire\", they dump all their collected ions, creating a large(for a cell) electrical charge on their surface, which is conducted by the cell's axions to neighboring cells. Which then repeat the process based on their own firing conditions. - Certain parts of the brain are \"programmed\" to regularly discharge in an organized fashion. Those discharges often produce specific \"chains\" of cell activation across the entire brain. A large quantity of charge moving simultaneously creates an ElectroMagnetic field. That EM field can be detected as appearing and dissipating with normal electrical equipment, and it looks a lot like a wave. [ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)20:30, 8 January 2019 (UTC) - Your brain generates and processes information in the form of electrochemical signals. Neurons communicate with each other via molecules called neurotransmitters, but the signals travel inside each neuron is an electrical pulse. Electrical charges have their own electric fields, but a mobile charge also generates a magnetic field. Whether or not such an electromagnetic field can be detected at that kind of a distance, I do not know. - And while we are at it, here is the answer to the original Quora question. Yes. All the time. Light is a class of electromagnetic waves that your eyes can detect. Infrared radiation, also known as heat, is given off as well and can be detected by touching. In general, any object whose absolute temperature is above zero emits electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths. The distribution of intensity as a function of wavelength depends on the temperature and looks like a bell curve but is tilted leftward. (See [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law)). The wavelength of peak intensity can be calculated as well (by using [Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law)).

There is still a small hard core of his base that buys into the fearmongering, but it's shrinking. #SchumerShutdown[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive299&action=edit\u00a7ion=34)] I watched Trump's address, along with the Democrat's response (and I suspect a lot of users also watched both). Until recently (like, the past few weeks) I considered the Trump Wall to be unnecessary. However, my mind has since changed. There are several points that the Democrats would rather sweep under the carpet. - A vast majority of heroin (90%) flows in from the Southern border. (Even I was surprised by this statistic) - Law enforcement professionals requested the wall, and they know more about this issue than any of us - Tens of billions are spent on dealing with [illegal immigration each year](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illegal-immigration-costing-record-135-billion-a-year-study-shows), the $5 billion is nothing in comparison - Trump outlined several problems with the current Southern border (including drugs and crime by illegal immigrants, e.g the murder of a police officer by [an illegal immigrant who crossed the Arizona border](https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-accused-of-murdering-california-cop-faces-judge)). In the Schumer/Pelosi response, Chuck Schumer disgracefully described this a \"manufactured crisis\" - The Democrats have supported border security in past, including good ol' Chuck and then-Senator Obama in 2006. In all, I have concluded that this is a 'SchumerShutdown'. The principle reason the Democrats oppose this wall is because Trump wants it. -- [RWRW](/wiki/User:RWRW) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:RWRW)) 19:00, 9 January 2019 (UTC) - A lot of heroin does come up throuh Mexico, but just about all of it gets through at the regular points of entry. Very little is brought through the desolate wastelands that are the only areas that don't already have border walls. And most people who are in the country illegally are here because they overstayed their visas, not because they took a dangerous trek through the desert. The fellow who allegedly killed the cop was one of them, and entered by a legit entry point. Trump's wall is an empty gesture meant to rile the white trash rather than to solve any immigration problem.

Neither would be stopped by The Wall. We should spend money on dealing with these problems. - Of course there are going to be some law enforcement professionals that support this. There will also be some who oppose it. [Selection bias](/wiki/Selection_bias)at work. - The Wall is not a very efficient way of preventing illegal immigration. Stuff like more border patrol agents is more effective and costs less. The only reason Trump wants a wall is because that was his signature campaign promise, back when he didn't actually have to govern. - Native-born citizens commit twice as many crimes as illegal immigrants: [[4]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/two-charts-demolish-the-notion-that-immigrants-here-illegally-commit-more-crime/?utm_term=.a8f84be2a2aa) - Fences are not walls. Schumer & co supported fences in 2006. There are some areas where fences could potentially be effective; they have already been built in these locations. Much of the remaining area is either difficult-to-cross terrain like mountains or rivers or is on private land which the government would have to seize (something which as a self-identified libertarian you would probably oppose). Both of these things result in increased cost, which results in less wall getting built. - Look, if Mexico pays for the wall, then why not have one. But [the odds of that happening are zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/25/former-mexican-president-says-he-will-not-pay-for-donald-trumps-f-wall/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c78418dd3df8). Why should taxpayers have to foot the bill for this nonsensical campaign promise? In fact, a spending bill the House passed that funded every agency except Homeland Security (the agency in charge of border security), which would end most of the shutdown was blocked by Senate Republicans. Why? Because then Trump wouldn't be able to hold millions of government employees hostage over this wall. The real \"crisis\" is Trump's causing this shutdown entirely by himself, causing environmental damage at national parks and putting many government employees at risk of losing their homes, all because of this stupid wall. \u2014 [pythoncoder](/wiki/User:Pythoncoder)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Pythoncoder)| [contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/pythoncoder)) 21:31, 9 January 2019 (UTC) - Fair points.

The first point is valid, but no real reason to oppose. Of course on Trump's part it is a broken promise, but did anyone actually expect him to get Mexico to pay? Trump has discovered what every elected official discovers sooner or later: the realities of power very different than elaborate campaign promises. The second point was not wanting taxpayer money to be wasted. I couldn't help but laugh - when has the left ever cared about wasting taxpayer money? - The real question now is what happens next. As the Joker once said, Congress seems to be an \"unstoppable force meeting an immovable object\". There's an idea that the budget should be pushed through without border funding, allowing for negotiations to continue. This makes perfect sense, IF the Dems would actually be willing to compromise (like the GOP would be doing).

Can we move the goalposts again and say that really, it's \"border security\" that is what Trump wants? That's one of the few compromise paths I see, it involves redefining \"wall\" away from being explicitly a physical thing, and away from something that is symbolic of Trump into something a little more generic. That's not something I see Trump doing though... - At any rate, rationally, a physical wall is certainly a stupid idea in many places on the border (think Santa Elena Canyon in Big Bend or think trying to take land from Texas landowners :) ). But we are talking politics, which is never rational. Under more normal political times, more border security probably would have been an option (as it has been before). What I think makes things different this time is Donald Trump's openly racist attitude has hardened feelings on the Democrats. The Democrats also has momentum, coming fresh off of a \"blue wave\" election. Politically this was probably not the best time for Trump to play hardball on this issue. But here we are.

Meanwhile everyone else has seen their real salary stagnate or even decrease. That is a tremendous success if you ask me. Absolutely fabulous deal. He's engaged in trade disruption with all of America's allies effectively isolating the USA as an aggressive trading partner encouraging other economies to trade with one another without pointless economic barriers. He shook Kim Yung Un's hand in Singapore. He then changed the subject and ignored North Korea's continuation with parts of the nuclear program and his threats. A tremendous success that has clearly brought fabulous peace to the world. He's been really really good at dressing down world leaders with some of the funniest insults and hissy-fits. The state of US diplomacy and global influence is just great, great stuff. He managed to get two really amazing people in the supreme court, just terrific good guys, guys anyone would trust their daughter to be alone with. Just fabulous judges. He was a winner at converting political narrative, new ideas, knee jerk reactions, insults, temper-tanrtums... to sporadic incomprehensible messages of 160 characters (280 now I believe). Has any other president been more successful at toning down facts and injecting outrage? He was a star at losing the House of Representatives. He is number one at letting victims of natural disasters learn the skills of fending for themselves and becoming more self-sufficient. No previous president has achieved such close gushing man-crushes amongst other populist like the democratic and fair and close lovers of America like Putin, Kim Yung Un, Mohammad al Saud. He brought heart and soul into the oval office. His most notable achievement is winning the absolute prize for the president who is laughed at and flabberghasts (if not disturbs) 80% of the citizens of the EU, Canada (western world). More than even Bush or Nixon. But I think really the best achievement of all, was taking credit for economic growth which is mostly due to the last three president's policies, change in market trends and specific state's policies. Whats incredible is that the economy has managed to grow despite him limiting it with trade disruption and an enormous loss of stimulus policies due to his tax slaughtering. Who on earth can take better credit for something positive (which they've actually done their best to sabotage) than President T.

Here is something I have not seen discussed enough. The U.S. government should criminalize the hiring of illegal immigrants. Employers on U.S. soil must verify (electronically) that their recruits are either U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or other legal alien residents authorized to work. Employers hiring undocumented migrants should face heavy jail time. This would eliminate the incentive for people to illegally immigrate to the U.S. and would cut down illegal immigration more effectively than any border wall. - @ [Anna Livia](/wiki/User:Anna_Livia)No. Foreigners aren't entitled to American tax money.

With regards to infrastructure, [she is 16th in the 2017-2018 period, while her southern neighbor is now in 9th place,](http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-index-2017-2018/competitiveness-rankings/#series=GCI.A.02)displacing Germany and the United Kingdom. This is why I said U.S. infrastructure is improving relative to other countries. - As for high-speed rail, one should always keep in mind that it is appropriate only for highly populated cities located not too far apart (about 4 hours). Two key factors needed for high-speed rail to be feasible are (1) population density and (2) wealth. The U.S. certainly has wealth, a lot of it, but not always the density. This is why high-speed rail exists in relative few places in the U.S. at present, namely, in the Northeast Corridor, and in Florida, with more under construction in California and Texas.

First, I don't think \"improving relative to other countries\" is as relevant to \"how good it could and ought to be considering the US's wealth, budget and world dominance/leadership/standing in so many areas. There are countries which are pretty comparable to the US in either size, population or opportunity, with much less money and resources and have better infrastructure. - As for high-speed rail, the North East corridor of the US is very dense and desparately need of real high speed rail (it is slow and pathetic with most of the path not having dedicated lanes which are needed for real high speed). The Madrid-Zaragoza-Barcelona-Girona corridor serves two metros (Madrid/Barcelona) with 9 million between them and three cities (with about 3 million) serving about 12 million and the trains reach 300 km per hour and averages 280kph). In some places you just see streak lines out the window especially through short mountain passages. The average speed on the accela is less than half that of Spains at 135kpm. That is slow. You might as well fly from Boston to Washington. An Spain's economy has been behind that of the US for a long time. The Washington-NY-Boston serves one megopolis (NY is about 20 mil), 3 metropoli (13 mil) and several cities (5 mil). Thats about 38 million. More than three times the population than the Spanish corridor serving some of the richest cities in the world and connecting the biggest financial centre on Earth with the most powerful national capital on Earth and tons in between. Add to that a power house economy. There are engineering challenges in both Spain and the US corridors. Spain had to blast through tons of mountains and appropriate a fair bit of land. The US will have to build more dedicated tracks which is difficult and will include long tunnels and appropriate a lot of land. I could say the same for comparable high speed rails in France and even Germany. No more excuses, get it done, do it. [Shabi](/wiki/User:Shabidoo) [DOO](/wiki/User_talk:Shabidoo)20:01, 11 January 2019 (UTC) - I'm not sure what you mean by the last report, @ [Shabidoo](/wiki/User:Shabidoo). I don't remember ever seeing Canada in the top 10. - When speaking about high-speed rail, average speed is way more important than record speed or maximum operational speed, because that's the number you need to calculate how much time it takes to get from point A to point B. Concerning the Northeast Corridor, there are plans for infrastructure upgrades and new trains, the Avelia Liberty from Alstom, expected to enter service in the 2020s.

They aren't white. Meanwhile, the former group WILL NOT SHUT THE EVERLOVING FUCK UP about how great they think the U.S. is, blissfully unaware that such praise might just be the reason other people (such as the the aforementioned Mexicans and Latinos) keep trying to move here.

It is too simplistic to label people who oppose (illegal) immigration as racists and xenophobes. Remember the law of supply. Higher supply of labor means lower wages.

[AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 18:28, 11 January 2019 (UTC) - As far as I know, the terms 'illegal' and 'undocumented' are equivalent in the context of immigration, though the latter is less negative. It is important to note that how the question is phrased can affect the answer. That's just a fact one learns from statistics. - What I learned is that Americans generally support legal immigration and oppose illegal immigration. Most support a pathway to citizenship for illegal migrants already in the country and want non-US citizens to prove their legal status before getting hired. A majority thinks it is important or essential for migrants to be fluent in English. About equal numbers of people support prioritizing high-skilled immigrants vs. family reunion immigrants. An overwhelming majority agree that illegal immigration is a serious problem. [Nerd](/wiki/User:Nerd)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Nerd)) 18:37, 11 January 2019 (UTC) - with reducing illegal immigration (im answering here rather than above - no clear point to interject) - as i understand it some industries cannot function without illegal/undocumented immigrants and that most illegals are as a result of expired visas. is the problem less 'illegal' immigration and more that there are problems with the visa process removing the legality of workers that are necessary to the economy? (i know nothing of the processes involved, just thinking out loud) if companies are fined for employing people that are necessary to a particular industry, who does these jobs if legit immigrants and citizens are not doing them? and whats the incentives for the status quo? if some system is in place for those whose visas have expired to stay in country legitimately, would they just find better paid work else where? seems like we've been discussing these kinds of workers for years but cheap fruit seems to trump decent pay and conditions for a solution to appear. at least with a wall, its ineffectiveness would be desirable while claiming you solved a problem that everyone wants to exist. if only it the message it sent wasnt so fucking awful. - you could just do what we brits do with unemployment figures - redefine the terms until the numbers look acceptable [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 18:57, 11 January 2019 (UTC) - @ [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)Careful!

The reason we don't see as many sightings with all our devices is...first of all...there are no ghosts or alien visits and secondly, its very easy now to identify a doctored image these days, making what once easy to pull a fast one on stupid people with fake images, pretty difficult task now (though disturbingly at the same time image-fakers are getting better and may soon be able to fake-images with image manipulation techniques very difficult to spot).

Dogs are closely related. In fact, we consider them all the same species despite a wide array of morphological forms. It is not controversial to recognize that different breeds maintain different degrees of intelligence. The border collie is universally recognized as one of the most intelligent breeds capable of learning many tasks whereas the beagle is borderline retarded. Dont @ me cuck dog fags. Different dog breeds have been bred for different traits, some being intelligence, others, for instance, smell and hunting. All traits are advantageous to conform to the biological pressures and restraints laid upon them. As for the animal kingdom, we observe a hierarchy of intelligence. Some animals habe little to no recognized intelligence. Sponges and jellyfish do not have brains! But we all can name off the most intelligent non-human animals: Chimps, other apes, pigs, dolphins. Totally uncontroversial. We dont worry about offending the feelings of sponges. In the animal kingdom, intelligence evolved as a consequence of genetics. However, a higher intelligence isn't NECESSARY for success let alone survival. Most animals are not as intelligent as the aforementioned few but are nonetheless just as capable of thriving as well if not better than the intellectually gifted. - sheeet...an ah' wuz gittin' riddy to haff an intelligent discussing... - @Rationaldriver Survey of opinions on the primacy of g and social consequences of ability testing: A comparison of expert and non-expert views.

For example, can you guys give me some examples of non-white countries (non-European descent majority) that are having a lot of immigration from \"non-whites\" since the 20th century? And also, are there any good arguments countering the claim that all other subspecies want to stay with their own kind, but humans are the only ones to significantly mix people who evolved from such diverse backgrounds into a collective? Do any other species do this especially other primates? Also is there a good argument that addresses the claim white people deserve a homeland like all people do?

I'm not a biologist, but homo sapiens doesn't have any subspecies. A population would have to be geographically isolated for a very long time and then present morphological differences from the rest of the species. A deme, however, does not need to show morphological differences, but it can exist as an semi- or fully-isolated population. Demes account for all diversity we see in homo sapiens. To make a subspecies distinction you'd have to provide evidence of homo sapiens with different bone structure or organ structure or something like that. - With that out of the way, to the actual question we go. Beyond the fact that humans mixing with humans isn't covered by your question (humans mixed demes, not subspecies), there even exists cross-species breeding. The mule is a great example. When a donkey and a horse love each other very much, though they are different species and the Donkulets and the Equitagues are at war and their love is illicit, they can make a mule by breeding. The Liger and the Tigon are also good examples. So yeah, mules. Their existence is a good argument against the claim that subspecies want to stay with their own kind.

Their main argument is that CinemaSins mistakes nitpicking for actual analysis, and hides behind the \"satire\" label in order to get away with it, like a non-political version of any number of edgelords (\"we're not really obnoxious nerds who obsess over everything that so much as resembles a plot hole even if it's actually not when you look at the bigger picture, we're parodying those sorts of assholes!\"). Their concern is that, for many people whose first exposure to movie analysis comes through CinemaSins, they will think that that's what being a critic is supposed to be, causing them to either embrace those attitudes or write off all film criticism and analysis in general. More broadly, I've also seen some describe CinemaSins as reflective of bigger problems with internet film criticism in general, feeling that it just marks the next evolution of the \"angry critic\" shows (The Nostalgia Critic, The Angry Video Game Nerd, Zero Punctuation, and their many ripoffs) that first started proliferating in the 2000s; CinemaSins took that style and made it palatable for the mainstream by cutting back on the F-bombs and the vulgar humor.

My attempt to make sense of it is that they think of everything as \"one\" or made of the same thing. I picture it like the universe is made of clay and that what looks like anything made of this \"clay\" as dying is really just the form that is passing away. On some level I guess it's true since energy can't be destroyed and the molecules and bonds of the body break down, dissipate and interact with others. But I can't shake the feeling like there is some gaping hole in ppithat, but I can't put my finger on it. My thoughts are that it's just another way to make death seem less scary.

Likewise, the \"soul\" could theoretically exist but still be unable to persist past death, or unable to leave the body post mortem, or even merely reincarnate rather than travel to an afterlife of any kind.

Both places where arranged marriage in one form or another is common. It is always a business/family/class/caste/honor arrangement. True, in most rich families and some middle/lower class families, parents might consider comparability and the happiness of their children. However you have to be lucky to be rich or parents with that mind-set. There is very little endearing about arranged marriages. Most women have no idea what is about to happen to them and in all too many cases if they resist they are maritally raped. In India many men are as uncomfortable around their wives the first years as their wives are partly afraid of their husbands. In the transaction, women in India become a part of the man's family/household. That means in many cases free-slave-labor for the husband and mother-in-law. Violence is well known in a lot of arranged marriages, the wife is often isolated, lonely and unable to stand up to the problems she faces. A few friends of mine in the milk case have things a little different. The wife stays with her family (happily) and she visits her husband once a month or so. My friend had heart burn every time he met her as he doesn't know her, just has sex with a woman who doesn't want to and then gives her a disingenuous present and asks her to call him when she gets pregnant. He hates every part of it and reserves his sexual energy for prostitutes. What you see mostly via media, cinema, fiction is the arranged marriage of the rich. Things can be very different that way. For the lowest class things are pretty grim and I really don't think you're well informed about the realities of arranged marriages cause a few claims you've made are bloody crazy. A mentally disabled woman getting a chance at marriage where she might not have outside arranged marriage? Mentally ill woman become spinsters? Mentally ill women prefer to become a property of her husbands family, likely experience marital rape (with even less idea what is going on in the bedroom) experience isolation and removal from her family ... rather than possible happiness with a non-arranged marriage, or barring that, no marriage at all? A lot of arranged-marriage-wives (and husbands) would be quite jealous. The last thing a mentally disabled person needs is that kind of sexual-shock, isolation and loneliness. Except for the rich/upper-class, I didn't know a single Indian or Iranian guy in an arranged marriage who was happy. Those from love-marriages? Usually pretty happy. Wives treated better, less isolation, more caring sex, more equality in the marriage, loving environment for children etc. It's the obvious choice. It's like comparing caramel with rancid meat.

First off, divorce in arranged marriages requires legal grounds - no one is \"trapped.\" Unlike Western \"no-fault\" which requires no basis whatsoever. Secondly, as hinted at above, it's a question of societal and community interests taking precedence over individual choice, and individual freedom, which is the basis of Western abortion and gay marriage laws. Yet some of you tried to force me into an arranged marriage with health insurors just yesterday based on some notion of community responsibility. You give me the choice to get butt fucked, have an abortion, or marry whoever I love, yet on something as personal as having health insurance or not, you tell me I have a responsibility to the community that overrides my personal decisions, in essence saying \"Fuck you.\" Well fuck you too I say, and your hypocracy. - Rob I am honestly quite concerned for you. You must be going through a real rough patch. Everything you accuse of us is something that you subsequently and even previously have done. The logic and reason in your posts are breaking down and some of the things you say are just frightening. take 10 deep breaths and try to read this discussion from a dispassionate neutral point of view and ask yourself through the medium of critical thinking, how reasonable some of your comments are.
