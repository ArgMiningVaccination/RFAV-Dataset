Microanalytical 100 Years Ago: 1906 The 1906 Throop Institute Bulletin notes that the Shop and Laboratory Fee for Biology, payable at the beginning of each term, is $1.00. This was in addition to annual tuition fee of $85. The Biology faculty in 1906 was Professor of Biology JosephGrinnell, and Lecturer Ernest Bryant Hoag. Grinnell was a noted mammalogist and ornithologist who later made important contributions to ecology and field biology; Grinnell Mountain in the San Bernardino Range is named after him. 75 Years Ago: 1931 In May, 1931 the then three-year old Division of Biology lost one of its early members in a tragic accident. Professor Karl Belar, who joined the Division in 1929 from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin, died in an automobile accidentnear Victorville, on a trip to the California desert that he had come to love. He was a world-renowned cytologist of theprotozoans, studying what we would call now chromatin dynamics. At the time of his death he was 35 years old. The biochemist Hugh Huffman was hired as an assistant professor in 1931, and remained on the faculty as an assistant professor until 1943. His specialty was calorimetric measurements of biologically important molecules. He left the Institute in 1943 to establish a laboratory of thermodynamics at the U.S. Bureau of Mines, in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. 50 Years Ago: 1956 From Biology 1956, the 1956 Annual Report:\"In addition to 20 regular members of the faculty [there were] eight Research Associates and 85 Postdoctoral Research Fellows. There were 16 undergraduate students in the biology option and 25 graduate students working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Division.\" \"The virologists and biophysicists of the Division are now moved into the newly completed Church Laboratory and for the first time have adequate facilities for their research.\" \"Investigations of gene nature and gene function continue to be carried out on a variety of organisms: viruses, bread mold, corn, fruit fly and several other plants and animals... A problem that is currently receiving much attention by geneticists inseveral laboratories is the so-called fine structure of the gene. It seems probable that in all organisms primary information is carried in nucleic acid molecules in the form of sequences of four subunits called nucleotides...\" 25 Years Ago: 1981 From the CALTECH Biology Annual Report 1981: \"1980-81 was year of transition for the Division of Biology. Professor Leroy Hood took over the Division Chairman's responsibilities in, September, 1980... Lee faces the challenges of finding funding for new programs in an era ofbudget-cutting...\" \"In January, 1981, we welcomed Mary Kennedy, who became Assistant Professor of Biology... In the fall of 1981, Barbara Wold, who completed her Ph.D. here in 1978, will return as Assistant Professor of Biology.\" \"In 1981 we lost two senior members of our faculty. Professor James Bonner retired at the end of the academic year, after more than 50 years of association with the Division of Biology as student and faculty member... On March 10, 1981, ProfessorMax Delbr\u00fcck passed away after a long and arduous illness.\"4 Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience, Ralph Adolphs , has joined the Biology Division while maintaining his initialappointment in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division.His laboratory investigates the neural underpinnings of humansocial behavior, pursuing questions such as: How do werecognize emotion from facial expressions? How do we makesocial judgments about other people? How do we look atpeople's faces (how do we move our eyes when looking atthem)? How do we make decisions that are influenced byemotion? How do we remember emotional events in our lives?How do we make moral judgments about what is right andwrong? These questions are being addressed using a variety of techniques: (i) studying the impairments following specific brain damage in neurological patients; (ii) recording electricalactivity from the brains of neurosurgical patients; (iii) probingthe behavior of people with neuropsychiatric diseases such asautism and Williams syndrome; and, (iv) investigatingbehavior and brain activations in normal individuals withregard to social cognition. Professor Dianne Newman has joined the Biology Division while maintaining her initial appointment in the Geological and Planetary Sciences Division. Bacteria have had and continue to have major impact on the chemistry of ourenvironment. Dianne's approach includes genetic andmolecular analysis of organisms that affect the production anddissolution of minerals. By understanding how existingorganisms metabolize iron, for example, she hopes to betterinterpret the signatures that early life scrawled into thegeologic record. Many of her favorite microbes develop intobiofilms, with strata of individualized physiology. She andher group have developed novel ways of studying biofilms,structures crucial to microbial function and pathogenesis. Bythinking about microbes from a geological perspective they have gained new insight into what might be the ancestral roles of microbial-produced antibiotics. 5 FERGUSON AWARD , 2005 - 2006 Meyerowitz Bingol Schuman Dr. Baris Bingol is the winner of the Ferguson Award for the 2005-2006 academic year. This award goes to the student who is judged by the faculty to have produced the best Ph.D. thesis over the past year. Dr. Bingol performed his graduate studies in the laboratory of Professor Erin Schuman. His thesis work focused on the regulation of synaptic function by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway. He used a combination of biochemical, molecular biological and imaging techniques to demonstrate thata multi-protein cellular machine, the proteasome, moves into neuronal synapses when synapses are stimulated. The proteasome is responsible for the degradation of most cytoplasmic proteins.

McDonnell Foundation National Alliance for Autism Research National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression National Institute of Mental HealthNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeNational Science FoundationPfeiffer Foundation Summary : Our laboratory investigates the psychological and neural bases of emotional and social processing, usinga number of different approaches. Some studies focus at the psychological level, using behavioral data from healthy people to make inferences about how emotion modulatesmemory, attention, or conscious awareness. Some of thesemeasures are quite technically innovative and have beendeveloped in our lab: for instance, measuring peoples' eyemovements as they interact socially with one another. A second approach uses neuroimaging to investigate the neural mechanisms behind emotional andsocial processing. The studies ask how the structure andfunction of the brain, in either health or disease,contributes to domains such as face processing or rewardlearning. A third approach studies the performances, and the brains, of special populations. At Caltech, we havebeen recruiting people with agenesis of the corpuscallosum to investigate the functional consequences ofdisruption in long-range connectivity. This work isspearheaded by visiting associate Lynn Paul, and involvescollaborations with Michael Tyszka and Professor JohnAllman. In collaboration with Joe Piven at the Universityof North Carolina, we have also been studying people withautism, as well as their first-degree relatives (the parents).We are beginning to recruit people with autism locally at Caltech as well. At the University of Iowa, we have ongoing collaborations that involve neurologicalpopulations with focal brain lesions, and that involveneurosurgical populations in whom we can recordintracranially. The two primary aims of the research are to understand how emotion contributes to aspects of humansocial behavior and, in so doing, to help with the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric illnesses thatinvolve dysfunctional social behavior. A major focus hasbeen on two brain structures: the amygdala, and theprefrontal cortex, both structures known to participate inemotion and social cognition. We are interested in how these structures modulate memory for emotional events, how they modulate allocation of attention to emotionalstimuli, and how they guide decisions about options whoseoutcomes have emotional value. One particularly activearea of development is to better understand how amygdalaand prefrontal cortex interact, and how they interface withother brain structures that also participate in emotionalprocessing. To this end, we are developing methods foranalyzing the structural and functional connectivity of thehuman brain. The studies involve Caltech collaborators from diverse backgrounds. Experiments on decision-making and reward-related learning involve faculty in the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences who applycomputational models to the analysis of human decision-making, such as Professors O'Doherty, Camerer, Rangel,and Bossaerts. Experiments on how emotion contributesto moral decisions even include faculty with backgroundsin philosophy, such as Professors Quartz and Woodward.In the Biology Division, we are collaborating withProfessor John Allman on a variety of projects, and theinvestigations of the connectivity of the brain involveMichael Tyszka, Caltech's MR physicist. 1. Huang, Fulvia Castelli,Ralph AdolphsThe role of the human amygdala in real social interactions remains essentially unknown, although it isknown from studies using artificial social stimuli(photographs of faces) to be critical for emotionalprocessing and social cognition. We have recently studieda rare patient with complete amygdala lesions at Caltech,in a task in which she has to interact with another person. We monitored eye gaze during this experiment. The patient showed a severe reduction in direct eye contact inconversations with real people, together with an abnormalincrease in gaze to the mouth. These findings areconsistent with a hypothesized role for the amygdala inautism and open up new directions for quantifying socialcognition and behavior in humans.26 Figure 1: Damage to the amygdala impairs direct eye contact in conversations with real people. During a faceto face conversation, a rare patient with complete andfocal bilateral amygdala damage made almost no fixationsto the eyes and almost exclusively fixated the mouth (a). Incontrast, a group of age , gender , and IQ matchedcontrols displayed normal fixations to the eyes during realconversation. Color indicates amount of gaze (Red: high; Blue: low). 2. Facial categories do not attract attention F. Moradi 1, R. Adolphs, S. Shimojo2 Recent studies suggest that some facial categories such as negative expressions that are not perceived nonetheless activate sub-cortical regions and amygdala.This unconscious pathway is suggested to direct attentiontoward ecologically significant categories so they aresubsequently seen. However, it remains unclear whether itis stimulus features or emotion categories that are responsible for these effects. In order to investigate this issue, we examined whether or not categories guideattention in visual search among morphed faces. We independently manipulated the distance of the stimuli in feature and in category space by positioning facemorphs relative to category boundaries. Morphsequidistant in feature space are perceived as different ifthey span the category boundary, a phenomenon known ascategorical perception. If facial categories rather than low-level image differences attract attention, then search timeshould depend more on the perceived difference betweentarget and distracters than on how far apart they are in the morph continuum. Search displays comprised 4-16 faces, all but one of which were identical. We measured thereaction time that it took observers to report the location ofthe odd face. We found that search was only slightly faster if the target differed from distracters in one categorical aspect(identity, expression, or gaze direction), and thiscontribution was small compared to the effect of distancein feature space. Furthermore, a rare patient with bilateralamygdala damage gave results essentially identical tonormal observes (even for fear, which she cannot recognize from facial expressions). These findings argue that search for face categories is serial, and thatdeployment of focused attention in visual search does notdepend on the amygdala, even for fear. 1Computation and Neural Systems, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 2Professor, Division of Biology, Caltech3. Brain organization, social cognition, and emotional processing in agenesis of the corpuscallosumLynn Paul, Warren Brown 1, Mike Tyszka, Matt Leonard, Nao Tsuchiya, Matt Bridgman1, Dirk Neumann2, Ralph the corpus callosum (AgCC) is a congenital condition in which all or part of the corpuscallosum of a fetus does not develop. AgCC in individualswith intact general intelligence and no other majorneuropathology is known as Primary AgCC, a rarecondition studied primarily by Dr. Warren Brown'slaboratory. Neuropsychological testing has revealedmultiple deficits in this population, particularly in the areasof social and emotional cognition. To date we have studied four such patients at Caltech. We have utilized well-established localizer taskswith fMRI to examine functional organization in AgCC, particularly visual field mapping, retinotopy, and tasks that localize fusiform gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and superiortemporal sulcus. In a larger sample of eight adults withPrimary AgCC, we have also measured eye tracking whilethe subjects look at emotional faces, complex scenes, andin visual search tasks. Preliminary eye-tracking results inthree AgCC subjects, indicating unusual patterns of eyemovements when viewing photographs of faces, werepresented at the International Neuropsychological Societyconference in February, 2006. Ultimately, correlation of brain activation findings and behavioral outcomes may provide criticalinsight about the functional mechanisms underlying thesocial-emotional deficits in AgCC. In turn, thisunderstanding may also inform the role ofinterhemispheric transfer and corpus callosumdevelopment in behavioral syndromes that involve similardeficits, such as autism spectrum disorders. 1Fuller Graduate School, Pasadena, CA 2Computation and Neural Systems, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 28 Figure 3: Integrated probabilistic fiber tracking and BOLD fMRI localization in a normal control and AgCC subject. The left and right primary motor areas were localized using a coordinated finger tapping task (A,B,E,F). Probabistic fiber trackingresults are overlaid on coregistered high resolution structural MRI (C,D,G,H). A total of 5000 fibers were traced for eachseed voxel within the motor areas. Exploration of the use of such data as a constraint or prior for connectivity modeling is akey element of this project. Note that in this subject, the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were significantly enlar ged (colpocephaly, visible in axial section in E,G) as were other CSF spaces. 5. Autobiographical memories of moral events Jessica Edwards, Ralph Adolphs Morality, moral rules and moral choices have provided rich fodder for philosophers, psychologists and others. Moral judgments play a key role in many of our daily social interactions. However, the neurosciencebehind moral decision-making is not yet well understood.This project investigates how we recollect moralautobiographical events and how we make moraljudgments about them. Using a cued recall protocol inwhich subjects are given specific words (\"tell me about thetime you felt most guilty\"), we have collected nearly 800moral memories from 100 local, healthy, adult subjects(ages 40-60). In addition, these subjects have been broadlycharacterized, allowing us to examine the possible associations between neuropsychological profiles (such as personality traits) and specific types of memories.Currently we are developing a searchable database of themoral memories that they generated, includingindependent ratings of the moral choices in each memory.This database will facilitate the selection of moralmemories to use subsequently as stimuli in a variety ofprojects investigating the role of moral events in memory,decision-making, and other aspects of social cognition.6. Deficit in parafoveal processing of negative emotions following bilateral amygdala damageNaotsugu Tsuchiya, Ralph AdolphsFor more than a decade, we have been characterizing a rare patient, SM, who has fairlycircumscribed and selective damage to bilateral amygdala.A recent study of SM's gaze revealed a highly abnormalovert attention to faces: she showed a dramaticallyreduced fixation to the eye region of faces (Adolphs et. al . (2005), Nature ). Because the eye region contains the most useful information for discriminating fear from otheremotional expressions (Smith et. al . (2005), Psychological Science ), SM's deficit in recognizing fearful expression may be due to her failure to fixate the eye region of faces.Indeed, when instructed to look at the eyes, SM was able to recognize fear. This still leaves us with a puzzle: why does SM fail to look at the eye region of facesspontaneously? One possibility is that SM fails to process salient eye regions when they are located parafoveally - suchnormally salient stimuli may not attract her attention,resulting in less frequent fixations onto the eyes. To testthis hypothesis, we characterized her ability todiscriminate briefly presented facial expressions atparafoveal locations. In each block of ~100 trials, one ofsix basic emotional expressions (happy, sad, fearful, angry,disgusted, and surprised) served as a target. In each trial, two faces (one emotional, and the other neutral; both of the same identity) were briefly presented (40 msec) slightlylateralized on both sides of fixation. Subjects were askedto judge which side showed the target emotional face as30 which the visual information at each location of the image influences the response. The resulting maps of canonicalcorrelation coefficients were smoothed with a Gaussiankernel and thresholded at an overall significance level of p<0.05. We found a significant modulation of autonomicresponses when the eyes or parts of the mouth were revealed. Autonomic emotional reactions to faces appear to be driven most potently by the eyes, consistent with thehypothesis that such emotional responses also contribute toour overt classification of the emotions shown in facialexpressions. 1Computation Neural Systems and Schyns, P.G.

Michael Tyszka, Ralph AdolphsTwo challenges in tracking axonal connections in the brain are to track fibers that are small compared to theimaging resolution, and to track through voxels thatcontain multiple and crossing fibers. Diffusion-weightedimaging with high angular resolution, together withprobabilistic models of apparent diffusion, can helpsurmount these difficulties. However, the relationshipbetween the uncertainty in the apparent diffusionmeasurement and the uncertainty of the fiber trackestimates remains poorly understood. Here we studied the reliability of a probabilistic fiber-tracking (PFT) algorithm by looking at for interhemispheric connections seededin contralateral voxels. We used a statistical measure,Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence, that does not make anyassumption about the shape of the probability distributionto quantify the difference in the probability distributiondescribing paths from a seed regions in the left hemisphereto the right hemisphere and that from the right to the lefthemisphere. The KL divergence is the average amount ofinformation, expressed in number of bits that are wastedwhen encoding the events from one distribution with the optimal code from the other distribution. Thus, if the twodistributions were identical, they would have a KLdivergence of zero, and the larger the KL divergence, thelarger the non-overlap between the two distributions (i.e.,the lower the reliability of the fiber tracking algorithm). Scans were acquired with a horizontal bore 3T Siemens system using a diffusion-weighted EPI sequence(64x64x34 matrix, 3 mm resolution, 72 directions). Theorientation density distribution was estimated using theFMRIB's diffusion toolbox. Seed regions were automatically labeled using the FreeSurfer corticalparcellation package. Custom software was used for theprobabilistic sampling and Runge Kutta line integration. Initial probabilistic fiber tracking estimates were quite reliable. The improved PFT algorithm (PFT+) Runge Kutta integration) resulted in a significant improvement in reliability (p<.001). The KL divergence provides a quantitative approach to studythe reliability of probabilistic fiber tracking results. *Computation and Neural Systems, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 10. Dissociating top-down and bottom-up visual attention in autismDirk Neumann 1, Michael Spezio, Joe Piven2, Ralph AdolphsPeople with autism are impaired in their social behavior, including their eye contact with others, but the processes that underlie this impairment remain elusive.We combined high-resolution eye tracking withcomputational modeling in a group of ten high-functioningindividuals with autism to address this issue. The groupfixated the location of the mouth in facial expressionsmore than did matched controls, even when the mouth wasnot shown, even in faces that were inverted, and mostnoticeably at latencies of 200-400 ms. Comparisons with acomputational model of visual saliency argue that theabnormal bias for fixating the mouth in autism is notdriven by an exaggerated sensitivity to the bottom-up saliency of the features, but rather by an abnormal top- down strategy for allocating visual attention. 1Computation and Neural Systems, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 2Neurodevelopmental Disorders Research Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA 31 A) B) Figure 7 .

McDonnell FoundationThe Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationThe David and Lucile Packard Foundation Summary: We are mainly concerned with brain evolution as revealed through the comparative study of brainstructure and with the neural mechanisms of economic andsocial decision-making. These two interests come together in our investigation of the Von Economo (spindle) neurons of anterior cingulate and fronto-insular cortex. Theseneurons are present only in humans and apes and are muchmore abundant in humans than in apes; they thus representa recent development in hominoid evolution. The VonEconomo cells emerge mainly after birth and are 30%more abundant in the right hemisphere. We think that theVon Economo neurons are part of the circuitry responsiblefor rapid intuitive choice in complex social situations. Another facet of our laboratory research is the incorporation of neuroimaging modalities, particularly MRI, into the analysis of comparative brain anatomy. We are investigating the structure of the brain in anotherhighly social mammal, the African elephant, using MRI.And we are currently working with a new variant of MRI,called diffusion tensor imaging, which can be used tocharacterize the orientation and coherence of white mattertracts in the brain. In order to quantitatively validate thisemerging technology, we are comparing measurements offiber anisotropy from DTI scans with measurements offiber coherence as measured from histological preparationsperformed on the same specimens. 11. A comparative study of the hypothalamus in apes and humans John Allman, D. L. Lei 1, J.R. Korenberg2, supraoptic (SON) of the hypothalamus have long been known tomaintain autonomic functions including fluid andelectrolyte homeostasis, but recent research has also shownthat these nuclei are involved in central processes such associal affiliation and emotional cognition that arefrequently disturbed during aging and in neuropsychiatric disorders. The SON and PVN consist of arginine vasopressin (AVP) - and oxytocin (OT)-synthesizingneurons that send projections to the neurohypophysis. ThePVN also projects to other brain areas including cortex. Inthe present study, we quantified Nissl-stained neuronsusing unbiased stereology in the PVN and SON in human(n=8), gorilla (n=1), and chimpanzee (n=3). In the PVN,the mean total number of neurons was significantly higherin humans (300,000) compared to the chimpanzees(110,000) and gorilla (134,000). In contrast, no significantdifferences were present in the total numbers of neurons inSON among the three species. The results indicate thatSON, a region of the hypothalamus involved in social bonding and nurturing, contains the same number of neurons in humans compared to apes, while the humanPVN, which is involved learning and higher corticalfunctions, including cognition, has almost three times asmany neurons as are present in the apes. We havepreviously reported that there was a 50% reduction in thenumber of PVN neurons in patients of major depressionand bipolar disorders. The greatly expanded population ofPVN neurons in humans is the product of recent evolutionand may be particularly vulnerable to pathology. Byunderstanding variations in the neuronal circuitry related tosocial bonding, emotions, and cognition in human and apes, we may be better able to interpret pathological variation in humans.This work was supported by the McDonnell Foundation. 1Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Howard University, College of Medicine, Washington, DC 2Division Neurogenetics, Pediatrics and Human Genetics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 3Neuroscience, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 12. Von Economo neurons are selectively vulnerable in agenesis of the corpus callosumJason A. Kaufman, Lynn K. Paul 1,2, Kebreten F. Manaye3, Julie R. Korenber45, Patrick R. Hof5, John M. AllmanAgenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) can have significant effects on social and emotional behaviors,including alexithymia (the inability to express one'semotional state), difficulty intuiting the emotional states ofothers, and deficits in self- and social-awareness that canimpair such capacities as humor, comprehension of non-literal or affective language, and social judgment. Onecomponent of the neural network that supports social cognition which may be damaged in AgCC is the von Economo neurons (VENs), which are large spindle-shapedneurons localized to two brain regions that are known to beinvolved in social and emotional cognition: anteriorcingulate cortex (ACC) and fronto-insular cortex (FI).VENs appear late development (emerging mainlypostnatally), are a recent phylogenetic specialization and,as a consequence may be particularly vulnerable to certainneuropathologic conditions. To test the hypothesis that VENs are selectively vulnerable in AgCC, we used stereology to obtain unbiased estimates of total neuron number and VEN number in postmortem brain specimens of two normaladult controls and two adults with isolated callosaldysgenesis. In both ACC and FI, the partial agenesis casedisplayed approximately half as many VENs as in the twonormal controls. In the complete agenesis case the VENswere almost entirely absent. Most importantly, the ratio of33 total neurons to VENs increases dramatically in callosal agenesis (Figure 1). These results indicate that VENs areselectively vulnerable in AgCC. Additionally, completeAgCC appears to be more detrimental to the VENpopulation than partial AgCC, suggesting that even alimited corpus callosum may provide a sustaining connection for the VEN population. We conclude that abnormal brain development can have a particularlyharmful effect on VENs, and that their vulnerability couldhelp to explain some social and emotional deficits that areseen in a variety of brain disorders. 1Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology 2Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary 3Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Howard University College of Medicine 4Department of Human Genetics, UCLA and Cedars Sinai Health System 5Department of Neuroscience, Mount Sinai School of Medicine Figure 1 . Ratio of total neuron number to VEN number in FI (top) and ACC (bottom) obtained from stereology.

White matter pathways in the brain of a gorilla revealed by high-field diffusion MRIJason A. Kaufman, J. Michael Tyszka, Patrick R.Hof 1, John M. Allman Cerebral white matter consists of organized bundles of axons that provide long-distance connections between different cortical regions, and between cortex and sub-cortical grey matter structures. Traditional methodsfor tracing long-distance fiber tracts require terminalinjection procedures or focal lesion and degenerationstudies, both of which are impractical and unethical forcontrolled experimentation in humans and apes.Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging(DW-MRI) is a new, non-invasive means of obtaining dataon brain connectivity. Within any particular voxel, DW-MRI provides a quantitative measure of the coherence ofaxon fibers - a property termed fractional anisotropy - aswell as the principal orientation of those fibers in three- dimensional space. Tract-tracing algorithms use these diffusion data to track fiber pathways from voxel to voxel.We scanned a formalin-fixed gorilla brain using a 9.4 Tesla MR imaging system to obtain ultra-high-resolution structural images (250 \u0001m isotropic voxel size) diffusion 1mm isotropic voxel size). With the high-fieldimaging system, we were able to achieve anatomical scans with 4-6 times the resolution of most structural MRI experiments, and our diffusion-weighted scans have atleast twice the resolution of even the most sophisticateddiffusion-spectrum MRI studies (Figure 1). Visualizationof the principal diffusion direction (Figure 1, right) revealsdistinct white matter fiber tracts that correspond to knownpathways, including the corona radiata, cingulum, internalcapsule, and longitudinal fasciculi, well asinterhemispheric near future wehope to apply probabilistic fiber tractography algorithmsthat will allow us to trace these and other major fiberpathways throughout the brain. We believe that by applying this technology in a comparative context across primate species, quantitative comparisons of the strengthand distribution of cortical connections may reveal distinctspecializations related to the evolution of the human brain. 1Department of Neuroscience, Mount Sinai School of Medicine Figure 1 .A: Axial slice through the ultra-high-resolution structural MR image.

Our behaviors are dictated by ourintentions, but we have only recently begun to understand how the brain forms intentions to act. The posterior parietal cortex is situated between the sensory and themovement regions of the cerebral cortex and serves as a bridge from sensation to action. We have found that ananatomical map of intenti ons exists within this area, with one part devoted to planning eye movements and another part to planning arm movements. The action plans in thearm movement area exist in a cognitive form, sp ecifying the goal of the intended movement rather than par ticular signals to various muscle groups. Neuroprosthetics . One project in the lab is to develop a cognitive-based neural prosthesis for paraly zed patients. This prosthetic system is designed to record the electrical activity of nerve cells in the posterior parietal cortex ofparalyzed patients, interpret the patients' intentions from these neural signals using computer algorithms, andconvert the \"decoded\" intentions into electrical control signals to operate external devices such as a robot arm, autonomous vehicle or a computer. Recent attempts to develop neural prosthetics by other labs have focused on decoding intended handtrajectories from motor cortical neurons. We have concentrated on higher-level signals related to th e goals of movements. Using healthy monkeys with implanted arrays of electrodes we recorded neural activity related to the intended goals of the animals and used this signal toposition cursors on a computer screen without the animalsemitting any behaviors. Their performance in this task improved over a period of weeks. Expected value signals related to fluid preference, or the expected magnitude orprobability of reward were also decoded simultaneously with the intended goal. For neural prosthetic applications, the goal signals can be used to operate co mputers, robots and vehicles, while the expected value signals can be used to continuously monitor a paralyzed patient's preferencesand motivation. Movable probes . In collaboration with Joel Burdick's laboratory at Caltech, we have developed a system that can autonomously position recording electrodes to isolate andmaintain optimal quality extracellular rec ordings. It consists of a novel motorized microdrive and control algorithm. Th e microdrive uses very small piezoelectric actuators that can position electrodes with micron accuracy over a 5 mm operating range. The autonomouspositioning algorithm is designed to detect, align, andcluster action potentials, and then command the microdrive to move the electrodes to optimize the recorded signals. This system has been shown to autonomously iso late single-unit activity in monkey cortex. In collaboration with Yu-Chong Tai's lab and the Burdick lab, we are now developing an even more compact system that uses electrolysis-based actuators designed to independently move a large number of electrodes in a c hronically implanted array of electrodes. Coordinate frames . Our laboratory also examines the coordinate frames of spatial maps in cortical areas of the parietal cortex coding m ovement intentions. R ecently, we have discovered that plans to reach are coded in thecoordinates of the eye. Th is is particularly interesting finding because it means the reach plan at this stage is still rather primitive, coding the plan in a visual c oordinate frame rather than the fine details of torques and forces formaking the movement. We have also discovered thatwhen the animal plans a limb movement to a sound, this movement is still coded in the c oordinates of the eye. This finding indicates that vision predominates in terms ofspatial programming of movements in primates. We have also been examining the coordinate frame for coordinated movements of the hand and eyes. Inthe dorsal premotor cortex we find a novel, \"r elative\" coordinate frame is used for ha nd-eye c oordination. Neurons in this cortical area encode the position of the eyeto the target, the position of the hand to the target, and therelative position of the hand to the eye. A similar relative37 coding may be used for other tasks that involve the movements of multiple body parts such as bimanualmovements. Motion perception . Another major effort of our lab is to examine the neural basis of motion perception. One series of experiments is determining how optic flow signals andefference copy signals regarding eye movements are combined in order to per ceive the direction of heading during self-motion. These experiments are helping usunderstand how we navigate as we move through theworld. A second line of investigation asks how motioninformation is used to construct the three-dimensional shape of objects. We asked monkeys to tell us which waythey perceived an ambiguous object rotating. We found anarea of the brain where the neural activity changed according to what the monkey perceived, even though he was always seeing the same stimulus. In other experiments, we have been examining how we rotatemental images of objects in our minds, so called mental rotation. In the posterior parietal cortex we find that these rotations are made in a retinal coordinate frame, and not an object-based coordinate frame, and the mental image of theobject rotates through this retinotopic map. Local field potentials . The cortical local field potential (LFP) is a summation signal of excitatory and inhibitory dendritic potentials that has recently become of increasinginterest. We report that LFP signals in the s accade and reach regions provide information about the direction ofplanned movements, as well as the state of the an imal; e.g., baseline, planning a s accade, planning a r each, executing a saccade, or executing a reach. This new evidence provides further support for a role of the parietalcortex in movement planning. It also shows that LFPs can be used for neural prosth etics application. Since LFP recordings from implanted arrays of electrodes are more robust and do not degrade as much with time compared tosingle-cell recordings, this application is of e normous practical importance. fMRI in monkeys . We have su ccessfully performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments in awake, behaving monkeys. This development is important since this type of experiment is done routinely in humans and monitors the changes in blood flow during different cognitive and motor tasks. However, a direct correlation of brain activity with blood flow cannot beachieved in humans, but can in monkeys. Thus, thecorrelation of cellular recording and functional MRIactivation in monkeys will provide us with a b etter understanding of the many experiments currently beingperformed in humans. A 4.7 Tesla vertical magnet formonkey imaging has recently been installed in the newImaging Center in the Broad building. We are using this magnet, combined with neural recordings, to examine thecorrelation between neural activity and fMRI signals. 14. Dynamics of context modulations the \"reach\" networkM. Brozovic, A. Gail, R.A. AndersenThe anti-reach task is well suited for studying how context influences the dynamics of sensorimotor transformations. In the anti-reach task the spatial sensoryinput is kept the same, while a colored context cue instructs the animal to r each either toward (pro-reach) or away (anti-reach) from the visual target. Our neuralnetwork study is based on the experimental evidence that shows that the neurons in the parietal reach region (PRR)predominantly encode the position of the motor goal asopposed to the position of the visual cue. F urthermore, the motor goal representation in PRR is delayed by ~60 ms in anti- compared to pro-reaches, implying the need for an additional step of cortical processing. The time dynamics of the contextual motor planning provides evidence for a recurrent network. In neural network simulations we find that a sensorimotor network for reaches (visual areas -> parietal reach region (PRR) -> downstream areas) works mainly in a feed-forward fashion for pro-reaches. The movement goalcorresponds to the visual cue location and there is no need for a transformation. However, for anti-reaches the neuralnetwork strongly depends on feed back projections. Anatomically this feedback may be derived either from within PRR or from areas downstream of pathways bring in the context information needed to update the motor plan in PRR. 15. Selection of targets and active disregard of irrelevant information in monkey LIP and SEFM. Campos, B. Breznen, R.A. AndersenUsing asynchronous presentations of a target and distracter in a s accade ta sk, we believe we have uncovered two important components of the neural mechanism oftarget selection, including som e evidence for the active disregard of irrelevant information. In a study of theneural representation of objects in oculomotor structures prior to learning an object-based task, we used a paradigm in which objects were presented, but were irrelevant fortask completion. We recorded single-unit activity from cortical areas SEF and L IP in two monkeys during this variant on the memory-guided saccade task, in which adistracter stimulus (one of two green polygonal ob jects) was presented prior to the cue stimulus (small while dot), which was briefly flashed. The distracter persisted until just before the signal for the monkey to saccade to theremembered location of the spatial cue. The location ofthe target and distracter were each chosen randomly from a set 42 peripheral locations covering the visual field out to17 deg in all directions. Neither of the monkeys hadprevious exposure to any tasks in which the distracterstimuli (objects) were relevant. Many LIP neurons (26%, 31/120), showed spatially tuned responses to both thedistracter and cue pres entations, though the distracter response was transient (100%, 31/31), and the cue res ponse was maintained (84%, 26/31), throughout the memory period. Thus, in agreement with many published findings,LIP responds transiently to all flashed stimuli, but38 selectively maintains representations of intended eye movement targets. Many SEF neurons respond in a s till more selective manner, most (24%, 40/165), res ponding selectively only to the cue, and not responding to the distracter. Surprisingly, some (9%, 15/165), SEF ne urons responded only to the distracter, and were silent during thepresentation of the cue. These SEF responses could bethought to label the task r elevance of the target and distracter stimuli. Another class of SEF neuronsresponded to both the cue and distracter, but both of these responses tended to be transient, perhaps marking the passage of time in an event-based manner (Campos et al , 2005). Taken together, we find that, first , frontal cortex labels relevant and irrelevant stimuli, and second, parietal cortex selectively maintains the spatial representations required for planning behavior. These are im portant components of target selection when various stimuli arepresented at different times. monkeys has been found to encode impending decisions regarding the spatial goals of movements. The present study addresses the encoding of non-spatial decisions between two effectors instead of two locations in the sp ace. In other words, the decision concerns ' how' rather than 'where.' We examined PPC activity while monkeys chose to acquire a target either by saccading or reaching in theabsence of direct instructions specifying the effectors. The monkey was seated in front of a board with an array of buttons, each containing a red and a green LED. At thebeginning of the trial, both the green and red LEDs in the central button were turned on and the monkey was required to fixate and touch it. Then both the red and green LEDs in a peripheral button were turn on simultaneously, and themonkey was required to continue fixating and touching thecentral fixation spot until it disappears (GO signal). After 600 ms of cue duration, the green (red) LED was turn off and only the red (green) remained on in 25% of trials,instructing a saccade (reach) after delay. In the remaining50% of the trials, both peripheral LEDs extinguished, and the monkey could decide to either shift gaze to the locationof the peripheral target while continuing to touch the centerspot, or keep fixation of the center spot but move the arm to reach to the target. In these free choice trials, the monkey was rewarded only if his choice matched thecomputer's choice and computer biased its choice against the monkey's choice sequence. This competitive algorithm provided an effective method to b alance the m onkey's bias for saccade/reach selection. We recorded 33 lateral intraparietal (LIP) cells and 68 parietal reach region (PRR) cells from two macaque monkeys, and 16 LIP cells (48%) and 35 PRR cells (51%) exhibited significant effector-specific selectivity for the monkeys decisions, with LIPselective for decisions to saccade and PRR selective fordecisions to reach. For those eff ector-selective cells, the activity in saccade and reach choice trials began to separate at variable times, spanning from 20 ms after cue offset to movement onset. Our results suggest that the PPC also encodes non-spatial decisions regarding effectors cho ice,and decision making appears to be a progressive and involve multiple and at least partially non-overlapping circuits in the PPC. 17. Local field potentials represent context-specific movement goals in the posterior parietal R.A. AndersenWe performed anti-reach experiment to of sensorimotortransformations in the posterior parietal cortex. Wedetermined the relative timing of neural activity r elated to visual sensory processing and reach movement planning inthe parietal reach region (PRR) of monkeys. In aninstructed-delay, center-out reach task the monkey had either to r each to a memorized peripheral target position (PRO-reach) or to a diametrically opposed position (ANTI) while keeping central ocular fixation. PRO- and ANTI- trials were pseudo-randomly interleaved and indicated tothe monkey from the beginning of the trial by a color cue. We analyzed PRR single-unit spiking activity and local field potentials (LFP) with respect to spatio-temporal response selectivity. We have shown previously that theensemble spiking activity encoded the sensory informationon the cue position weakly and only during a short period of cue visibility. From the end of the visual cuepresentation and during the memory period therepresentation of the reach goal was increasingly prevalentin the ensemble spiking activity. This means that PRRencodes context-specific sensorimotor transformations. Wenow show that in PRR LFPs in the frequency range above 15 Hz, but not below, are spatially tuned, and that their tuning also reliably represents the reach goal during thememory period, regardless of whether the monkeys are planning a PRO or ANTI reach. In contrast to the spike activity the visual cue location is not represented in the ensemble LFP spectral amplitudes, even during cuevisibility. This is mostly likely due to the small fr action of single PRR neurons that were tuned for the visual cueduring the cue period in our data, and the integrative effect of LFP over a large number of neurons. LFPs in PRR exclusively encode the specific information on themovement plan, regardless of the context. Together withtheir superior properties for stable long-term rec ordings, this confirms the suitability of LFPs for the use inneuroprosthetic devices. 18. fMRI during goal-directed movement planning in normal and spinal cord injured subjectsH.K. Glidden, N. Yozbatiran *, D.S. Ri zzuto, S.C. Cramer*, R.A. Andersen It area (SMA) may be good locations for the implantation of a cortical brain-machine interface. This study evaluates the feasibility of using functional magnetic resonance imagined (fMRI) and imagined movements to localize poten tial neuroprosthetic implant sites in paralyzed patients and aid in ne urosurgical planning. Spinal cord injured (SCI) patients planned andexecuted imagined limb movements towa rds r emembered39 visual locations in a modified memory r each task. Across five SCI subjects scanned thus far (time since inj ury: jects: C6/C7), we find that many of the same brain areas are activated compared to normal controls. With this limited sample size, we also notice a shift in the left h emispheric- laterality for imagined right leg movements in normal subjects towards a right hemispheric-laterality in SCIsubjects, particularly in PMd and SMA. Add itionally, PPC activity appears to be more bilateral in SCI subjectsthan in normal subjects performing the same task. Since imagined leg and arm movement planning activate highlyoverlapping areas with real reach planning in normal subjects, it is possible that in these SCI patients a more normal pattern of brain activation is maintained by use ofthe upper limbs, exercise and rehabilitation therapy, etc.Another concomitant study of the same SCI patientsaddresses changes in brain activation patterns during attempted knee movement before and after intensiveexercise therapy. These studies address the question ofwhether there are different patterns of reorganization inPPC, PMd and SMA compared to pr imary motor and somatosensory areas. We continue to recruit and scan normal and SCI subjects and to characterize and correlate activity patterns with lesion level, time since injury, age,and other clinical factors. *UC Irvine Medical Center, Orange, CA 19. Local field potentials as a control signal for brain machine interfacesE.J. Hwang, S. Musallam, H. Scherberger, R.A. AndersenIn the posterior parietal reach region (P RR) of macaque monkeys, both the spike firing rates and the local field potentials (LFPs) in the ~20 Hz band are directionallytuned during the memory period of the memory guided reach task. Furthermore, LFPs at the ~10 Hz band aremodulated by behavioral state, i. e., the LFP power at ~10 Hz becomes weaker during the memory period compared tothe movement or fixation periods . The directional tuning and behavioral state dependent modulation suggest that LFPs can be used as a robust control signal for the controlof a brain machine interface (BM I). To test this idea, we examined LFPs recorded from chronically implanted electrode arrays in PRR and compared the tuningproperties from the arrays with those from acute single- electrode recordings. Consistent with the results from the acute recordings, LFPs from the chronic arrays were directionally tuned mainly at the ~20 Hz band during thememory period and LFP power at ~10 Hz was strongly modulated by behavioral state. More interestingly, thetuning strength of the LFPs at ~20 Hz was not correlatedwith the tuning strength of th e spike firing rates from the same electrode channel, suggesting that the LFP signal canprovide direction information even when little or no tuning exists in the firing rate of neurons on the same channel.This independent directional tuning of L FPs is an appealing feature for a control s ignal for BMIs since the isolation of neurons from an array is not guaranteed. Weare currently testing the effect of electrode location andelectrode impedance on the tuni ng strength of the LFPs in order to optimize the recording of LFPs for use in a BMI. 20. fMRI of reward context modulation during motor response preparationA. Iyer, I. Kagan, A. Lindner, R.A. AndersenEffects of reward and punishment have been extensively investigated in humans with functional imaging, mostly focusing on subcortical and frontalcortical structures implicated in the immediate processing of task contingencies. These studies are paralleled byelectrophysiological investigations in monkeys, mostlydemonstrating consistent analogies between reward processing in the two species. However, recent recordings in monkeys also showed dependence of activity of singleneurons on reward contingencies in many cortical areas thathave not been directly implicated in the processing ofreward. For example, in delayed response tasks, m onkey parietal areas PRR and LIP exhibit firing rate modulationbased on the expectancy for amount and probability ofreward. The few studies that addressed preparatory activity in humans concentrated mostly on pre frontal and premotor areas. Here, we used event-related fMRI to investigate the effect of expected reward or punishment, contingent on the task performance, in human cortical areas recruited inspatial memory and motor planning tasks. We added areward/punishment context to a variant of the d elayed response task in which subjects had to re member lo cations of spatial cues and use this information for subsequent motor responses, using trackball to perform sequences of \"virtual\" reaches with a cursor. Subjects were given monetary reward or punishment based on their performance, on a tr ial-by-trial basis. The c urrent reward/punishment context for the trial was ind icated shortly before the presentation of the spatial cues. Thememory load and the response complexity were demanding so that performance level would not ex ceed a cer tain level, usually <75% c orrect. We used different combinations of reward/punishment context to dissociate between effects of expected value and motivation. Our preliminary results suggest that besides structures involved in the processing of expected and received reward in humans, s everal other cortical regions exhibit modulation with the reward/punishment context in the early phase of the delay period, i.e., shortly after the presentation of the context and spatial cues. In particular, areas along intraparietal sulcus, in middle frontal gyrus (atthe junction of superior frontal sulcus and pr ecentral sulcus), and precuneus were more activated in trials where possible gain or loss was high, as compared to trials where anticipated gain or loss was small or null. Further experiments will elucidate potential reward m odulation during later phases of delay period activity.40 21. Event-related fMRI in alert behaving monke andmemory saccadesI. A. Lindner, S. Wagner *, R.A. AndersenDelayed (memory) response paradigms have been used extensively in monkey electrophysiology and more recently in human functional imaging studies in order to dissociate visual and motor responses, and to investigatemechanisms of working memory and movement planning.However, the exact relationship between these studies isnot clear due to differences in methods and time-scales. Here we provide a direct comparison between the twospecies with the same tasks and techniques, using a high-field 4.7T vertical MRI scanner for monkeys and a 3Tscanner for humans. Eye movements, reward, timing and other behavioral information (e.g., body or head motion in monkeys) were recorded while subjects made visuallyguided and memory s accades to vis ible or r emembered cues. The pe rformance of the task and the behavioral feedback was controlled in real-time. Additionally it wasnecessary to detect and remove motion-affected periods from the monkey data. Advancing previous m onkey fMRI studies that used block design, we applied event-related analysis of BOLD signal time-courses to delineate responses from different epochs within the task sequence - fixation, cue, delay period, s accade execution, reward expectation and acquisition. In the first experiment we compared res ponses during visually- a nd memory-guided s accades to extract \"cognitive\" signals related to spatial working memory andmotor preparation. In monkeys, prefrontal and par ietal areas, in particular discrete bilateral regions in arcuate sulcus , principal sulcus, cue and memory/preparation activity. The event-related time-courses from thes e areas revealed cognitive d emand- related differential signals seen as a separate peak orelevated activity in the middle and late memory period,distinguishable from the early cue response. Consistentactivation patterns were found in putative functionalhuman homologs, although exact shape and contribution of these signals varied between subjects in both sp ecies. In control experiments we varied the duration of the memory period and the relevance of the cue for subsequent action to further separate sensory cue response from thememory/preparatory processing. Our results demonstratethat dynamics of \"higher-order\" cognitive signals can bedetected in monkeys using event-related fMRI, making it apowerful link between human imaging and m onkey electrophysiology. *Scott Fraser's Lab, Division of Biology, Caltech 22. Dynamical gain fields in MSTd B. Lee, M. Brozovic, B. Pesaran, R.A. AndersenNeurons in the dorsal aspect of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) respond to the focus of expansion (FOE) of the visual image and demonstrate eyeposition gain fields. Previous studies characterized MSTd gain fields as planar, planar component, no planar component, and no gain. Here, we report that MSTd gain fields change their gain-type based upon the retinal input.In the fixed gaze (Fixed) condition, the monkeys fixated at five eye positions, six degrees apart, along the preferreddirection of pursuit. Focus of expansion (FOE) tuning was determined at each of the five eye positions. In this condition, the input signals to MSTd were the expandingvisual stimulus and eye position signals. In a simulated pursuit (Sim) condition, the monkey also fixated at five eye positions while the same stimulus used in the Fixedcondition was dragged across the screen. In this condition,in addition to the expanding visual stimulus and eyeposition signals, there was also laminar motion of theretinal input from the simulated pursuit stimulus. Wefound that 33/73 neurons did not change their gain field- types from Fixed to Sim. This included the neurons thatdid not have gain-fields in both Fixed and Sim (19/73). 40/73 neurons changed their type of gain fields between Fixed and Sim. Through decode analysis (Fisher linear discriminant), we found that eye position was closely tied to a small subpopulation of (14/73) neurons which we call \"eye cells.\" These neurons did not change the type of their gain-fields between the Fixed and Sim conditions. The decode of eye position from the neurons which changedtheir gain was significantly lower. For comparison, thedecode of the focus of expansion was the same for ne urons which did and did not change their gain fields. Weconclude that the dynamical g ain fields associated with MSTd are due to a combination of eye position and theretinal signal input and this mechanism may play a role inself-motion processing. 23. fMRI correlates of human spatial working memory and movement planning in theposterior parietal plays a cr itical role in motor planning a notion that stems mainly from electrophysiological studies in non-human primatesengaging delayed response tasks. Such tasks temporally separate task instructions and motor responses from theintervening memory- and motor planning- phase,permitting the delineation of neuronal contributions toeach of these processes. Recently, similar experimental designs have been applied during fMRI in humans, mainlyfocusing on a putative role of PPC in ret rospective visual memory and/or attention rather than on its role in motor planning. Here we tease apart event-r elated fMRI- responses associated with retrospective vi sual memory and prospective motor planning during the delay period. Ten human subjects performed delayed response tasks in which sequences of virtual \"reaches\" had to beexecuted with a finger-controlled trackball. In the 'delayed reach task' (i) movements were instructed by cues that were presented before the delay period, whereas the 'non-match to sample task' (ii) these cues indicated undesired target locations. The actual motor response in the latter task wasdefined by sample cues that were presented after the delay period: movements should be pe rformed only to new target locations. Thus, r eaches could either be prepared in advance (task i) or be avoided (task ii), while visual memory load (two or four spatial cues) was kept constantacross conditions.41 Significant delay period activity for both tasks was found in PPC, premotor cortex (PM) and period activity wassignificantly modulated by the memory and/or planning load in PPC and PM. Activity r elated to motor planning was mainly confined to the PPC, w here fM RI-responses during the delay differed between the two task conditions: fMRI-responses in the non-match to sample task were significantly larger than in the delayed reach task. In control experiments (n=3), in which the motor res ponse could no longer be predicted by the initial cues (match to sample task), PPC activity was reduced as compared to thedelayed reach and non-match to s ample tasks, again supporting the role of PPC in motor planning. This pattern of activ ity in PPC cannot be explained solely by retrospective visual memory, which was identical across conditions. It rather indicates anadditional involvement of PPC in the planning of upcoming movements while coding for both types of targets relevant for action - those to be acquired and those to be avoided. 24. Online directional control signals in posterior parietal cortexG. Mulliken, S. Musallam, R.A. AndersenPsychophysical and clinical studies in humans point to a role for PPC in rapid online updating and correction of movements. To explore the neural representation of online control signals in primate PPC,we analyzed the correlations of single-neuron activity with four plausible sensorimotor control angles (SCAs) during avisually guided joystick task, including: 1) angle to target in eye coordinates (EYE-to-TGT); 2) angle to cursor in eye coordinates (EYE-to-CUR); 3) angle to target in cursor coordinates (CUR-to-TGT); and, 4) heading angle of cursor (CUR HEAD). To enforce curvature and ensure online control of trajectories, we trained one monkey to use a joystick to guide a cursor on a computer screen around an obstacle andto a target. The monkey initiated a trial by moving awhite cursor (0.9 deg) into a central green target circle (4.4 deg) and fixating a red c oncentric circle (1.6 deg). A fter 350 ms, a blue obstacle circle (10.0 deg) appeared and the target jumped simultaneously to one of eight random peripheral locations (14.7 deg). The obstacle was alignedand equidistant to the initial and end target positions. Themonkey guided the cursor around the obs tacle and into the peripheral target. Once the cursor was within 2.2 deg of the target center for 350 ms, he was rewarded with a drop of juice. If the cursor intersected the obstacle or central fixation was broken, the trial was aborted. We constructed space-time receptive f ields (STRFs) using reverse correlation to assess SCA tuningfor 50 neurons. STRFs typically exhibited unimodal SCAtuning and were largely separable in the SCA-time plane. We classified cells according to which SCA was best encoded. Variance in STRF time slices was used to assessSCA tuning strength as a function of lag time. The time slice with maximal variance was defined as the optimal lag time (OLT) for a particular SCA. The SCA whose maximal variance was significantly larger than all others was defined as the best encoded SCA (bootstrap, p<0.05;t-test). We found that 11 neurons (22%) best encoded EYE-to-TGT, 17 neurons (34%) best encoded EYE-to- (OLT=44ms), 18 neurons (36%) best encoded CUR- to-TGT (OLT=-7ms), and four neurons (8%) best encoded CUR HEAD (OLT=30ms). These results show that during online control of a cursor PPC dynamically encodes both the state of the cursor and the target in eye and cursor- centered coordinates. 25. Neurons in the posterior parietal cortex the amplitude of an impending reachS. Musallam, R.A. AndersenWhen planning a reach, the direction and the amplitude of the reach need to be specified. Surprisingly, a study of motor cortex found that the variation in firing rate due to the amplitude of the movement usually occursduring the movement time and not be fore it (Fu et al ., 1993). Recently, premovement reach amp litude information was found in premotor cortex (Messier andKalaska 2000). Given its role in high-level motor planning, we examined whether amplitude information isalso found in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Twomonkeys were trained to perform memory reaches totargets located at various distances from the fixation point in a 2D plane. Using acute recordings, 63 neurons wererecorded from the parietal reach region (PRR) of M onkey C. Of these, 53 neurons (84%) responded to the memory reach task and how many were direction selective. 45/53(84%) were modulated by the target distance. 22/45 (49%)neurons had distance tuning in the cue period, 31/45 (69%)in the memory period, and 21/45 (47%) in the motorperiod. 32/45 (71%) neurons increased th eir firing rate in response to an increase in the amplitude of the r each in the neuron's preferred direction while 13/45 (29%) ne urons decreased their firing rate. In the second animal (monkeyS), neurons were recorded from an array of 32 electrodes implanted along the medial bank of the intrapar ietal sulcus. From these 32 channels, 21 single units were recorded of which 15 were tuned to the memory r each task. Only 3/15 (20%) of these neurons were modulated byamplitude during the cue period, all 15 were modulated in the motor period and 7/15 (46%) were modulated in the memory period. All the neurons that encoded the amplitude of the reach were directionally tuned. In thesame session, we ran a brain-control experiment using the memory period activity of the seven memory-period tuned neurons to decode the location of eight possible targets at four different directions and two different amplitudes ineach direction. We w ere able to decode the targets with a success rate of 73.7% (chance =12.5%). We conclude that amplitude is encoded in the reach plan in PPC and that goals located anywhere in a 2D plane can be decoded from this region. References Fu, Q.G., Suarez, J.I. and and percept-dependent V1 dimensional objectsZ. Nadasdy, B. Pesaran, R.A. AndersenAmbiguous visual objects enable the study of perception under constant sensory input conditions. Tworhesus monkeys were trained to report the percept of ambiguous structure-from-moti on objects interspersed with unambiguous objects while single-unit responses and LFPwere recorded from the superficial laye r of V1 neurons. In order to elucidate the effects of previous trials on theneuronal responses and perceptual decisions, we varied the duration of inter-trial-intervals (ITIs) between two timescales, a short (ITI<1s) and a long (ITI>2s) time scale. Weestimated the probability with which the firing rate and theLFP spectrum of V1 neurons allow an ideal observer to predict the monkey's perceptual choice. Neuronal responses to zero-disparity (ambiguous) objects were sorted according to the perceptual choices, the type of object inthe preceding trial, and the inter-trial interval. As many as40% of the neurons showed a significant perceptual bias which was dependent on the object presented in theprevious trial and on the duration of ITI. Specifically, forthe majority of biased neurons the firing rate increased during an ambiguous trial following a trial rotating in theneuron's preferred direction after long ITI if the monkeyreported motion consistent with the neuron's preferred direction. In contrast, firing rate was reduced in tr ials preceded by objects rotating in the anti-preferred dir ection following long ITIs when the monkey reported anti- preferred direction motion. Interestingly, this eff ect was reversed under the ITI<1s condition. In both cases themonkey's choices were consistent with the late ne uronal responses; namely, the percept \"froze\" following IT I>1s and \"switched\" following ITI<1s. Early responsescorrelated more with the previous trial while late res ponses showed more correlation with the percept. This suggeststhat perceiving ambiguous objects in one way or another is not merely a by-chance decision but rather is biased by theprimary visual cortex in response to previous exposures. 27. Computing time from space in the parietal reach regionE.B. Torres, R.A. AndersenWe address a new question - is there a difference in PRR cells responses between a motion that requires thinking to solve it, and one that is performed in automatic mode? In complete darkness while fix ating straight ahead two rhesus m onkeys pe rformed inter leaved delayed center-out (DCO) reaches (automatic task) withDCO reaches around obstacles (na\u00efve task) to the sameperipheral targets. We concurrently recorded the responses from PRR neurons with the arm motions. During the1000 ms of memory period 126/144 neurons from bothanimals showed significant differences (t wo-way ANOVA, p = 0.01 ) in mean firing rates and tuning properties when the postural (and) hand paths changed from straight to curved. In addition, during the obstacle condition 117/144neurons continued to change s uch response properties after the spatial path had been resolved but the speed was being planned. Analysis of behavioral data from this period revealed that (1) the arm posture wa s repositioned prior tothe movement in anticipation to the upcoming c urved path, and (2) during the first impulse of the motion therewas fine-tuning of the distance traveled to the first velocitypeak while for each target the time to r each this peak was held constant. We asked if the first significant changes were due to the transformation of the hand goal into a postural plan and the second significant changes were dueto the distance-based speed planning. To this end we added an experiment where the initial change in posturewas enforced so that the postural paths changed relative to those starting from the normal posture but where the s peed profiles did not change. The experimental sequence was DCO-normal, DCO-ob, DCO-normal, DCO-enforced, and DCO-normal. In 33/35 PRR cells there were significant changes in gain when the upcoming postural paths changed both due to the spontaneous postural repositioning in OB-avoidance and to the enforced initial postural change. In29/35 cells, there were significant changes in gain during the OB-condition for distance-based temporal planning. Incontrast for the e nforced-posture case 31/35 cells had no significant changes when there were no required changes in speed profiles. These results suggest involvement of PRRcells in path planning at the postural level and distance- based temporal planning reflected later in the first impulse of the motion. 28. Floating microelectrode arrays for chronic implantationC. Ustun, S. Musallam, D.Rizzuto, C. Pang, Y.C. Tai, R.A AndersenA vital component of many types of Brain- Machine Interfaces (BMI) is a chronically implantable array that can record from neurons that lie near the s urface of the brain or deep within the convoluted structures of the cortex. Development of such an array will be im portant for the development of BMIs and, in particular, neural prosthetics for paralyzed patients. Here we report onmetal-based and silicon-based arrays that satisfy the a bove requirements. We developed a microwire-based array consisting of up to 18 electrodes attached perpendicularly onto a thin ceramic substrate. The array is wired to a connector via aset of fine gold wires enabling it to \"float\" in the cortex, thus preventing the relative motion of the brain with respect to the skull from producing damage to the neural tissue. Arrays with electrodes insulated with Parylene and made from Pt/Ir with lengths of either 1 mm or 8 mmwere implanted in rats. In two rats with 1 mm long probes, single-unit activity was observed in 4/8 and 10/16 channels with addition al channels showing multi-unit activity. In one rat with an 8 mm array extending into the caudate, 10/16 channels showed either single- or mu lti-unit activity. We also observe local field potentials in 15/16channels in the deep array. We also present arrays manufactured using silicon-chip technology. An advantage of this a pproach is that signal processing and wireless communicationelectronics can be integrated directly into the array design, potentially leading to significant decreases in cost andincreases in reliability. Our ma nufacturing technique allows probes to have arbitrary numbers of shanks, shank lengths (up to 10 mm) and contact impedances. The first43 generation array was made with seven shanks spaced 400 \u00b5m apart. Each shank has four contacts spaced 125 \u00b5m apart and has an impedance ranging from 500 kOhms to1.5 M Ohms. The width and thicknesses of the shanks atthe base are 150 \u00b5m each and taper toward a point. The array is designed to penetrate the rat dura (and the primate pia) without breaking. We have tested this array for mechanical integrity in the rat and we plan to implant rats and monkeys in the upcoming months. Publications Andersen, R.A., Musallam, S., Burdick, J.W. and Cham, J.G.

Neural stem cell biology Stem cells are multipotent, cells.In the central nervous system (CNS), neurons, astrocytesand oligodendrocytes the three major cell classes of theCNS are thought to be derived from self-renewing stemcells. In contradistinction to this prevailing view, ourrecent studies in the spinal cord suggest that following theperiod of neurogenesis the majority of progenitor cells donot self-renew, but rather lose neurogenic capacity andbecome restricted to a glial fate. Current work is aimed at identifying genes that control this irreversible switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. An understanding of thismechanism might eventually permit controlled reversionof adult glial cells to a stem cell-like state, which could beuseful for therapeutic purposes. Neural circuitry of behavior We are developing and applying molecular biological toolsto map and manipulate the neural circuitry underlyingemotional behaviors in mice. These studies focus on twodistinct but related states: pain and fear. In the former case, we have identified a novel family of G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs) for neuropeptides, calledMrgs, which are specifically expressed in restricted subsetsof primary nociceptive sensory neurons. Usinghomologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, wehave marked the neurons that express different Mrgs withgenetically-encoded axonal tracers. Remarkably, differentMrg-expressing neurons project to different, and highly specific, peripheral target tissues. We are now engaged ingenetic inactivation or killing of these neurons, as well asgenetic activation, to understand their function. We arealso tracing the higher-order projections of these neuronsinto the brain, to determine the point at which these novel and distinct sensory circuits converge. In a separate project, we have identified genes that are expressed in subpopulations of neurons in thecentral nucleus of the amygdala, which is thought to be amajor output structure that co-ordinates different aspects oflearned fear responses. Using the promoters of thesegenes, we are generating mice in which these neurons canbe reversibly silenced, in collaboration with Henry Lester'slaboratory. The role of these neurons, and the circuits inwhich they participate, in mediating responses toconditioned and unconditioned fearful stimuli, can then beassessed. In parallel with these studies in mice, we are engaged in conceptually similar experiments in the fruitfly,Drosophila melanogaster . Our goal is to identify simple and robust innate behaviors, and then perform unbiased\"anatomical\" and genetic screens to map the neuronalcircuits and identify the genes that control these behaviors.This dual approach will provide an opportunity to integratemolecular genetic and circuit-level approaches tounderstanding how genes influence behavior. The\"anatomical\" screen exploits the availability of \"enhancertrap\" lines, in which the yeast transactivator protein GAL4 is expressed in specific subsets of neurons, and a conditional (temperature-sensitive) neuronal silencer gene(shiberets ) that prevents synaptic transmission. Currently, we have developed assays for an innate avoidanceresponse triggered by an odorant mixture released fromtraumatized flies, as well as for arousal intensity andhedonic valence, two important axes underlying emotionalstates in humans. 29. Identification of genes associated with the neuron to glia developmental transitionBen Deneen, David J. Anderson Development of the central nervous system (CNS) is dependent upon the appropriate spatial andtemporal generation of the three main neural cell types:neurons, differing neuronal cell types generated in theventricular zone has been deciphered, the mechanismsgoverning the temporal switch from neuronal to glialgeneration remain elusive. The goal of my study is toidentify genes that control the transition from neurogenesisto gliogenesis. As a model for this developmental transition we chose to utilize Olig-expressing cells, because the Oliggenes are specifically expressed in the pMN domain of thedeveloping spinal cord during both neurogenic andgliogenic phases of development. In this study we utilizedan Olig2/GFP transgenic mouse in order to prospectivelyisolate Olig2-expressing cells via FACS analysis from45 embryonic spinal cord across this developmental interval (E9.5 though E12.5). Using these methods of cellisolation, we have been able collect sufficient numbers ofcells from each timepoint to generate cRNA probes tohybridize to Affymetrix microarrays. To test the validity of the candidate genes identified in our microarray experiments, we performed in situ hybridization on numerous genes. In particular, we analyzed the expression of several members of a family oftranscription factors, the NF1 genes, which are upregulatedacross this time interval. This family of genesdemonstrates specific spatial expression throughout theventricular zone at E12.5, suggesting that these genescould play a role in the neuron to glia fate switch.Preliminary gain- and loss-of-function studies in the chickneural tube suggest that these genes may indeed functionto promote the onset of gliogenesis. Currently, we areexamining the effects all members of the NF1 family, individually or in combination, have on the onset of gliogenesis through gain-and loss-of-function analysis inthe chick neural tube. 30. and manipulations of Mrgprd+ nociceptive neuronsLiching Lo, Mark J. Zylka, David J. AndersonNociceptors are a large population of afferents that have a high threshold for activation and respondspreferentially to intense, noxious stimuli. Mrgprd is expressed in a subset of pain-sensing nociceptive neurons (~75% of the IB4+ neurons). Mrgprd+ free nerve endings terminate exclusively in the epidermis and do not innervateany other cutaneous structures, such as glands,Merkel cells, or Meissner corpuscles. Mrgprd+ fibers donot innervate any other tissues in the body. In the dorsalhorn, Mrgprd+ and CGRP+ neurons project to distinctlamina layers. Because of the exclusive projection andinnervation, it is important to know how the brainprocesses these specific afferent inputs and how thisdedicated projection compares to other projections withdifferent target specificities. Tracing the second or thirdorder projections should provide us some answers. To achieve that, we have used gene targeting in ES cells to generate strains of mice in which the coding region ofMrgprd was replaced with Cre recombinase or thetetracycline-dependent transcriptional activator (rtTA). Tocircumvent the the tetO-WGA (a lectin, wheat germ agglutinin) ortetO-DTA (diphtheria toxin A) was put downstream ofrtTA in the same orientation in the same targeting cassette.For transneuronal tracing analysis of circuits, the MrgD-Cre mice were crossed with ZW mice (gift from AllanBasbaum) in which excision of the lacZ gene by Cre- mediated recombination initiates expression of the WGA. For cell ablation study, administration of doxycyclineshould induce the expression of diphtheria toxin, resultingin the cell autonomous kill of only the Mrgprd neurons.We have generated and are in the process of analyzingthese mice.31. Molecular specification of motor neuron progenitor cell fate in the CNSAgnes LukaszewiczIn the battle against Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, replacing the degenerating neurons appears to beone of the most promising treatments. For this reason, an improved basic knowledge of motor neurons should aid in the search for a cure. A first step toward this missionwould be to better understand the molecular mechanismsof motoneuron fate specification during development. Todo so, one of the most relevant models comprises aspecific progenitor domain of the central nervous systemventricular zone, in which the process of motor neuronproduction is very well defined: the pMN domain of thespinal cord. Dr. David J. Anderson's lab has been interested for several years in understanding the molecular control ofthe neuron-to-glia switch in this domain. Through these studies, Dr. Anderson's lab has developed the tools to carry out systematic gene expression profiling (GEP)experiments on purified oligodendrocyte progenitors,using Affymetrix microarrays. Preliminary data have beengenerated and candidate genes have been identified.CyclinD1, a positive cell cycle regulator, has beenidentified as specifically expressed in a subset ofprecursors, dynamically regulated during the neuronal toglia transition. This led us to hypothesize that CyclinD1may regulate neurogenesis. The experimental paradigm initially used is the modulation of its level of expression so as to monitor effect on the neurogenesis. CyclinD1 misexpressionspecifically increases the level CyclinD1 inhibitionimpairs neurogenesis. As a conclusion, we demonstratethat CyclinD1, independently of any effects on cell cycle,modulates the generation of MN. We believe thisconstitutes an unexpected result of potential importance forthe field. We are further testing the function of CyclinD1 using mouse-to-chick transplantations, which have beenroutinely done in Dr. Anderson's lab. We will also try to decipher the fundamental regulatory mechanisms by which CyclinD1 could trigger motoneuron fate specification.These studies will contribute to understanding thedevelopment of neuronal progenitor cell capacities, andtheir genetic control. 32. The role of neurosecretory cells in the modulation of Drosophila behavior Timothy Tayler, Anne HergardenAnimals exhibit countless complex and stereotyped behaviors such as aggression, courtship and the fight or flight response. These behaviors are likely generated and modulated by neural circuits. Other than afew simple reflex circuits, relatively little is known abouthow these circuits generate appropriate behaviors.Drosophila exhibits complex behaviors, but are anatomically less complicated and genetically moretractable than many vertebrate model systems. In addition,46 flies have a highly developed set of molecular tools that can used to manipulate and analyze specific cellpopulations. Previous studies have demonstrated thatDrosophila can be used to successfully identify neural correlates underlying complex behaviors such as courtship,olfactory aversion and learning and memory [1] [2] [3]. The goal of this project is to elucidate the connectivity, function, and modulation of circuits thatunderlie Drosophila behavior. To address this, we are attempting to manipulate neuropeptidergic neurons in thecontext of behavior. Neuropeptides are an important classof signaling molecules that are involved in a variousaspects of animal physiology and behavior [4]. To gaingenetic control over neuropeptide-producing neurons, wehave identified the putative regulatory regions of 21neuropeptide genes and have generated transgenic animalsthat will express the GAL4 protein under these promoters.The Gal4/UAS system allows for the expression of any of a large variety of transgenes in a spatial and temporally controlled manner. We are currently in the process ofvalidating the expression patterns of these Gal4 lines whilesimultaneously using fluorescent reporters to characterizethese neuropeptidergic neurons anatomically. In order tounderstand the role of these neuropeptidergic neurons inbehavior, we will use genetic tools that will allow us toablate, silence, or activate these neuropeptidergic neuronsin the context of several behavioral paradigms.

Anderson The brain detects noxious stimulation of the skin, viscera and other internal structures via different subsets ofprimary nociceptive sensory neurons. These subsetspossibly engage distinct circuitry all the way up to thebrain, explaining the ability to distinguish the bodily sitesat which noxious stimuli are detected. Our objective is toget new molecular markers for such subsets and especiallyfor viscera nociceptors that project to the gut and otherinternal organs and that form the basis of interoception, thebrain's perception of the body's internal states. Theultimate goal is to use them, in conjunction with already identified markers for nociceptors innervating other targets, to trace their sensory maps, so as to illuminatewhether these circuits are distinct labelled lines. Thisanalysis might help deciphering the logic of braindecoding in the understudied visceral pain. In order to dothat, we will dissect the circuitry, by gene targeting, ofMrgB4/B5 members of the GPCR family of Mrgs, whichis believed to be involved in nociception. Since the MrgD member is specifically expressed in cutaneous afferents, itis implied that the other Mrgs might be characteristic fornociceptor subsets innervating different organs, includingviscera. Furthermore, since the P2X3,is expressed by both cutaneous and viscera nociceptive sensory neurons and MrgD neurons appear to innervate exclusively cutaneous targets, it follows that P2X3+ andMrgD- neurons are likely to contain visceral afferents.Thereby by creating appropriate targeted mutations inP2X3 and exploiting the already made in MrgD locus, wewill be able to trace and compare the circuitry of theP2X3+ and MrgD- sensory neurons with that of P2X3+and MrgD+. Additionally, in order to isolate new visceralnociceptor markers, we will conduct a screen that will bebased on the separation by FACS and the comparison ofthe gene expression profile of cells from cutaneousnociceptors (marked by MrgD) and nociceptor afferents enriched by other markers for visceral targets (like c-RET, known to be expressed in P2X3 neurons). 34. Specific olfactory circuits in Drosophila direct an innate avoidance behaviorGreg S. Suh, David J. AndersonWe have developed a novel behavioral paradigm for an innate avoidance response in Drosophila . This paradigm involves avoidance of a substance (calledDrosophila Stress Odorant or dSO) emitted by flies subjected to mechanical stress or electrical shock. Most responder flies, when given a choice in a T-maze between a fresh tube and a conditioned tube in which emitter flieswere previously stressed, avoid the latter tube. Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Respirometer analyses indicated that CO 2 is a component of dSO. Consistent with this, flies exhibitedan avoidance response to CO 2 in a dosage-dependent manner. Surgical removal of the 3rd antennal segment,which houses olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), renderedthe flies defective in responding to dSO and CO 2, indicating that ORNs are likely required for avoidance todSO and CO 2. In collaboration with Richard Axel's laboratory, we next identified a single pair of glomeruli in the antenna lobe that are innervated by Gr21a+ ORNs, thatare specifically activated by CO 2 and are necessary for CO 2 avoidance (Suh et al., 2004). We have mapped groups of neurons essential for the avoidance response to dSO, by carrying out anunbiased neuronal inactivation screen using the We have screened ~200 Gal4 enhancer trap lines and have identified 14 lines defectiveonly at the non-permissive temperature. In one of the 14lines, c761, the avoidance response to CO 2, was also defective at the non-permissive temperature. In this line, Gal4 is expressed in Gr21a+ ORNs, consistent with thelack of CO 2-responsiveness. Moreover, the observation that c761 is expressed in additional populations of ORNsprojecting to other glomeruli besides V, taken togetherwith the lack of dSO responsiveness in c761; UAS- Shi ts47 flies, suggests that these ORNs may include those responding to another non-CO 2 component of dSO (NCO). These lines of evidence indicated that dSO is composed of an unidentified substance(s) in addition toCO 2. To identify the groups of ORNs activated by NCO, we expressed GCaMP using pan-neuronal Elav-Gal4 and c761 drivers, and monitored the patterns of glomerular activation to traumatized fly air. We observed that anothersingle pair of glomeruli, known as Dm1, was activated bytraumatized fly air, but not by undisturbed fly air. TheDm1 glomeruli are innervated that conditional inactivation ofOr42b+ and Gr21a+ ORNs made flies defective in responding to dSO, whereas silencing either Or42+ orGr21a+ ORNs was not sufficient. These results suggestedthat the two ORN populations act in combination andtogether are essential for dSO avoidance. Reference Suh, G.S., Wong, Hergarden, A.C., Wang, Simon, Axel, R.

Anderson, Michael H.Dickinson*The fruitfly when presented with visual or olfactory stimuli responds with a change in behavior. For instance, when exposed to an expanding pattern of visualstimuli, the fly will move away from the focus ofexpansion; when exposed to low concentrations of carbondioxide the fly will move away from the gas. In order toaccomplish these behaviors, the fly must detectenvironmental changes, decide what to do, and coordinateits muscles to accomplish the behavior. We wish tounderstand how these steps are encoded in the nervoussystem of the fly. We reason a good entry point is tounderstand how locomotor information is encoded by thedescending interneurons. These neurons connect the brain with the thoracic ganglia (the equivalent of the spinal cord in vertebrates), all visual and olfactory mediated behaviorsmust be transmitted through these neurons. We have performed preliminary experiments to identify these neurons using photoactivable GFP. Weexpressed PA-GFP in all neurons in the fly, focallyactivated the neck connective, and then examined the brainto reveal about 90 pairs of neurons whose cell bodies are inthe brain, fitting the descending interneuron definition. We plan to record the activity of the descending interneurons while the fly is freely walking. In order to accomplish this, we built a walking arena modeled after Erich Buchner's design, where a tethered fly is walking ontop of a floating ball. This allows for a preparation thatsimulates walking behavior while the fly is stationary,permitting functional imaging and electrophysiologicalrecording with a two-photon microscope. We are alsointegrating the ball with the virtual flight arena hardwaredeveloped by Michael Riser to present visual stimuli to the walking fly. We are also identifying enhancer trap lines that genetically label descending interneurons. We screenedabout 500 lines in the Heberlein collection and found fivepotentially useful lines. More detailed characterization of these lines is on going. Meanwhile, we have collaborations with other labs to screen through theirenhancer trap collections. These lines will be useful forfunctional imaging studies by labeling a limited subset ofneurons. This allows for a better signal to noise readingwith functional imaging and targeted recordings withelectrophysiology.*Professor of Bioengineering, Caltech 36. Investigation of behavior and neural circuitry underlying mechanosensation in Drosophila melanogaster Suzuko Mechanosensation is intricately linked to an organism's survival. For example, the ability to detectwind allows many flying insects to navigate, while otherinsects detect disturbances of air particles to help themlocate predators and prey. Thus, a coordinated locomotoroutput in response to mechanical stimuli is critical forsurvival of organisms in nature. However, the linkbetween mechanosensation and locomotor control at theneural circuit level is currently unknown. To address thisquestion, we are trying to understand the neural circuitry underlying air current detection using a novel behavioral assay known as Air Suppression of Locomotion wild-type adult and eventually stop moving when theyare exposed to gentle air current. They remain immobilefor as long as they are exposed to air flow stimulation,while they immediately re-engage in locomotor activitywhen the air flow stops, as if air flow stimulus acts as aneural switch for fly's locomotor activity. Interestingly,when third antennal segment is surgically removedbilaterally, they continue to engage in locomotor activity inthe presence of air flow stimulation, suggesting that detection of air current is probably mediated through sensory organs housed in antennae. We propose to takeadvantage of the simplicity, robustness, highreproducibility, and unique locomotor phenotype of ASLto give insight into the link between mechanosensation andlocomotor control at neural circuit level. The goal of my project is to understand where and how air currents act on the nervous system to suppresslocomotor activity in fly. To this end, we will combinebehavioral genetics and functional analysis to address thefollowing specific aims: 1) determine which sensory organ mediates ASL; and 2) identify the second- and higher-order neurons that mediate the processing of aircurrent sensation and/or suppression of locomotor activity.48 37. In vivo reversible silencing of striatal neurons by an ivermectin gated Cl channelWalter Lerchner, Cheng Xiao, Laurent van Trigt,Eric M. Slimko, Henry A. Lester*, David J.AndersonTo develop tools for molecularly dissecting defined neuronal circuits in the brain, we have tested a two component ion-channel-based silencing system:expression of an C.elegans The heteropentameric requires both alpha and beta subunits, allowing for combinatorial strategies to increasethe specificity of expression. Both subunits have beencodon optimized, rendered insensitive to ) and YFP the system in the CNS in vivo , we injected mice unilaterally in the striatum with a suspension of two recombinant viruses(AAV2) expressing the alpha and beta subunits. IVM-induced silencing was confirmed in a simple rotation assay. Ten days after virus injection the mice wereinjected intraperitoneally with IVM and tested at varioustime points for amphetamine-induced rotation. Ifdopaminergic transmission via the striatum is unilaterallydisrupted in amphetamine-injected animals, ipsilateralrotation occurs. Such rotation was observed in animals co-injected with virus encoding the alpha and beta subunit, but not with virus encoding the alpha or beta subunit alone. With injections of 10 mg/kg IVM, the rotationappears after 4 h, peaks at 12 h and remains amphetamine inducible for up to 3 d. We repeated IVM administration and withdrawal at least twice in the same animals. Whilerepeated IVM administration restores the full rotationphenotype, in several mice some amphetamine-induciblerotation remains after IVM withdrawal. Furtherexperiments will determine whether this effect is causedby behavioral sensitization, or by a percentage of neuronsthat cannot be reactivated after prolonged silencing.Preliminary striatal slice patch recordings show that virus-expressing neurons respond to a <1 min IVM pulse withhyperpolarization and reduced firing, as expected from ofCl channel activation. The conductance then reverses, which suggests that the several days required for reversal in behavioral experiments may arise from ivermectinpharmacokinetics and could be accelerated.*Professor, Division of Biology, Caltech Reference [1] Slimko, E.M. and Lester, H.A.

Modeling \"emotional\" behavior in Drosophila Tim Lebestky Emotional behaviors in humans convey a positive or negative response to a stimulus, and this response ismanifest in discrete, highly conspicuous ways, such asstereotyped facial expressions and physiological arousal.Although Drosophila do not present the richness of human emotions in their behavior, they may share fundamentalmolecular similarities that could allow us to dissect theway that neural circuits function to provide graded responses in intensity, as measured quantitatively. To thisend, we are developing automated, high-resolutionbehavioral assays that will allow a reproduciblecharacterization of behavioral responses to aversive stimulifor high-throughput genetic screens. One such assay follows the startle effects on locomotion and escape behaviors in response to a series of air puffs, delivered atregular intervals. We observe a reproducible escalation oflocomotor activity and jump-response behaviors as afunction of time and puff number. We have performedgenetic screens to isolate and characterize insertionalmutants and potential neural circuits that mediate startlebehavior. Similar to mammals, Drosophila utilizes biogenic amines as dSERT, withsignificant functional homology to the mammalian SERT family has been cloned and physiologically characterized in vitro [1], however, there is no genetic analysis of this, or any other aminergic transporter in vivo . Given the importance of this molecular family and the successfuladvancement of in vivo RNAi techniques in Drosophila , we are currently developing techniques to look at gain- andloss-of-function conditions in a spatially and temporallyregulated manner in adult flies. To this end, we haveobtained RNAi lines, an insertional mutation in the dSERTlocus, and multiple deficiencies that uncover the region. Itis our hope that by tightly controlling the gene dosage and induction level of the RNAi, we may observe quantifiable phenotypic differences in behaviors that may give insightsinto how molecular thresholds influence the escalation ordecline of distinct internal states in genes in the oligodendrocyte- astrocyte fate decision Christian Hochstim, Qiao Zhou, David J.AndersonThis study aims to contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination incentral nervous system development. The more specificfocus will be on the glial subtype choice betweenoligodendrocyte and astrocyte fates. Olig2 is a bHLH transcription factor that has been shown to promote oligodendrocyte fate and repressastrocyte fate (Zhou and Anderson, Cell, 2002). In Olig2 -/- mice prospective oligodendrocytes marked by a GFP knockin are converted to astrocytes. In order to uncoverdownstream target genes of Olig2 involved in glial cellfate regulation we conducted gene identified as a gene49 upregulated in the Olig2 mutant. Expression data confirms that the conversion of Olig2 -/- cells to astrocytes iscorrelated with the upregulation that Pax6 expressed in a subpopulations of astrocyteprecursors and differentiated astrocytes but not inoligodendrocytes. Preliminary functional studies indicate that Pax6 is required for early astrocyte gene expression within a subset of precursors as well as for normaldevelopment of astrocytes in the ventral white matter ofthe spinal cord. 40. The amygdala central nucleus in innate and conditioned fear Wulf Haubensak, David J. AndersonFear is probably the most conserved emotion, underlying defensive behaviors across species, and, in turn,it is a basic, medically important, human emotion that canbe addressed in experimentally tractable animal model systems. Numerous studies have pointed to a central role of medial temporal lobe structures, particularly the amygdala,in various forms of fear. Typically, these structure-functionrelationships have been obtained by mapping patterns ofneuronal activity accompanying fear associated behaviors,and functionally validating these correlations by surgical orneurotoxic lesions. However, these methods are not suitableto investigate single neuronal circuits with cellularresolution. This is especially important when it comes toassign function to the amygdala subregions, and of thedifferent neuronal populations therein. Among these, neurons expressing the stress promoting neuropeptide CRH in the central amygdala (CeA) are likely to have a centralrole in fear processing. Here, we explore a genetic strategy in mice to analyze function and circuitry of these neurons with higherprecision. CRH is,as many other genes, expressed in more than one brain region. We, therefore, use it in combinationwith another region-specific gene, PKC delta, which is only coexpressed with CRH in the CeA, and thereby restrict theexpression of inducible genetically-encoded neuronalsilencers specifically to CeA neurons. To this end, we generated CRH and PKC delta transgenic mice expressing each one of the two subunits of a chloride channel for silencing (Slimko et al., J. Neurosci. 22:7373), such that in intercrosses of these mice, the functional channel will bereconstituted only in the target cells. This will allow us tosilence these cells in a temporally-defined manner inbehavioral paradigms for innate (measuringultrasound-induced freezing in foot-shock sensitized mice[1] and conditioned (measuring freezing in tone/foot-shockconditioned mice) fear. We will then use stereotactic injections of Cre- dependent viruses for neuronal tracing into the CeA of aPKC delta -Cre transgenic mouse line to identify projections to and from these neurons.

Boswell FoundationEllison Medical Foundation The John Douglas French Alzheimer's Foundation Life Sciences Research FoundationMcKnight FoundationNational Institutes of Health, USPHSNational Science FoundationRetina Research Foundation Summary: Our group uses Drosophila as a model system in which to identify and characterize genes involved in behavior, aging, and neurodegeneration. The high degree of homology between the fly and human genomes formsthe basis of a strategy for understanding the correspondinghuman genes. To study the genetics of aging, we use a single- gene approach to screen for mutants with enhancedlongevity, and analyze the functions of the genes involved.For instance, the mutant, methuselah , extends the average lifespan of Drosophila by some 30% and also provides increased resistance to different stresses. The methuselahprotein is related to G protein-coupled receptors of thesecretin receptor family, and has a unique N-terminal ectodomain. In collaboration with Professor Richard Roberts' group, a library of peptides was generated, fromwhich a subset was selected that show very high bindingaffinity to Mth protein. Overexpression of some of thesepeptides in transgenic flies extends lifespan. Exposure of flies to 100% oxygen causes rapid death, and we have found that an early-induced event islocal disruption of muscle mitochondrial structure in theform of internal \"swirls.\" These also accumulate in normalaging. We have identified and are characterizing mutantsthat are unusually sensitive to oxygen and display large numbers of swirls, as well as degeneration of specific cell types in the nervous system. Analysis of such mutantsmay provide clues to primary mechanisms of oxidativedamage. Mutations in specific components of therespiratory chain are of special interest in relation tohuman mitochondrial disorders. Dietary restriction extends lifespan in various organisms, and we are investigating the mechanism of thatphenomenon in Drosophila , as well as the role of bacterial flora. We have developed biomarkers to monitor theprogress of aging during lifetime, and have shown thatlifespan can be extended by simple feeding of a drugwhich alters the balance of induction and repression of different sets of genes. Among the behavioral paradigms currently under investigation are an alarm response in which fliessubjected to stress emit an odor that induces avoidance byother flies, a genetic analysis of appetite and obesity, and the effects of a sex peptide in Drosophila sperm that revamps the behavior of mated females. 41. Biochemical characterization of a Drosophila mitochondrial complex II mutant Dan Knoepfle, Giuseppe Attardi *, Seymour Benzer In a screen to identify genes that protect the mitochondrion from oxidative stress, we discovered a flymutant with a defect in subunit B of succinatedehydrogenase (SDH; mitochondrial respiratory complexII). Mitochondrial complex II, the only respiratory chaincomplex that is completely encoded by nuclear genes,consists of four subunits; SDHA, SDHB, SDHC andSDHD. Inactivation including familial pheochromocytoma, and familial head-and-neck paraganglioma. Understanding of these diseases has been limited by a dearth of animalmodels carrying mutations in each of the complex IIsubunits. Under hyperoxia (100% O 2), the mean survival of sdhB mutant flies, is reduced by 91%. Under normoxic conditions, mutant flies displayed a 66% decrease in meansurvival time and a 17% decrease in maximum survivaltime. To determine the effect of the sdhB mutation on respiratory chain activity, the rate of oxygen consumptionwas measured, using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Thesteps in respiration were compared in mitochondria isolated from wild-type and from sdhB mutant flies, using substrates ComplexI-specific (rotenone-sensitive) respiration rate was mutant as was the Complex IV-specific (ascorbate/TMPD-dependent/KCN-sensitive) respirationrate. However, there was a 56% decrease in Complex II-specific (succinate-dependent/antimycin A-sensitive)respiration rate. The effect of the mutation on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assayed bymitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production. Mitochondria from sdhB mutant animals had a 32% increase in hydrogen peroxide production, as compared towild-type controls. Our data indicate that SDHB is criticalin preventing electron leakage from complex II, so thatmutant animals suffer from increased oxidative stress and,as a result, are highly sensitive to oxygen and die rapidly.To determine the consequences of increased levels ofSDHB, we generated transgenic flies that overexpress thenormal gene. Mean lifespan was increased by 50% in fliesthat overexpress sdhB . *Professor, Division of Biology, Caltech51 42. sdhB gene activity is protective in a Drosophila model of ischemia/reperfusion injury David W. Walker, Seymour BenzerWhen tissues and organs are deprived of blood flow, the ischemic effects result from inadequate nutrientsand oxygen. When blood flow is restored (reperfusion), a second series of injurious events is triggered. Ischemia and reperfusion can cause serious brain damage as a resultof stroke or cardiac arrest. Several studies havedemonstrated that the reactions initiated at reperfusioninvolve the formation of cytotoxic oxidants derived frommolecular oxygen. Biochemical characterization of a fly mutant with a defect in subunit B of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH;mitochondrial respiratory complex II) reveals that sdhB mutants suffer from increased mitochondrial oxidativestress. To determine whether normal sdhB activity is important in protecting against reperfusion injury, we tested the ability of sdhB mutants to withstand periods of oxygen deprivation, by subjecting them to 100% N2, followed by recovery under normoxia. Groups of 20-25 adult flies were exposed to anoxic conditions (100% N2), in which the flies quickly lost coordination and becamemotionless. After 45 minutes, they were allowed torecover in room air. We compared the ability of wild-typeand mutant flies to recover from this anoxic stress.Normal flies began to waken after 8 minutes; by 24minutes, all were awake. sdhB mutants displayed a delay in recovery from anoxia, beginning to wake after 13 minutes, but at 24 minutes, when all control flies had awakened, less than 50% of the mutant flies had. By 1hour, all had recovered, but the sdhB mutant flies were still much less active than controls. We measured the flies'climbing performance before and after thehypoxia/reperfusion paradigm. Young mutant flies, at 2days of age, which in normoxia had climbed quite well,afterward displayed a severe climbing defect, not seen innormal flies. These data indicate that sdhB is indeed protective against reperfusion injury and suggests thatmutant animals can serve as a general model for studyingmechanisms of reperfusion injury. 43. Neurophysiological analysis of aging in Drosophila Shlomo Ben Tabou de Leon, David W. Walker,Seymour BenzerMost studies on aging in Drosophila are based on survival curves, without regard to the physiologicalchanges that underlie mortality. To that end, we arestudying age-related changes in electrophysiologicalfunction of specific organs, including the flight musclesand the photoreceptors, in normal flies and mutants. The role of mitochondrial dysfunction is studied by using the mutant sdhB, which is defective in subunit B of complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This mutantis short lived and shows mitochondrial dysfunction withage and elevated ROS production.We find that in normal flies both muscle fibers and photoreceptors show strong deterioration inelectrophysiological function with age. In muscle fibers,the resting potential decreases and the action potentialamplitude becomes smaller. Photoreceptors show adecrease in response to light, as manifested by decreases in both the receptor potential and the \"on\" and \"off\" responses in the electroretinogram. The eyes also developspontaneous activity (in the dark). Electron microscopyreveals associated retinal degeneration. Under oxidativestress (100% O 2), muscle fibers of normal and sdhB mutant flies showed similar deterioration, but thephotoreceptors of the mutant flies showed lessdeterioration than normal flies. The differential responseof these two tissues to oxidative stress suggests thatincreased ROS level may not be sufficient to account forall the deterioration of function with age. Investigating themolecular basis of tissue-specific deterioration may provide clues about causes of death, and specifically the role of the mitochondria. 44. Modeling the role of Apolipoprotein D in normal and pathological aging in Drosophila Julien A. Muffat, David W. Walker, SeymourBenzerWe have been investigating the roles of Apolipoprotein D and Neural of stress, and in pathological situations. In Alzheimer's disease the human protein is strongly upregulated and recruited to senile plaques. Morerecently, it has been shown also to be upregulated in thesubstantia nigra of Parkinson's disease While humanApoD (hApoD) is upregulated in many situations ofneuronal damage, research has yet to determine whether itis part of a stress response meant to control and repair thedamage, or a marker of and actor in cell death. Our goalhas been to use the powerful genetic tools available inDrosophila to modulate the expression of the homologs ofApoD in flies. We recently reported that overexpression of GLaz extends lifespan of flies by up to 30% under normalconditions, while also increasing resistance to multipleextrinsic stresses. Most importantly, healthspan is alsoimproved, as assessed by behavioral assays. For example,normal flies exposed to hyperoxia for 4 days display adecline in their ability to climb, while flies overexpressingGLaz are protected against this decay, and continue to climb normally. Glaz overexpression also appears to protect flies from a behavioral decline induced by ahypoxia/reoxygenation treatment thought to model stroke. This result is particularly important considering that ApoD is upregulated in a mouse model of stroke. GLaz loss-of-function flies are sensitive to oxidative stress and short-lived. We are currently testingUAS-RNAi lines for both GLaz and NLaz . These will allow us to study time and tissue-specific down-regulationof the two genes. We can then find out which tissues are52 necessary for the normal functions of GLaz and NLaz . An important experiment will be to try to rescue neurodegeneration in mutants with the human protein. We generated several constructs placing the sequences of GLaz ,NLaz and hApoD under UAS control in a modified pUASt plasmid. The plasmids were designed to fuse a C-terminal tag (Ha or GFP) to the different proteins. We selected, for each construct, onewith the gene inserted on the 2 nd chromosome, and one on the 3rd chromosome. Anti-HA staining on protein preparations from transformants shows clearimmunoreactive bands, of the expected molecular weight.We find that flies overexpressing NLaz or hApoD are 30 to 40% more resistant to the oxidative stress caused byparaquat, as well as living longer under normal conditions.These results are evidence of functional homologybetween GLaz/NLaz and hApoD and suggest that their functions are beneficial. 45. Doubling of fruitfly lifespan by overexpression of a mitochondrial gene William W. Ja, Gil B. Carvalho, Seymour BenzerHypomorphic mutations in either the G protein- coupled receptor (GPCR) gene methuselah (mth) or its ligand stunted result in robust extensions of Drosophila lifespan. Surprisingly, we have found that ubiquitousoverexpression of Stunted during development, but notduring adulthood, leads to an unprecedented two-foldextension of adult longevity. Stunted encodes a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, implying a connection between metabolism, the ATP-producingmachinery, and GPCR signaling in the lifespan-extendingeffect. The long-lived animals overexpressing Stuntedshow reduced size, body mass and fertility, suggesting atradeoff between metabolism and longevity. We arecurrently dissecting the role of Stunted as a regulator ofenergy investment, and determining the connectionbetween Methuselah signaling and mitochondrialmetabolism. 46. Downstream mediators of dietary restriction Brian M. Zid, Pankaj Kapahi*, Seymour Benzer Dietary restriction (DR), the reduction of calories without malnutrition, has been known to extend lifespan inmice since the 1930's and has since been shown to work ina variety of organisms. DR is also the most potent,broadly acting intervention for preventing the age-relateddisease cancer. DR causes a shift in an organism'sphysiology; in Drosophila, this is characterized by fat accumulation, increased stress resistance, and reducedfertility. We have found that the eIF4E binding protein,4EBP, is dramatically upregulated as the concentration of yeast extract in the fly food is reduced. 4EBP is necessary for the lifespan extension seen under DR as male andfemale 4EBP mull flies show a diminished response to thereduction in YE concentration. Using the Gal4-UASsystem, we overexpressed d4EBP using two separateweak, ubiquitous drivers and found that, in females, thisupregulation extended lifespan on high YE but not underDR. eIF4E is part of the cap binding complex that is necessary for the translation of the majority of mRNAs.mRNAs with long 5'UTRs that have a high amount ofsecondary structure are especially sensitive to the activity of eIF4E. Many mRNAs with high amounts of secondary structure are important in the control of cell growth andproliferation. The polysome profile of flies under DR wasinvestigated, and translation state array analysis (TSAA)performed to assay the translational state of individualmRNAs. DR significantly changed the translational levelsof 107 genes, 81 up and 26 down. To investigate whetherthere is a relation between 5'UTR secondary structure andtranslation regulation under DR, we calculated the foldingfree energy, \u0001G, for the 5'UTR for each gene that changed significantly. It was found that the average 5'UTR of theupregulated genes was 92 bp long and had a \u0001 G of -13.9 kcal/mol, while the downregulated genes had average 5'UTR lengths of 324 bp and \u0001 G's of -71.1 kcal/mol. There was a highly significant translational downregulation of transcripts that had high secondarystructure in their 5'UTR, consistent with the hypothesis that eIF4E activity is downregulated upon DR. Current research is focused on understanding the functionalclassification of the genes which translationally changeunder DR.*Buck Institute, Novato, CA 47. creosote mutants in Drosophila as a model to identify genetic suppressors of the toxic effects of over-nutritionJonathan Liong, William Ja, Pankaj Kapahi*,Seymour Benzer Dietary restriction extends lifespan in various organisms. That implies that ad libitum food intake has a toxic effect. By feeding flies on excessively rich food, we can screen for genes that counteract this toxic effect. Wedesignate mutants that are hypersensitive to mutation ascreosote mutants. These can, in principle, provide models with which to screen for drugs and genes that act assuppressors of the deleterious effects of over-nutrition.Since the basic cellular processes and pathways arestrongly conserved among organisms, and there is a highdegree of genetic homology between Drosophila and humans, information obtained from creosote mutants may help to uncover the role of nutrition in the etiology of age-related human diseases. To identify creosote lines we compared adult lifespan on high yeast compared to lowyeast foods (20% versus 5% brewer's yeast), using linesoverexpressing RNAi of various genes. We discoveredthat down-regulation of a gene involved in electrontransport, oxido-reductase, and monooxygenase activitycauses sensitivity to high yeast food. We will verifywhether down-regulation of the gene is responsible for thecreosote phenotype, and will continue to screen a collection of RNAi lines for additional gene targets. *Buck Institute, Novato, CA53 48. Obese mutants of Drosophila Bader F. Al Anzi, Seymour Benzer a screen for obese mutants, we found fatso , which is recessive for both starvation resistance andobesity. Both phenotypes map to a 300 Kbp genomicinterval, and we are currently doing complementation tests between fatso and other mutant genes in that genomic interval. Via various assays, we have examined the underlying basis of the phenotype. fatso has a 25% increase in food intake and also shows reduced locomotoractivity. However, these are not associated with reducedmetabolic rate, as indicated by CO 2 generation. In fact, there is a 10-15% increase in CO 2 emission with age. Fat also accumulates in the thoracic muscle. In the abdomenthere are abnormally enlarged fat droplets with centralnuclei. In a second mutant, Butterball , both starvation resistance and obesity are dominant. Butterball shows a 50-60% increase in CO 2 emission, as compared to wild- type controls, which might indicate a metabolicabnormality. Butterball also exhibits abnormal fat cell morphology but, unlike fatso, does not show storage of fat in thoracic muscle with age. Surprisingly, unlike fatso , Butterball flies have 25-30% increase in lifespan as compared to wild-type controls. Using a two-dye feeding assay to isolate mutants with abnormal feeding patterns, we found that a P-elementinsertion in the neuropeptide hormone leucokinin causes abdominal bloating, associated with increased food intake. Excision lines produced by mobilization of this P-element revert this phenotype, confirming that the bloating defect isindeed by the P-element insertion in the leucokinin gene. Leucokinin is a myotropic neuropeptide found in most invertebrate species. It was initially isolated as aneurohormone that increases fluid secretion in themalpighian tubules, and also hindgut motility.The hinges upon thepresence of a C-terminal pentapeptide, a feature that itshares with the vertebrate tachykinin peptides, a family ofpeptides including molecules such as substance P (SP), known to be involved in gut motility, which is a likely vertebrate evolutionary ortholog of Leucokinin. The known role of Leucokinin in stimulating fluid secretion of the malpighian tubules prompted us toexamine whether leucokinin mutants exhibit any defect in maintaining osmotic balance. We addressed this issue bygrowing the mutant flies in media posing high osmoticstress. Unlike wild-type flies, leucokinin mutant adults begin to die within 24 hours after being transferred tomedia with a high concentration of NaCl, KCl or D-sorbitol. We are currently examining whether this phenotype in fact maps to the leucokinin gene.49. Appetite mutants of Drosophila melanogaster Paul Nagami, Anzi, Seymour Benzer We used a two-color assay to screen for mutants that overeat. In the two-color assay, flies are starved for24 hours, then transferred for 20 minutes to red-dyed food,then transferred for 15 minutes to blue-dyed food. Flies that are not satiated in 20 minutes of feeding consume both red and blue food, and so have purple bellies and arepotential overeaters. We screened the Drosophila X chromosome for EMS-induced mutants with altered feeding behavior usingthe assay. In addition, we have screened some 60 lineswith P-element-induced deletions in genes chosen aspotential appetite regulatory genes. Candidate mutantlines obtained by these screens are being furthercharacterized. 50. Odor sensitivity and habituation in a Drosophila dNOS mutant Vickie Pon, Bader F. Al Anzi, Seymour Benzer Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that mediates the production of cyclic guanosinemonophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger involved inmany biological processes. NO is largely produced by theenzymatic activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), anessential enzyme in most animals. Among its many roles,NO is involved in odor habituation, a process that protectsfrom sensory overload. We examined a Drosophila mutant with a P-element insertion in the gene that encodes NOS (called dNOS) to determine whether the mutant has any olfactory defects. Using diaphorase staining, we found that these dNOS mutants have a decrease in NO production in its antennae and maxillary palps, which are thought tobe the main olfactory organs of the adult fly. Byperforming behavioral experiments using a T-maze, wenext examined if this reduction in NO production iscorrelated with olfactory defects. We found that dNOS mutants are more sensitive to a variety of odors at lowerconcentrations than control flies. Odor habituation testsindicated that dNOS mutants do not habituate to most odors to the same degree as do control flies, suggesting that the increased sensitivity to odors in dNOS mutants may be due to the defect in habituation. 51. A search for \"forgetless\" mutants Joseph Donovan, Bader F. Al Anzi, Seymour BenzerWhile great strides have been made towards understanding memory, forgetting is still a poorlyunderstood process. While some aspects of forgettingmust involve passive processes, such as decay of neuralactivity over time, there is the possibility that an active forgetting mechanism exists. The goal of this project is to develop a new, more efficient paradigm for Drosophila olfactory memory conditioning assays, and to use theparadigm to search for mutants that fail to forget. The newparadigm differs from the conventional Drosophila olfactory paradigm in that flies are conditioned to reversetheir behavior, i.e., to avoid a normally attractive odor.54 This facilitates detection of mutants with long-lasting memory. Screening is in progress using the new paradigm,and there are several promising mutant lines, but moretesting is required to determine whether they are trulyforgetless mutants. 52. The effect of mating and seminal peptides on female food preferenceGil B. Carvalho, William W. Ja, Elizabeth Mak,Seymour BenzerIn numerous insect species, mating elicits a dramatic remodeling of behavior. In Drosophila , this post- mating response (PMR) is mediated by small peptidestransferred in the male ejaculate. We have recently shownthat copulation also induces a marked increase in femaleappetite, and that this change is controlled by a single maleseminal factor, the Sex Peptide (SP). We have developeda procedure, the CAFE (capillary feeding) assay that allows one to directly monitor real-time ingestion and feeding preference. When presented with a choicebetween sugar and yeast, virgins ingest more of the sugaryfood but mated females show an enhanced preference forthe latter. We are investigating the role of SP in regulatingthis paradigm. 53. Genetic analysis of action of the Drosophila sex peptideGeorge Luo, Gil Carvalho, Seymour BenzerDrosophila sex peptide (SP) is synthesized in the adult male accessory gland and transferred via the seminal fluid to the female during copulation. SP thus inducesprofound changes in female reproductive behavior andphysiology, including repressed sexual receptivity,increased egg-laying, reduced lifespan, increased feeding,and an alteration in food choices. To reveal the pathwaysunderlying these post-mating responses, a key step is toidentify the SP receptor(s). We are using a geneticscreening assay that makes use of the dramatic reduction infemale sexual receptivity after receiving SP. While normalfemales will not remate for many hours, females with aeffect in the SP pathway should accept remating. We sequentially exposed females of various mutant lines to two groups of males, each carrying a distinctive geneticmarker to identify the resultant progeny. With normalfemales, only \u00015% accepts a secondary mating. In contrast, some mutant lines show a much higher degree ofacceptance. These data suggested that this screening assayis capable of identifying SP pathway-defective mutants.54. Olfactory circuits in Drosophila avoidance of stress-associated Allan Wong 1, Anne Hergarden1, Richard Axel2, Seymour Benzer, David J. Anderson3 Recognition of many odorants in insects requires decoding of the combinatorial patterns of glomerular activation, mediated by the mushroom body (MB), whichreceives inputs from the most of projection neurons (PNs),called the inner antennocerebral tract. Other tracts bypassthe MB and make direct connections to the inner brain. AsCO 2 can elicit avoidance response by activating a single population of ORNs rather than a complex combinatorialset, it would be interesting to know whether decoding ofthe simple CO 2 olfactory information requires the MB function. The fact that the MB is not required for CO 2 avoidance, however, suggests that the CO 2 olfactory information is unlikely processed in the MB. It has been shown that locomotor activity triggered by acute exposure of CO 2 to flies does not habituate, while the activity elicited by other odors does habituate, which requires theMB function. Accordingly, repeated exposure of CO 2 to flies does not habituate the avoidance response in aT-maze assay. Furthermore, it has been difficult to trainflies to conditionally associate CO 2 (conditioned stimuli) with electric shock (unconditioned stimuli). These resultsraise an interesting possibility that CO 2-responsive PNs bypass the MB and directly innervate the inner brain. Tovisualize the connectivity pattern of PNs innervated V (V-PN), we utilized a Gal4 enhancer trap line expressed in PNs including those innervated the V glomeruli. Using theFLP-out technique of Basler and Struhl, we showed that aV-PN bypasses the MB and directly innervates the laternalhorn. The Axel lab subsequently showed that the V-PNlabeled by the Gal4 line is activated by CO 2. The lines of evidence indicate that dSO contains an unidentified substance(s) in addition to CO 2, \"the mystery odor.\" To identify the groups of ORNs activatedby the mystery odor, we expressed GCaMP using pan-neuronal Elav-Gal4 and c761 drivers, and monitored thepatterns of glomerular activation to air from traumatized flies. We found that another single pair of glomeruli, known as Dm1, was activated by such air, but not by airfrom undisturbed flies. The Dm1 glomeruli are innervatedby Or42b+ORNs. Using batteries of showed thatconditional inactivation of Or42b+ and Gr21a+ ORNs made flies defective in responding to dSO. 1David Anderson lab, Division of Biology, Caltech 2Columbia University 3Professor, Division of Biology, Caltech Publications Al-Anzi, B., Tracey Jr., W.D. and Benzer, S.

Formore details and all publications, see http://www.klab.caltech.edu Research carried out as part of a \"Biophysics of Computation\" focuses on how the electrophysiology,synaptic architecture, and dendritic morphology of groupsof individual neurons subserve information processing. Towhat extent do neuronal noise sources (thermal andchannel noise, noise due to synaptic background firing,and so on) limit signal detection and signal reconstructionat the level of individual neurons? What are thebiophysical mechanisms underlying neuronalcomputations? Can we infer something about the shape and property of a neuron by listening to its extracellular observed action potential? How does the constantlyfluctuating extracellular membrane potential influence theintracellular membrane potential? Can the extracellularmembrane potential carry information of relevance toneural computation? Analytical work, backed up bydetailed computer simulations of nerve cells based onelectrophysiological data from our experimental collaborators at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem (IdanSegev and Yosef Yarom) and Henry Lester at Caltech,generates experimentally verifiable predictions. WithGuyri Buzsaki at Rutgers, we continue to investigate therelationship and intracellular spike waveforms and with Tomaso Poggio at MIT we are identifying ways in which single neurons can implementspecific neuronal operations, such as computing themaximum over a cell' synaptic input (MAX). Understanding the action of selective, visual attention (both saliency-driven, bottom-up, as well as task-dependent, top-down forms) requires a firm grasp of howvisual object recognition in natural scenes can be solved atthe computational level, and how the resulting algorithmscan be mapped onto the known architecture of the visualcortex and associated subcortical areas. We use analyticalmethods, coupled with computer simulations of the appropriate circuitry in the primate visual system, experimental psychophysics, eye trackers and functionalbrain imaging to investigate human object recognition inthe near-absence of focal attention, in visual search and innatural scene perception (some of this is done incollaboration with Laurent Itti at USC). Together withTomaso Poggio at MIT, we investigate neurobiologicallyplausible models of both the ventral and dorsal visualstreams. What are the limits of human object recognition?To what extent can probabilistic Bayesian recognitionalgorithms perform near-human level visual object classification (the object is a dog) and identification (it's my dog Bella). This is ongoing work with Pietro Perona atCaltech. The resulting algorithms are being applied toproblems in overhead imagery analysis, robotic navigationand scene interpretation for real-time machine vision. We are complementing these studies using noninvasive fMRI imaging (at Caltech's 3.4 T scanner)under the identical stimulus protocols to investigate suchquestions as object recognition with and without spatialselective attention, as well as orientation and face-specificadaptation. Our laboratory collaborates with the neurosurgeon and neuroscientist Itzhak Fried at UCLA, recording from 64 electrodes in the medial temporal lobeof awake patients with pharmacologically intractableepilepsy who are implanted with depth electrodes tolocalize the focus of seizure onset. This unique settingallows us to observe invariant recognition, imagery andrepresentation of familiar objects and famous individualsin conscious humans by listening in on the spiking activityof many individual neurons - complemented by local fieldanalysis. This work requires sophisticated data processingskills and the careful design of the appropriate behavioral- physiological paradigms that will work in a clinical context. Finally, we continue to study the neuronal correlates of consciousness, developing a neurobiologicalframework to understand how subjective feelings (inparticular, conscious visual perception) can arise in themammalian forebrain. This two decade-long research57 program has found its way into a book for a general scientific audience, The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach , by C. Koch and published in 2004. 55. On the origins of the extracellular action potential waveform: A modeling study Carl Henze2, Christof Koch1, Gy\u00f6rgy Buzs\u00e1ki3 Although extracellular unit recording is typically used for the detection of spike occurrences, it also has thetheoretical ability to report about what are typicallyconsidered intracellular features of the action potential.We address this theoretical ability by developing a modelsystem that captures features of experimentally recordedsimultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings ofCA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the Line SourceApproximation method (Holt and Koch, 1999) to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neuronsrecorded in vivo (Henze et al ., 2000) with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulatedwith compartmental models.The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAP's, although it wasdifficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both theintracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggeststhat accounting for the EAP waveform provides aconsiderable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell.Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had verylittle impact on the EAP waveform. The model alsodemonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currentsin different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP. 1Computation and Neural Systems, Caltech 2Merck Research Laboratories 3Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University Reference Henze, D.A., Borhegyi, Z., Csicsvari, J., Neurophysiol.

The properties of forward and backpropagating action potentials (BPAPs) in the dendritictree of pyramidal cells are the subject of intense empiricalwork and theoretical speculation. We numericallysimulate the effects of stochastic ion channels on theforward and backward propagation of dendritic spikes inMonte-Carlo simulations on a reconstructed layer 5pyramidal neuron. We report that in most instances thereis little variation in timing or amplitude for a single BPAP,while variable backpropagation can occur for trains ofaction potentials. Additionally, we find that the generationand forward propagation of dendritic Ca 2+ spikes are susceptible to channel variability.

Girardin2, John Anderson2, Rodney Douglas2, Christof Koch We simulate the biophysics of intra- and extracellular current flow to calculate the distance at whichan extracellular electrode could record neurons fromdifferent layers of cat visual cortex. Detailed 3-Dreconstructions of neurons from identified layers of catvisual cortex (N=70; Binzegger et. al ., 2004) coupled to a detailed electrophysiological membrane model, weresimulated using compartmental models within NEURON(Hines and Carnevale, 1997). We use the Line Source Approximation (Holt and Koch, 1999) to model the extracellular action potential voltage resulting from thespiking activity of individual neurons (Gold et. al ., 2006). The peak extracellular voltage resulting from an actionpotential was calculated in the vicinity of each model cell.A threshold determined by the background noise was usedto calculate a region in which an extracellular electrodewould be able to detect the action potential. For each layerof cortex we calculated an average detection range for atypical neuron located in that layer. We found that the sizeof the detectable region around a cell depended strongly on the size and morphology of the cells. Based on the average detection volume, we calculated the number ofcells that would be within range of a fixed electrode foreach layer using previous measurements of the density ofcells in each layer (Beaulieu and Colonnier, 1983). Thenumber of cells within detection range varied from only 2in layer 4 to around 20 in layer 5. (Layers 2/3 and 6Awere more similar to layer 4; see Table 1.) Thiscalculation is roughly in agreement with previousempirical measurements, which found an average of 4.4 units detectable by tetrodes in vivo (Gray et. al ., 1995.) We also calculated the sampling bias of each layer,assuming that the fraction of cells in each layer firing atany given time was uniform. This calculation suggeststhat the probability of sampling from any layer, given an electrode randomly placed somewhere in the grey matter, is influenced by both the size of the different layers and thedetection range around the cells of that layer. 1Computation and Neural Systems, Caltech 2Institute of Neuroinformatics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) References Beaulieu, C. and Colonnier, M.

Using extracellular action potential recordings to constrain parameters of detailed compartmental modelsCarl Gold *, Christof Koch We compare two different methods for constraining the active current conductance density parameters of detailed compartmental models. The first method is using a measurement of the intracellular actionpotential (IAP) at one or more locations on the membrane.The second method is to calculate the Extracellular ActionPotential (EAP) from the membrane currents, using theLine Source Approximation (LSA). We find that using theIAP as the parameter has the drawback that signicantlydifferent sets of parameters can have virtually identicalIAP's. In contrast, the EAP's for the same simulations varyconsiderably as a result of the parameter differences. Thereason for the phenomena is that the IAP results from bothmembrane currents on a compartment and also axial current owing from neighboring compartments. The EAP results from the local membrane currents alone. This givesthe IAP additional degrees of freedom in comparison to theIAP. Based on these results we conclude that use of theEAP to constrain compartmental model parameters may besuperior to using measurements of the IAP. *Computation and Neural Systems, Caltech 59. Local field potentials and spikes in the human MTL are selective to image categoryAlexander Local potentials (LFPs) reflect the averaged dendro-somatic activity of synaptic signals of largeneuronal populations. In this study we investigated theselectivity of local field potentials and single neuronactivity to semantic categories of visual stimuli in themedial temporal lobe of nine neurosurgical patientsimplanted with intracranial depth electrodes for clinicalreasons. Strong selectivity to the category of presentedimages was found for the amplitude of LFPs in 8% ofimplanted microelectrodes and for the firing rates of singleand multi units in 14% of microelectrodes. There was little overlap between the LFP- and spike-selective microelectrodes. Separate analysis of the power and phaseof LFPs revealed that the mean phase was category- selective around the \u0002 frequency range and that the power of the LFPs was category-selective for high frequencies around the \u0001 rhythm. Of the 36 microelectrodes with amplitude-selective LFPs, 30 were found in thehippocampus. Finally, it was possible to read-outinformation about the category of stimuli presented to thepatients with both spikes and LFPs. Combining spiking and LFP activity enhanced the decoding accuracy in comparison with the accuracy obtained with each signalalone, especially for short time intervals. 1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, UK 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology 3Division of Neurosurgery and Neuropsychiatric Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA60. A single neuron correlate of change detection and change blindness in the human medialtemporal lobeLeila Reddy 1, Rodrigo Quian Quiroga2, Patrick Wilken3, Christof Koch, Itzhak Fried4 Observers are often unaware of changes in their visual environment when attention is not focused at thelocation of the change. Because of its rather intriguingnature, this phenomenon, known as change blindness, hasbeen extensively studied with psychophysics as well aswith fMRI. However, whether change blindness can betracked in the activity of single cells is not clear. Toexplore the neural correlates of change detection andchange blindness, we recorded from single neurons in thehuman medial temporal lobe (MTL) during a changedetection paradigm. The preferred pictures of the visuallyresponsive units elicited significantly higher firing rates onthose trials when subjects correctly identified a change (change detection) compared to when they missed it (change blindness). On correct trials, the firing activity ofindividual units allowed us to predict the occurrence of achange, on a trial-by-trial basis, with 67% accuracy. Thisprediction was at chance for incorrect trials. Furthermore,subjects' behavioral choices on each trial could bepredicted above chance (58%) based on these individualresponses. The firing rates of visual selective MTL cellsthus constitute a neural correlate of change detection. 1Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, 3Otto Magdeburg, Germany 4Division of Neurosurgery and Neuropsychiatric Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 61. Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brainRodrigo Quian Quiroga 1, Leila Reddy2, Gabriel Kreiman2, Christof Koch, Itzhak Fried3 We can easily recognize a person or object even if viewed from different angles or under strikingly differentconditions. How such a robust high-level representation isachieved by neurons in the brain is still unclear and has led to different hypothesis. We analyzed neuronal responses in the human medial temporal lobe to presentations ofimages of individuals and objects. Using a new spike-sorting algorithm, we extracted spiking activity fromintracranial recordings in the temporal lobe of patientswith pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. Thesepatients were implanted with depth electrodes, incombination with multiple micro-wires, in order to localizethe seizure focus area for potential surgical resection.From a total of 64 micro-wires, usually located in theamygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, we isolated between 40 and 90 simultaneously recorded units per experiment. For eachpatient, we first analyzed single- and multi-unit responsesto presentations of about 100 different pictures, comprisingfamous and non-famous people, animals, landmarks, andobjects. Then, we selected those images for which at leastone unit showed a significant response and, in subsequent60 sessions, we presented different views of those individuals, animals, or objects. From a total of 998 units recorded ineight patients, 51 units were activated by differentpresentations of an individual, landmark or object, withfew or no responses to images of other individuals orobjects. Some of these neurons also responded selectively to the letter string with the name of the individual. Noteworthy, these responses were in many cases limited toshort bursts occurring between 300-600 msec. Theseresults point towards a sparse, invariant and explicit representation of individuals or objects by neurons in thehuman temporal lobe. 1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, UK 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology 3Division of Neurosurgery and Neuropsychiatric Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA Selective and invariant responses in human neurons: Spiking responses and histograms of a single unit in the left posterior hippocampus of a human subject activated exclusively by different views of the actressJennifer Aniston. Only the responses to 30 of the 87 images shown to the patient are given. There were nostatistically significant responses to the other 57 pictures. 62. Computational modeling of sparse representationStephen Waydo 1, Alexander Kraskov, Rodrigo Quian Quiroga2, Itzhak Fried3, Christof Koch Recent experiments characterized individual neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) withremarkably selective, invariant and explicit responses toimages of famous individuals or landmark buildings. Weuse probabilistic analysis to show that these data areconsistent with a sparse code in which neurons respond ina selective manner to a small fraction of stimuli. We further develop a computational model based on a current state-of-the-art machine vision system (Hmax) that is ableto generate category selective behavior after anunsupervised learning process. 1Control and Dynamical Systems, Caltech 2Now at Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, UK 3Division of Neurosurgery and Neuropsychiatric Institute, Peter K\u00f6nig2, Wolfgang When inspecting a complex natural scene, human observers sequentially allocate their attention to subsets ofthe stimulus for detailed processing. Since these shifts inattention are usually associated with shifts in gaze,eye-position provides an overt correlate of the focus of attention. While several factors, such as the observer'sexperience and the task, influence the direction of gaze under natural conditions, most models of human attention concentrate on the influence of bottom-up factors, i.e.,features of the current stimulus. Most of these models usethe concept of a so-called saliency map (Koch and Ullman,1985). They compute center-surround differencesindependently in multiple feature channels, normalize thedifference maps in each feature individually and add theresulting \"conspicuity maps\" linearly across features.While such models predict human fixation above chance, it61 is unclear whether their two fundamental assumptions, linearity and independence of features, do indeed hold. Here we investigate the contribution of two- specific features, color-contrast and luminance-contrast, tohuman overt attention in natural scenes. We measure eye-position of observers viewing stimuli where luminance- contrast and/or color-contrast are increased gradually towards one side of the image. We find that such gradientsbias fixation locations towards regions of higher contrasts.If both features increase in the same or in opposingdirection, the individual biases add linearly. In addition,both features act independently as revealed byperpendicular feature gradients.These findings demonstrate that the effects of color- andluminance-contrast on human overt attention are consistentwith the predictions and assumptions of bottom-upsaliency map models.1D\u00e9partement de Psychologie, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Canada 2Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany Reference Koch, C. and Ullman, S.

The duration of the attentional blink in natural scenes depends on stimulus categoryWolfgang Einh\u00e4user, Christof Koch, ScottMakeig * Humans comprehend the \"gist\" of even a complex natural scene within a small fraction of a second. If,however, observers are asked to detect targets in asequence of rapidly presented items, recognition of a targetsucceeding another target by about a third of a second is severely impaired. Remarkably, this impairment is absent if the second target immediately follows the first. Thesetwo phenomena constitute the \"attentional blink\" (AB;Raymond, Shapiro, and Arnell, 1992). Since mostexperiments on the AB use well controlled but artificialstimuli, the question arises whether the same phenomenonoccurs for complex, natural stimuli, and if so, whether its specifics depend on stimulus category. Here we presentedrapid sequences of complex stimuli (photographs ofobjects, scenes and faces) and asked observers to detectand remember items of a specific category (either faces,watches, or both). We found a consistent AB for bothtarget categories but the duration of the AB depended onthe target category. *Swartz Center for Computational Percept. Perform .18(3):849-860.62 65. Phase-noise and Ueli Rutishauser1, Swantje Nadler2, Peter K\u00f6nig2, Christof Koch conditions, humans sequentially allocate their attention to subsets of the stimulus. Models of attention are typically based on difference maps in low- level features, but neglect higher-order statistics inherentin natural stimuli. To what extent does such higher-orderstructure affect the deployment of attention? Here werecorded eye-movements in human observers who viewedunmodified and modified images of natural scenes.Modifications included contrast modulations (resulting inchanges to first and second-order statistics), as well as theaddition of noise to the Fourier phase (resulting in changesto higher-order statistics). We find: First, subjects'interpretation of a stimulus as a \"natural\" depiction of anoutdoor scene depends on higher-order statistics. Second, a linear relation between fixation probability and first- order feature contrast predicts the observed fixationdistribution, if the feature is modulated independently ofthe underlying scene. However, for features originallypresent in the scene, this relation depends on the interplaybetween spatial frequency and higher-order statistics. Thisholds for various stimulus categories (man-made, faces,out-door scenes and fractals). Taking both findingstogether, our data imply that the effect of first-orderfeatures is related to scene interpretation. Consequently, alinear model explains the relation of attention to first-order features, if they occur in isolation. For natural scenes, however, higher order correlations have to be taken intoaccount. 1Computation and Neural Systems, Caltech 2Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany 66. Task-demands can reverse the effects of visual saliencyWolfgang Einh\u00e4user, Christof KochIn natural vision, stimulus features and the demands of the task affect observers' attention and eye movements. The exact relationship between sensory- driven and task-dependent factors is controversial. On theone hand, \"bottom-up\" models that rely solely on sensory-driven features (e.g., \"saliency-maps\") successfully predicta significant fraction of free viewing fixations. Models ofvisual search, on the other hand, focus on task-related(\"top-down\") factors: they predict the selective up-modulation of target features or filters, or an optimizedstrategy according to general scene statistics. Wedemonstrate a robust effect of sensory-driven saliencyunder free viewing conditions that can, however, be completely and immediately overridden by a search task.67. Modeling human errors in rapid scene recognitionT. Nathan Mundhenk 1, Wolfgang Einh\u00e4user, Christof Koch, Pierre Baldi2, Laurent Itti1 Humans demonstrate a peculiar ability to detect complex target items (such as an animal) in sequences of rapidly presented natural scenes. They thereby far outperform contemporary machine vision algorithms, yetlittle computational understanding exists of the neuralmechanisms underlying such rapid visual processing. Tocharacterize these mechanisms and to translate them into acomputational model, we quantitatively analyze theconditions under which rapid target detection succeeds andfails in humans. Three observers viewed 1000 sequencesof 20 natural scene images, presented at 20Hz. Theyperformed a yes/no paradigm as to whether one image ofan animal was embedded in the sequence, which was thecase in half of the trials. Consistently with earlier studies, subjects performed well above chance. In addition, performance of different observers was not mutuallyindependent: in more sequences than predicted by chancedid all three observers detect the target (\"hit\": 207/500trials) or miss it (\"miss\": 93/500 trials). This implies thatthe spatio-temporal statistics of a sequence allowprediction of target detection success. We quantify thisusing two computational vision algorithms: one computesinstantaneous visual information-theoreticmeasure of attentional saliency, while the other evaluatesthe distribution of image contrast. We find that consistently detected targets have significantly higher contrast than targets that are consistently missed. Moreimportantly, images immediately preceding and followinga target elicited significantly more visual surprise in \"miss\"than in \"hit\" trials. This suggests that items thatparasitically capture attention impair target detection byeffectively masking the target. Using these measures, wedemonstrate that a neural network can predict taskperformance on a trial-by-trial basis. Being the firstcomputational model predicting human performance inrapid visual detection tasks, our results pave the way forimproving machine vision algorithms on the basis of understanding the mechanisms of human performance. 1Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California 2School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA 68. Visual motion area MT+ responds to auditory motion in early blind Fine 1, Alex Huth2, L.B. Lewis*, Christof Koch Much of the human brain cortex is devoted to visual processing, leading to the question of what happens to the visual cortex in people who are blind? Numerousstudies have demonstrated cross-modal responses toauditory and tactile stimuli within human visual cortex as aresult of early blindness. However, the mechanismsunderlying this cross-modal plasticity are still not wellunderstood. One critical question that has not yet been63 addressed is how these cross-modal responses within reorganized visual cortex map onto \"normal\" corticalorganization. Here we demonstrate an example of cross-modal plasticity in blind humans in which the reorganizedcortical visual area maintains its functional role. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that visual area MT+, well established for its role in visualmotion processing in sighted subjects, is selectivelyrecruited for auditory motion processing in early blindsubjects. We defined areas that responded selectively tomoving auditory stimuli in seven sighted subjects, twoformerly blind subject with partial sight recovery, and fiveearly-blind subjects. We verified area MT+ location(human medial temporal area, thought to be homologous tomacaque areas MT/V5 and MST) in the five sightedsubjects and two formerly blind subjects using a standardvisual MT+ localizer scan. Within both early blind subjects and formerly blind subjects we found significant responses to auditory motion within medial temporal areasthat were defined as area MT+ using a conjunction ofanatomical and functional criteria. Sighted subjects didnot show responses to auditory motion within MT+. These data suggest that area MT+ continues to fulfill its specialized computational role of motionprocessing, even in the absence of visual input. This is, toour knowledge, the first demonstration that cross-modalreorganization may map onto pre-existing functions ofcortex, suggesting an organizational principle behind cross-modal plasticity whereby cortical regions, despite receiving information from a novel modality, remain\"functionally constant.\" 1Department of Ophthalmology, Keck School of Medicine, USC 2SURF student, Caltech 69. Combined effects of spatial and deature-based AttentionMelissa Saenz, Geoff Boynton *, Christof Koch Spatial and feature-based attention are known to modulate cortical visual responses, but little is knownabout how these (or other) forms of attention interact whencombined. Using fMRI in humans, we measured theindividual and combined effects of spatial and feature-based attention in visual cortex. Subjects (n=5) viewedtwo circular apertures of moving random dots presented tothe left and right of central fixation. The test side had onefield of dots moving either upward or downward. Theother side had two overlapping fields of dots movingupward and downward. Subjects performed a threshold- level speed discrimination task on one of the three dot fields at a time. We measured the modulation of theresponse to the test field under three attention conditions. In the spatial condition (S), attention alternated betweenthe test field and the field with the same motion directionon the other side (block design). In the feature-basedcondition (F), attention alternated between the fields withthe same and opposite motion directions on the other side.In the S+F condition, attention alternated between the testfield and the field with the opposite direction on the other side. In areas V1, V2, V3, V3A, V4, both the attendedlocation and the attended feature (S+F) equaled the sum ofthat caused by changing the attended location (S) and theattended feature (F) alone. Thus, spatial and feature-based attention mutually reinforce their effects in the earliest stages of cortical visual processing. *Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA 70. Attention and consciousness: Two distinct brain processesChristof Koch, Naotsugu Tsuchiya * The relationship between attention and consciousness is a close one. In many cases, we becomeconscious of what we attend to. This leads many scholarsto conflate the two. We here summarize psychophysicalevidence arguing that top-down attention and consciousness are distinct phenomena that need not occur together and that can be manipulated using distinctpsychophysical paradigms. Subjects can becomeconscious of an isolated object, or the gist of the scene inthe near absence of top-down attention. Conversely,subjects can attend to perceptually invisible objects. Mostremarkable, top-down attention and consciousness canhave opposing effects. Such dissociations became easierto understand when one considers the different functionsof these two processes. *Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, Caltech 71. Dissociating microgenesis of retinal and non- retinal adaptationNaotsugu Tsuchiya 1, Lee A Gilroy2, Randolph Blake2, Christof Koch Negative afterimages have traditionally been ascribed to retinal adaptation, but recent studies suggestthat adaptation mediating afterimage formation occurs atmultiple levels of visual processing. Here, we use aninterocular suppression technique, called continuous flashsuppression (Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005), to dissociatemicrogenesis of retinal adaptation (which should be immune to suppression) from non-retinal adaptation (which is susceptible to suppression). We achieve this dissociation by holding retinal adaptation constant at 5 sec while manipulating theduration of suppression. Remarkably, presentation of five,brief flashes during the last 500 msec of adaptation wassufficient to reduce the magnitude of non-retinaladaptation by half. To quantify the strength ofsuppression, we used a forced-choice probe detection taskand found that as few as five successive, brief flashesinterfered with probe detection as much as continuous flash suppression. However, a single flash only exerted suppression within a narrow window of time between onset of theprobe and onset of the suppression figure; moreover, thesuppression from this single flash did not sum its effectwhen we paired flash suppression with conventionalbinocular rivalry suppression.64 This modified flash suppression technique provides a useful method for dissecting adaptation arisingwithin mechanisms at multiple visual processing levels. 1Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, Caltech 2Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University Reference Tsuchiya, N. and Koch, C.

Depth of interocular suppression associated with continuous flash suppression, flashsuppression, and binocular rivalryNaotsugu Tsuchiya 1, Christof Koch, Lee A Gilroy2, Randolph Blake2 When conflicting images are presented to the corresponding regions of the two eyes, only one imagemay be consciously perceived. In binocular rivalry, two images alternate in phenomenal visibility; even a salient image is eventually suppressed by an image of lowsaliency. Recently, (Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005) reported atechnique called continuous flash suppression (CFS),extending the suppression duration more than 10-fold.Here, we investigated the depth of this prolonged form ofinterocular suppression, as well as conventional binocularrivalry and flash suppression using a probe detection task.Compared to monocular viewing condition, CFS elevateddetection thresholds more than 20-fold, while binocularrivalry did so by 3-fold. In subsequent experiments, we dissected CFS into several components. By manipulating the number and timing of flashes with respect to the probe,we found that the stronger suppression in CFS is not due tosummation between binocular rivalry and flashsuppression, but is caused by the summation of thesuppression due to multiple flashes. Our results supportthe view that CFS is not a stronger version of binocularrivalry, but is due to the accumulated suppressive effectsof multiple flashes. 1Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, Caltech 2Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University Reference Tsuchiya, N. and Koch, C.

Continuous flash suppression reduces negative afterimagesNaotsugu Tsuchiya *, Christof Koch Illusions that produce perceptual suppression despite constant retinal input are used to manipulate visualconsciousness. Here we report on a powerful variant ofexisting techniques, continuous flash suppression. Distinct images flashed successively at ~10 Hz into one eye reliably suppress an image presented to the other eye. Theduration of perceptual suppression is at least ten timesgreater than that produced by binocular rivalry. Using thistool we show that the strength of the negative afterimageof an adaptor was reduced by half when it wasperceptually suppressed by input from the other eye. Themore likely the adaptor was completely suppressed, the larger the reduction of the afterimage intensity.Paradoxically, trial-to-trial visibility of the adaptor did notcorrelate with the degree of reduction. Our results implythat formation of afterimages involves neuronal structuresthat access input from both eyes, but that do not correspond directly to the neuronal correlates of perceptual awareness *Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, Caltech 74. The continuous wagon wheel Illusion is associated with changes in EEG power at 13HzRufin VanRullen 1, Leila Reddy2, Christof Koch Temporal subsampling of the perceptual stream can cause illusory reversals of the perceived motiondirection. This \"Wagon Wheel Illusion,\" most apparent inmovies or on television, can also be observed under continuous illumination, suggesting that our visual systems too might sample motion in a sequence of discrete epochs(Purves et al .,Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA , 1996). This phenomenon is bistable by nature, with the actual motiondirection generally dominating perception (Kline et al., Vis. Res . 2004). Psychophysics: Previously we reported that a motion energy model subsampling visual inputs at a ratebetween 10 and 20 Hz can quantitatively predict therelative durations of real and illusory percepts duringcontinuous viewing of the illusion (VanRullen et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2004). Here we use pairs of gratings drifting in opposite directions to investigate thiseffect. By way of these \"counterphase\" gratings of slightlydifferent contrasts, one can directly manipulate theambiguity of motion direction, and enhance the relativestrength of the illusory percept. We find that motiondirection judgments for these stimuli are selectivelyimpaired around 10 Hz, as predicted by the temporallysubsampled motion energy model. This impairmentvanished when focal attention was directed away from themotion stimulus: we used a dual-task paradigm to drawspatial attention to a stream of rapidly presented randomly rotated letters at the center of the grating. Under these conditions, simultaneous motion direction judgments werein fact better at 10 Hz than when attention was directed tothe motion itself. This is one of very few known instanceswere focal attention is found to impair performance.These results support the idea that, at least in somecircumstances, the visual system represents motion indiscrete epochs, and that this effect is mediated by focalattention. EEG: We then tested 12 observers who watched a rotating wheel (on a 160 Hz monitor, fast enough to avoid contamination by framing artifacts) for thirty, two- minute long trials. 32-channel EEG activity was recordedconcurrently. Subjects continuously reported theperceived direction of motion by pressing the arrows on akeyboard. Two stimulus temporal frequencies were used(7.5 and 10 Hz). Illusory motion occurred more than 30%of the time on average, consistent with previous reports.65 We separated periods of perceived actual and perceived illusory motion, and compared the EEG power spectrum(from 2 to 70 Hz) in these two conditions. The onlyreliable difference was observed over centro-parietalelectrodes at approximately 13 Hz: EEG power in thisrange was significantly higher (corrected for multiple comparisons across electrodes) during periods of perceived real motion than during illusory periods. This difference at13 Hz, and the corresponding scalp topography, wasobserved for both stimulus temporal frequencies, and thusprobably reflects internal processes rather than stimulus-related activity. 13 Hz EEG power decreased prior to theonset of illusory motion, and increased before transitionsback to real motion. Using this relation it was possible topredict above chance, on a trial-by-trial basis, the directionof the upcoming perceptual transition, with predictionaccuracy for some subjects above 70%. We discusspotential mechanisms for the generation of the illusion, and the relation to our previous model. 1CNRS, Centre de Recherche Cerveau et Cognition, Toulouse, 93(8):3693-3697. VanRullen et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2004. Poster presentation. Electrophysiological correlates of the continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion (c-WWI). We compared the power spectrum of the EEG during periods when subjects experienced real or illusory motion on a wheel rotating at a fixed frequency (the resultswere comparable when this frequency was 10Hz or when it was 7.5Hz). Even though the physical stimulus was identical inboth situations, one component of the power spectrum (and one only) differed significantly between the two conditions. Thiscomponent was centred around 13Hz, exactly as predicted by our model of the c-WWI based on periodic attentional samplingof motion information. The localization of this effect over right parietal regions is compatible with the known involvement of these regions in focusing attention to temporal events.66 75. Explicit and implicit processes in human aversive conditioningRonald McKell Carter, Christof KochThe ability to adapt to a changing environment is central to an organism's success. The process ofassociating two stimuli (as in associative conditioning) requires very little in the way of neural machinery. In fact, organisms with only a few hundred neurons showconditioning that is specific to an associated cue. Thistype of learning is commonly referred to as implicitlearning. The learning can be performed in the absence ofthe subject's ability to describe it. One example of learningthat is thought to be implicit is delay conditioning. Delay conditioning consists of a single cue (a tone, for example)that starts before, and then overlaps with, an outcome (likea pain stimulus). In addition to associating sensory cues, humans routinely link abstract concepts with an outcome. This more complex learning is often described as explicit since subjects are able to describe the link between the stimulusand outcome. An example of conditioning that requiresthis type of knowledge is trace conditioning . Trace conditioning includes a separation of a few secondsbetween the cue and outcome. Explicit learning is oftenproposed to involve a separate system, but the degree ofseparation between implicit associations and explicitlearning is still debated. We describe aversive conditioning experiments in human subjects used to study the degree of interaction that takes place between explicit and implicit systems. We do this in three ways. First, if a higher order task (in this casea working memory task) is performed during conditioning,it reduces not only explicit learning but also implicitlearning. Second, we describe the area of the braininvolved in explicit learning during conditioning andconfirm that it is active during both trace and delayconditioning. Third, using functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI), we describe hemodynamic activitychanges in perceptual areas of the brain that occur duringdelay conditioning and persist after the learned associationhas faded. From these studies, we conclude that there is a strong interaction between explicit and implicit learningsystems, with one often directly changing the function ofthe other. 76. Contingency awareness in conditioning involves the middle frontal gyrusRonald McKell Carter, Christof KochIn contrast to the wealth of data describing the neural mechanisms underlying classical conditioning, weknow remarkably little about the mechanisms involved in acquisition of explicit contingency awareness. Subjects variably acquire contingency awareness in classicalconditioning paradigms, in which they are able to describethe temporal relationship between a conditioned cue andits outcome. Previous studies have implicated thehippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the acquisition ofexplicit knowledge, although their specific roles remainunclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to track the trial-by-trial acquisition of explicit knowledgein a concurrent trace and delay-conditioning paradigm.We show that activity in bilateral middle frontal gyrus andparahippocampal gyrus correlates with the accuracy ofexplicit contingency awareness on each trial. In contrast, amygdala activation correlates with conditioned responses indexed by skin conductance responses (SCRs). Theseresults demonstrate that brain regions known to beinvolved in other aspects of learning and memory also playa specific role, reflecting on each trial the acquisition andrepresentation of contingency awareness. 77. Aversive conditioning results in persistent changes in the fusiform face areaRonald McKell Carter, Christof KochIn classical conditioning, an initially neutral stimulus acquires significance by being repeatedly paired with a stimulus that has affective value - such as an aversive shock. Studies on the neural basis of conditioninghave focused on the role of structures such as theamygdala in mediating learning of these associations. Afundamental question that has received less attention iswhether neural representations of the conditioned stimulusitself are modified through conditioning, and if so where inthe stimulus processing pathway such changes take place.Here, we address whether neural representations of aspecific class of visual stimuli: faces, can be modulated asa function of conditioning, and if so, whether such changes persist in extinction. We scanned xx human subjects using fMRI while undergoing a differential conditioning paradigm in whichpresentation of one of two faces was repeatedly pairedwith aversive shocks. Analysis of BOLD activity in thefusiform face area revealed increasing activity in this areato the conditioned face when compared to the neutral face.This is contrary to the phenomenon of repetitionsuppression where repeated presentations of a visualstimulus normally show decreased activation over time.Moreover, activity in this area is resistant to extinction,and persists well beyond diminution of conditioned skin conductance responses. We conclude that aversive conditioning results in an increase in representation of aconditioned visual stimulus that persists beyond theextinction of physiological fear responses.67 Summary of changes in face representation over conditioning and extinction. BOLD activity in the fusiform face area (displayed above in red) increases during acquisition of conditioning (displayed above in yellow). This activity is persistent throughout extinction of the conditioned association (displayed above in magenta). Activity is displayed using a lower threshold than previous figures (P<0.01 uncorrected) to indicate the extent of overlap. 78. Face identification in the near-absence of focal attention Leila Reddy, Lavanya Reddy, Christof Koch In contrast to artificial geometric shapes, natural scenes and face-gender can be processed even when spatialattention is not fully available. In this study, weinvestigate whether a finer discrimination, at the level ofthe individual, is possible in the near-absence of focalattention. Using the dual-task paradigm, subjectsperformed face-identification on faces of celebrities andrelatively unfamiliar individuals, along with a task that isknown to engage spatial attention. We find that face-identification performance is only modestly impaired under dual-task conditions. These results suggest that the visual system is well able to make complex judgments ofnatural stimuli, even when attention is not fully available. 79. Attention enhances stimulus-driven feedforward activity in human visual cortexFarshad fMRI response in striate and extrastriate areas even in the absence of retinal input. Itremains unclear whether stimulus-dependent activationalso increases with attention. We dissociated stimulus-dependent effects from changes in baseline response by directing attention either before, or after, a peripheral grating is displayed. Directing attention before stimulusonset should increase both baseline activity and theactivity evoked by the grating. Post-stimulus attentionshould increase baseline activity but not the activityevoked by the grating. Two square-wave gratings weredisplayed in the upper quadrants at 10 deg. A brief centralcue instructed subjects either to report the orientation ofone of the two gratings, or to perform a central demandingtask (control). The cue appeared 400 ms before or 250 ms after the onset of the stimuli. Seven observers participated. Directing attention to the peripheral gratings enhanced BOLD activity (measured in a 3.0T Siemens scanner) inV1-V4 compared to control conditions (Figure).Subjective discrimination and V4 BOLD activity weresignificantly enhanced conditionscompared attention pre-stimulus attention. Enhancement of V4response to the attended grating (despite less V1 activity inthe same condition) is in agreement with the hypothesisthat attention facilitates feed-forward sensory processing by increasing neural gain. A simple cascade model that assumes top-down attention increases both the gain and thebaseline BOLD activity in V1, V2/VP and V4quantitatively explains the results. Our findings areconsistent with single neuron recordings in monkeys andhuman visual event related potentials indicating thatselective facilitation of neural responses to stimulationmainly occurs in extra-striate cortices.68 Left: The profile of fMRI activity evoked by stimulation and attention. Right : The effect of cue timing on BOLD modulation (difference between pre- and post-cue conditions normalized to the average of the twoconditions) varies systematically along the visual hierarchy. 80. Deployment of feature-based top-down attention during visual search Ueli Rutishauser, Christof KochWhere the eyes fixate during search is not random; rather, gaze reflects an expectation of where thesubject expects the target to be. It is not clear, however,what information about a target is used to bias theunderlying neuronal responses. We engaged subjects in avariety of simple visual search tasks while tracking theireye moments. We derive a generative model thatreproduces these eye movements and calculate theconditional probabilities that observers fixate, given thetarget, on or near an item in the display sharing a specific feature with the target. We use these probabilities to infer which features were biased by top-down attention: colorseems to be the dominant stimulus dimension-guidingsearch, followed by object size and, lastly, orientation. Weuse the number of fixations it took to find the target as ameasure of task difficulty. We find that only a model thatbiases multiple feature dimensions in a hierarchicalmanner can account for the data. Contrary to commonassumptions, memory plays almost no role in searchperformance. Our model can be fit to average data ofmultiple subjects or to individual subjects. Small variations of a few key parameters account well for the inter-subject differences. The model is compatible withneurophysiological findings of V4 and FEP neurons andpredicts the gain modulation of these cells. 81. Is bottom-up attention useful for object recognition?Ueli Rutishauser, Dirk Walther, Christof Koch,Pietro Perona * A key problem in learning multiple objects from unlabeled images is that it is a priori impossible to tellwhich part of the image corresponds to each individual object, and which part is irrelevant clutter which is not associated to the objects. We investigate empirically towhat extent pure bottom-up attention can extract usefulinformation about the location, size and shape of objectsfrom images and demonstrate how this information can be utilized to enable unsupervised learning of objects from unlabeled images. Our experiments demonstrate that theproposed approach to using bottom-up attention is indeeduseful for a variety of applications. *Professor of Electrical Engineering, Caltech 82. What do we perceive in a glance of a real- world scene?Li FeiFei 1, Asha Iyer2, Christof Koch, Pietro Perona3 What do we see when we glance at a natural scene and how does this visual information change as the glance becomes longer? We asked nave subjects to report in a freeform text what they saw in real-life photographsthat were briefly presented to them. Our subjects receivedno specic information as to the content of each stimulus.Our paradigm differs from previous studies where subjectswere either cued before a picture was presented, and/orwere probed with multiple-choice questions. In the rst stage, a group of 22 native English-speaking subjects wereshown ninety novel grayscale photographs foveally. Thepresentation time was chosen at random in the set of sevenpossible times (from 27 msec to 500 msec). A perceptual mask followed each photograph immediately; subjects reported what they had just seen as completely as possible.In the second stage, another group of five naive individualsscored each of the descriptions produced by the subjects inthe rst stage. Individual scores were assigned to morethan a hundred different attributes. We show that within asingle glance, much object and scene level information isperceived by humans. But the richness of our perception isasymmetrical. Subjects have a bias to natural scenes beingperceived as outdoor rather than indoor. The reporting ofsensory or feature level information of a scene (such asshading, shape) consistently proceeds the reporting of the semantic level information. But once subjects recognize the more semantic level components of a scene, there islittle evidence suggesting a bias toward scene levelrecognition over object level recognition, or vice versa.69 1Department of Computer Science, Princeton University 2MD/PhD student in the Division of Biology 3Professor of Electrical Engineering, Caltech 83. Spatial priors and task dominate the relation between attention and recognition Wolfgang Einh\u00e4user, Merrielle Spain1, Pietro Perona2 In natural vision, humans sequentially attend to stimuli subsets for detailed serial processing. Nonetheless,observers can grasp the gist of a briefly presented scenewithout engaging attention. While recent studiesdemonstrate the usefulness of attentional models formachine vision in cluttered scenes, the details of therelation between attention and object recognition are notunderstood. Here we measure the relationship betweenobject recognition and human attention in complex scenes,under natural conditions. We assess human attention by measuring observer's gaze direction while they view artistic photographs; we assess human recognition byimmediate free recall of shown objects. To probe taskmodulation, some observers are additionally engaged in avisual search task during viewing. Using this setting, wedemonstrate: Basic fixation parameters such as fixationduration, the spatial spread of fixated locations, andsaccade length are significantly modulated by task. Theobjects recalled tend to be the objects fixated, with thelargest fraction of fixations on the object recalled first.Part of the relation between fixation and recall is explained by a general, task-dependent but stimulus-independent, spatial prior on fixation. We observe a task modulatedpeak in fixation frequency near object boundaries, which ismostly attributable to boundary shape, length, andposition. Our findings demonstrate that spatial priors andtask dominate the relation between attention and objectrecognition. 1Computation and Neural Systems, Caltech 2Professor of Electrical Graph-based visual saliency Jonathan Harel1, Pietro Perona2, Christof Koch Continuing in the now decades-old tradition [1], recent efforts have aimed at finding a fundamental quantitythat is most highly correlated with human visual attention(see, e.g., \"surprise\" or \"self-information\"). Thoughattractive in principle, the computation of a reasonableinterpretation of the quantity in practice typically requiresa thoughtful algorithm with many sub-components. Here,we first organize the topology of these varied approaches,so that they can be compared more rigorously: i.e., notjust end-to-end, but also piecewise, removing someuncertainty about the origin of observed performance differences. We then propose a new bottom-up saliency model, Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS), whichunifies the hitherto disparate problems of formingactivation maps on certain feature channels, and thennormalizing them in a way which highlights conspicuityand admits combination with other maps. The model issimple, and powerfully predicts human fixations on 749variations of 108 natural images, achieving 98% of the ROC area of a human-based control, whereas the classicalalgorithms of Itti and Koch [2], [3], achieve only 84%.We find experimentally that there are at least two reasonsfor this observed difference. The first observation is that itis an emergent property that GBVS promotes higher saliency values in the center of the image plane. We hypothesize that this \"center bias\" is favorable with respectto predicting fixations due to human experience both withphotographs, which are typically taken with a centralsubject, and with everyday life in which head motion oftenresults in gazing straight ahead. We conjecture that theother reason for the performance difference stems from therobustness of our algorithm with respect to differences inthe sizes of salient regions. Our model is extensible to multi-resolution representations for better performance, is biologicallyplausible, and naturally lends itself to parallel implementation. 1Graduate student in Electrical Engineering, Caltech 2Professor of Electrical Engineering, Caltech References [1] Koch, C. and Ullman, S.

Anatomical wiringdiagrams do help make functional predictions under somecircumstances. Although starting with primary sensoryfibers would seem logical, it is hard to predict how theresponse properties of neurons change even in the secondorder station. The predictions here do not meanforecasting of all possible combinations or grouping ofstimulus properties (such as frequency, amplitude, andtime in the auditory system) that are encoded by theprimary fibers but specific behaviorally meaningful configurations of the properties. What is the alternative then? We might start with \"complex\" neurons that areselective for behaviorally significant stimuli. The opinionthat such neurons do not exist for complex stimuli derivesfrom the implicit assumption that these neurons areisolated entities. Single neurons can be selective forcomplex stimuli such as faces. These \"complex\" neuronsrepresent the results of many processes that occur in serialand parallel pathways leading to them. We must, however,assume that these neurons are tractable, i.e., anatomicalconnections and physiological processes leading to themcan be determined. These pieces of information are not available for most of the complex neurons known today. The auditory system of barn owls is an exception amongvertebrate sensory systems, because we havesystematically investigated all stages of signal processingleading to the neurons that respond only to sounds arrivingfrom specific directions in space. In this academic year, two mathematically oriented members of our group, graduate student BjornChristianson and new postdoctoral fellow Brian Fischer,have carried out theoretical and computational analyses ofneuronal responses relevant to sound localization. Bjorn obtained his Ph.D. in 2006 and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University College, London, UK and JoseLuis Pe\u00f1a moved to the Albert Einstein College ofMedicine as assistant professor. We wish their success.85. Noise reduction of coincidence detector output by the inferior colliculus of the barn owlG. Bjorn Christianson, Jose Luis Pe\u00f1aA recurring theme in theoretical work is that integration over populations of similarly tuned neurons canreduce neural noise. However, there are relatively few demonstrations of an explicit noise reduction mechanism in a neural network. Here we demonstrate that thebrainstem of the barn owl includes a stage of processingapparently devoted to increasing the signal-to-noise ratioin the encoding of the interaural time difference (ITD), oneof two primary binaural cues used to compute the positionof a sound source in space. In the barn owl, the ITD isprocessed in a dedicated neural pathway that terminates atthe core of the inferior colliculus (ICcc). The actual locusof the computation of the before ICcc in the nucleuslaminaris (NL), and ICcc receives no inputs carryinginformation that did not originate in NL. Unlike in NL, the rate-ITD functions of ICcc neurons require as little as a single stimulus presentation per ITD to show coherent ITDtuning. ICcc neurons also displayed a greater dynamicrange with a maximal difference in ITD response ratesapproximately double that seen in NL. These resultsindicate that ICcc neurons perform a computationfunctionally analogous to averaging across a population ofsimilarly tuned NL neurons. 86. Sound localization behavior of the barn owl is consistent with a Bayesian estimator Brian Fischer The barn owl can localize single sound sources with great accuracy in both the horizontal and verticaldimensions. When localizing sound sources, the barn owlmust infer the direction of the source from the soundsignals received at the ears. Behavioral experiments showthat the barn owl uses the interaural time difference (ITD)for localization in the horizontal dimension and theinteraural level difference (ILD) for localization in thevertical dimension. The nature of the inference problemthat the owl faces depends on the relationship betweenlocations in space and these binaural cues. The spatial and frequency dependence of the localization cues ITD and ILD are revealed by makingdirect measurements of the sounds received at the barnowl's ears for sources in the environment. The qualitativepicture of the localization cues derived from directmeasurements is that ITD and ILD cues are quite complexfunctions of frequency that display spatial ambiguity. It isunclear what implications the spatial ambiguity of ITD andILD cues have on operations that must be performed bythe barn owl to support its localization of sound sources.Presently, theories suggest that a spectral matching operation underlies the derivation of spatial information from the auditory cues. However, there is yet to be acomputational model that reproduces the soundlocalization behavior the barn owl.72 Here we examined two models for the barn owl's sound localization behavior. We view the soundlocalization problem as a statistical estimation problemwhere direction estimates are derived from noisymeasurements of spectral ITD and ILD cues. Maximumlikelihood and Bayesian solutions to the estimation problem were compared with the localization behavior of a barn owl in a head turning task. Our analysis supports the Bayesian model of the barn owl's solution to the localization problem over themaximum likelihood model. For noise variances largeenough so that the maximum likelihood estimation errorincreased at the periphery, in accordance with the barnowl's behavior, the error also increased significantly in thecentral region of space. This non-monotonic shape to themaximum likelihood error with a large central peak is notconsistent with the performance of the barn owl in thehead turning task. In the Bayesian case, it was possible to find a Gaussian prior to produce a maximum a posteriori estimator with performance that matched the barn owl'sbehavioral performance. For the maximum a posterioriestimator, the error was smallest in the central region ofspace and increased at the periphery. The maximum likelihood solution corresponds to a spectral cue matching operation, while the Bayesiansolution uses a combination of spectral matching with abias toward central locations. The performance of theestimators suggests that spectral matching models will notbe sufficient to explain sound localization behavior in the barn owl and that an additional mechanism for resolving ambiguities in ITD and ILD must be considered. The maximum likelihood model failed because of the nature of the spatial ambiguity in the ITD and ILDcues. As expected, directions near each other have similarcues. In addition to similarity of cues between proximaldirections, distant directions can have similar ITD and ILDcues. The result of ambiguity between distant directions isthat noise in measuring localization cues can lead to largeerrors in direction estimation, as seen in the maximumlikelihood estimate. In particular, source directions in thecentral region of space are often mistaken for directions with similar horizontal position, but extreme peripheral vertical positions. While it is clear from behavioral teststhat the barn owl does not confuse central locations withperipheral locations, there is not enough published data todetermine if the owl confuses directions having peripheralelevations (elevation > 80 deg.) with directions in thecenter of space. Further experiments are required to testthis prediction of the Bayesian model. 87. Combination of interaural time and level differences in ICcl Brian Fischer Space-specific neurons in the barn owl's space map derive their spatial selectivity from tuning toparticular ranges of the interaural time difference (ITD)and the interaural level difference (ILD). Subthresholdresponses of space-specific neurons suggest that thecomputation underlying the convergence of ITD and ILDis multiplication. This makes the barn owl's auditory system an ideal model system to study the generallyimportant question of how neural systems performmultiplication. A prerequisite to studying the biophysicalbasis of multiplicative responses in space-specific neuronsis to determine the nature of neural responses to ITD and ILD at the initial site of convergence of ITD and ILD in the lateral shell of the central nucleus of the inferiorcolliculus (ICcl). Towards this aim, we recordedextracellularly the spiking responses of single ICcl neuronsto ITD and ILD in broadband noise signals Following Pe\u00f1a and Konishi [2001], ITD-ILD interaction. The majority (84/89) ofthe ICcl spiking responses were better described by themultiplicative model than the additive model. While themultiplicative model better describes the data than does the additive model for most cells, there are properties of the neural responses to ITD and ILD that are not consistentwith pure multiplication. ICcl neurons showed shifts ofthe preferred ITD with ILD, and vice versa, and displayedITD tuning curves for different ILD that differed by anadditive bias. These results show that the combination ofITD and ILD in ICcl is primarily nonlinear, but thatresponses are not as clearly multiplicative as in space-specific neurons.

We are particularlyinterested in understanding the role of time,synchronization and oscillations in information coding and in relating the biophysical properties of neurons and synapses to the function of the networks in that they areembedded. We, therefore, study the cellular, synaptic andnetwork aspects of neural processing. We focused ourresearch this year on the olfactory system of insects(antennal lobes and mushroom bodies, circuits analogousto vertebrate and anterior/posteriorpiriform cortices), using locusts, Drosophila and honeybees as primary model systems. Our work combinesexperimental (behavioral, electro-physiological and twophoton imaging), and modeling techniques and aims atunderstanding functional aspects of brain circuits design and the rules of information coding used by the nervous system. Identity-specific responses with varying degreesof concentration invariance. The tuning of KCs to identityand concentration and the patterning of their responses areconsistent with piecewise decoding of their PN inputs overoscillation-cycle length epochs. 88. Odor processing in the locust Benjamin RubinThe discovery of odor-induced oscillations in the locust brain* inspired a series of studies that have made the locust olfactory system a model for studying how information is represented and transformed across brainareas, and in particular for studying the role of neuronaloscillations in these processes. The majority ofinvestigations of this system have focused on the ~800projection neurons (PNs) of each targets, a population of ~50,000 Kenyon cells (KCs) located in the mushroom body (MB). These studieshave provided considerable insight into how multiplefactors (including the firing properties of PNs, PN-to-KCfunctional connectivity, cellular properties of KCs, andfeed-forward inhibition of KCs) cooperate in transforming the highly dynamic and dense PN odor responses into specific and sparse KC responses. Our ability to integrate our knowledge of this system, however, has been limited by three factors. First,no study has been made of how PN and KC populationsrespond to a wide variety of chemically similar anddisparate odors - stimuli that have been instrumental inrevealing olfactory coding principles in other animals.Second, investigations in which other stimulus parameterssuch as odor concentration, duration and mixtures havebeen varied are not directly comparable due to non-uniform experimental conditions. Third, since datasets across experiments cannot be combined, and no single experiment has sampled more than 150 PNs or KCs,questions that can only be addressed with larger datasetshave remained unanswered. We plan to bridge these gapsby producing an extensive dataset of many hundreds ofPNs and KCs recorded under uniform conditions inresponse to widely varying odor stimuli. To this end, wehave designed and built a computer-controlled odordelivery system capable of delivering up to 169 odors andare in the midst of constructing the aforementionedphysiological dataset (Figure 1). While the overarching goal of this work is to produce a model that codifies and challenges our understanding of the system, this study willallow us to address specific coding questions whilecreating a dataset that will be used to answer additionalquestions that will undoubtedly arise along the way.

Turner, Gilles Laurent The mushroom body (MB) of the insect brain is essential for olfactory learning and memory. We are usingelectrophysiological techniques to study odorrepresentations in the MB of Drosophila, an insect with established olfactory conditioning paradigms and geneticvariants with specific learning and memory defects. Ourgoal is to determine how odors are represented in a brainarea involved in learning. We have used whole cell patchclamp recordings to characterize the odor responseproperties of the Kenyon cells (KCs), the principal neuronsof the MB. All recorded KCs were spiking neurons andfired sodium action potentials in response to current injection. In the absence of odor stimulation KCs showed significant ongoing synaptic activity. Baseline firing rates,however, were extremely low. Odor presentationincreased subthreshold synaptic activity, but the overallprobability of a spiking response to a given odor was only~5%. Thus, KCs are highly odor selective compared totheir inputs, the antennal lobe (AL) projection neurons,which have a 50% probability of response (1). A similartransformation from dense representations in the AL tosparse representations in the MB was first observed inlocust (2). A sparse format minimizes overlap between therepresentations of similar stimuli and could contribute to the accuracy of memory formation and recall. We are currently examining the mechanisms responsible for thistransformation. Although periodic phase-laggedexcitatory-inhibitory synaptic inputs to KCs are essentialfor sparse representations in locust, we do not find strongevidence for such oscillations in Drosophila. We are examining the contribution of other mechanisms including:i) fast synaptic kinetics; ii) spike threshold and, iii) phasic,non-oscillatory inhibition.Support contributed Jane Coffin Childs Foundation, Swartz Sloan Foundation, NIDCD References(1) Wilson, R. et al.

We intend to characterize a synaptic transfer function in C.elegans , to explore how the dynamic range of the post- synaptic response is set, and to understand the mechanismsfor integration and gain control in this system. In order to address these questions, one needs a controlled, precise way of stimulating the presynaptic cell.Channelrhodopsin (ChR2), a light activated cation channelhas been used to obtain genetically targeted optical controlof neural activity, with a timescale of milliseconds [1]. , light-activation of neurons and muscles expressing ChR2 has been shown to evoke behavioralresponses [2]. Our plan is to use cell-specific promoters to express ChR2 in the presynaptic cell and gfp in the postsynaptic cell, and monitor cellular activity usingwhole-cell patch clamp. We selected the AFD-AIY synapse based on criteria including the following: A demonstratedbehavioral relevance of the synapse, an absence offeedforward connections and direct feedback, and thepresence of unique cell-specific promoters. AFD is athermosensory neuron that measures the differencebetween ambient temperature and preferred temperature(temperature of cultivation). Imaging studies from AFD [3] indicate that AFD can phase-lock its calcium dynamics to oscillatory thermosensory inputs. AIY is an interneuronthat is the primary postsynaptic partner of AFD. It alsoreceives input from chemosensory neurons ASE, AWAand AWC. AIY is responsesto stimuli transduced thoughAFD, ASE and AWA [4].75 Since ChR2 allows millisecond-timescale, targeted control of stimulus, with electrophysiology itshould be possible to obtain temporally preciseinformation about the dynamics of the synaptic transferfunction between AFD and AIY. This is the first steptowards understanding the functional dynamics of neural sub-circuits in C. elegans. *Professor, Division of Biology, [1] Boyden, E.S., Zhang, F., Bamberg, E., overlapping odor sequences Bede M. Broome*, projection neurons (PNs)\u2014the mitral cellanalogs. These patterns evolve over hundreds ofmilliseconds and contain information about odor identityand concentration. In nature, animals often encountermany odorants in short temporal succession. We exploredthe effects of such conditions by presenting two different odors with variable intervening delays. PN-ensemble representations tracked stimulus changes and, in somedelay conditions, reached states that corresponded neitherto the representation of either odor alone, nor to the binarymixture of the two. We then recorded from Kenyon cells(KCs), the PNs' targets. Their responses were consistentwith the PN population's behavior: in some conditions,KCs were recruited that did not fire during single-odor ormixture stimuli. Thus, PN-population dynamics arehistory dependent, and responses KCs areconsistent with piecewise temporal decoding of PN outputover the PN population. *Equal contributors Publication Broome, B.M., Jayaraman, V. and Laurent, G.

Simultaneous electrophysiology and two- photon imaging of olfactory projectionneurons in intact fruit flies Vivek Jayaraman Genetically encoded optical indicators hold the promise of enabling non-invasive monitoring of activity inidentified neurons in a behaving organism. Theinterpretation of images of brain activity produced usingsuch sensors is, however, problematic, and may be thesource of seemingly contradictory findings in Drosophilaolfaction. At issue is the breadth of odor tuning of projection neurons (PNs), the output neurons of theantennal lobe (the insect analog of the mammalianolfactory bulb). in a calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein named G-CaMP 1 in PNs. They interpreted the selective G-CaMP responses they recorded to mean that PNs are rathernarrowly tuned to odors, and suggested that a given PN'sresponses directly reflect the uniglomerular input itreceives from its olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) 2. This is in contrast to evidence from in vivo whole-cell recordings suggesting that PNs are more broadly tuned,consistent with a transformation of OSN input by theantennal lobe circuitry 3. A different group using G-CaMP expressed in Kenyon cells, targets of the PNs, hassuggested that odors evoke sparse, stereotyped andspatially restricted responses in these neurons 4, a finding that is consistent with electrophysiological data5. In both sets of imaging experiments however, it is unclear whatelectrophysiological signal the imaging signal beingmeasured corresponds to. The narrow odor tuning seen inthese imaging experiments could, for example, be a resultof the relatively high threshold of activation of G-CaMP 6,7. We are attempting to resolve such issues by performing simultaneous 2-photon imaging andelectrophysiology of G-CaMP expressing PNs in an intact,in vivo adult fly preparation. For our electrophysiological recordings in PNs, we use both loose-patch 8 and intracellular (sharp electrode) techniques. In our current experiments, we are trying to establish the correlationbetween physiology and G-CaMP signal in PN somata.Imaging in the soma, we find that G-CaMP faithfullyreports sustained (e.g., >1 sec) activity at rates higher than50Hz, albeit with very slow kinetics. However, it is unableto detect sustained activity at rates below 30Hz or higher-rate activity if it is not sustained (e.g., 50Hz for 200 msec). Our results suggest that while this sensor can beuseful for the identification of neural targets for morerefined exploration of a functional circuit, it could bemisleading if used as the sole means to assess activity in a population of neurons. More generally, the methodology we have developed enables any genetically encoded sensors,activators or silencers to be precisely calibrated in an intactfly and in the very neurons that they are likely to be usedin, something that is crucial given the likely cell-type-dependent variability of their function. Calibrated use ofsuch fast-improving technology is likely to be ofconsiderable value to systems neuroscience. References 1. Nakai, J. et al. (2001) Nature Biotechnol. 19:137-141. 2. Wang, J.W. et al.

Functional organization of the central complex in an insect brain Cindy Chiu The central complex is a midline neuropil brain structure that is present in most insects. Its most strikingfeature is a three-dimensional matrix structure whichinterconnects the left and right hemispheres through anordered set of chiasmata. 1,2. Although the intrinsic anatomy of the central complex is well-mapped, the input-output connectivity of this region is poorly understood.Based on behavioral studies of Drosophila melanogaster central complex mutants and a small number ofelectrophysiology recordings in locusts, the centralcomplex has been implicated in \"higher order\" brainfunctions including integration of visual sensory information and regulation of motor-related activities. 3,4,5 Additionally, its systematic inter-hemispheric connectivity points to a role in mapping external space and integratingthis information across the left and right hemispheres.Despite these tantalizing possibilities, the essentialfunction of the central complex remains elusive. My goal is to elucidate the functional organization of the central complex. To date, there are fewelectrophysiological data of central complex neurons.Given the broad range of possible inputs to this structure, Ihave chosen a battery of diverse, ethologically relevant stimuli. Currently, I am assembling an electrophysiology rig that includes an arena of visual, auditory, olfactory, andmechanosensory stimuli. Using this broad-based stimulusrepertoire, I (1) Characterize using intracellularmethods the electrophysiological and anatomicalproperties of individual central complex neurons; (2)examine the physiological responses of central complexneurons during orientation behaviors and, (3) investigatethe circuit properties of the central complex system byPrecording from neural ensembles. I have chosen for mymodel organism the field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus , because it is amenable to in vivo intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology methods, and it exhibits robust behaviors that can be studied in laboratoryconditions.Support contributed by the Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation.

(2004) the Drosophila mushroom body Mala MurthyOver the past year, I have investigated the logic of neuronal connectivity in the Drosophila mushroom body, a higher order brain center required for complex processes such as learning and memory. The mushroom body (MB) is important for olfactory learning: Molecules implicatedin learning are concentrated in the MB, mutants thatdisrupt these molecules have defects in memory formation,and anatomical studies have shown that experience caninduce substantial structural transformations. Suchplasticity suggests that odor representations by Kenyoncells (KCs), the neurons that comprise the MB, by theirtargets, or both, could change within the lifetime of eachanimal or across animals. Further, KCs belong to largepopulations (2,500 in Drosophila ; 300,000 in cockroaches; millions in the related arthropod Limulus ) of similar neurons: morphological and molecular subtypes have been described, but identifiable individuals have not. Yet, theneurons from which they receive olfactory input, theprojection neurons (PNs), are unambiguously identifiable,by virtue of their restricted projections to individualantennal lobe glomeruli, expression of molecular markers,and odor responses. In the Drosophila MB, there is conflicting evidence regarding anatomical and functionalstereotypy, and it is not known if the matrix of connectionsbetween PNs and KCs is predetermined, thus giving rise tostereotyped odor responses within identifiable KCs, or if this matrix of connections is more random, thus varying across individuals. The extent to which KCs aredeterministically stereotyped affects how experience andlearning may modify odor representations within the MB.To address this question of stereotypy, I have beenconducting in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp KCs in Drosophila melanogaster , in order to record from the same cell or cells across genetically identical flies. Answering this questionwith KCs will inform what could be expected with largersystems of neurons in other organisms. In the fruit fly, the mushroom body is derived from four neuroblasts, and by divisions through the embryonic, larval and pupal stages, each neuroblastgenerates ~500 neurons per clonal unit. Each cluster can be subdivided into three KC classes (\u0001/\u0002,\u0003, and \u0001'/\u0002') based on adult axonal projection patterns and birth order. The Drosophila GAL4/UAS system allows for spatial control over transgene expression, based on the promoterregulating the GAL4 insert. Many labs have identifiedGAL4 lines with expression in the MB, and I havescreened through 60 such GAL4 lines for those with veryrestricted KC expression. GAL4 line NP7175 is expressed in (23.6\u00b13.3 KCs per neuroblastclonal unit; 20 clonal units counted) that project to the core of the \u0001/\u0002 lobes. Moreover, each of the four clonal units can be distinguished based on the position of somata and the region of the MB calyx innervated by their dendrites, which allows for identification of the same ~23 cells across flies. In order to sample at least three duplicate77 KCs, I have recorded from 18 KCs from the left hemisphere, lateral posterior (L, LP) ofNP7175 GAL4; UAS eGFP2x/Cyo old females,raised under identical conditions. Even assuming thatthere are as many as 30 cells per clonal unit (the maximumnumber of cells counted for an NP7175 clonal unit), 18 recordings results in >99% probability of sampling at leasttwo cells twice. I have studied the odor tuning of KCsstimulated with 43 odors (12 odors at three concentrations,plus control odors) and have confirmed cell identity withintracellular labeling. Because neuronal responses in KCsare sparse, that is responses are elicited by only a smallpercentage of odors, KCs can easily be identified both bytheir spiking and subthreshold activity in response toodors. For comparison, I have also recorded from 7GFP- labeled KCs from other clonal units and 15 non- GFP-labeled KCs, whose cell bodies are adjacent to L, LPNP7175 KCs, but whose axons project to disparate regions of the MB lobes. I have begun to characterize KCs based on the following four criteria: 1) The morphology of axonbranches, reconstructed from biocytin fills; 2) the presenceof spikes during the odor response period, and the rate andtiming of spikes if present; 3) subthreshold responsesduring the odor response period (i.e., dynamics ofmembrane depolarization); and, 4) rank orders of responsestrength to the odors tested. Thus far, I do not findevidence for replicates among cells from the same clonalunit, suggesting that KCs are not stereotyped. The preliminary implication of these findings is either that individual KCs connect with a different subset of PNs inevery fly or that synaptic weights are set differently amonga constant matrix of PN to KC connections. To follow up these results, I am currently investigating the possibility that NP7175 KCs from the L, LP clonal unit, while not stereotyped, may possess odorresponse profiles that are more similar to one another thanto KCs that project to other regions of the MB. Inaddition, it is possible that while NP7175 KCs are notstereotyped, other KCs are, and for this reason, I haveidentified a second GAL4 driver that labels a distinct small subset of KCs, to determine if KCs that project to other regions of the MB lobes are similarly lacking in responsestereotypy. Finally, I have conducted similar recordingson identifiable projection neurons across many flies. Ihave recorded from PNs that innervate antennal lobeglomerulus DL1, in response to a panel of approximately12 odors. Because PNs have been shown to bestereotyped, this control will serve to validate my methodsof analysis on the KCs. While a lack of stereotypy in KCs is interesting, an absence of a functional map in the MB would make it nearly impossible to undertake experiments focused on long-term plasticity and learning in KCs. I have, therefore,begun to investigate neurons that are postsynaptic to theKCs, the MB extrinsic neurons. In this vein, we havegenerated several fly lines that label MB extrinsic neuronswith eGFP and with GCaMP, a genetically-encodedcalcium sensor. Future research will be focused oncharacterizing odor responses in these cells, anddetermining how experience can modify these responses.In addition to my results on stereotypy, I have observed,consistent with results from the Laurent lab in the locust,that some KCs are concentration selective, while otherKCs are odor selective, but respond to all concentrations tested. Behavioral experiments in flies have shown that valence is correlated with concentration for many odors,and it will be of interest to determine how MB extrinsicneurons read out this concentration specific information.Ultimately, it will be important to screen for GAL4 linesthat label neurons postsynaptic to the extrinsic neurons, tounderstand how sensory perception results in behavioralchoices for the fly. 95. Plasticity of olfactory representations in zebrafish larvae Jonathan Young We are interested in the question of olfactory circuit plasticity: Does the representation of an odor object change over the life history of the animal, and what impactdoes this have on olfactory computation? The zebrafishlarva provides a vertebrate model system for studyingolfaction that offers the advantages of completetransparency, complex behavior, established genetics, andexternal development, which are the properties needed toinvestigate this question. Work has already previouslybeen done in this lab to characterize the responses of mitralcells in the adult zebrafish olfactory bulb. We will use the larval form of the zebrafish to study olfactory learning and circuit development. Using a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and calcium imaging techniques, wewill investigate the capabilities of the larval olfactorysystem to learn and change through development, andobserve how these changes are encoded in both the activityof the olfactory bulb and the behavioral responses of theanimal. We will aversively condition fish to odors whilesimultaneously either imaging calcium activity in theolfactory bulb using two photon microscopy or doingelectrophysiological recording from mitral cells. We hope to be able to observe changes in the activity of the mitral cell population of the olfactory bulb during olfactorylearning and development, and gain an understanding ofthe circuit mechanisms underlying these processes. 96. Processing of multisensory information in the honeybee central complex Mikko V\u00e4h\u00e4s\u00f6yrinki The success of an individual depends upon accurately determining and executing the appropriatebehavior based on sensory information gathered from the surroundings. How does the nervous system extract biologically relevant information from a complexmultisensory environment to generate adaptive behaviors?To address this question my research is focused onstudying the neuronal representation of olfactory andvisual information ( mellifera M. ) central complex.78 The central complex (CX) is a prominent, bilateral, invariable structure in the center of insect brain. Although earlier studies have demonstrated its role inhigher motor control and visually guided behavior 1,2, functions of this brain area are poorly understood and thecorresponding neuronal mechanisms largely unknown. The CX comprises two major subdivisions: The protocerebral bridge and the central body, which can itselfbe further subdivided into an upper and lower division anda pair of globular noduli. Interestingly, the CX isorganized horizontal layersintersected by vertical columns (Figure 1a). Thisorganization, together with its central location in the brain,suggests some involvement in the bilateral integration ofsignals across both hemispheres and provides an intriguingmodel system for studying information processing inneural networks. I have developed an experimental setup and an in vivo preparation that allow electrophysiological recordings while stimulating bees with visual and olfactory stimuli.My current focus is to establish a basic functionalcharacterization of main types of central complex neuronsby doing intracellular recordings with fluorescent dyeinjections (Figure 2). This information will also form thebasis for cell-type identification from extracellularmultiple single-unit recordings with tetrodes. Theseexperiments are aimed at providing a network-leveldescription of multisensory processing in the honeybeecentral complex. References 1. Homberg, U.

Decoding the sparse representations of the locust mushroom body Stijn Cassenaer The insect mushroom body (MB) is used as a model system to address several questions of general neurobiological interest such as sensory discrimination, multi-modal integration, the control of complex behavioralrepertoires, as well as learning and memory 1. Among these, the role of the MB in olfaction and memory hasreceived considerable attention. A number of studies haveaddressed how olfactory information reaches the MB andhow it is transformed along the way 2,3. A particularly dramatic transformation occurs between the antennal lobe(AL) and the MB. Whereas, odor representations in theAL are densely distributed and dynamic, only one synapsefurther downstream, odor representations are sparse, comprised of brief activation of a small fraction of the MB intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells, KCs). This sparserepresentation should be advantageous for learning andmemory, as it reduces the number of synapses that need tobe modified and the number of comparisons necessary forpattern matching 4. There are several lines of evidence that implicate the synaptic contacts between KCs and theirdownstream targets in memory storage and recall 5. In order to address the question of how the sparse representations carried by KCs are decoded and furthertransformed before leaving the MB, we are investigating the cells that take KC activity as their input, the MB extrinsic cells. There appear to be several distinct celltypes within this population that differ most obviouslywith respect to the neuropils they invade 6,7. We are characterizing these neurons in terms of their physiologicaland morphological properties by means of intracellular andtetrode recordings, as well as extracellular stimulation andpressure-microinjection. We are investigating how odorsare represented by this population, how efficacious theKC-extrinsic cell synapses are, how they can be modified,and how the extrinsic cells integrate their KC inputs.79 References 1.

Role of inhibition of the giant GABAergic neuron in the mushroom body Maria Papadopoulou, Glenn Turner The giant GABAergic neuron (GGN) is a non- spiking neuron that arborizes extensively in the mushroombody (MB) to contact the dendrites of Kenyon cells (KCs)(Leitch and Laurent, 1996), neurons required for learningand memory (Heisenberg, 2000). We are interested incharacterizing the functional role of GGN in the olfactorycircuit because its pattern of connectivity makes it anattractive candidate for modulating KC responses withpotential implications for learning and memory. Physiological recordings of KCs in locust have shown these cells to represent odors sparsely despite receivingcontinuous, dense and slowly evolving excitatory inputfrom antennal lobe projection neurons (Perez-Orive et al. , 2002). Inhibition appears to be important for thesparseness and brevity of the KC response, because itcontributes to odor-induced oscillations of the KCmembrane potential that create a narrow window of KCtemporal integration of excitatory input (Perez-Orive et al, 2002). While part of the source of inhibition has beenidentified, we are interested in elucidating the role of theodor-evoked GGN inhibition in the sparseness and synchrony of KC responses. More specifically, the goal is to determine the role of the graded aspect of the odor-evoked GGN response to increasing odor concentrationand its functional consequences for the KC populationresponse. This work could have implications for learningand memory since sparseness in the KCs has beensuggested as a mechanism to facilitate storing andhandling of memories (Perez-Orive et al., 2002).

Population coding of odor mixtures of increasing complexity by principal neurons ofthe antennal lobe Kai Shen, Gilles LaurentIn nature, animals rarely encounter stimuli in isolation and must often extract meaningful information from complex odor mixtures. Understanding how the brain treats such complex stimuli is complicated by theobservation that olfaction is a synthetic sense. Unlikevision, where we can easily parse out the individual linesin a Kadinsky painting, in olfaction, we can identifyindividual components in a mixture, but only if less thanthree-four odors are mixed together. How then, does thebrain code odor mixtures? I address this question using electrophysiological methods. Currently, I am examining how the Antennallobe and Mushroom body (first and second relay in thelocust brain) code odor mixtures. Experiments involve inserting electrodes into the respective brain regions of the locust and recording the electrical activity (extra-cellularspikes) of neurons in those regions, while presenting odormixtures of increasing degrees of complexity to theanimal. By looking for structure and pattern in theresulting high dimensional data set (consisting of thespiking activity of many neurons), I hope to uncover theunderlying circuit dynamics of the system. We recorded the single-unit activity of ensembles of projection neurons (PNs), the principal cells of theantennal lobe, and Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic cells of the mushroom body, as well as the local field potential (LFP) within the mushroom body, while presentingmixtures of monomolecular odors. First, we examined theevolution of PN ensemble response patterns as wesystematically varied the ratio of concentrations of twocomponents within a binary mixture. Applying principalcomponent analysis for dimensionality reduction of the PNpopulation response, we observed that responses todifferent mixtures formed distinct clusters and varied in anonlinear manner with odor ratio. We applied locallylinear embedding to visualize the time-varying dynamicsof the PN ensemble as a function of the ratio of odor components. Second, we estimated the ensemble PN response vectors to odor mixtures by adding the responsevectors corresponding to the mixture components. Wethen examined the degree of deviation between theseestimated response vectors and the experimentallyobserved response vectors as the number of odorantswithin the mixture increased from 2 to 3, 4, 5, and 8.Finally, we examine the degree to which theserepresentations mirror the responses of the targets of thePNs in the mushroom body, the KCs. This will give usinsights into what exactly happens in the brain when we encounter a very complicated odor mixture.80 100. Stimulus tuned criticality, short-term memory and optimized computation in the olfactory systemIngmar Riedel Kruse I want to understand how neuronal networks can learn to optimally perform computational tasks based on their network topology and neuronal dynamics - a central question in systems-neurobiology. I will study the antenna lobe (AL) in the locust olfactory system - a neuronal network carrying out highlydynamic odor discrimination tasks. Repeated odorencounters tune the neurons in the AL towards an odorspecific synchronous oscillatory firing pattern. This tuningis a form of unsupervised learning (or short-term memory).Transient spontaneous oscillations are still present whenthe odor stimulus is absent, which strongly suggests to methat this system is close to criticality. Systems close to criticality show strong non- linear behavior and have, therefore, been proposed to beoptimal sensors with high sensitivity and large dynamicrange. One of the rare biological examples withconvincing evidence for this proposition is hearing, werethe self-tuning mechanism of the hair-bundle is close to anoscillatory instability. In abstract analogy to hearing I will: (1) experimentally test whether the AL truly utilizescriticality; (2) experimentally investigate how criticalityfacilitates odor discrimination and memory formation; and(3) develop a theoretical model to understand advantages and limitations of criticality in the AL. I will learn and apply single and multi-neuronal recording techniques and combine them with my experimental and theoretical expertise gained fromworking on the dynamics of other complex biologicalsystems outside neurobiology. My work aims forconceptual new insight into olfactory processing, memoryformation and the role of the widely observed oscillatoryactivity in neuronal networks.

We have analyzed severalstrains of knock-in mice generated in our laboratory for the nicotinic \u00024 receptor, and these have resulted in interesting insights into nicotine addiction. We find that activation of \u00024-containing receptors by nicotine is sufficient for tolerance, sensitization, and reward behavior. The nicotinic receptor work is enhanced by a promising new knock-in strain, with fluorescent \u00024 receptors. We are beginning to understand the nicotine-dependent, cell type- specific increase in receptor levels, and how this increase produces some aspects of nicotine addiction. The group's research has been enhanced during the past year by two new microscopes: a Nikon spectrallyresolved confocal system, and TIRF capabilities for an existing wide-field instrument. The TIRF capabilities arebeing extended to single molecule resolution. The\u00024 nicotinic receptor, or its partner, the \u00032 subunit, are mutated in a rare series of human epilepsies. We studied the nAChR epilepsy mutations in oocyteexpression systems and, in collaboration with other labs,are constructing knock-in mouse strains that also have these mutations. Another \u00024 knock-in strain, the Leu9'Ser, presents a model system for studying neurodegenerative disease. Our work on selective silencing of mammalian neurons has generated a promising set of techniques andreagents based on ligand-activated chloride channels. Incollaboration with the David Anderson laboratory, we arenow completing the initial experiments on \"proof of concept\" silencing in mice; and with the group of Herwig Baier at the University of California, San Francisco, tozebrafish. We continue our joint work with the Dougherty group, in Caltech's Chemistry Division, on aspects of ionchannel structure function. We have brought noveltechniques to these studies, including mass spectrometryand fluorescence. We also concentrate on unnaturalamino-acid mutagenesis. We have now found that a cation-\u0001 interaction helps agonists bind to several cys-loop receptors\u2014for acetylcholine, serotonin, and GABA. employing the we are measuringindividual nicotinic receptors containing unnaturalflorescent side-chains. With the Dougherty group and with Neurion Pharmaceuticals in Pasadena, we have started to analyzethe binding of blocking drugs to the hERG potassium channel, also using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. The channel is important because it underlies manyinstances of drug-induced long-QT syndrome. We areworking hard to incorporate unnatural amino acids into thehERG channel when expressed in mammalian cells, wherethe pharmacology of blockade is much more similar to thatin heart muscle. Our work continues on quantitative aspects of transporter function, primarily measured with fluorescenceand with knock-in mice. We are using fluorescence toanalyze the mobility of GABA transporters, and both confocal and TIRF modes. As an interesting side benefit of the GABA transporter knock-in mouse, we havegenerated and analyzed a knockout mouse for the samemolecule. Our group's home page has additional up- to-date information, images, and notices of positions. It's athttp://www.cco.caltech.edu/~lester.82 101. The role of cation- \u0001 interactions in nicotinic receptor activation Jai A.P. Shanata*, Bruce N. Cohen, Dennis A. Dougherty*, Henry A. Lester Our previous results show that a cation- \u0001 interaction between the agonist acetylcholine (ACh) and a tryptophan residue ( \u0002W149) in extracellular domain of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) dramatically enhances the ability of ACh to activate thisreceptor. To activate a receptor, the agonist must first bind to it and then induce the conformational change(s) leading to activation. To determine which of these steps the cation-\u0001 interaction at residue \u0002W149 primarily affects, we expressed and mono-fluorinated nAChRs their single-channel activity in cell-attached patches with 300 \u00b5M ACh. We previously found that modifying the cation- \u0001 interaction at residue \u0002W149 by fluorinating this residue (5-F-W149) reduces the ACh sensitivity (i.e., increases the EC 50) of the muscle nAChR six-fold. Analyses of our single-channel kinetic data showthis mutation reduced the ACh gating equilibrium constant (\u0006)less than twofold, far short of the 36-fold decrease required to account for the six-fold increase in EC 50 (EC 50 ~\u0006-1/2). In contrast, fits of the WT and 5-F-W149 mutant single-channel data to a four-state kinetic model with three agonist-bound closed states suggest that the 5-F-W149mutant reduced the apparent forward rate constant forAch-binding seven-fold, enough to account for the effectsof tryptophan fluorination on the EC 50, but this rate constant could also reflect rapid desensitization of thereceptor rather than agonist binding. Thus, our single- channel data suggest that the cation- \u0001 interaction between ACh and residue \u0002W149 in the muscle nAChR probably affects ACh binding rather the ACh-induced conformational changes leading to receptor activation. Yetwe cannot exclude the possibility that it may be involvedin receptor desensitization. Future work will 3-W149), effects of other ACh concentrations on the kinetics of the mono-fluorinated 5-F-W149 mutant. Also, we will confirm that the cation- \u0001 interaction at \u0002W149 does not affect the \u0006s measured for other agonists. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 102. In vivo incorporation of multiple unnatural amino acids through nonsense and frameshiftsuppression Erik A. Rodriguez *, Henry A. Lester, Dennis A. Dougherty* Site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) into proteins is a valuable tool for studyingstructure-function relationships, incorporating biophysicalprobes, and elucidating protein-protein interactions. Inhigher eukaryotic cells, the methodology is currentlylimited to incorporation of a single UAA in response to astop codon, which is known as nonsense suppression.Frameshift suppression is a unique methodology for incorporating UAAs in response to quadruplet codons, butcurrently, it is mostly limited to in vitro protein translation systems. Here, we evaluate the viability of frameshiftsuppression in Xenopus oocytes. We demonstrate UAA incorporation by using yeast phenylalanine frameshift suppressor (YFFS) tRNAs that tRNAs increasesnonlinearly with the amount of injected endogenous, triplet-recognizing tRNA. Both suppressor tRNA THG73(Tetrahymena thermophila G73), which has been used extensively for UAA incorporation in Xenopus oocytes. However, the two YFFS tRNAs are more \"orthogonal\" totheXenopus system than THG73, and they offer a viable replacement when suppressing at promiscuous sites. To illustrate the potential of combining nonsense and frameshift suppression, we have site specificallyincorporated two and three UAAs simultaneously into aneuroreceptor expressed in vivo. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 103. Probing the importance of backbone interactions in the nAChR using \u0002-hydroxy acids Kristin D. Rule*, Henry A. Lester, Dennis A. Dougherty* The importance of backbone hydrogen bonding and flexibility in the extracellular domain of the nicotinicacetylcholine receptor (nAChR) were explored using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. Incorporating an \u0002- hydroxy analogue of an amino acid replaces the backbone amide bond with an ester. This subtle mutation disruptshydrogen bonding and confers additional backboneflexibility at the site of mutation without perturbing theside chain. While amide-to-ester mutations of the binding box residues in the primary subunit ( \u0002) produced only modest changes in receptor function, they pointed to an important role for residues in key \u0003-strands near the binding site. Anomalous behavior was observed for \u0002- hydroxy acids incorporated at the binding-site residues in the complementary subunits ( \u0004 and \u0005) that suggests a key role for these residues in nAChR function. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 104. The functional role of a conserved aspartate in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Amanda L. Cashin*, Michael M. Torrice*, Kathryn A. McMenimen*, Henry A. Lester, Dennis A. Dougherty* The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and related Cys-loop receptors are ligand-gated ion channels thatmediate fast synaptic transmission throughout the centraland peripheral nervous system. A highly conservedaspartate residue (D89) that is near, but not integral to, theagonist-binding site has been proposed to play a criticalpart in receptor function. We have probed the role of D8983 with the unsurpassed precision of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis coupled with electrophysiology. The sidechain of D89 establishes a redundant network of hydrogenbonds that serves to preoganize the agonist-binding site bypositioning a critical tryptophan residue that directlycontributes to the agonist-binding site. The negative charge of D89 is not essential for receptor function. Our studies also revealed a novel electrostatic clash in thehighly deleterious D89N mutant that rationalizes thebehavior of a unique Cys-loop receptor, the MOD-1serotonin receptor, which naturally contains thissubstitution. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 105. Contrasting drug-receptor interactions at neuronal Dennis A. Dougherty1 This study begins to apply the nonsense suppression approach to unnatural amino acid incorporation for nicotinic receptors (nAChR) expressed in Xenopu s oocytes. A number of unnatural amino acids were incorporated and evaluated in the \u00034\u00044 nAChR. Remarkably, the compelling cation- \u0001 interaction seen between ACh and TrpB of the muscle-type receptor is mostly absent in the \u00034\u00044 receptor. None of the other four side chains probed in the aromatic-binding box shows strong evidence for an equally strong cation-\u0001 interaction with ACh. However, a modestly large EC50 ratio of ~15 was observed for the CN vs. Br Phe derivatives in loop A, consistent with weak cation- \u0001 interaction. We also evaluated three other agonists - nicotine, epibatidine, and cytisine. At TrpB, for nicotine to some extent and definitely for cytisine, 5-CN-Trp causes a much large drop in potency than does 5-Br-Trp, possibly indicating a cation-\u0001 interaction. Within the nAChR family, cation- \u0001 interactions appear to vary markedly, despite high homology and absolute identity for the supposedly key residues. 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 2Neurion Pharmaceuticals, Pasadena, CA 3Eli Lilly and Company Ltd., Lilly Research Centre, Erl Wood Manor, Windlesham, Surrey GU20 6PH, UK 106. receptorsMohammed PantojaWe continue to use at the muscle nAChR.

We have combined these data with signals obtains from mutations at the M2 16' position and at neighboring positions in the M1 and M3 helices. We have also assessed Cu phenanthroline crosslinking of dual Cysmutations. The data help to define the contacts of the M219' position in the resting and active states. 107. Microorganization of synaptic receptors Lawrence A. WadeNicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are found in many central nervous system and nerve-skeletalmuscle postsynaptic membranes. The nAChR is subunits. Furthermore, the \u0003 exist at least subtypes ( \u00031 through \u000310) and the four subtypes ( \u00041 through \u00044) [1]. In this past year we've initiated an effort to combine several novel techniques to directly optically image the microorganization of AChRs expressed inXenopus oocytes. By expressing in the AChR \u0003 and \u0004 subunits, we expect to directly resolve and thereby determine the number of \u0003 and \u0004 subunits that comprise individual receptors. Furthermore we hope to discretely identify the individual receptors over a field-of-view of at least one micron. This will enable us tosimultaneously characterize the large-scale distribution ofsuch receptors, to identify any local structures within an imaged membrane surface, and to assay the variation of receptor subtypes. The techniques being combined in this experiment include a novel method for repeatedly locatingimaging probes to specific substrate locations within a few10's of nm [2], and an ~10 nm resolution, single-moleculesensitive optical microscope developed incollaboration with the Quake group [3,4]. A technique forattachment protein patterning on glass Nanolithographic (DPN) pioneered by the Colliergroup [5,6] will be used to rigidly adhere the membranes to be image to a glass substrate. Receptor subunit imaging is enabled by the development of specific XFP-labeledAChR subunits [7,8] in the Lester group. By developing the ability to directly image each subunit of each AChR expressed in the membrane ofXenopus oocytes, we lay the groundwork for future studies of transmembrane proteins, receptors and membrane-embedded proteins in many different types of cells. Inparticular we will substantially advance our ability toimage the (2004) Science 306:1029-1032. [2] Wade, L.A.

Two-electrode voltage- Xenopus oocytes. A confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) with a spectral detector was used to characterize the accessibility of the \u0002V17'C and \u0003M2 L17'C residues to MTS-TAMRA (50 \u00b5M) in the absence or presence of ACh (100 \u00b5M). The \u0003M2 L17'C side chain was accessible to MTS-TAMRA in the presence, but not in the absence, of ACh. The non-fluorescent thiol reactive N-(2-[(t- and \u0003M2 L17'C in the absence of ACh: Subsequent labeling by MTS-TAMRA in the presence of ACh (100 \u00b5M) was unaffected. Hence, tBocMal was used to mask surface-exposed non-receptor cysteine residues in order to isolate specific applied MTS-TAMRA. We conductedsimultaneous two-electrode voltage-clampelectrophysiology and fluorometry studies all the CLSM results, the oocytes expressing the17'C mutants were treated with a two-step labeling procedure (1) tBocMal (50 \u00b5M) and (2) MTS-TAMRA (50 \u00b5M) / ACh (100 \u00b5M). The oocytes expressing the 20'C mutants were treated with MTS-TAMRA (50 \u00b5M) / ACh (100\u00b5M). MTS-TAMRA attached to any of the four side chains reported an increase in fluorescence ( \u0001F/F ~ 2 - 3%) upon activation with ACh (10 - 1000 \u00b5M). Previously, we showed that \u000319'C labeled with MTSR also leads to increased fluorescence upon receptor activation.The fluorescence increase of MTS-TAMRA tethered to these positions provides new constraints on the nature ofthe primary conformational transition at this location. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 109. Detection of a single fluorescent unnatural amino acid incorporated into the nAChR Rigo Pantoja, Mohammed I. Dibas, James E.Petersson *, Erik Rodriguez*, Dennis A. Dougherty1 Fluorescent unnatural amino acids (fUAAs) represent an attractive alternative for labeling ion channelproteins with minimal structural and amino acid sequenceperturbations. Here we report the first successfulincorporation of a fUAA, Lys(Bodipy), into the nicotinicacetylcholine receptor (nAChR) using the frameshiftsuppression oocytes after injection confirmed the presence offunctional surface-expressed nAChRs. The measured EC 50 for the nAChR \u000319'GGGULys(Bodipy) was 40.16 + 2.99 \u00b5M (n = 5) and is not dramatically different from the known wild-type nAChR EC 50 (~25 \u00b5M). Total internal reflection microscopy was the nAChR \u000319'GGGULys(Bodipy). TIRF microscopy for oocyte autofluorescence and unincorporated Lys(Bodipy).Time-series photobleaching experiments determined that70 % of observed sparse puncta (< 0.25 puncta/ \u00b5m 2) originated from single molecules since a discrete decrease in fluorescence resulted upon photobleaching. The average single-molecule signal to background ( \u0001F/F) with the corresponding standard deviation (\u00b1 SD) was approximately 0.38 \u00b1 0.15. Puncta were detected inoocytes injected with ACCC-Lys(Bodipy), however, in lower densities fluorescence signals ( \u0001F/F \u00b1 SD = 0.20 \u00b1 0.07). To confirm that the puncta originated from Lys(Bodipy) incorporated into a if a nAChR \u000319'GGGULys(Bodipy) is labeled with two\u0002-Btx-Alexa488 probes one would predict observing three discrete steps of photobleaching. Three days after injection, receptors containing the Lys(Bodipy) labeled with two \u0002-Btx-Alexa488 yielded three discrete photobleach steps in 13% of the puncta. In addition, we performed similar experiments with a nAChR ( \u0002/\u0003/\u0005/\u0004eGFP) mutant to confirm the results from the \u000319'GGGU mutant. Oocytes expressing ( \u0002/\u0003/\u0005/\u0004eGFP) nAChRs at similar levels as they did the \u000319'GGGULys(Bodipy) nAChRs also produced analogous puncta densities and three discrete photobleach steps from receptors labeled with \u0002-Btx- Alexa488. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech85 110. cis-trans Isomerization at a proline ion channelSarah C.R. Lummis 1, Lori W. Lee2, Dennis A. Dougherty2, Henry A. Lester The Cys-loop receptor superfamily includes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Neurotransmitter bindingin these proteins triggers the opening (gating) of an ionchannel, by means of an as yet uncharacterizedconformational change. We previously have shown that aspecific proline (Pro 8*), located at the apex of the 2 nd and 3rd transmembrane helices (M2-M3), can link binding to gating through a cis trans isomerization of the protein backbone. Using unnaturalamino acid mutagenesis, a series of proline analogues withvarying preference for the cis conformer was the 8* position of 5-HT 3R. Proline analogues that strongly favor the trans conformer produced non- functional channels. Among the functional mutants therewas a strong correlation between the intrinsic cis trans energy gap of the proline analogue and the activation ofthe channel, suggesting that cis trans isomerization of this single proline provides the switch that interconverts theopen and closed states of the channel. We are currentlyperforming the same \"prolyl\" scan in nAChR. Initialresults suggest a potential role for Pro 1*, not Pro 8*, inthe gating of nAChR. Our studies are currently aimed atdetermining if a molecular rearrangement at Pro 1* ofnAChR, namely cis trans isomerization, is the structural mechanism that opens the receptor pore. 1Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge, CB2 1GA, UnitedKingdom 2Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology 111. Ligand-receptor interactions in the 5-HT3 receptorKiowa S. Bower *, Henry A. Lester, Dennis A. Dougherty* Homology modeling and biochemical studies have been instrumental in advancing our understanding ofthe 5-HT3 ligand-binding site. Despite the success ofthese studies, several important aspects of the agonist-receptor binding interaction remain poorly understood.One notable interaction is the putative hydrogen bondbetween 5-HT3 and the hydroxyl group of the naturalagonist serotonin. We aim to identify and characterizenovel binding-site interactions with serotonin and other5-HT3 agonists such as mCPBG. Because receptor gatingis thought to begin with a conformational change in theagonist-binding site, a second goal of this study is to characterize residues around the binding site that participate in important interactions during this initialstructural rearrangement. Conventional mutations are usedas a starting point in our investigations. Residues thatappear to play a role in agonist binding or receptor gatingwill be studied in greater detail using the unnatural aminoacid mutagenesis methodology. This methodology will beused to probe the interaction of interest at a more chemicalscale than is possible with conventional mutagenesis, andthus provide more convincing evidence. Ligandmodification is another tool we use to help us betterunderstand binding interactions. By characterizing theeffect of variations to ligand structure, we can gain further insights into specific interactions between agonist and the receptor. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 112. Simultaneous electrophysiological and fluorescence measurements on the glycinereceptor M2-M3 linker Pless *, Mohammed I. Dibas, Joseph W. Lynch* How is the binding of a ligand molecule in the N-terminal ligand-binding domain communicated to thechannel gate in the transmembrane segments of pentameric Cys-loop receptors? To address this question a previous study has shown that an environmentally-sensitiverhodamine fluorophore attached to the 19' position in (nAChR) \u0001 subunit can detect agonist-binding in the ligand-binding domain. Here, we demonstrate specific labeling of a cysteine residue introduced at the 19' position (R271C mutant) of glycine receptor with a rhodamine fluorophore. Current and fluorescence changes were simultaneously monitored during the application of glycine, strychnine and taurine. This provides crucial insights into the conformational changes accompanyingGlyR activation and deactivation. Both the results fromglycine and strychnine application indicate a closecoupling between movements at the channel gate and the19' residue in the M2-M3 linker domain. This supports theidea of a concerted movement of a large portion of the M2helix during glycine receptor activation and deactivation.However, the application of taurine evokes no currents butan increase in fluorescence. Taurine may, thus, induce aconformational change in the M2-M3 linker domain that is distinct from that induced by glycine and strychnine. *School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Queensland, QLD, Australia 113. Study the gating mechanism in GABA C receptors Jinti Wang1, Dennis A. Dougherty1 GABA C receptors, expressed predominantly vertebrate retina, are members of the Cys-loop superfamilyof ligand-gated ion channels. Upon agonist binding, thereceptor undergoes a structural transition from the closedto the open state, but the mechanism of gating is not well studied. Recent work has demonstrated a specific proline (Pro8*), located at the apex of the loop between the M2and M3 helices, functions as a hinge for movement of M2during the gating process in 5-HT 3A receptor. In contrast, anionic receptors in this superfamily, such as the GABA C receptor, do not contain this proline, and the possibility ofacis trans isomerization at a non-proline receptor should be explored. In this work, we investigate the structural86 basis for functionally coupling agonist binding with gating domains in GABA C receptor by inserting a proline residue in different positions in M2-M3 loop resulting in non-functional receptors. Trying to rescue the receptor bymutation D94N in loop2 failed, except one constructD(11*insert)P/D94N could induce 100nA maximal current. Only S4* in this region can be mutated to proline without greatly effecting channel function, showing a3-fold increase in EC 50. Incorporated two -proline analogues, aze and pip, at this site, produced a 10- and3-fold increase in EC 50, respectively. So we concluded that this mutant proline could not function as the keyproline in 5-HT 3A as expected. We also generated a into the GABA C receptor. The chimera is expressed and folded correctly inthe cell membrane; however, the channels were constitutively active. F uture studies will explore the functions of this chimeric receptor. 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 114. A novel cation-\u0001 interaction in loop A of the GABA A receptor-binding site Claire L. Padgett1, Ariele P. Hanek2, Dennis A. Dougherty2, Sarah C.R. Lummis1 The binding pockets of Cys-loop receptors are dominated by aromatic amino acids. In the GABA A receptor \u00021Phe65,\u00032Tyr97,\u00032Tyr157 and \u00032Tyr205 are present at the \u00032/\u00021 interface and likely form an important part of the GABA-binding site. Here we have probed interactions of these residues using subtle chemicalchanges: Unnatural amino acid mutagenesis was used to introduce a range of Phe analogues, and mutant receptors expressed in oocytes were studied using voltage clamp electrophysiology. Serial mutations at \u0003 297 revealed a 20- fold increase in EC 50 with the addition of each fluorine atom, establishing a cation- \u0001 interaction between GABA and this residue. This is the first example of a cation- \u0001 interaction in loop A of a Cys-loop receptor, and along with earlier studies that identified cation- \u0001 interactions in loop B and loop C, the result emphasizes the adaptability of Cys-loop receptors in response to changes in agonist structure. The data further show that \u0002165 is relatively tolerant to substitution. Conversely, mutating either \u00032Tyr157 or \u00032Tyr205 to Phe substantially disrupts receptor function. Substitution of 4-F-Phe, however, at either position, or 4-MeO-Phe at \u00032Tyr157 resulted in receptors with wild-type EC 50s, suggesting a possible hydrogen bonding interaction. The high precision insightsprovided by these data allow the construction of an atomic-scale model for GABA docking to the agonist-binding siteof the GABA A receptor. 1Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK 2Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech115. Probing the Mg2+ blockade site of an NMDA receptor with unnatural amino acidmutagenesis Kathyrn A. McMenimen *, E. James Petersson*, Dennis A. Dougherty* The NMDA receptor plays a central role in learning and memory in the mammalian CNS. At normal neuronal resting membrane potentials, the pore of thisglutamate-gated ion channel is blocked by a Mg 2+ ion. Previous work suggests that the Mg2+-binding event is novel, involving several asparagine residues and a cation- \u0001 interaction between Mg2+and a conserved tryptophan in the pore. Using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis we show that no such cation- \u0001 interaction exists. The implicated tryptophan instead appears to play a structural role that can only be fulfilled by a rigid, flat hydrophobic residue. This is the first demonstration of unnatural amino acid incorporation in the NMDA receptor, and it opens theway for future investigations of this pivotal neuroreceptor. *Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 116. A cation-\u0001 interaction between extracellular TEA and an aromatic residue in potassium channelsChristopher A. Ahern 1, Amy L. Eastwood2, Dennis A. Dougherty2, Richard Horn1 Voltage-gated potassium channels are responsible for returning an excitable cell membrane to ahyperpolarized resting potential after an action potential.High-affinity blockade by extracellular TEA requires thepresence of an aromatic residue, either tyrosine orphenylalanine, at position 449 (in Shaker) which sits at theexternal entrance of the permeation pathway. Weinvestigated whether a cation- \u0001 interaction between TEA and Phe449 contributes to TEA block, using the in vivo nonsense suppression method to incorporate a series ofincreasingly fluorinated Phe analogues at position 449. Consistent with \u0001 interaction, increasing fluorination monotonically increased the inhibitory constant Ki for TEA block, the increase reaching 153-foldfor 3,4,5F-Phe. An even larger increase in Ki wasobserved when the benzene ring of Phe449 was substitutedby non-aromatic cyclohexane. These results support astrong cation- \u0001 component to the TEA block. However, the homologous aromatic residue Tyr82 in crystal structures of KcsA has an orientation incompatible with a cation-\u0001 mechanism. We propose that the aromatic residue at this position in voltage-gated potassium channels is more favorably oriented for a cation- \u0001 interaction along the permeation pathway. This proposal is supported by high-level ab initio calculations of the effects of Phe modifications on TEA-binding energy. 1Department of Physiology, Institute of Hyperexcitability, Jefferson Medical College, 1020 Locust Street,Philadelphia, PA 19107 2Division Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech87 117. Investigating cation- \u0001 interactions in the local anesthetic block of voltage gated sodium channels Christopher A. Ahern1, Amy Eastwood2, Dennis A. Dougherty2, Richard Horn1 Voltage gated sodium channels control the upstroke of the cardiac action potential and are therefore,important for cardiac electrical excitability. Class I anti-arrhythmic drugs, like lidocaine, block sodium conductionin this family of ion channels and are commonly used totreat numerous life threatening conditions, including ventricular fibrillation. We investigated the possibility of a cation-\u0001 interaction between lidocaine and the voltage gated sodium channel rNa V1.4. To this end, a series of phenylalanine derivatives deactivated in the cation- \u0001 interaction by the addition of fluorine substituents were inserted at aromatic amino acid sites in a transmembranesegment (S6 of domain 4) that lines the internal pore of thechannel, using the in vivo nonsense suppression methodology. The effect of 200 \u00b5M lidocaine was investigated using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing sodium channels carrying these unnatural amino acid derivatives. Thenature of the channel block was investigated for steadystate tonic conditions and with a use-dependent protocolemploying repetitive 20-ms depolarizations from -100 mV to 0 mV over a range from 2 to 20 Hz. For one of these sites, Phe1579, the lidocaine block was highly sensitive toaromatic fluorination. The use-dependent block wassuccessively alleviated by addition of multiple fluorinesubstituents. Furthermore, suppression at this site with theunnatural amino acid cyclohexylalanine, a side chainsterically similar to phenylalanine but lacking aromaticcharacter, abolished use-dependent block by lidocaine atfrequencies as high as 20 Hz. WT channels are roughly90% blocked under similar conditions. Two otheraromatic sites in this S6 segment, Tyr1574 and Tyr1586,showed no effect or mild relief of block, respectively, with the same series of unnatural amino acids. Our results suggest a cation- \u0001 contribution to lidocaine block of voltage gated sodium channels. 1Institute of Hyperexcitability, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA, USA 2Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 118. Nicotine responses in Leu9'Ala and \u00024 KO mice predict tolerance and sensitization Andrew R. Tapper, Sheri L. McKinney, Michael J. Marks1 Behavioral tolerance and sensitization are two hallmarks of nicotine dependence that underscore longlasting changes receptors ( \u00024* nAChRs) represent the most widely expressed high affinity nicotinic receptor in the CNS although the precise role of \u00024* nAChRs in these phenomenon are unclear. To elucidate the contribution of \u00024* nAChRs in the development of tolerance andsensitization, wild-type, Leu9'Ala \u00024, or \u00024 knockout mice were injected with nicotine and their behaviors compared. Repeated selective activation of \u00024* nAChRs in Leu9'Ala mice produced profound tolerance to hypothermia, whereas no tolerance was observed in \u00024 KO animals. The summed response from these two mouse lines was not significantly different from the wild-typetolerance profile. In addition, sensitization to nicotine's locomotor effects were observed with activation of \u00024* nAChRs, while only nicotine-induced hypolocomotor effects were seen in \u00024 KO mice. The averaged response between the two lines reflected the locomotor response in wild-type animals. Finally, quantitation of radiolabeledcytisine sensitive nAChR binding in Leu9'Ala animalsafter nicotine treatments showed no significant differencesin expression levels compared to saline treated mice eventhough significant tolerance and sensitization occurred.These data indicate that, by comparing nicotinic responses in two complementary mouse lines, one lacking \u00024* nAChRs, the other expressing hypersensitive \u00024* nAChRs, we could accurately predict wild-type tolerance and sensitization. Together our data suggest that activation of\u00024* nAChRs is both necessary and sufficient for the expression of tolerance and sensitization, and that these behaviors occur in the absence of nAChR upregulation. 1Institute for Behavioral Genetics, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 119. Possible D2R- \u00024* nAChR interactions in a novel mouse model of Parkinson's disease Andrew R. Tapper, Herwig Just, Cheng XiaoStrong epidemiological data indicates Parkinson's disease (PD) is less prevalent in smokers. In addition,animal studies have found that nicotine, the addictivecomponent of tobacco smoke, protects DAergic neuronsfrom chemical insult. Thus, shown in midbrain toincrease DA release in striatum by activating midbrain DAergic neurons directly via nAChRs. In glutamatergic studies indicate that \u00024\u00032* nAChRs may functionally interact directly with D 2 autoreceptors, G- protein coupled DA receptors that are expressed inDAergic neurons and negatively regulate activity. Toexplore this possible interaction, we injected mice expressing hypersensitive \u00024* nAChRs (the Leu9'Ala line) with the D 2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, and compared resulting behaviors to wild-type animals. One postinjection of 5 mg/kg quinpirole, aresignificantly hypoactive in a novel wild-type animals. In addition, rigidity of fore- andhind-limbs sets in. The severity and duration of thisphenotype is quantified in the rotorod assay. When placedon a rotorod rotating at only 3 RPM, Leu9'ala mice88 injected with quinpirole fall from the apparatus quickly (latency to fall = ~35 sec. compared to wild-type 180 seccut off = 180 sec) due to their rigidity, whereas wild-typemice have little trouble staying on the apparatus. Leu9'Alamice develop a resting tremor that becomes constant onehour post quinpirole injection. In addition these mice also exhibit ptosis. All of these symptoms are reversible; 3-4 hours post injection Leu9'Ala mice are indistinguishablefrom wild type. This phenotype is rescued byadministration of amphetamine and D1 agonists.Together, these data indicate that the Leu9'AlaParkinsonian phenotype (bradykinesia, rigidity, and restingtremor) is caused by DA depletion. Furthermore, we hypothesize that D 2 activation in our hyper sensitive \u00014* nAChR mouse model uncovers a novel interactionbetween Gi/o coupled receptors and \u00014* nAChRs. Upcoming experiments utilizing neurochemistry and slice electrophysiology will test this hypothesis. It is anticipatedthat the results from these experiments will not onlyprovide a new pharmacological, reversible, Parkinson'sdisease mouse model, but also increase understanding ofnicotinic receptor mediated modulation of DAergicneurotransmission. 120. Nicotine-induced Qi Huang, Tristan McClure Begley*, Allan nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are brain. We wish a)to monitor the subcellular and neuroanatomical localizations of \u0001 4 nAChR subunits when they are correctly expressed in living cells, and b) to observe their changes in expression with chronic nicotine exposure.Using homologous recombination, we engineered knock-inmice that express Midbrain neurons \u0002-erythroidine-sensitive release. Confocal microscopic imaging and spectral unmixing allows us to isolate \u00014YFP fluorescence in various brain regions. The strongest \u00014YFP fluorescence was detected in neurons from the medialhabenula. \u00014YFP could be traced from axonal fibers in the fasciculus retroflexus emanating from the medial habenula and terminating in the interpeduncular nucleus. Strong\u00014YFP expression was found in soma and neurites throughout the thalamus, in axonal fibers in the internal capsule, and also in fibers coursing between dopaminergic fibers of the caudate-putamen. \u00014YFP fluorescence was~2-fold more intense in the dopaminergic neurons (substantia nigra pars compacta,ventral GABAergicneurons. Mice were implanted subcutaneously with mini-osmotic pumps that delivered either saline or nicotine (2mg/kg/hr for 10 d). The nicotine-treated mice showedalterations in \u00014YFP fluorescence in specific brain regions. These \u00014YFP mice provide an opportunity to quantify\u00014* nAChRs at \u00b5m resolution in the CNS and to study their role in nicotine addiction. *Institute for Behavioral Genetics, University of Colorado, Boulder 80309 121. Spontaneous seizures and nicotine-induced c-fos dominant frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized bybrief, sometimes violent partial seizures, occurring in sleepand starting during childhood. ADNFLE is linked to pointmutations (nAChR) \u00014 and nAChRs (Leu9'Ala, not an ADNFLE mutation), following nicotine (nic) injections, displayed a syndrome with partial seizures similar to those experienced spontaneously by \u00014-linked ADNFLE patients (see reference). We now report the occurrence of spontaneous seizures in several Leu9'Ala mice 12 to 29 days old. Spontaneous seizures in 11 homozygous and one heterozygous Leu9'Ala mice to date were characterized by loss of righting response,repetitive jerky movements of forelimbs and hindlimbs andflailing or stiff tail. Seizures were followed by rigidity ofthe body and extremities, disorientation, lack oflocomotion and hypothermia. Convulsive bouts typicallylasted between 10 to 20 min. Three of the mice diedwithin an hour after seizure onset, while the rest of theanimals recovered completely. In order to identifyneuronal populations activated during seizures, we aremeasuring the levels of c-fos expression in the brains of wild-type (WT) and Leu9'Ala mice that undergo seizures following nic treatment, as well as mice that experiencespontaneous seizures. Seizures triggered by 10 mg/k nic inWT and Leu9'Ala result in strong seizures and display little c-fos whereasLeu9'Ala mice have partial clonic in the medial habenula. Spontaneousseizures in Leu9'Ala mice, thus far, cause increases in c-fos staining in the cerebral cortex and the laterodorsalthalamic nucleus, but little or no expression in the medial habenula.89 Reference Fonck, H.A. (2005) J. 25(49):11396-11411. 122. Regi on-specific R.A. The medial habenula (MHb) is the brain nucleus with the highest expression level of neuronal nicotinicacetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Although mRNAs forseveral nAChR subtypes have been detected in the MHb, itis not yet known which of these subunits form functionalreceptors. We investigated the expression pattern and function of \u0001 4-containing ( \u00014*) nAChRs in thatexpress \u00014YFP, Nashmi et al., SFN, 2005 and 2006), but the most intensely YFP- labeled neurons were concentrated in the ventral-lateralportion of the MHb (VL-MHb); b) In knock-in mice that express mutated hypersensitive \u00014* nAChRs (Leu9'Ala), injections of either 0.2 mg/k or 2 mg/k nicotine led to strong c-fos expression in VL-MHb. No such pattern of c-fos expression was observed in the MHb of wild-typemice. Therefore, at relatively low nicotine doses, neurons expressing hypersensitive \u00014* nAChRs are activated; and, c) Patch-clamp experiments showed that VL-MHb neurons from Leu9'Ala mice responded robustly (166 + 37 pA) to pressure applied 1 \u00b5 M nicotine, whereas neurons in the medial portion of the MHb had little or no responses (< 15pA). These nicotine responses in Leu9'AlaVL-MHb were~10-fold higher than in WT VL-MHb. Our results indicate that functional \u00014* receptors are expressed within the MHb, and that this expression is specific to the VL subregion of MHb. *Department of Neurobiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL ReferencesNashmi, R., Deshpande, P., Labarca, C., Huang, Q. and localization fluorescently tagged\u00014 nicotinic Abstract Viewer/Itinerary Planner, Washington, DC,Society for Neuroscience.

One of these is amissense mutation of valine 287 to leucine in the M2region of the beta2 subunit. Using the gene targetingtechnique, we generated \"knock-in\" mice carrying thesame V287L mutation found in human ADNFLE. Beta2V287L mice are born at an expected Mendelian ratio andappear normal. There were no apparent neuroanatomical differences between V287L and wild-type mice in the brain regions examined. Spontaneous seizures were notfrequently observed in beta2 V287L mice. However,V287L mice showed several-fold higher sensitivity to seizures induced by nicotine. V287L mice also displayedhypersensitivity to nicotine-induced dorsiflexion of the tail). Thus, beta2 V287L mice may be a usefulanimal model for understanding the pathophysiology ofADNFLE. 1The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, MNL H, La Jolla, CA 92037 2Institute for Behavioral genetics, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309 124. Balancing neur onal activity and survival via modulator Miwa 1,2, receptors (nAChRs) affect a wide array of biological processes including learning and memory, attention, and addiction. Lynx1, the founding member of a family of mammalian prototoxins, modulatesnAChR function in vitro by altering agonist sensitivity and desensitization kinetics. Here we demonstrate, through thegeneration of lynx1 knockout KO) mice, that lynx1modulates nAChR signaling in vivo . Its removal causes decreasing the nicotineby ~10-fold. Decreased desensitization is levels in neurons in responseto nicotine. Lynx1 KO mice also showed decreasednicotine-induced paired pulse facilitation. In addition, lynx1 KO exhibit enhancements in performance in tasks measuring learning and memory. Consistent with reportsthat mutations resulting in hyper-activation of nAChRs canlead to neurodegeneration, aging lynx1 null mutant a degeneration that is exacerbated bynicotine and ameliorated by null-mutations in nAChRs.We conclude that lynx1 allosteric90 modulator of nAChR function in vivo , and that it plays a critical role in balancing neuronal function and survival inthe CNS. 1The Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York,NY, 10021 2Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510 3Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510 4Department of Neuroendocrinology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021 125. Interactions between the prototoxin lynx1 and \u00014\u00022 receptors Cagdas D. Son The mammalian prototoxin lynx1 shares an evolutionary relationship with the Ly-6/neurotoxin gene family. Similar to \u0001-neurotoxins, such as the bungarotoxins and muscarinic toxins, lynx1 predicted to adopt the three-fingered toxin fold. lynx1 is expressed inlarge that lynx1 modulates current amplitudes, enhances desensitization and increases the EC 50 for activation by Ach [3]. These results suggest that lynx1 opposes the changes induced by chronic exposure tonicotine. Recent work by Sekhon et al., 2005, showed that lynx1 expression in lungs increased following nicotineexposure [4]. Thus, we hypothesize that interactionsbetween lynx1 and nAChRs are important in the response to chronic nicotine exposure in vivo . In order to identify the important residue(s) and/or region(s) in lynx1 function we will examineAch-induced macroscopic current responses of \u0001 4\u00022 nAChRs using two-electrode voltage clamp in the presence of wild-type or mutant lynx1. Alternatively, mutants of a 4b2 will be generated and expressed in Xenopus oocytes and tested for wild-type lynx1 assays and surface cys teine accessibility method to locate the residues important inlynx1 interaction on the receptor. In addition, directinteraction(s) between neuronal nAChRs and lynx1 will beexamined by generating a covalent bond between thesetwo proteins. Using the unnatural amino acid replacementtechniques we will introduce a photoaffinity crosslinker(such as p-benzoylphenylalanine) in the regions of receptor or lynx1 that are predicted to be involved in the interaction and induce crosslinking by light activation. The resultantcomplex will then be analyzed by fragmentation andprotein sequencing by mass spectrometry to identify thecrosslinked residue on the partner. These studies will helpus better understand the interactions between lynx1 andneuronal nAChRs, revealing important insights al. (1999) Neuron al. (2002) Neuron al. (2002) Neuron 33:893-903.

Slimko, Cheng Xiao,Laurent van Trigt, David J. Anderson * To develop tools for molecularly dissecting defined neuronal circuits in the brain we have tested a twocomponent ion channel-based silencing system:expression of C. . The channel requires both alpha and betasubunits, allowing for combinatorial strategies to increasethe specificity of expression. Both subunits have been codon optimized, rendered insensitive to glutamate and tagged with CFP (alpha) and YFP (beta). To test thesystem in the CNS in vivo , we injected mice unilaterally in the striatum with a suspension of two recombinant viruses(AAV2) expressing the alpha and beta subunits.IVM-induced silencing was confirmed in a simple rotationassay. Ten days after virus injection, the mice wereinjected intraperitoneally with IVM and tested at varioustime points for amphetamine-induced rotation. Ifdopaminergic transmission via the striatum is unilaterallydisrupted in amphetamine-injected animals, ipsilateral rotation occurs. Such rotation was observed in animals coinjected with virus encoding the alpha and beta subunit,but not with virus encoding the alpha or beta subunit alone.With injections of 10 mg/kg IVM, the rotation appearsafter 4 h, peaks at 12 h and remains amphetamine-inducible for up to 3 d. We repeated IVM administrationand withdrawal at least twice in the same animals. Whilerepeated IVM administration restores the full rotationphenotype, in several mice some amphetamine-induciblerotation remains after IVM withdrawal. Furtherexperiments will determine whether this effect is causedby behavioral sensitization, or by a percentage of neurons that cannot be re-activated after prolonged silencing. Striatal slice patch recordings show that ~50% of neuronsfrom virus-injected striatum, but none 10-20 min 10 nM IVM withhyperpolarization and reduced firing, as expected from Clchannel activation. *Professor of Biology, Caltech 127.\u00016* nicotinic ACh in nicotine addiction Ryan M. Drenan, Nathaniel Heintz* Addiction to cigarettes is a major health risk to smokers and non-smokers alike, and has created a massivehealthcare burden for developed countries. Wehypothesize that interfering with the establishment and/ormaintenance of nicotine dependence, specifically within the midbrain dopaminergic system, will help to foster smoking cessation. Several nicotinic ACh receptor91 subunits are expressed in this brain \u00024, \u00026,\u00032, and \u00033.\u00026-containing (denoted as \u00026*) nicotinic ACh receptors are required for 50-70% of total nicotine- stimulated dopamine release, an important neurochemicalaspect of dependence to nicotine. To further understandthe role of \u00026* nAChRs in nicotine addiction, we will amplify and isolate \u00026-dependent behavioral and cellular responses in mice by creating a new mouse strain expressing hypersensitive \u00026 subunits. \u00026 subunits are expressed poorly outside of their native neurons in the central nervous system, which precludes a detailed in vitro study aimed at designing a suitable hypersensitive mutant \u00026* receptor. To circumvent this problem, we have begun to create the desired mouse strain using BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenesis. In exon 5 of the \u00026 gene, the 9' position of TM2 will be mutated from Leu to Ser or Ala, and the mutant BAC construct will beincorporated into the mouse genome via random insertion following pronuclear injection. Founders will be screened for transgene expression. Using nicotine-stimulateddopamine release from synaptosomes, along with fura-2Ca 2+ imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology from primary neurons, we will determine the extent ofhypersensitivity across several L9'S and L9'A lines of lowand high transgene copy lines will beassayed for hypersensitivity to nicotine-dependent reward,tolerance, and withdrawal in behavioral assays. With the ability to selectively activate \u00026* receptors, these mice will allow us to determine which aspects of nicotine addiction \u00026* receptors are sufficient for. In addition, these mice will be useful for smoking cessation lead compound selection and optimization studies that focus on \u00026* receptors. *Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University 128. hERG block in acquired long-QT Syndrome probed with unnatural amino acidsFraser J. MossAcquired LQT syndrome arising from block of the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassiumchannel has become the primary safety concern whendeveloping new pharmaceuticals. Lead compounds mustnot block hERG if they are to move forward. Substitutingunnatural amino acids (UAAs) for critical hERG residues using nonsense suppression in mammalian cell lines will resolve the nature of the non-covalent interactions betweeneach residue and each drug. For example, di-, or tetra-fluoro derivatives of phenylalanine minimally perturb thePhe structure, but would form a uniform graded series ofincreasingly electron-withdrawing groups whenincorporated at position 656 (wt residue, Phe) or position 652 (wt residue, Tyr) that could probe any cation- \u0001 or \u0001-\u0001 drug-channel interactions. Traditionally, to incorporate UAAs, we took a stoichiometric approach, where aftereach tRNA molecule had delivered one UAA molecule itbecame redundant. We have demonstrated recovery ofhERG current with this approach. However, expressionlevels were less than 10% of wt hERG and often phenotypes were suppressors by endogenous tRNA synthetases afterdelivering their initial cargo. Consequently, we aredeveloping a catalytic approach; expanding the geneticcode of CHO cells to express tRNA synthetases that repeatedly re-acylate orthogonal suppressor tRNAs with UAAs supplied in the We have identified atyrosine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (bTyrRS)/tRNA(bTyrtRNA CUA) pair from bacteria expression when co-transfected with a hERG Y652TAGmutant in CHO cells. Importantly, if either the tRNAsynthetase or the tRNA plasmids are omitted from thetransfection, no hERG expression is detected. Thebiophysical properties of currents rescued by the tyrosine-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair were not significantlydifferent from WT hERG. Work continues to randomlymutate the bTyrRS at five positions involved in binding tyrosine. The generated mutant library will be screened for UAA incorporation. tRNA CUA/aaRS pairs identified in the screen will then be tested for UAA incorporation inhERG channels expressed in CHO-K1 cells 129. Fluorescent mG AT1 constructs reveal important motifs for correct transportertrafficking and dimerizationFraser J. Moss, Princess I. Imoukhuede, JoannaL. Jankowsky, Jia Hu * We studied fusion proteins of the mouse \u0004-aminobutyric acid transporter (mGAT1) and the yellow or cyan fluorescent proteins (YFP or CFP) to understand PDZ and dimerization of mGAT1. We a fluorescent fusion that behaved like wild-type (wt) transporter in all respects to create knock-in mice expressing fluorescent transporters. Species that did notrecreate the wt phenotype could highlight regions of to the mGAT1 C- terminus with an additional 3, 8, 20 or, 45 residues fromthe hGAT1 C-terminus fused after the fluorophore.mGAT1-XFP* had an region (YKV) compared to the wt. XFP between the penultimate and finalexon of mGAT1. We measured [ 3H]-GABA uptake in N2A cells, in assays optimized for linearity; we recorded the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)efficiencies when YFP and CFP pairs of the sameconstruct design were co-expressed; biotinylation assaysdetermined the proportion of the expressed transporterslocalized in the plasma membrane versus the cytoplasm.mGAT1-XFP* and -XFP8-28 showed no significantdifference to wt biotinylation of 8% values 12 transmembrane (TM) domain transporters. mGAT1-XFPCT and mGAT1- XFP45 had poor uptake and resided predominantly in the92 cytoplasm; interestingly, FRET efficiency for the poorly trafficked mGAT1-XFPCT's was 33%, but FRET couldnot be detected for mGAT1-XFP45. This impliedbisecting the 17 amino acids immediately after TM12 withXFP inhibits transporter export to the membrane but notassembly. However, two copies of this same region per GAT1 molecule prevented transporter assembly and export from endoplasmic reticulum. We concluded that mGAT1-XFP* is the most suitable construct to build fluorescentmGAT1 mice because it produced the strongest FRET ofall the constructs that behave like wt. Nonetheless, otherconstructs highlighted regions that regulate normalmGAT1 trafficking and assembly. *Department of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California 130. Measuring the lateral mobility of GAT1 using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching Princess I. Imoukhuede*, Henry A. Lester We seek an understanding of GAT1 trafficking onto the surface of the neuronal membrane. GAT1 is amembrane protein that reuptakes GABA from synapse,thus it terminates inhibitory signaling events. It is wellknown that membrane protein exchange occurs viaendocytosis/exocytosis; however, little work has been doneto determine the role of lateral diffusion in the regulationof protein number at the plasma membrane. To this end,we utilize fluorescence recovery after photobleaching(FRAP) to determine the mechanics of transporter exchange at the cell membrane. Treatment with latrunculin B, which depolymerizes actin filaments,decreased both the mobility and recovery time constant ofGAT1. However, treatment with nocodazole, whichdepolymerizes microtubules, did not affect the mobility ofGAT1. Our data suggests that GAT1 is anchored to themembrane via an association with actin filaments. *Division of Engineering and Applied Science, Bioengineering Option, Caltech 131. C ombination therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease Joanna Jankowsky, Pritam Das1, Switzer III3, Todd Golde1 Alzheimer's disease is thought to stem from the over-accumulation of a small peptide called A \u0001 that aggregates into amyloid plaques in parts of the brain that are critical for learning and memory. Because of itshypothesized role in the onset of AD, considerable efforthas been devoted to the development of new treatments forAlzheimer's disease based on the prediction that lowering the amount of amyloid- \u0001 peptide (A \u0001) in the brain will facilitate the removal of amyloid lesions and repair of damaged tissue. Work towards this goal has been dividedbetween two main approaches. The first uses the immune system to combat high levels of A \u0001 by either actively immunizing patients against A \u0001, or by passively transferring antibodies to it. Meanwhile, other investigators have sought to lower A \u0001 levels by targetingits production. In isolation each strategy faces substantial limitations; however, combination of the two therapiesmay overcome their individual shortcomings. We are, therefore, testing a combination of chronic A \u0001 inhibition with acute antibody administration for the treatment of Alzheimer's in a transgenic mouse model for the disease.Our hypothesis is that acute immunotherapy will reverse pre-existing lesions while chroniFc suppression of new A \u0001 synthesis will prevent their recurrence. This work will focus on a new mouse model for AD in which we haveused a genetic switch to mimic the effect of treatment withsecretase inhibitors. These animals express an engineeredform of APP that can be regulated by doxycycline.Experiments are underway to test whether acute administration of anti-A \u0001 antibody in combination with chronic doxycycline treatment to prevent further A \u0001 synthesis can produce long-term amyloid clearance. Concurrent experiments will compare the effectiveness ofthis approach in older mice with an aging immune systemto that attained in young animals. Together, theseexperiments could provide strong proof-of-principle thatcombination therapy might be used to successfully reverseprior amyloid accumulation and prevent its recurrence inpatients with Alzheimer's disease. 1Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, 4500 Jacksonville, FL 32224 2Department of Neuroscience, Gainesville, FL 32610 3NeuroScience Associates, 10915 Lake Ridge Drive, Knoxville, TN 37934 132. S elective silencing of mammalian neurons using glutamate-gated chloride channels Herwig Just, Eric SlimkoWe are developing a technique to selectively silence mammalian neurons in vivo . This will enable us to study the function of specific types of neurons in thecontext of an intact brain circuitry. We are heterologously expressing a glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from C. elegans in neurons. The GluCl channel is a heteropentamer consisting of two subunits, an alpha and abeta subunit. These subunits have been modified for ourpurposes: they have been codon-optimized for enhancedmammalian expression, tagged with fluorescent proteins toallow for direct visualization and had the tyrosine atresidue 182 of the GluCl beta-subunit mutated to the agonist ivermectin (IVM)elicits a current that clamps the neurons to the resting potential of chloride, thereby inhibiting action potentials ('silencing'). High expression levels of the GluCl channelare required for efficient silencing. Our initial transgenicapproaches generated mice with appropriate expression ofthe GluCl channel in neurons according to the promotersfrom which their expression was being driven. However,the expression levels were not sufficiently high forvisualization or to elicit silencing in these neurons.Consequently, we have developed an alternative strategy:Adeno-associated virus encoding, the modified GluCl93 subunits to drive high-level expression in the ventral- tegmental area (VTA), are being stereotaxically injectedinto this region of mouse brains. The VTA is part of themesocorticolimbic reward pathway. Cells in the VTAsend ascending fibers to the nucleus accumbens releasingdopamine (DA). Drugs of abuse increase release of DA in the nucleus accumbens. To block this pathway the virus- injected animals are treated with IVM to inhibit neuronalfiring and subsequently administered drugs of abuse(cocaine, amphetamine). Using place preference assays,we are studying the effect of inhibiting neuronal functionin the VTA on the development of addiction.

Using knockout (KO) mice and over-expression in vivo with viral vectors, we are exploring the role of the neuropoietic cytokine leukemia inhibitor factor(LIF) in Alzheimer's disease and inflammation. Thiscytokine is further being used to manipulate neural stemcell proliferation and fate in the brain. Also in the contextof neuroimmune interactions, we are investigating a mousemodel of mental illness based on the known risk factor ofmaternal influenza infection. Huntington's disease (HD) isanother focus, where we are investigating potentialtherapies using intracellular expression of antibodies, and manipulating NF \u0001B activity. An additional project involves the inhibition of melanoma and glioma cell growth by endothelin receptor blockers. Cytokines are diffusible, intercellular messengers that were originally studied in the immune system. Ourgroup contributed to the discovery of a new family that wehave termed the neuropoietic cytokines, because of theiraction in both the nervous and hematopoietic/immunesystems. We have demonstrated that one of thesecytokines, LIF, can coordinate the neuronal, glial andimmune reactions to injury. Using both delivery of LIF in vivo and examination of the consequences of knocking out the LIF gene in mice, we find that this cytokine has apowerful regulatory effect on the inflammatory cascade.Moreover, LIF can regulate neurogenesis and gliogenesis.We find that LIF is a critical regulator of astrocyte andmicroglial activation following stroke, seizure or trauma,and that this cytokine also regulates inflammatory cellinfiltration, neuronal and oligodendrocyte death, gene expression, as well as the production of adult neural stemcell renewal. These results highlight LIF as an importanttherapeutic target. We are also examining the role of LIF ina transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, where itsadministration can decrease the level of senile plaques. Cytokine involvement in a new model for mental illness is also being investigated. This mouse model isbased on findings that maternal infection can increase thelikelihood of schizophrenia or autism in the offspring. Weare using behavioral, neuropathological, molecular andbrain imaging methods to investigate the effects of maternal influenza infection on fetal brain development and how this leads to altered behavior in young and adultoffspring. We are utilizing intracellular antibody expression to block the toxicity of mutant huntingtin (Htt), the proteinthat causes HD. We have produced single-chainantibodies (scFvs) that bind to various domains of Htt, andthese can either exacerbate or alleviate Htt toxicity incultured cells, acute brain slices, and in a Drosophila HD model. Work has begun on viral vectors for deliveringscFvs in a mouse model of HD. We have also implicated the NF\u0001B signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of HD, and identified several steps in this signaling cascade as potential therapeutic targets. 133. Intrabodies as potential therapeutics for Huntington's disease Amber L. Southwell, Jan Ko, Ali Khoshnan Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tractin the huntingtin protein (Htt). This expansion leads to Httaggregation and degeneration of medium-sized spinyneurons of the striatum. We are investigating the use ofintrabodies (intracellularly expressed antibodies) aspotential therapeutics for HD. Intrabodies have greattherapeutic potential due to their specificity in targetrecognition, and are currently being tested in the treatmentof HIV and cancer. Single chains (scFvs) consisting of the variable heavy and light antigen recognition domains (V H and V L) connected by a linker are preferable for this type of application due to their small size and lack ofantigenicity. We have developed a number of monoclonalantibody (mAb)-derived scFvs and cell death. This effecthas been demonstrated in cell culture, acute brain slices(with P. Reinhart and D. Lo at Duke), and in a Drosophila model of HD (with G. Jackson at UCLA). This intrabody,however, requires a 4:1 ratio to mutant Htt for its effects. In an effort to generate a more efficacious intrabody with the benefits of binding in the polyproline region, weproduced novel intrabodies (Happs) against the proline-rich domain Htt. Happs were isolated from ahuman synthetic phage display intrabody library first, byselection with a peptide from the unique proline-richsequence located between the two polyproline stretches95 and second, with mutant Htt. Happ1 and three are single domain, light chain intrabodies (V Ls) that bind to mutant Htt in a proline-rich domain-dependent manner. Theyreduce mutant Htt-induced aggregation and toxicity in cellculture models. They have an optimum 2:1 ratio to mutantHtt but are still effective at 1:1. We then compared Happ1 and three to the single domain, light-chain intrabody V L12.3, which recognizes the first 17 amino acids of Htt (Colby et. al. (2004) PNAS 101:51). V L12.3 was engineered to fold without disulfide bonds and to reducemutant Htt-induced aggregation at a 0.5:1 ratio to Htt.Cell culture studies indicate that the beneficial effects ofV L12.3 are mechanistically different from the Happs. While all three intrabodies decrease toxicity andaggregated Htt, unlike V L12.3, the Happs appear to do so without increasing soluble mutant Htt, suggesting a changein Htt turnover. The therapeutic potential of theseintrabodies will next be tested in a mouse model of HD using viral-mediated gene therapy. Insights acquired through such experiments may contribute to the generationof novel therapeutics for HD. Reference Colby, D.W., intrabodies disease Charles W. Bugg, Ali Paul H.PattersonDeath of neurons in the striatum and cortex is a key component of Huntington's disease (HD), aprogressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Severalintracellular antibodies (intrabodies) have been developedas potential therapeutics for HD, based on their binding tomutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein. These intrabodiesameliorate the disease phenotype with various efficienciesin cell culture. Some even exacerbate the cell death. Weare developing a more direct, iterative system to select for intrabodies that prevent mHtt-induced cell death without necessarily binding mHtt. A library of intrabodies isexpressed in ecdysone the intrabodies willsurvive, and those intrabody sequences can be recovered,amplified and recycled through the selection. Theefficiency of the selection will be determined in large partby the ability to kill nearly all cells that do not carry aneuroprotective sequence. After optimization of conditions, we find that 99% of the PC12/PQ103 cells die within 12 days of induction with 5 \u00b5M Muristerone A. Two library strategies are being pursued. A mutagenized intrabody pool will be used to directly transfect thePQ103-inducible PC12 cells. In parallel, the intrabody library will be cloned into the lentiviral vector pFUGW and used to produce a lentiviral library with which thePC12 cells will be transduced. As proof of principle, we will select a published intrabody that functions in theabsence of the conserved disulfide bond. This system willthen be used to select novel intrabodies that protect frommHtt-induced cell death for use as therapeutics for HD. 135. Interaction of mutant huntingtin with the NF-\u0005B pathway Ali Khoshnan, Simona Ko Transcriptional dysregulation by mutant huntingtin (Htt) protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD) and we found that mutant Htt activates the NF- \u0005B pathway. Mutant Htt physically associates with IKK \u0004, a regulatory component of the I\u0005B kinase complex (IKK). In cultured cells, this interaction results in the activation of IKK, leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory protein I\u0005B\u0002. These findings have in vivo relevance, as striatal extracts from HD transgenic mice have higher levels of IKK than extracts from control mice, and activated NF- \u0005B is found in the nucleus of striatal and cortical neurons in HD mice. Binding to IKK \u0004 is mediated by the expanded polyglutamine stretch in mutant Htt, and is augmented by the proline-rich motifs of Htt. Expression of IKK \u0004 promotes mutant Htt aggregation and nuclear localization. Conversely, an N-terminally truncated form of IKK \u0004, which interferes with IKK activity, blocks Htt-induced NF-\u0005B activation and reduces the toxicity of mutant Htt in cell culture and in an acute brain slice model of HD. Toxicity is also inhibited by expression of a mutant F-box deleted E-3 ubiquitin ligase, \u0001F-\u0003TRCP, which specifically blocks degradation of I \u0005B inhibitory proteins. Thus, aberrant interaction of mutant Htt with IKK \u0004, and subsequent NF- \u0005B activation, may be important for HD pathology. On the other hand, IKK \u0004 can influence Htt actions through non-NF- \u0005B pathways. Expression of IKK\u0004 promotes the toxicity of full-length mutant Htt, implicating IKK \u0004 as a modifier of mutant Htt toxicity. IKK\u0004 also promotes aggregation/oligomerization of mutant Htt. In neurons, IKK \u0004 is predominantly located in the nucleus. Microarray analysis shows that expression of IKK\u0004 from a recombinant lentivirus influences expression of many genes implicated in neuronal survival and differentiation. Studies are in progress to examine specific genes affected by IKK \u0004 that may regulate the toxicity of mutant Htt and neurodegeneration. 1Caltech undergraduate student 136. The role of I \u0005B-kinase complex in neuronal development and function Ali Khoshnan, Jan Ko The role of I \u0005B-kinase complex (IKK) in neuronal development, survival and degeneration is not understood. In non-neuronal cells IKK regulates the activity of the transcription factor NF- \u0005B. The core components of the IKK complex include two serine- threonine kinases IKK and IKK \u0003 also have NF- \u0004B independent functions. We showed that binding of mutant Htt to IKK \u0003 leads to aberrant IKK activity and enhances mutant Htt neurotoxicity (Khoshnan et al., 2004). On the other hand, mice deleted for both IKK \u0001 and IKK \u0002 die at E12 and display enhanced apoptosis in the neuroepithelium, indicating normal and regulated activity of IKK complex isessential for development and function of neurons. We are specifically interested in the function of IKK \u0001, as it has been implicated in chromatin modification in epithelial cells. We find that IKK \u0001 promotes neurite outgrowth in differentiating rat cortical stem cells and it is found in the growing tips of neurites. Growth cone cues such as netrin activate IKK. IKK \u0001 is activated in response to neuroprotective molecules such as IGF and estrogen, suggesting a role in neuronal survival. IKK \u0001 is translocated to the nucleus upon IGF treatment, where it colocalizes with CREB-binding protein. We are studying the mechanism of IKK \u0001 regulation of neurite outgrowth, as well as the signaling pathways influenced by the nuclear function of IKK \u0001 in neurons and neuroblasts.

Patterson, David Myszka1, Ronald Wetzel1, Chris Dealwis1 Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common dementia disorders, has profound medical andsocial consequences. Synaptic dysfunction,neurofribrillary tangles, neurodegeneration and memoryimpairment have been found in patients with AD. Amyloid-beta (A \u0002), either in soluble or insoluble form, has been hypothesized to be responsible for AD pathology. Both active and passive immunotherapy targeting A \u0002 have been shown to ameliorate histological and behavioral pathology in AD transgenic mice. Although clinical trials in human with active immunotherapy have been terminated because of occasional cases ofmeningoencephalitis, a safer vaccine is being soughtbecause of the impressive mouse results. We havegenerated a panel of monoclonal antibodies to the protofibril or fibril forms of A \u0002. The crystallographic structures of two of the antigen antibody-binding pairs have been determined, providing insight into rationaldesign for AD immunotherapy. 1University of Tennessee138. Maternal fetal brain Shi, Natalia Malkova, 1Yixuan Andy Shi, Paul H. PattersonEpidemiological studies have shown that maternal infection can increase the risk for mental illness in the offspring. In a mouse model of maternal respiratory infection with influenza virus, the adult offspring displaystriking behavioral, pharmacological and histologicalabnormalities. In addition to a localized loss of Purkinjecells that is strikingly similar to a common finding inautism, we find an altered migration of neurons in the fetalcortex. Whereas late-born cortical neurons areappropriately positioned in the upper layers in shamcontrol offspring and na\u00efve mice from postnatal day 0 toyoung adulthood, the late-born cortical neurons inoffspring of infected mothers are randomly distributedacross all layers. This neuropathology is of particular interest because it is very similar to that reported for mice whose level of Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1)mRNA is knocked down. It is possible that our finding inthe mouse model is relevant to the pathology andbehavioral abnormalities that have been linked to thecerebral cortex in schizophrenia. 1Temple City High School student 139. The maternal inflammatory response and its effects on fetal development and behavior of the adult offspring Benjamin E. Deverman, Wendy Xu1, Sarah Wadsworth2, Paul H. Patterson Significant epidemiological evidence indicates that there is an increased incidence of schizophrenia andautism in the offspring of women exposed to viralinfection during pregnancy. In a mouse model based onthese findings, the adult offspring of mothers exposed toinfluenza during pregnancy exhibit several behavioral andneuropathological abnormalities that are consistent withthose observed in schizophrenia and autism. Moreover,several of these abnormalities is also seen in the adult offspring of mothers injected with poly(I:C), a dsRNA that elicits an inflammatory response similar to that induced byinfluenza infection. The inflammatory response to viral infection and poly(I:C) administration is mediated by numerouscytokines, many of which could have profound effects onfetal brain development. Therefore, in an effort todetermine which cytokines may be responsible for theobserved behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities,we are measuring cytokine induction during theinflammatory response to poly(I:C) in both maternal and fetal tissues. As expected, we have found that the levels of numerous cytokines are strongly induced in the maternalserum during the response to poly(I:C). In addition, weobserve a significant increase in several of these cytokinesin the local fetal-maternal environment (i.e., the placenta,decidua, yolk sac, and amniotic fluid) during the responseto poly(I:C). In contrast, we have not yet detectedsignificantly increased levels of any cytokines examined in97 the fetus following poly(I:C) administration. We are currently attempting to increase the sensitivity of ourcytokine analysis protocols, assessing maternal and fetaltissues for changes in additional cytokines, and looking forevidence of downstream cytokine signaling pathwayactivation during the response to poly(I:C) in both the fetus and the fetal-maternal environment. Studies are ongoing to determine the consequences that these alterations in thefetal-maternal environment may have for fetal braindevelopment. 1Former Caltech undergraduate student 2Caltech undergraduate student 140. Int erleukin-6 as a mediator of the effect of maternal immune activation on fetal braindevelopmentStephen Smith, Paul Patterson Human studies demonstrate an increased risk for both schizophrenia and autism in children born to mothers who experienced a viral infection during pregnancy. Weare exploring a mouse model in which administration ofinfluenza virus during pregnancy induces behavioralabnormalities in the adult offspring. The virus itself is notnecessary, as we find that stimulation of the maternalimmune system by dsRNA (poly(I:C)) is sufficient tocause behavioral abnormalities in the offspring such asdeficits in prepulse inhibition, latent inhibition and openfield exploration. To test the hypothesis that elevated maternal cytokines mediate the effect of maternal immune activation on fetal brain development we administeredindividual cytokines to pregnant mice. A single injectionof interleukin-6 (IL-6) is sufficient to cause behavioraldeficits in the offspring. Moreover, administration of anti-IL-6 antibody along with poly(I:C) inhibits the effects ofpoly(I:C) on the offspring. Another project involves thestudy of maternal inflammatory cells in the fetuses ofpoly(I:C)-injected mothers. 141. The effect of prenatal influenza infection on neurobehavioral development of mouse offspringNatalia Malkova, Preetha SinhaWe are investigating the neurobehavioral development of mouse pups born to mothers whoseimmune systems were activated at mid-gestation. Testsinclude the rate of ultrasound vocalizations, which is veryimportant for mother-infant social interaction, maturationstatus of neuromotor reflexes, We findthat injection of double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)), whichevokes an inflammatory response in the mother similar to that induced by influenza virus, alters the behavior of the offspring. Compared to controls, 10-day old C57BL/6Jpups born to mothers given 10 mg/kg poly(I:C) have lowerrates of ultrasound calling when separated from theirmothers. We also monitored developing motor reflexessuch as negative geotaxis, righting, and grasping and usedbody weight as an indicator of general health. Nodifference is found in the physical abilities and generalhealth in the control and experimental groups. Thus, thedeficit in the social behavior of pups born to mothers withactivated immune systems is not due to a delay in physicaldevelopment. 142. Imaging hallucinations in mice Natalia Malkova, Doris Tse, Paul H. Patterson We are interested in whether hallucinations can be assayed in mice. Hallucinations can be defined as the normal activation of the visual or auditory system in theabsence of appropriate sensory input. A corollary is thatsuch activity should be enhanced by drugs that are knownto induce hallucinations in normal people and thatexacerbate this symptom in schizophrenic subjects.Activation of 5-HT 2A receptors (5-HT2AR) is thought to underlie the psychomimetic properties of hallucinogenicchemicals in humans. 5-HT 2A and lysergicacid diethylamide (LSD) stimulate head twitches in mice, which are not seen in 5-HT2AR null mutant mice. DOI and LSD stimulate similar profiles of erg 1, erg 2 and period 1 mRNAs [Gonzalez-Maeso et al . (2003) J. Neurosci. 23:8836]. We find that DOI induces stereotyped behavior in mice in a dose-dependent manner, and that this drugspecifically up-regulates egr 1 and c fos but not egr or period-1 immunoreactivity in the auditory, visual andsomatosensory cortices in a dark and quiet environment.In addition, 15 min exposure to DOI increases c jun phosphorylation in the somatosensory cortex and amygdala. Thus, in the absence of external acoustic and visual input, the hallucinogen DOI activates the sensorysystem and the amygdala, which has a primary role in theprocessing and memory of emotional reactions.

Effects of LIF on adult neural stem cells in normal and APP23 mice Sylvian Bauer Although neural stem cells (NSCs) persist in various areas of the adult brain, their contribution to brain repair, after injury, is very limited. Treatment withexogenous growth factors can mitigate this limitation,suggesting that the brain environment is normally deficientin permissive cues and that it may be possible to stimulatethe latent regenerative potential of endogenous progenitorswith appropriate signals. We analyzed the effects of over-expressing the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on adult neurogenesis in the normal brain. We found that LIF reduces neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb andsubventricular zone by acting directly on NSCs. LIFappears to promote their self-renewal, preventing theemergence of more differentiated cell types. Thisultimately leads to an expansion of the NSC pool. Ourresults have implications for the development of98 therapeutic strategies for brain repair, and suggest that LIF may be useful, in combination with other factors, inpromoting regeneration in the adult brain. Adult neurogenesis is studied in vivo using thymidine analogues such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)to label DNA synthesis during the S-phase of the cell cycle. However, BrdU may also label DNA synthesis events not directly related to cell proliferation, such asDNA repair and/or abortive reentry into the cell cycle,which can occur as part of an apoptotic process in post-mitotic neurons. We used three well-characterized modelsof neuronal apoptosis, (BrdU labeling) and death(TUNEL staining) to investigate the specificity of BrdUincorporation in the adult mouse brain in vivo . We find that BrdU is not significantly incorporated during DNArepair, and that labeling is not detected in vulnerable ordying post-mitotic neurons, even when a high dose of BrdU is directly infused into the brain. These findings have important implications for a controversy surroundingadult neurogenesis: the connection between cell cyclereactivation and apoptosis of terminally differentiatedneurons. 144. Generating mice that can be used to identify, alter or ablate newly generated neurons in the adult central nervous systemBenjamin E. DevermanNeurogenesis persists in the adult brain and might have a role in recovery from injuries to the central nervoussystem (CNS). However, the study of neurogenesis iscurrently limited by the lack of adequate tools to identifyand assess the participation of newly generated cells infunctional recovery in vivo . To address this problem, we generated mice with genetic modifications that we hopedwould allow us to permanently mark, genetically alter orablate newly generated cells throughout the CNS at anytime desired. We constructed a targeting vector that wasused to insert a doxycycline (dox)-inducible Crerecombinase system into the regulatory sequences of thesox 2 gene, a transcription factor whose expression is restricted to neural stem/progenitor cells. Unfortunately, when these mice were crossed with a Cre-dependentreporter line, and their offspring were treated with orwithout dox to test for dox-inducible reporter expression,reporter expression was widespread throughout the CNS inthe absence of dox. While we do not yet understand thecause of this dox-independent, Sox2-independent Creexpression, one possibility that we are now investigating isthat promoter interference from the PGK-neo cassette,which was inserted in the targeting vector to facilitateselection of embryonic stem cell clones carrying our knock-in cassette, causes leaky Cre expression. We have now removed this cassette from the knock-in line bycrossing these mice to flp recombinase expressing mice(the neo cassette is flanked by frt sites) and are currentlymating these new knock-in mice with cre-dependentreporter mice to test for dox-dependent cre expression inthe offspring. If we can overcome the difficulties withleaky Cre expression, these mice will provide us with apowerful tool to: (1) analyze the contribution that newlygenerated neurons and glia make in the healthy anddiseased/injured adult brain; and, (2) develop therapies thatenhance the repair capacity of endogenous stem/progenitorcells in models of CNS disease and injury. 145. The effect of endothelin receptor antagonists on cancer cells Jennifer MontgomeryWe are investigating the effect of two distinct endothelin receptor B (ETRB) antagonists on theproliferation of melanoma and glioma cells. Previouswork in this laboratory indicated that the ETRB antagonistBQ788 decreases melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo . We find that this is also true for the antagonist A-192621 in vitro . Moreover, both ETRB antagonists decrease proliferation in some glioma cell lines. Very high doses of antagonist are required to achieve a significant decrease in viable cell numbers, however. This, alongwith data on ETRB expression, led us to question themechanism of how the ETRB antagonists are working.Preliminary evidence suggests that these antagonists maynot be affecting proliferation changes through ETRB. Weare further assessing this by siRNA knockdown of ETRB,as well as exploring alternative signaling possibilities bymicroarray analysis. 146. Effects of size and aggregation on the neurotoxicity of Mn 3O4 Khoshnan, Janet Hering, Paul H. PattersonNanoparticles are used in many daily products including cosmetics and drug delivery. Exposure ofhumans to manganese can lead to the neurologicaldisorder, manganism. The pathology and symptoms of thedisease resemble those of Parkinson's disease. To betterunderstand their mechanism of action, we are exploring theeffects of manganese oxide nanoparticles on a humanembryonic neuronal cell line. Our initial data suggest thatexposure to Mn 3O4 causes dose-dependent cell death, which is influenced by particle size and time of exposure.Moreover, exposure to Mn 3O4 results in activation of the IKK-NF-\u0001B, as well as the p53 signaling pathways. Studies are in progress to examine the mechanism ofMn 3O4-induced cell death and to determine how the interaction between p53 and NF-\u0001 B may regulate neuronal death.

The ability of synapses to changethroughout the lifetime of the animal contributes to theability to learn and remember. We are interested in howsynapses are modified at the cellular and molecular level.We are also interested in how neuronal circuits changewhen synapses change their properties. We conduct all ofour studies in the hippocampus, a structure known to beimportant for memory in both humans and animals. Weuse molecular biology, electrophysiology and imaging to address the questions detailed below. A major focus of the lab concerns the cell biological mechanisms that govern modifications atindividual synaptic sites. In particular, we are interested inthe idea that dendritic protein synthesis and degradationmay contribute to synaptic plasticity. We are alsointerested in mRNA and protein trafficking during synapticplasticity. We are also examining the role of the cadherins family of cell adhesion molecules in synaptic plasticity.Several labs have shown that cadherins are localized to synapses in the hippocampus. Earlier, we demonstrated that function-blocking cadherin antibodies or peptides canprevent long-term potentiation, without interfering withbasal synaptic transmission. We hypothesize that cadherinbonds may be sensitive to local fluxes in extracellularcalcium imposed by action potential activity. We are nowexamining the molecular mechanisms by which cadherinsinfluence synaptic strength and the involvement of cadherins in the formation and maintenance of synapses,using fluorescence resonance energy transfer andendocytosis assays. A relatively new endeavor in the lab involves the recording of single neuron activities in the medial temporal lobe of human epilepsy patients. In these studies, we are able to correlate single neuron responses with behavioralexperience and performance. These studies shouldelucidate some fundamental mechanisms of brain codingand representation. 147. BO NCAT and FUNCAT - novel approaches for the identification and visualization oflocally synthesized proteins in neuronaldendrites Daniela C. Dieterich *, Jennifer J. Lee, John T. Ngo1, David A. Tirrell1, Johannes Graumann2 In both normal and pathological states, cells respond rapidly to environmental cues by synthesizing newproteins. Both the selective identification andvisualization of a newly synthesized proteome has beenhindered by the basic fact that all proteins, new and old,share the same pool of amino acids and thus arechemically indistinguishable. R ecently, we have developed a tool (BONCAT) for the specific identificationof newly synthesized proteins. This approach is basedupon the co-translational introduction of smallbioorthogonal chemical groups via the incorporation of modified amino acids into proteins and the chemoselective tagging of labeled proteins with an affinity tag via [3+2]click chemistry. Furthermore, we have extended thisproteomic approach by using fluorescent tags to visualizenewly synthesized proteins (FUNCAT). Incorporation of the modified amino acids is unbiased, non-toxic and does not increase proteindegradation. As a first demonstration of the BONCATmethod, we recently reported the selective purification andidentification of 195 proteins withmultidimensional liquid chromatography in-line withtandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a mammalian cell line. The identified proteins, synthesized in a 2-hour window, possess a broad range of biochemical propertiesand span most functional gene ontology categories. Themass spectrometrical identification of newly synthesizedproteins is performed in the laboratory of Professor RayDeshaies, Division of Biology, at Caltech. In addition toBONCAT, we are now able to visualize newly synthesizedproteins in situ in primary hippocampal neurons using water-soluble fluorescent tags (FUNCAT) by confocalmicroscopy. While abundant signal is detected in cellstreated with the modified amino acids, no signal is detected in protein synthesis-inhibitor treated cultures, confirming that this procedure labels newly synthesizedproteins with high specificity. Strikingly, newlysynthesized proteins in the soma of dissociatedhippocampal cultures can be detected as early as 10minutes after contact with the modified amino acids. Thisnew set of tools makes it possible to address the temporal101 and spatial characteristics of newly synthesized proteomes in any cell type under basal, as well as, elevated levels ofsynaptic activity. *DCD is supported by the German Academy for Natural Scientists LEOPOLDINA (BMBF LPD9901/8 95).Work is supported by NIH NIDA 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 2Deshaies Lab, Division of Biology, Caltech 148. Elucidating C. Dieterich *, David A. Tirrell1 Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter that innervates multiple structures in the brain, such as thestriatum, prefrontal cortex, and the hippocampus.Abnormalities in dopamine regulation are responsible fordisorders like Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studiesfound that there is activation in the mesolimbic systemduring reward-mediated learning. The mesolimbic systemis one of the four major dopaminergic pathways in thehuman brain and includes the ventral tegmental area and the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a bilateral, horn- shaped structure that has been implicated in theestablishment of learning and memory in mammalianspecies ranging from rats to humans. Recent work in cultured hippocampal neurons by our lab has shown that dopamine modulates local proteinsynthesis in neuronal dendrites. Even though we understand that dopamine plays a role in protein synthesis,no one has yet identified the specific proteins that areproduced upon dopaminergic stimulation. In order to specifically enrich for the newly synthesized proteinsproduced upon dopaminergic stimulation, we have employed the above-described approach of bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid conjunction with multidimensional protein identificationtechnology (MudPIT), we are able to identify the proteins in synaptoneurosomes in which synthesis is modulated bydopamine with high levels of accuracy and sensitivity.The mass spectrometrical identification of newlysynthesized proteins is performed in the laboratory ofProfessor Raymond J. Deshaies, Division of Biology, atCaltech. The mass spectrometry data is then passedthrough the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP, developed by the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, WA), which provides tools for quantification and identification of ourproteins. To identify the dopamine-induced somaticproteome, we analyze newly synthesized proteins fromwhole acutehippocampal slices; for analyzenewly synthesized rat brainsynaptoneurosomes somata and nuclei. Isolated dendrites will beobtained from a special culture system using polycarbonatenets to separate dendrites from cell bodies. *DCD is supported by the German Academy for Natural Scientists LEOPOLDINA (BMBF LPD9901/8 95).

Mysore, Chin Yin TaiN-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule that has been shown to play an important role in synapse formationduring the development of neuronal circuits. However, theextent of its role in the maintenance of mature synapses islargely unknown. We investigated the role of N-cadherinin regulating the structure and function of maturehippocampal synapses in cultured neurons. We found thatthe acute disruption of N-cadherin with a 10-minute application of the HAV peptide produced drastic effects on synaptic structure. Time-lapse confocal microscopyrevealed that spines shorten and are more motile soon afterN-cadherin disruption (75 minutes post treatment). Thisdestabilization of spines is followed by spine loss at 180minutes post-t reatment. We find that the earlier increase in motility and decrease in length are predictive of laterspine loss. In addition to structural postsynaptic changes,we find changes both in the function and the biochemicalcomposition of synapses. The frequency of miniaturesynaptic events is reduced to 50% at 30 minutes following N-cadherin disruption. Concomitantly, we see a decreased binding of N-cadherin to \u0001-catenin, a signaling molecule immediately downstream of N-cadherin. Consistent with earlier work, we see an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of \u0001-catenin as well. Experiments in heterologous cells suggest that these large-scale synaptic changes are the result of a long-lasting effect of the HAVpeptide on N-cadherin mediated adhesion. Thus, our worksheds light on the key role of N-cadherin in the stabilityand function of mature synapses. 150. Information integration in CA1 pyramidal neurons Hiroshi ItoA number of studies indicate that the hippocampus is required to form certain types of memory.Among the subregions of the hippocampus, area CA1 isconsidered as a final relay station of the hippocampalformation and thus is expected to play a significant role inhippocampal function. Area CA1 receives two distinctexcitatory synaptic inputs; one is from area CA3 (Schaffer-collateral pathway) and the other is from the entorhinal cortex (temporoammonic pathway). Considering the large differences in in vivo neural activities between area CA3 and the entorhinal cortex, integration betweentwo pathways is likely crucial for hippocampal function.We are interested in the modulation of integration byseveral types of neuromodulators, such as dopamine oracetylcholine, which are thought to have important roles inlearning. We observe that dopamine not only depresses102 basal synaptic transmission , but also enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) in the temporoammonic pathway. However, under GABA receptors blockade with bicuculline and CGP55845, dopamine still depresses basalsynaptic transmission but does not enhance LTP, whichsuggests that interneurons play a major role in dopamine- induced enhancement of LTP. We hypothesize that thedopamine-induced depression of ex citatory inputs interneurons reduces inhibition of pyramidal neurons,which eventually enhances LTP. Furthermore, our datasuggests that the impact of dopaminergic modulationdepends on the stimulus frequency; i.e., higher frequencystimuli have a larger impact under dopamine application.On the other hand, in spite of strong modulation of thetemporoammonic pathway, we did not observe majoreffects of dopamine on the Schaffer-collateral pathway.Considering our results together, dopamine selectivelymodulates the impact of the temporoammonic pathway and regulates the information flow in area CA1. 151. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spinesBaris Bingol, Erin M. SchumanThe regulated degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is emerging as an importantmodulator of synaptic function and plasticity. Theproteasome is a large, multi-subunit cellular machine thatrecognizes, unfolds and degrades target polyubiquitinated proteins. Here we report the NMDA (N-methyl- Daspartate) r redistribution to synaptic spines upon synaptic stimulation, providing a mechanism for localprotein degradation. Using a proteasome-activity reporterand local perfusion, we show synaptic dendrites. Weused restricted photobleaching of individual spines anddendritic shafts to reveal the dynamics that underlieproteasome sequestration, and show that activity modestlyenhances the entry rate of proteasomes into spines whiledramatically reducing their exit rate. Proteasome sequestration is persistent, reflecting an association with the actin-based cytoskeleton. Together, our data indicatethat synaptic activity can promote the recruitment andsequestration of proteasomes to locally remodel the proteincomposition of synapses. 152. eEF2 couples weak synaptic activation to suppression of dendritic translation Michael A. Sutton, Erin M. SchumanLocal protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites has emerged as a powerful mechanism for regulating both basal synaptic function and activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy. We have previously reported thatongoing weak synaptic activation conferred by miniaturesynaptic transmission (minis) inhibits local translation indendrites of hippocampal neurons (Sutton et al., 2004) and that this regulation acts to stabilize synaptic functionduring activity blockade (Sutton et al., 2006). Here, weshow that the coupling of minis to the translationalmachinery in dendrites is mediated, in (eEF2). eEF2catalyzes ribosomal and its activity is strongly inhibited byphosphorylation. In the absence of action potential (AP)- evoked neurotransmission, mini blockade inhibits eEF2 phosphorylation, whereas acute stimulation of eEF2 kinase inhibitors produces local translationalactivation in treated dendritic segments. These results thusindicate that eEF2 serves as a local biochemical sensordesigned for coupling weak synaptic activation with localtranslational suppression in dendrites.

MysoreN-cadherin, of the major cell adhesion molecule at excitatory synapses, regulates synapticstructure and plasticity. The amount of N-cadherin presentat synapses regulates the strength of the adhesive forceacross the synaptic junction. Very little is known, however, about the turnover of N-cadherin at the synapse and the mechanisms that underlie its exo- and endocytosis.Our results show, for the first time, that the constitutiveinternalization and recycling of N-cadherin occurs rapidly.We hypothesized that this turnover can be regulated bysynaptic activity. Indeed, we found that the activation ofNMDAR causes a delay in the N-cadherin internalization.This delay resulted in an accumulation of surfaceN-cadherin at both synaptic- and extrasynaptic sites. Toelucidate the mechanism, we investigated the role of \u0001-catenin, an N-cadherin binding protein, in the regulation of N-cadherin endocytosis. In heterologous cells,\u0001-catenin negatively regulates the endocytosis of N-cadherin. In neurons, NMDAR activity resulted in anincrease in the N-cadherin/ \u0001-catenin binding accompanied by a decrease in the amount of tyrosine phosphorylated\u0001-catenin. These results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of \u0001-catenin regulates N-cadherin endocytosis. When a of \u0001-catenin (Y654F, mimics no phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 654) was expressed in neurons, the NMDAR-dependent regulationof N-cadherin internalization was abolished and surfaceN-cadherin was stabilized, suggesting that tyrosine residue 654 of \u0001 -catenin is required for this process. In addition,103 we found that the overexpression of \u0001 -catenin Y654F mutant in neurons blocks chemical long-term depression (chemLTD) produced by NMDA treatment. Together, wehave demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of \u0001 -catenin. We have also demonstrated that the prolonged stabilization of N-cadherin at the surface causes deregulation of synaptic plasticity. We propose that the \u0001-catenin-dependent regulation of N- cadherin endocytosis plays an important role not only in structural plasticity but also in synaptic function. 154. D elivery of RNAs into neurons using the penetratin peptide Hwan Ching TaiWe are interested in utilizing the penetratin peptide to develop new tools to study synaptic function Penetratin is Antennapedia capable of crossing the cytoplasmicmembrane by clathrin-independent endocytosis. It has been shown to function in essentially all mammalian cells tested to date, including neurons. Penetratin can beutilized to carry various types of molecular cargos acrossthe cell membrane, if the cargo is covalently linked topenetratin. When the covalent linkage is a disulfide bond,the cargo can be automatically released inside the cell dueto reduction by intracellular glutathione. Penetratin hasbeen successfully applied to as, macromolecules such as DNAs, RNAs andpeptides. Our laboratory in hippocampal neurons, protein- synthesis-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity can occur on the timescale of tens of minutes to several hours.Therefore, fast-acting RNA interference (RNAi) methodsare required to investigate such dynamic changes. RNAiin cultured neurons is generally based on DNA-derivedsiRNAs, which are slow-acting because vector entry andgene transcription are rate-limiting steps. We are testing ifpenetratin-mediated siRNA could induce fast-acting RNAiresponses. Recent reports have shown that microRNAsand enzymes required for microRNA function (Dicer andArgonaute) are localized in dendrites. We are also interested in delivering microRNAs via penetratin to examine the role of microRNAs in the dynamic regulationof synaptic function. Reference Lugli, G., Larson, J., (2005) of cadherin-cadherin association in living cellsEric MosserIn the last decade, much effort has been devoted to understanding the structure and molecular associationsof classic cadherins. Crystallographic and biophysical studies have yielded somewhat conflicting results and an, as yet unclear, picture of the homotypic interactions of thecadherin extracellular domain during dimerization. Tobetter understand the dynamics of cadherin interactions wehave developed Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer(FRET)-based sensors to monitor cadherin associationsacross cellular junctions in a dynamic manner in livingcells. We have fluorescently tagged cadherin molecules in their extracellular domains and expressed FRET-donorand FRET-acceptor cadherins in pre- and postjunctionalcells to monitor the strength of adhesion. We have demonstrated FRET between ECFP and EYFP labeled cadherins in double-transfected HEK 293 cells (expressingboth donor acceptor constructs), as well as, FRETbetween adjacent single-transfected COS7 cells. It has long been known that the structural integrity of cadherins and their dimerization status isdependent on the local calcium concentration. We haveobserved that reducing Ca 2+ in the extracellular solution leads to a significant loss of FRET signal at COS7 celljunctions expressing FRET pairs and have used repeated,fast scans of cell pairs to monitor FRET changes dues to changes in extracellular Ca 2+ during perfusion with Ca2+ or Ca2+ chelators; allowing us to examine the dynamics of cadherin-cadherin interactions on a shorter time scale. FRET is unique in its ability to provide signals that are sensitive to changes in intra- or intermolecular distances in the 1-10 nm range, well below the inherentdiffraction limit of conventional fluorescence microscopy.We believe that FRET is a powerful technique to monitorcadherin orientation and interactions in heterologous,living cells. 156. S timulation-dependent assembly and trafficking of ribosomes in neurons Young J. YoonPrevious observations of ribosomes in dendrites of hippocampal neurons suggests that the translationalcapacity of synapses in spines is limited by the number ofribosomes available in the dendritic pool. Studies of fixedsamples have shown that each synapse, on the average,possesses only one to two polysomes The apparentshortage of translational machinery in dendrites poses several challenges to cells that utilize local translation as a key mechanism to modulate cellular responses to amultitude of external stimuli. To this end, experimentshave been designed to address the ways in which neuronsmay budget or expand their translational capacity to meetthe growing demands. Our goal is to test and determinewhether neurons manage the translational capacity of its104 dendrites in a dynamic (shared) or static (all or none) manner. There have been successes in studying ribosomes in cultured cells by expressing fluorescently-labeledribosomal proteins. By expressing 60S and 40S subunitproteins which are tagged with different fluorescent proteins, it will be possible to track localization of the subunits by time-lapse imaging. In addition, it will bepossible to study stimulation-dependent trafficking andassembly of ribosomes as neurons are cells with highmorphological complexity. 157. Firing properties of human hippocampal neurons during reward expectance anddeliveryUeli Rutishauser, Adam N. MamelakThe of midbrain dopaminergic neurons to cortex and the limbic system are crucial for many forms of learning. Dopaminergic neurons fire when animals encounter unexpected events (novelty) or whenthere is a mismatch between what (reward) is expected andwhat is received. The hippocampus is known to becrucially involved in learning and receives a prominentdopaminergic input. Recently, we have identified neuronsin the human hippocampus that fire strongly only to thefirst (\"novelty detectors\") or second and following(\"familiarity detectors\") presentation of a stimulus. Theseneurons are thus capable of single-trial learning. We havethus constructed a behavioral task involving reward to investigate whether dopamine modulates the firing properties of hippocampal neurons. We recorded singleneuron activity from intracranial depth the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and anteriorcingulate cortex of epilepsy surgery patients. The patientswere exposed to a demanding reaction time task combinedwith a reward delivery. Within a given trial, visual cueswere provided that predicted whether a given trial wouldbe rewarded or not (dependent on performance). Wefound that a subset of human MTL neurons, both in theamygdala and hippocampus, are strongly driven by theexpectance and/or delivery of reward. Particularly, we find neurons that appear to be tuned to the magnitude and valence of the reward, for example, \"high reward\" or\"punishment.\" Remarkably, many neurons fire moststrongly at the conclusion of a trial, following rewarddelivery or absence. These data suggest that therepresentation of learned information in the firing activityof hippocampal neurons is influenced by rewardexpectancy and magnitude. Publications Beatty, K., Liu, J.

Vigorous collaborations are conducted in ourpsychophysics laboratory here and the Japan site located at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan. Using a variety of methods, including eye tracking, EEG, fMRI and MEG, we examine how exactlyperipheral sensory stimuli, neural activity in the sensorycortex, and the mental experience of perception are relatedto each other. As for objectives of the new ERATOproject, we aim to understand implicit, as opposed toexplicit or conscious, somatic and neural processes thatlead to, and thus predict, conscious emotional decisionsuch as preference. In addition, we have some purely theoretical meta-analysis on human color perception, complexity ofvisual letters and objects, etc. (1) We continue our work applying TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) to the visual cortex ofalert normal subjects, to reveal neural mechanismsunderlying conscious visual perceptual experience. In thelatest study, we have demonstrated that \"impossible space\" is represented in the visual cortex. We compared spatialposition/extension of phosphene (illusory light field)triggered by dual-pulse TMS, when gaze upper most vs.lower most. The results strongly indicate that thephosphene may extend into space beyond the typical outer range of the visibility (such as \"under the chin\" or \"inside of the chest\"). This may be understood as an emergentproperty of gain field, or gaze-dependent modulation ofneuronal activity. In yet another study we applied TMS tosaccade mislocalization phenomenon, and provided thefirst direct evidence against any account based on theneural delay from the retina to the cortex. We showed thatTMS-triggered phosphene, which would not have theneural delay that visual stimuli typically have, yetundergoes an equally large magnitude of saccademislocalization. (2) We compared color modulation of bare skin color which signals emotional change, and sensitivity of the human color system in the relevant middle-wavelengthrange. We then came up with a surprising conclusion thatevolution of primate color perception is at least underinfluence of socio-emotional signaling via skin colormodulation in the others. (3) We compared the structures of letters and symbols in natural languages on one hand, and those ofobjects in natural scenes on the other hand. It turned outthat the structures of letters and symbols throughouthuman history are selected to match those found in objects in natural scenes. (4) Applying adaptation/aftereffect paradigm and fMRI, we investigate how consciously visible/invisibleadaptor contributes to aftereffect. In the special case offace adaptation, unlike lower-level perceptual adaptationssuch as tilt or contrast adaptation, we found that onlyvisible duration of adaptor face contributes to face-identityaftereffect later. On a related issue, when the eyere-fixated elsewhere after adaptation, there was a gaze-dependent modulation of color and depth aftereffects. Theeffect of face adaptation seems to be spatially un-tuned,that is, remains everywhere regardless of the location on the retina or the space. (5) Following our earlier work indicating that dynamic gaze shift (and perhaps orienting response ingeneral) is a somatic precursor of conscious preferencejudgment, we extended the analyses by manipulating theinitial attractiveness difference in the pair of faces, and seehow much gaze manipulation can affect the preferencedecision depending on the initial differences. The resultindicates that even with the largest baseline difference,gaze manipulation affects the final preference decisionequally effectively. (6) We compared reward and punishment- avoidance in fMRI. While obtaining a reward-elicitedactivity in classical reward structures, avoidance ofpunishment did not elicit significant activity in those areas.These data suggest that reward and avoidance conditioningare very distinct processes despite their common behavior-reinforcing properties.106 (7) As a part of the ERATO project, we examined fMRI signals in response to a more preferable face vs. aless preferable one. As a result, we found some earlyactivation of a subcortical area (nucleus accumbens) withlate activation of a more prefrontal area. This earlyactivation was task-independent, thus indicating automatic, bottom-up emotional activation. (8) We continue to address the issue of how position and motion information are linked in the visualprocessing. In a psychophysical study, we examined howsequence-of-snapshots evolve to a smooth motiontrajectory. Yet another study examined contradictoryperception of position and motion trajectory. The thirdstudy demonstrated a cyclopean (i.e., binocularly fused)version of the flash lag. (9) In collaboration with Boston University group, we examine a very paradoxical situation whereweaker visual motion signals (distractor) lead to a larger interference effect with motor responses. We suspect that this may be something to do with salience of the distractorsignals and top-down control specific to the task. (10) We reported a special case of auditory-visual integration where visual motion effect sound sourcelocalization (ventriloquism) except that the effect iscumulative over cycles. We coined it \"movingventriloquism.\" 158. The optimal human ventral stream from estimates of the complexity of visual objects Mark A. Changizi The part of the primate visual cortex responsible for the recognition of objects is parceled into about adozen areas organized somewhat hierarchically (the regionis called the ventral stream). Why are there approximatelythis many hierarchical levels for object recognition? HereI put forth a generic information-processing hierarchicalmodel for visual object recognition, and show how thetotal number of neurons required depends on the numberof hierarchical levels and the complexity of visual objectsthat must be recognized. Because the recognition ofwritten words appears to occur in a similar part of inferotemporal cortex as other visual objects, the complexity of written words may be similar to that of othervisual objects; for this reason, I measure the complexity ofwritten words, and use it as an approximate estimate of thecomplexity of visual objects more generally. I then showthat the information-processing hierarchy thataccommodates visual objects of that complexity possessesthe minimum number of neurons when the number ofhierarchical levels is approximately 15 and when the sizesof areas decrease exponentially with level, each level onaverage approximately 1.25 times larger than the level above it. I show that these optimal properties are close to those found in the primate ventral stream.159. Bare skin, blood, and the evolution of primate color visionMark A. Changizi, Qiong Zhang, ShinsukeShimojoThe primate face undergoes color modulations (such as blushing or blanching), some which may be selected for signaling and some that may be an inevitable consequence of underlying physiological modulations.Because for highly social animals like most primates, oneof the most important kinds of object to be competent atperceiving and discriminating is other members of one'sown species, we hypothesized that primate color vision hasbeen selected for discriminating the short-term spectralmodulations on the skin of conspecifics, these modulationsproviding useful information about the current state ormood of another conspecific. Here we show that for thetwo dimensions of skin spectral variation in the short term,the dimension due to the fraction of blood in the skin corresponds approximately to the blue-yellow opponent channel (more blood ==> bluer), and the other dimensiondue to oxygen saturation of the blood correspondsapproximately to the red-green opponent channel (greateroxygenation ==> redder). Trichromats, but notdichromats, are therefore, sensitive to both dimensions ofskin color variation, and, more specifically, the wavelengthsensitivities of the M and L cones for trichromatic primatesare near optimal for sensing modulations of oxygensaturation. Also, because skin color modulation cannot beseen on a furry face, trichromatic primates tend to have bare faces. 160. The structures of letters and symbols throughout human history are selected tomatch those found in objects in natural scenesMark A. Changizi, Qiong Zhang, Hao Ye,Shinsuke Shimojo Are there empirical regularities in the shapes of letters and other human visual signs, and if so, what are theselection pressures underlying these regularities? Toexamine this, we determined a wide variety oftopologically distinct contour configurations, andexamined the relative frequency of these configurationtypes across non-logographic writing systems, Chinesewriting, and non-linguistic symbols. Our first, and main,result is that these three classes of human visual signpossess a similar signature in their configurationdistribution, suggesting that there are underlying principles governing the shapes of human visual signs. Second, we provide evidence that the shapes of visual signs areselected to be easily seen, at the expense of the motorsystem. Finally, we provide evidence to support anecological hypothesis that visual signs have been culturallyselected to match the kinds of conglomerations of contoursfound in natural scenes, because that is what we haveevolved to be good at visually processing.107 161. Does avoiding a punishment act as a reward? An fMRI study of avoidance learningHackjin Kim *, Shinsuke Shimojo, Ralph Adolphs*, John P.O'Doherty* Avoidance conditioning involves learning to perform a response to avoid an aversive event. Avoidance learning poses a challenge for theories of instrumental conditioning because once the punishment is successfullyavoided the subject no longer experiences negativereinforcement for their behavior. Thus, behavior appearsto be maintained in the absence of reinforcement. Onepossible account for this is to propose that avoiding apunishment is in itself a reward, and thus, avoidancebehavior is positively reinforced on each trial when thepunishment is successfully avoided. In the present studywe aimed to address the question of whether avoidance ofpunishment recruits the same or distinct neural circuitry asthat elicited by a reward itself. We scanned 16 human subjects with fMRI while they performed an instrumental choice task in which they could win or lose money. Inreward condition subjects could choose one of two actionsthat led to a greater (60%) or lesser (30%) probability ofobtaining a monetary reward (gaining $1). In avoidancecondition they could choose between two actions whichwere associated with a greater (60%) or lesser (30%)chance of avoiding a monetary loss (losing $1). Over thecourse of the experiment subjects showed a statisticallysignificant preference for the action associated with alesser probability of punishment and for the action associated with the greater probability of reward, indicating that they had shown avoidance, as well asreward conditioning. However, contrary to thereinforcement account of avoidance learning, avoiding apunishment and obtaining a reward were associated withdifferent patterns of neural activity. While obtaining areward-elicited activity in classical reward amygdala,avoidance of punishment did not elicit significant activityin those areas. These data suggest that reward andavoidance conditioning are very distinct processes despite their common behavior-reinforcing properties. *Division of Humanities and Social Science, Caltech Citation Kim, H., Shimojo, S., Adolphs, R. and O'Doherty, J.P.

Auditory-motor delay simultaneity Shinohara*, exposure to relationship leads to recalibration of the two modalities, spatially (Welch, 1978) and/or temporally (Cunningham et al., 2001). We question if personal sensorimotor adaptation modulates the perception of others performingidentical motor actions with sensory feedback. The experiment consisted of three phases: Pretest, adaptation and post-test. In the adaptation phase,subjects were exposed to temporal misalignment ofauditory stimulus and arm motion. Subjects moved acomputer mouse horizontally while a delayed (150ms)\"click\" sound was delivered whenever the mouse ceased tomove. We instructed the subjects to temporally align the \"click\" to a metronome \"beep.\" Only a fixation spot was displayed on the monitor and the subject's arm wasscreened to eliminate possible auditory-visual adaptation. For the test of adaptation, we examined three types of subjective simultaneity on an event basis withoutthe use of a metronome. In the \"self\" test, the participantsjudged the simultaneity of self-mouse stoppage and a\"click\" sound. In the \"other\" test, the participants viewedthe experimenter maneuvering the mouse and judged thesimultaneity of mouse stoppage and a \"click.\" Finally forcontrol, we tested the subjective simultaneity of a simple visual flash and a \"click.\" The psychophysical results indicated statistically significant shifts in subjective simultaneity toward the lagof auditory stimulus for both the \"self\" test (+72 ms) andthe \"other\" test (+35 ms), but not for control. Our resultssuggest possible involvement of the mirror system inprojecting personal sensorimotor recalibration toobservation of other's action. *University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan M.

A syste matic effect Claudiu Simion, Shinsuke ShimojoWe (Shimojo, Simion et al, 2003) have advanced the hypothesis that orienting behavior and cognitioninteract in a positive feedback loop forming the backbone of preference decisions. The fewer the cognitive \"reasons\" to prefer a stimulus in a comparison task, the stronger theinfluence of orienting behavior. We demonstrated thatorienting can directly influence subjects' preferencedecision by manipulating subjects' gaze, and that thestimuli oriented towards for longer times were chosen asmore attractive when the difference in base attractivenessrating was small. The effect was not due to mereexposure. The present study is a systematic investigationof the phenomenon of gaze manipulation under variouscognitive loads. Observers rated a human face databasefor attractiveness, after which they were presented with pairs of faces drawn from this database. The pairing was done so that the difference in attractiveness rating variesfrom large to zero. One of the faces was the \"target,\" andthe subject was forced to orient to it longer. We show that,regardless of the initial difference in rating, the percentageof cases in which the target face is chosen is on-average 14percent larger in the gaze manipulation compared to thecontrol task. We conclude that orienting influencespreference at all levels of cognitive load, making astimulus initially considered less attractive more likely tobe preferred.

An Wu, Shinsuke Shimojo Accurate spatial localization of a visual stimulus requires the integration of its retinal position with the direction of gaze at the time of stimulus presentation. Butstudies have shown that brief visual targets presented nearthe time of saccades tend to be mislocalized.Mislocalization starts growing long before a saccade(~100ms) and reaches a maximum at saccade onset. Thispresaccadic mislocalization has often been attributed to thetemporal mismatch between the visual and eye positionsignals due to the long visual afferent delay (>50ms). Todirectly test if the visual afferent delay is necessary for presaccadic mislocalization, we investigated how observers localize phosphenes induced by transcranialmagnetic stimulation (TMS) of the visual cortex (thus,bypassing the afferent delay) around the time of saccades. Observers who consistently perceived single phosphene with a sharp vertical edge were screened andtested in two conditions. In one condition, a dual-pulseTMS was applied over the left visual cortex at varioustimes while they were performing a delayed (rightward)saccade task. Observers reported the perceived position ofthe leftmost edge of the phosphene with a mouse cursorpresented after a saccade. In the other condition, insteadof applying TMS, a dim vertical bar was presented (13ms) on the monitor screen. Most observers mislocalized TMS-induced phosphene near the time of saccades as they did for the flashed bar. The time course and magnitude of the errorfor both types of stimuli were practically identical. Thus,presaccadic mislocalization should be explained with someother factors than afferent delay.

Face adaptation depends on gaze (overt attention) to the faceFarshad Moradi, Shinsuke ShimojoWe are studying gaze dependence of adaptation to faces and scenes using fMRI. Previous studies indicateface adaptation is non-retinotopic, but its gaze dependencyhas not been systematically examined. In Experiment 1we demonstrated robust adaptation to foveal faces andscenes in FFA and PPA, respectively, using apsychophysical paradigm known to induce identity aftereffect: After 4 sec adaptation to a face (scene) followed by 0.8 sec blank, either a different, or an identicalimage of the same category (probe) was presented for 0.8sec. Observers reported if adaptor and test were the same.A different probe evoked significantly larger BOLDresponse in FFA(PPA) than the same image. InExperiment 2, adaptor and probe were displayed inperiphery (7.2 deg, same hemifield), and we measuredBOLD activity in the contralateral area. Adaptation tofaces, but not scenes, was considerably weaker than inExperiment 1. Experiment 3 examined whether gazeaffects the adaptation phase, or the subsequent testing (probe). A foveal adaptor resulted in significant aftereffect in periphery. Almost no adaptation occurred when adaptorwas peripheral and probe was foveal. No such dependencywas found for scenes. The BOLD activities evoked byperipheral and foveal faces/scenes were about the same.Thus, different activation is ruled out as a confound. Weconclude that adaptation to faces but not scenes dependson overt attention during adaptation. These results areunlikely to be due to the reduced resolution in theperiphery as scenes contained more high-spatial frequencyinformation than faces. Citation Moradi, F. and Shimojo, S. Vision 6(6) 875a, An Wu, Junghyun Park, Shinsuke ShimojoWhen peering through binoculars, one is acutely aware of the blackness that frames the field of view. Onemight expect that such a blackness should also frame our everyday field of vision; as we move our eyes about, portions of the retina are alternately exposed to the worldor shaded by the eye socket. Demonstration: With your gaze fixated on a distant object, tip your head downwards. As your foreheadbegins to descend over your field of view, you mighttheoretically expect to see a tall curtain of blackness overthe covered area. Instead, you never see more than a thindark band\u2014areas beyond that simply fall out of yourvisual awareness. These areas have been termed \"impossible\" space, because the retina cannot receive line-of-sight activation from these directions. Hayhoe & Williams (1984) and Cavanagh & Barton (VSS 2001) used afterimages andscleral illumination to demonstrate that even active retinalinput corresponding to impossible locations does not reachvisual awareness. Here, we directly stimulate visual cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), inducingpercepts of brightness (phosphenes). Because phosphenescan be induced in a retinotopically stable fashion, we canattempt to induce them in impossible locations bymanipulating eye position. Participants were tested both in total darkness and under low illumination. They reported the spatial position and extent of their phosphenes withrespect to various fixation points. Almost all participants reported one or both of the following: 1) In the dark, phosphenes could extend intoimpossible locations. These locations were described as\"inside my cheeks/chest,\" \"behind my ears,\" etc. 2) Underdim light, these percepts were abolished. Participantsreported shifts in location or \"squashing\" of the shape to fitwithin the visual field. This indicates that it is possible for visual awareness to extend into ecologically impossible space. However, when environmental illumination is present, the phosphene's retinotopic-egocentric correspondences maybecome remapped to respect visual field boundaries. Hayhoe, M.M. and Williams, D.R.

Dynamic *, Ryota Kanai, Shinsuke Shimojo In visual perception, position and motion interact reciprocally. While motion is a construct consisting of aseries of sequential changes in position, the perception ofmotion is considered to be more than just a series ofchanges in the perceived stimulus position. To investigatethe evolving process of motion percept starting from theonset of motion, we had observers detect a small transientgap (13 ms long) within an otherwise smooth motionsequence. Observers were highly sensitive to a gap thatoccurred early in the motion (< 200 ms from motiononset). However, their sensitivity to detect the gapdeteriorated as the motion continued (> 300 ms), indicating perceived motion became smoother and filled in over the course of motion. Moreover, the same temporal pattern ofdecline in detection performance was observed fortransient change in shape or color. Experiments suggestthat motion blur does not account for the effect, as blur hasdifferent temporal characteristics, and blur decreases, notincreases with time. Our results together imply that thevisual system processes a moving stimulus initially as aseries of snapshots, but then gradually develops a holisticpercept of motion as the motion continues. Once themotion system is sufficiently activated, stimuli presentedat different times begin to be integrated into a single, coherent entity. Our results therefore, suggest perception of object motion begins as a series of discrete, unintegratedsnapshots in a way akin to that of an akinetopsic patient. *University of Houston, Houston, TX CitationSheth, B., Kanai, and Shimojo, S.

Greater response conflict from generally thought that strong conflicting signals have greater negative impacts on task performancethan relatively weaker conflicting signal. Here we showthat this is not necessarily the case for visual-motorcontingencies. We used a novel procedure where subjectsjudged the color (blue or green) of a visual stimulus bymaking a color-contingent leftward or rightward motion. In the background, a certain percent of coherently moving dots was presented with leftward or rightward direction,but which was irrelevant to the task. In half the trials, thedirection of the \"correct\" motor response was the same asthe direction of motion-stimulus (i.e., congruent trials),whereas in the other half of trials, the correct responsedirection was opposite to the coherent motion direction(i.e., incongruent trials). The coherent motion percentagewas randomly chosen for each trial and ranged from0-100%. Interestingly, we found a non-monotonicrelationship with a significant dip in performance at around 25% motion coherence with recoveries of performance on either side. Reaction times trended higherat 25% coherence, opposite to the prediction of a reaction-time/accuracy trade-off. The generality of this effect wasconfirmed with tasks using different motor responses, suchas saccadic eye movements and steering wheel operations.These results are at odds with the model that stronger110 irrelevant signals more severely interfere with a task performance. One possible explanation is that visualsignals that are too weak to be \"noticed\" and suppressedcan directly interfere with a motor response as conflictingmotor signals. 1Boston University, Boston, MA 2Athinoula A.

Sheth *, Shinsuke ShimojoStudies of thinking and reasoning processes have shown that people can maintain multiple, fundamentallyincompatible beliefs, particularly if attention is not drawnto the incompatibility. Recent work suggests the samemay be true for multiple low-level visual percepts:Whitney and Cavanagh (2000) inferred that while a target'sperceived position is shifted by an inducer, there is noaccompanying percept of target motion. A more explicit perceptual paradox can be shown if the motion and position percepts of a target stimulus are each tested andfound to be inconsistent under conditions without aninducer. Observers (n=12) watched a small, circular targetmove diagonally at constant speed (21.2 deg/s) on a screenfor 200 ms, then make an abrupt 90 degree turn andcontinue at the same speed for 200 ms. Observers fixated asmall dot outside the target's path and judged the positionof the turn-point relative to nearby horizontal or verticalhash marks. The two-dimensional position of the turn wassystematically mislocalized to a position outside theobject's motion trajectory. Our control data indicates that known effects like Frohlich, flash-lag, representational momentum, and onset repulsion are unable to explain theshift. Specific probing of the target's trajectory suggeststhat observers maintain no less than three percepts that aremutually inconsistent: The position of the pre-turn path,the position of the post-turn path, and the position of theturn-point itself. Our findings support the idea that lower-level sensory processing can be mutually contradictory,suggesting some module-like structure. *University of Houston, Houston, TX Citation Nieman, D.R., 554a, Whitney, D. and Cavanagh, P.

Moving ventriloquism: Forward drifts and Shimojo, Ryota Attention is known to modulate sensory inputs; however, little is known on how the interactions betweentop-down and bottom-up cues dynamically evolve. Here,we show that auditory-visual changessystematically and non-monotonically from an interactionof sensory and attentional factors during the continuousviewing of a physically invariant stimulus. The stimuluswas a visual target (flash) revolving about fixation. Onevery rotational cycle (60 cycles/trial x 534 ms per cycle =32.04 s), a sound occurred in synchrony with the same angular position of the flash. For each cycle, observers (n=10) had to report on the perceived location of the flashcoincident with the perception of sound (audio-visualsynchrony). The initial estimate of the location of audio-visual synchrony was slightly behind veridical audio-visual synchrony, but then over subsequent cycles,gradually moved forward in the direction of the motion.This steady drift was followed by a sharp reset back to theinitially judged position. This perceptual sequence wasqualitatively common across observers. When wemanipulated attention to specific positions of the cycle on a trial, the location of audio-visual synchrony moved and remained there. The results show a striking parallel to thecontinuous report data suggesting the transitions aremediated by an attractive effect on audiovisual timingexerted by attention. Motion seems to drag spatialattention forward from the location of veridical audio-visual synchrony. As attention drifts far beyond veridical,its effect is overruled by the near-veridical sensorysynchrony signals and the perceived position of audio-visual synchrony snaps back to near veridical. *University of Houston, Houston, TX Citation Shimojo, S., Kanai, and Sheth, B.

On the possible relationship Simone Wehling *, Joydeep Bhattacharya*, Shinsuke Shimojo Making preferential choices is a fundamental aspect of human life. Research efforts, so far, are heavily concentrated on explaining the choice by exogenous features of the stimuli, whereas little is known about thepossible role of endogenous components such asorientation responses. This latter issue is extremelyrelevant when the features of the possible choices are veryclose.111 In this study, we monitored the gaze of ten observers in five two-alternative-forced-choice tasks(2AFC) where they were asked to choose a face which wasmore (i) attractive (ATTR), (ii) sympathetic (LIKE), (iii)unfriendly (DISL), and (iv) round (ROUN). An additionalATTR task was made with abstract pictures (ABST). The stimuli (faces or abstract) were matched according to an independent rating. Different gaze features, such as dwelltimes, number of fixations, likelihood of first fixation onthe choice or the left stimulus, were analysed. General properties of 2AFC: Two significant features are common to all tasks: (1) a shorter first dwelltime (Friedman, p<0.001) and (ii). An overall longerdwell time on the chosen stimulus (paired t test, p<0.0001)Task differences: We found for ABST trials three features(shorter first, second last and total dwell times) thatallowed their classification with a 56% accuracy, (by achance level of 20%). Among the face tasks, only the first dwell times showed significant differences (Friedman, p<0.003), in which ROUN exhibits the shortest dwell andseparates from ATTR, LIKE and DISL. These results indicate an overall association, albeit weak, between orientation and choice. The next stepis to investigate the directional information of thisassociation, i.e., orientation influences choice or viceversa; although this study does not conclusively supportthe former, the next step must be the extension to imagingtechniques. *Austrian Academy of Science, Vienna, Austria explain the flash-lag effect, in which subjects perceive a flashed itemthat is co-localized with a moving item as trailing behindthe moving item, have been found within the retina oflower species, and in the motor pathways of humans.Here, we demonstrate flash-lag employing \"second-order\"moving and flashed stimuli, defined solely by theirbinocular-disparity, to circumvent any possible \"early\" contributions to the effect. A significant flash-lag effect was measured with cyclopean stimuli composed entirely ofcorrelated random dot patterns. When the disparity-defined moving stimulus was replaced with a luminance-defined one, potentially engaging retinal mechanisms, themagnitude of the measured effect showed no significantchange. Thus, in primates, though retinal mechanismsmay contribute, flash-lag must be explained throughcortical processes. *University of Falmer, United Kingdom Reference Nieman, D., Nijhawan, R., Khurana, B. and Shimojo, S.

For example, it is thought that to learn movements, we use visual and proprioceptive feedback to generate appropriate neuro-motor commands. Ininstrumental conditioning, an animal or human learns toperform specific responses in order to obtain reward.Instrumental conditioning is often used by behavioralpsychologists in order to train an animal (or human) toproduce a desired behavior. Shaping involves reinforcingthose behaviors that in a step-wise fashion are successivelycloser to the desired behavior, until the desired behavior isreached. Here, we aim to extend this traditionalinstrumental shaping approach in order to directly shapeneural activity instead of overt behavior. To achieve this we scanned eight human subjects with real-time fMRI while they underwent an instrumental shaping procedurefor imagined (and not actual) finger movement. Using realand imagined finger tapping as a functional localizer, wedefined a region of interest (ROI) in motor/somatosensoryareas for this group of subjects. We then rewardedsubjects for producing activity in this ROI above a giventhreshold (by signaling receipt of one dollar per rewardedtrial), only if this activity was produced followingpresentation of a specific discriminative stimulus. Overthe course of four, 8-minute runs, we gradually increased this threshold according to an adaptive shaping procedure. Using this approach, we found a significant increase inactivity in this ROI across training sessions duringpresentation of the stimulus signaling reward as opposed toa stimulus signaling no reward. Subject finger movementwas monitored during this time, and we found no evidenceof actual movement. This demonstrates that instrumentalconditioning can be used to directly shape neural activity,even without the production of an overt behavioralresponse. This instrumental shaping technique can bedistinguished from previous fMRI studies using real-timefeedback in that here subjects are not provided with an explicit on-line representation of their neural activity, but rather are directly rewarded for successfully producing thedesired neural responses. This approach may be relevantin the future development of therapies for stroke and otherbrain disorders. *Division of Humanities and Social Science, Caltech Publications Changizi, M.A., Zhang, Q. and Shimojo, S.

Previousresearch has shown that the hippocampus is critical for theformation of long-term memories, and that this hippocampal involvement is time-limited. The current predominant conjecture is that memories are graduallyestablished across distributed neocortical networks throughthe interactions between cortical and hippocampal circuits. However, the direct experimental investigation of these interactions has been difficult since, until recently,simultaneous chronic recordings from large numbers ofwell-isolated single neurons were not technically feasible.These experiments became possible with the advent of thetechnique of chronic multi-area tetrode recordings in freelybehaving rodents. Using this technique we monitor the simultaneous activity of large numbers of cortical and hippocampal cells during the acquisition and performanceof memory tasks, as well as during the sleep periodspreceding and following experience. Our research efforts focus on analyzing the structure of cortico-hippocampal interactions in thedifferent brain states and on characterizing how thisstructure is modulated by behavior, how it evolvesthroughout the learning process, and what it reflects aboutthe intrinsic organization of memory processing at thelevel of networks of neurons. Our experimental work iscomplemented by theoretical studies of network models and the development of tools for the analysis of multi- neuronal data. 174. Dynamics of phase locking networksEvgueniy Lubenov, Thanos SiapasDuring awake behavior hippocampal by the presence of pronounced 4-10 Hz LFPoscillations known as theta oscillations [1]. Wedemonstrated that (about 40%) ofthe cells in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat fire preferentially during particular phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm [2]. Furthermore, we showed that prefrontalneurons phase lock best to theta oscillations delayed byapproximately 50 ms and confirmed this hippocampo-prefrontal directionality and timing at the level ofcorrelations between single cells. Finally, phase locking ofprefrontal cells is predicted by the presence of significantcorrelations with hippocampal cells at positive delays up to 150 ms. This indicates that direct hippocampal input islikely to have a considerable contribution to the observedprefrontal phase locking. We are currently characterizinghow these phase-locking properties evolve over time andhow they are synchrony in recurrent networksEvgueniy Lubenov, Thanos SiapasSynchronization is a key property of many biological, physical, and engineering systems. The level of synchronization in distributed systems is often controlled by the strength of the interactions between individualelements. In brain circuits the connection strengthsbetween neurons are constantly modified under theinfluence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules(STDP). However, the consequences of these local rulesfor the global dynamics of brain networks are not fullyunderstood. We have shown that when recurrent networksexhibit population bursts STDP rules exert a strongdecoupling force that desynchronizes activity. Thisdecoupling force may be engaged through highly synchronous population events, known as sharp-wave bursts, which occur throughout the hippocampal formationduring slow-wave sleep. We are currently analyzing theimplications of these results for the transfer of informationin cortico-hippocampal networks during Thanos SiapasEyeblink conditioning is a form of associative learning that has been shown to engage the hippocampus across a wide range of species and parameters [1]. Moreover, in its trace form, where the conditioned andunconditioned stimuli do not overlap in time, eyeblinkconditioning has been shown to require an intacthippocampus for successful acquisition [2]. Thishippocampal dependence falls off with time, implying thatthe long-term locus of the CS-US association is extra-hippocampal. Furthermore, lesions to the medialprefrontal cortex in rats have been shown to disrupt thelong-term recall of the eyeblink response, but not itsacquisition [3]. Using simultaneous chronic recordings from the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, we are characterizing the relationships between the activitypatterns in these brain areas during the acquisition of theCS-US association, with the eventual goal ofunderstanding how this association is represented acrossthe prefrontal-hippocampal networks.114 References [1] Christian, K.M. and Thompson, Learning & Memory 10:427-455.

Our current efforts focus oncharacterizing and comparing the spatial firing propertiesof DG, CA3, and CA1 cells, and quantifying how theseproperties function Knierim, J.J. and learning and VTA-hippocampal interactionsThanos SiapasMany lines of evidence suggest that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) interacts with the hippocampus tomodulate the entry of information into long-term memory[1]. The VTA-hippocampal loop has been hypothesized tobe important for the detection of novelty and signaling ofthe behavioral relevance of stimuli in the environment.However, the organization of VTA-hippocampalinteractions remains unknown, as simultaneous recordings from these areas have not been reported in the literature. Leveraging our experience with chronic multi-area tetroderecordings, we are examining the simultaneous response ofmultiple dopaminergic cells in the VTA and pyramidalcells in hippocampus during exposure to novel stimuli aswell as during the acquisition of instrumental conditioningparadigms.

Gimbel FoundationJapanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)The McKnight FoundationNational Institutes of HealthNational Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Summary: Our group studies the molecular mechanisms of axon guidance and synaptogenesis. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is our primary experimental system. In the embryo, we examine signaling systemsinvolved in motor and CNS axon guidance. In the larva,we study synaptogenesis and synaptic andcell biology. Motor axon guidance. The Drosophila motor axon network has provided one of the best systems in which to study growth cone pathfinding mechanisms. The network is simple: 32 motoneurons innervate 30 body wall musclefibers in each abdominal segment. Each motoneuron axonis targeted to a specific muscle fiber, and very fewprojection errors are made during normal development.Thus, the motor axon network is a genetically hard-wiredmap, and is an ideal system in which to study how genescontrol the formation of specific synaptic connections. Inmuch of our work, we have focused on the roles oftyrosine phosphorylation in regulating motor axonguidance decisions. We are now also conducting screensto determine the mechanisms by which cell surface proteins label specific muscle fibers for recognition by motor axon growth cones. Neural receptor tyrosine phosphatases. In the 1990's, we showed that receptor-linked protein tyrosinephosphatases (RPTPs) are selectively expressed on CNSaxons and growth cones in the Drosophila embryo, and that these RPTPs regulate motor and CNS axon guidanceduring embryonic development. RPTPs directly couplecell to control of tyrosine phosphorylation via their cytoplasmic enzymatic domains. The extracellular regions of the fly RPTPs all contain immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and/orfibronectin type III (FN3) domains, which are usuallyinvolved in recognition of cell-surface or extracellularmatrix ligands. Their cytoplasmic regions contain eitherone (LAR, DPTP10D, DPTP69D,DPTP99A, DPTP52F, DPTP4E), and we have generated or obtained mutations in all six of the genes encoding theseproteins (Jeon abstract). We have now performed a detailed characterization of the genetic interactions among all sixRPTPs. We find that each growth cone guidance decision in the neuromuscular system has a requirement for a unique subset of RPTPs; thus, in a sense, there is an\"RPTP code\" for each decision. In some cases, the RPTPswork together, so that defects are only observed when twoor more are removed. In other cases, however, phenotypesproduced by removal of one RPTP are suppressed when asecond RPTP is also absent. Our results provide evidencefor three types of relationships among the RPTPs: partialredundancy; collaboration; and competition. Our majorefforts in this area are now directed toward understandingthese relationships at the biochemical level, throughdefinition of upstream (ligands) and downstream (substrates) components of RPTP signaling pathways (see below). Searching for RPTP substrates. It is difficult to identify PTP substrates biochemically because PTPs usually do notdisplay strong specificity in vitro . To find substrates, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens versions of bindnormally but cannot a constitutively activated chicken Src tyrosine kinase into yeast together with the PTP trap constructs andthe cDNA library, in the hope that it would phosphorylaterelevant substrate fusion proteins made from cDNA libraryplasmids. We identified several classes of clones whoseinteractions with substrate-trap RPTPs are dependenton be substrates. These include a cell-surfacereceptor and some intracellular signaling proteins. We arecurrently examining whether these proteins interact withthe RPTPs in vivo and if they are required for RPTP signaling (Bugga abstract). Identification of RPTP ligands. The ligands recognized by RPTPs in vivo have not been identified in any system. In order to understand how RPTPs regulate axon guidance,it is essential to know when and where they engageligands, and how ligand binding affects enzymatic activityand/or localization. Our current approach to identifying ligands is based on our observation that fusion proteins in which theextracellular domains of RPTPs are joined to humanplacental alkaline phosphatase (AP) can be used to stain liveDrosophila embryos. Each of the six fusion proteins (LAR-AP, DPTP69D-AP, DPTP10D-AP, DPTP99A-AP,DPTP4E-AP, DPTP52F-AP) binds in a stains a subset of CNS axons and alsobinds to other cell types in the periphery. To identify thegenes encoding the RPTP ligands, we are screeningdeficiency mutations that remove specific portions of the116 genome. We began by screening the Bloomington 'deficiency (Df) kit' of 266 fly lines. Each Df line to GFP balancers so that Df/Df embryos could beidentified, and we then stained these embryos with each offour fusion proteins (LAR-HS2-AP, 69D-AP, 10D-AP,99A-AP). Since each Df lacks a specific region of the genome, if homozygous Df embryos don't stain with a fusion protein, this indicates that this genomic regioncontains a gene required for ligand expression.Overlapping Dfs and point mutants can then be screened inorder to identify the relevant gene within the Df (also seeWright abstract). Using this screen, we have already found a Df that contains a gene encoding a ligand that binds to LAR-AP, and have identified this ligand as Syndecan (Sdc).This work was recently a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Our results show that LAR binds to the glycosaminoglycan side chains ofSdc with nanomolar affinity, and that Sdc is required forDLAR-mediated axon guidance. We can generate motoraxon guidance errors by overexpressing LAR on neurons,and find that the same errors are generated by ectopicallyexpressing Sdc on muscles. This Sdc gain-of-function(GOF) phenotype is suppressed by loss-of-function (LOF)mutations in the Lar gene, indicating that LAR is epistatic to (downstream of) Sdc. This result shows that muscle Sdccan function as a ligand for LAR on neuronal growth cones, and suggests that binding to Sdc increases LAR's signaling activity. We have continued the Df screen, and have identified four regions required for 99A-AP staining, andthree regions required for HS2-AP staining. We are nowscreening overlapping Dfs and point mutations to try tofind the responsible genes. Reference *Fox, A.N. and Zinn, K. (2005) Curr. Biol. 15:1701-1711. Targeting of motor axons to specific muscle fibers. Despite the advances in characterizing molecules that regulate motor axon pathfinding, we still understand littleabout how specific muscle fibers are recognized as targetsfor synapse formation by these axons. Many mutationsaffect pathfinding decisions, leading to aberrant wiring ofthe neuromuscular system, but no single LOF mutationsare known that block recognition of specific muscletargets. These results are most easily explained byinvoking genetic redundancy in target labeling. If eachmuscle fiber were defined by a combination of severalcell-surface labels, removing one of the labels might not have a major effect on targeting of axons to that fiber. This would explain why targeting molecules have not beenidentified in conventional loss-of-function (LOF) geneticscreens. Studies of gain-of-function (GOF) phenotypes by other groups are consistent with the redundancyhypothesis. For example, the homophilic cell adhesionmolecule Fasciclin III (Fas III) is expressed on only two muscle fibers, 6 and 7, and on the growth cone of the RP3neuron that innervates these two fibers. Fas III appears tobe a functional target label, because when it is ectopicallyexpressed on other muscle fibers near 6 and 7, the RP3neuron makes abnormal synapses on these Fas III- expressing fibers. However, when Fas III is removed by a LOF mutation, there is no effect on targeting of RP3 to 6and 7. These results imply that Fas III can be used formuscle targeting, but that targeting of 6 and 7 can stillproceed in its absence, presumably because these fibers arealso labeled by other surface molecules that can bedetected by the RP3 growth cone when Fas III is notpresent. These findings suggest that cell-surface proteins that label specific targets in the motor axonsystem might be identifiable by a GOF genetic screen inwhich candidate labels are ectopically expressed on all muscle fibers. If these proteins are functional labels, their misexpression might produce alterations in targetrecognition, as observed in the Fas III experimentsdescribed above. By identifying all the genes encoded intheDrosophila genome that can confer GOF phenotypes in which targeting of specific muscle fibers is altered, we willacquire the tools to understand the mechanisms involved intarget recognition in this system. This type of screenshould allow us to overcome the redundancy problem. Forexample, suppose one could identify three different cell-surface proteins that are normally expressed on a specific muscle fiber, but whose misexpression on other muscle fibers produces targeting errors. One might then predictthat removing all three of these proteins by making a tripleLOF mutant (through conventional or RNAi techniques)would now prevent targeting of this muscle fiber. Throughthese kinds of experiments, we could begin to understandthe combinatorial code for muscle targeting. Insights intothe motor axon targeting code would be likely to facilitatean understanding of targeting in other neuronal systems(e.g., the antennal lobe, optic lobe, and mushroom body),since candidate target labels are usually expressed by avariety of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. To conduct this GOF screen, we first created a database of all cell-surface and secreted (CSS) proteins inDrosophila that are likely to be involved in specific cell- cell interactions. The database was generated by definingall fly genes encoding proteins that contain domainsknown to be present in CSS proteins in other eukaryotes.It currently contains 1005 genes. To drive expression of these genes in muscles, we used the 'EP' system, in which a P element containing ablock of UAS sequences that are responsive to the yeasttranscription factor GAL4 is jumped around the genome. Like other P elements, EPs usually land upstream of genes. If a line bearing an EP upstream of a gene is crossed to a'driver' line expressing GAL4 in all muscle fibers, the genewill now be expressed at high levels in muscles in the resulting progeny embryos and larvae. To find EP-likeelements upstream of the CSS genes, we searched throughabout 40,000 different insertions, including the original EP117 set generated by Pernille Rorth1, the EY insertions lines generated in the Bellen lab2, the GS lines developed in Japan, and the GE lines developed by GenExel, Inc. We were able to identify insertions that can confer expressionof about 400 of the 1005 CSS genes in our database,representing members of all CSS protein families. To screen for genes encoding potential targeting molecules, we are crossing each of these insertions to amuscle GAL4 driver and visualizing motor axons synapses the resulting F1progeny larvae by immunostaining. We have alreadyidentified a quite a genes that cause specificmistargeting or synaptic morphology phenotypes whenthey are expressed on muscles (Cording abstract). 1EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany 2Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Genes controlling synaptogenesis in the larval neuromuscular system. Motor growth cones reach their muscle targets during late embryogenesis and then mature into presynaptic terminals that are functional by the time ofhatching. The pattern of Type I neuromuscular junction(NMJ) synapses in the larva is simple and highlystereotyped, with boutons restricted to specific locationson each muscle fiber. These synapses continue to expandand change as the larva grows, because their strengthsmust be matched to the sizes of the muscle fibers theydrive. This growth represents a form of synaptic plasticity,because it is controlled by feedback from the muscle to the neuron. Studies of NMJ synapses in flies are relevant to an understanding of synaptic plasticity in the mammalianbrain, because the fly NMJ glutamatergic synapse,organized that uses homologous to vertebrate AMPA receptors. Control of synaptic local translation. Our recent work on synapses has focused on control of synaptic protein translation. Local translation at synapses has been studiedinAplysia , mammalian, and arthropod systems. It has attracted interest because it is a mechanism that allowsneurons to separately adjust the strengths of individual synapses. To identify genes involved in synaptogenesis in larvae, including those that regulate local translation, we devised and executed a GOF screen of live third instarlarvae (Kraut et al ., 2001; PDF available on website). In the screen, we identified pumilio (pum), which encodes an RNA-binding protein that shuts down ofspecific mRNAs by binding their controlsposterior patterning during embryonic development. In arecent Neuron paper (PDF available on website), we showed that Pum is an important mediator of synapticgrowth and plasticity at the NMJ. Pum is localized to thepostsynaptic side of the NMJ in third instar expressed in and bouton expression of the essentialtranslation factor eIF-4E (the cap-binding protein) at theNMJ, and Pum binds selectively to the 3'UTR of eIF 4EmRNA. These data suggest that Pum is a direct regulatorof local eIF-4E translation, and that eIF-4E (which isnormally limiting for translation) in turn switches on translation of other synaptic mRNAs. These mRNAs probably include that encoding the GluRIIa glutamatereceptor, which is also upregulated in pum mutants. These with genetic epistasis studies, suggest thatpostsynaptic Pum modulates synaptic function via direct control of local synaptic translation. We are now examining a number of other RNA-binding proteins that may regulate postsynaptictranslation at the NMJ (Menon abstract). These includeFMRP Orb(CPEB ortholog), Nanos (Pum's partner during earlydevelopment), and Cup (a protein that regulates eIF-4E activity). We are also studying whether controlled aggregation of Pum regulates its ability to represstranslation. This is being studied both in vivo and in vitro (Silverman abstract). 180. Identifying cell-surface proteins involved in targeting of motor axons to specific muscle fibersAmy Cording, Mitsuhiko Kurusu *, Kai Zinn We used computer analysis of sequence databases to define a set of ~1000 genes in Drosophila that encodecell-surface or secreted (CSS) proteins that could beinvolved in cell recognition events. We obtained 'EP'-likeP element insertion lines, in which a UAS element islocated upstream of the gene and can be used to drive itsexpression, for >400 of these genes. Each of these wascrossed to a pan-muscle GAL4 driver, 24B, andneuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and motor axonsexamined in the resulting larvae, which are expected to express the relevant CSS protein at high levels in all muscles. We found many genes for which pan-muscle(postsynaptic) expression produces dramatic alterations ofthe presynaptic terminal. These may reveal new pathwaysfor feedback from postsynaptic to presynaptic cells. Ourmajor focus in the past year, however, has been on asmaller group of genes for which pan-muscle expressioncauses mistargeting of axons that normally innervate muscle 12. We observed that targeting of ISNb axons, including RP5 and V, to muscle 12 was most affected bymisexpression, and so focused on this decision. In recentwork, we crossed the candidate mistargeting lines to othermuscle and neuronal drivers to verify the phenotypes anddetermine the timing of expression required to generatethem. We then performed in situ hybridization experiments to prove that the candidate gene was in fact,driven by GAL4, and to examine the endogenous expression pattern of the gene. We have completed this analysis for >10 genes already. We will continue theseexperiments until we have obtained a complete dataset foreach of the mistargeting genes. At the same time, we aregenerating or ordering loss-of-function mutations for the118 genes of most interest, and examining whether these cause motor axon phenotypes. *National Institute of Genetics, Japan 181. their target substrates, weare using yeast two-hybrid system. To attempt to achievestable binding of the RPTPs to a tyrosine phosphorylatedsubstrate, we have used 'substrate-trap' mutants of theRPTPs, which can bind to substrates but do not catalyzedephosphorylation, instead remaining bound to substrate ina stable complex. We constructed plasmids encodingGAL4 DBD/RPTP bait proteins and introduced them intoyeast together with fly cDNA libraries encoding GAL4AD- cDNA fusion proteins. We also introduced a plasmid containing a constitutively active form of chicken c-Src,driven by a constitutive yeast promoter. Positiveinteractions are detected by selecting on plates lacking theauxotrophic marker and screening for reporter expressionand src dependence. Our yeast two-hybrid screen with Drosophila neuronal and 52F resulted in four potentialsubstrates based on Src dependence. Of the four genes, twoare known genes - Tartan (a cell adhesion moleculeexpressed in embryonic CNS and PNS), is involved in spermatogenesis, oogenesis and embryogenesis). Of the two unknown genes,one is rich in proline residues and also has proline motifs,which are known to bind to SH3 domains. RNA in situs with this gene showed expression in the embryonic CNS. We are currently testing these interactions in vitro by transient transfection experiments with Drosophila S2 cell lines and finding out the expression of rest of theunknown genes by RNA in situs , and looking for double mutant phenotypes with DPTP and tartan mutant flies. Ourpreliminary experiments with tartan mutant flies showed same neuronal defects as 52F. Our biochemical experiments with full-length tartan showed association and this associationdecreased/disappeared with the wild-type 52F, suggestingthat tartan is a substrate for 52f. We are trying to map thearea of the tartan gene that specifically interacts with 52Fby mutating either single or combination of tyrosineresidues. 182. Translational control mechanisms at the larval junctions required both pre- and post-synaptically in the nervoussystem. In neurons, it is required for synaptic growth. Postsynaptically, it represses accumulation of the cap- binding protein, Eukaryotic Initiation Factor eIF4E at theNMJ. eIF4E accumulation has been shown to control bothmorphological and functional properties of the larval NMJ.Pumilio binds specifically to the 3' untranslated region ofeIF4E mRNA and thereby presumably controlling eIF4E accumulation and indirectly controlling translation ofglutamate receptor, GluRIIA mRNA at the NMJ. Pumilio interacts with Nanos and Brat proteins to repress translation of target hunchback mRNA in early embryogenesis in Drosophila . We are therefore, exploring the role of Nanos in synaptogenesis. We have found thatNanos shows similar expression pattern as Pumilio, both atthe NMJ and in the andmorphologically properties. We are currently examining nanos rescue lines to see if this phenotype is restored to normal. Since none of the existing mutants are completenulls, we are also making RNAi lines for nanos . We will be expressing the RNAi lines separately in the somaticmuscles and in the neurons to dissect the role of Nanos inthese two tissues. Recently, several reports have shown that Cup, a germline protein, interacts with eIF4E protein andrepresses its function in the developing embryo. We have found that Cup protein shows similar localization patterns as Pumilio and Nanos at the larval and We are currently determining how Pumilio, Nanosand Cup interact with each other to regulate synapticfunction at the NMJ. 183. The in vitro aggregation of an NQ-rich region ofpumilio Ed SilvermanWe are interested in whether the NQ (asparagine/glutamine)-rich region of pumilio has the capability to aggregate and, if so, whether this aggregationcan alter the function of pumilio . Our lab has shown that a Q/N-rich region of pumilio can aggregate in yeast and studies are currently under way investigating potential in vivo effects in flies (see Salazar abstract). Another way we are addressing this is by analyzing the NQ-rich region of pumilio in vitro . Using a canonical NQ-rich region of yeast protein Sup35 known to aggregate in a prion-likemanner, NM, as a positive control, and the highly chargedM region of Sup35 as a negative control, we purified thefirst NQ-rich region of pum (NQ1) and NQ1 lackingglutamine-rich stretches (NQ-Q) and allowed theseproteins to spontaneously convert with mild agitation intoan aggregated state. Several assays can be used to determine whether a protein aggregates into a stable, amyloid-like form. First,we looked at solubility in 2% SDS. A protein capable of forming amyloid will be insoluble in SDS without boiling. After conversion, NQ1 and NM are insoluble in SDSwithout boiling; whereas, M remains soluble and NQ-Q ismostly soluble. This result indicates that NQ1 is capableof forming amyloid. To confirm this we stained theconverted fibers of NQ1 and NM with Congo Red, andlooked for birefringence, which is used to diagnoseamyloid in disease and in vitro . Both the NQ1 and NM119 proteins formed small macroscopic fibers that bound Congo Red, and exhibited birefringence in cross-polarizedlight. The conversion reactions of NQ1 and NM arerecognized by an antibody that is specific against amyloidoligomers that are precursors to amyloid formation. Weare currently examining the kinetics of amyloid formation more closely, looking at seeding and temperature effects, and plan to test a yeast strain carrying a chimeric genewhere NQ1 replaces the NM region of Sup35 for theability of the in vitro fibers to be infectious. We also plan to examine the fibers under EM to see small fragments anddetermine whether they have properties typical of anamyloid. We will also test other regions of pumilio and accessory domains (non NQ) in NQ1 to better understandthe conversion and aggregation events. 184. Tr anslational regulation of PABP at the neuromuscular junction Ed Kaushiki Menon Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) the poly(A) tail most eukaryotic mRNAs.Cytoplasmic PABP is important for translational initiation,binding to the poly(A) tail and interacting with eIF4G toform a loop linking the 5' and 3' ends of the mRNA. Thisinhibits decapping and promotes translation. We areinterested in studying the translational regulation of thePABP because there is evidence implicating theimportance of PABP regulation for synaptic plasticity.Alteration of PABP expression leads to an increase in postsynaptic aggregates and changes synaptic morphology. Both PABP and eIF4E can form aggregates in response toactivity that appear as puncta, which can be controlled bytemperature and food consistency. The PABP aggregatesappear to colocalize with eIF4E [Sigrist et al. (2000) Nature 405:1062-1065]. Our lab has shown that eIF4E is directly regulated postsynaptically by Pumilio (Pum)binding to a specific region of the eIF4E 3'UTR; thisregulation affects local translation and synaptic plasticityby controlling expression of the GluRIIa receptor [Menonet al. (2004) Neuron 44:663-676]. Interestingly, it has been shown that eIF4E aggregates only form in response to altered PABP levels in wild-type flies when movement is induced [Sigrist et al. (2003) J. Neurosci . 23(16):6546-6556]; whereas, in mutants, eIF4E aggregates even induction of movement. Thissuggests a potential role for Pum in the regulation ofPABP. PABP levels appear to be upregulated throughoutthe muscle in pum mutants; we are currently in of quantifying PABP puncta in pum mutant larvae. PABP 3'UTR of approximately 1500 nucleotides in larval muscle preparations, so in order todetermine which areas were important, we aligned the 3'UTR sequences with the homologous sequences from six other Drosophila species and identified eight distinct areas of enhanced conservation. We intend to fuse the 3'UTR ofPABP to GFP and create mutants encompassing theseconserved elements in order to elucidate how PABPexpression is regulated. One of the conserved elements(CE), CE1, is a putative target site If removing CE1 deregulates the GFP-pabp3'UTR chimera, we will investigate the role of RISCand other members of the miRNA processing pathway foreffects on PABP. Two other conserved elements have aresemblance to a Pum binding site. If changing any of theother conserved elements deregulates PABP we will examine the role of Pum or other translational regulators for physical interaction with the pabp 3'UTR and genetic interaction with Pabp. We will then attempt to determine the contribution of each identified regulator of PABP tosynaptic plasticity. 185. A def iciency screen for axon guidance defects inDrosophila melanogaster Ashley Wright Only one systematic screen for axon guidance and muscle targeting defects has been carried out in Drosophila embryos*. In that study, heavily mutagenized second chromosomes (40% of the genome) were screenedfor defects by staining with an antibody that labels motorneurons in whole-mount embryos. By their estimate, only50% of the motor projections in the animal can bevisualized by this method. The authors found ten genesand estimate that there may be upwards of 20 genes, whichwhen mutated one at a time can lead to axon guidance ortargeting defects. We are currently carrying out a screen using a subset of the Drosophila deficiency kit which have wild-type or nearly wild-type central nervous system development and we hope to identify more genes or genefamilies which are involved in these processes. In order tovisualize all motor projections in the embryos, we arecarrying out live dissections on each line that opens up thebody wall so that all motor projections are visible. Thesedissected embryos are then stained with the same antibody used by Vanvactor et al. (1993), and scored for defects. Reference *Vanvactor, D., Sink, H., Fambrough, D., Tsoo, R. and Goodman, C.S.

Steele Professorship in Molecular Biology Summary : In the past year, significant advances have been made in several projects that have been pursued in our laboratory in the last few years, as well as in new directions that our research has taken. Thus, an analysisof the main mtDNA control region in fibroblasts ofsubjects older than 65 years has revealed severalmutations either at a site adjacent to the replication originat position 151 (i.e., a C150T or a T152C transition), or ata site close to the replication origin at position 191 (i.e., aT195C transition), or at a site corresponding to the 414promoter for the RNA primer of heavy stand synthesis (inparticular, T414G transversion). Most interestingly,while the C150T transition in Italian centenarians was associated with a change in the mtDNA replication origin at position 151 to position 149, the aging-relatedheteroplasmic T152C transition in Ashkenazi Jews wasnot accompanied by any change in such replication origin. A very significant finding was the occurrence in fibroblasts and immortalized lymphocytes of a novelinteraction between human mtDNA and a TCA cycleenzyme. This enzyme turned out to be the mitochondrialmalate dehydrogenase. Overexpression of this enzyme inHeLa cells resulted in an increase in mtDNA copynumber and in an activation of the mtDNA origins. 186. Investigation of a novel interaction between mtDNA and a TCA cycle enzyme in humanmitochondriaJaehyoung ChoMitochondria have their own genome, and cooperate with the nuclear genome in regulatingrespiration, energy metabolism, and, more surprisingly,aging and longevity (1, 2). Recent papers reported thatmitochondrial metabolic enzymes bind to mtDNA andhave a direct function for mtDNA biogenesis (3, 4). TheD-loop region of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is essential to control replication and transcription, and this control region also undergoes some mutations whichoccur in aging-dependent manner (1, 2). To investigate the molecular basis of the aging- related mtDNA mutagenesis and the selection process involved, we planned to identify possible protein-DNA interactions in this region. During the replicationprocess, an early intermediate mtDNA form is a long, triple-stranded D-loop. The stability of the single-strandedregion of the D-loop may have an important role in theregulation of mtDNA copy number. Thus, interactions in boththe single-stranded DNAs (heavy and light strands) of this region. At first, we focused on the DLP4 region of the D-loop because this segment of mtDNA is the locus ofseveral important point mutations related to human aging,in particular, the C150T, T152C and A189G mutations (2).In addition, this region harbors major replication originsand the CSB1 (conserved sequence block 1). Veryinterestingly, only the light strand of the DLP4 segmentshowed binding activity to several proteins in DNAmobility shift assays. We also tested the specificDNA-protein interactions in small subregions of DLP4 andfound that each subregion has a different profile ofDNA-protein complex. The results showed that the first three subregions have stronger protein binding activity than the remaining regions. We purified the proteins by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) affinity chromatography, and found that theseproteins have molecular weights of 70, 55, 35, 28 and 15kDa. Among them, the 35 kDa protein shows specificbinding to a previously known origin of heavy-strandmtDNA replication (OH2). This OH2 region is the site ofa very interesting aging-dependent mutation (C150T).Interestingly, the 35 kDa protein interacts preferentiallywith the mutant sequence rather than with the wild-type sequence. Since the 5'-end analysis of nascent heavy strands consistently revealed a new replication origin atposition 149, substituting for that at 151, only in C150Tmutation-carrying samples of fibroblasts or immortalizedlymphocytes (2), the 35 kDa protein (p35) may have animportant role for the selection of a remodeled replicationorigin. We characterized the molecular nature of thisprotein by LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatography and tandemmass spectrometry). The results showed that this protein isa critical enzyme of the TCA cycle; i.e., the mitochondrialmalate dehydrogenase. We confirmed that thecommercially available p35 purified from pig heart can also bind specifically to the DLP4-L2 subregion, which includes OH2, in vitro , and that the antibody against this protein can make a super-shifted band in a DNA mobilityshift assay. We also verified the specificity of p35-OH2interaction by DNase I footprinting analysis. The ssDNAinteraction inhibited the enzyme activity of p35 in asequence specific manner. Very interestingly, thisinteraction was inhibited by NADH in a dose-dependentmanner. To investigate the role of this interaction inmtDNA biogenesis, we overexpressed human p35 in HeLacell, and then examined the content and the replication of mtDNA. We confirmed the overexpression of p35 by an immunoblot assay and tested also the contents of othermitochondrial proteins important for mtDNA metabolism.We found that the mtDNA copy number increases inp35-overexpressing HeLa cells, depending on theexpression level of p35. We also tested the usage ofreplication origins during overexpression of p35, and the124 results showed that the replication origins of mtDNA were also turned on in the same manner. In a previousreport, this laboratory showed that human mtDNA makesa specific DNA-protein complex in the D-loop regionforming a novel knob structure (5). Therefore, wepurified the mtDNA-protein complex from highly purified mitochondria to test if this knob structure contains p35 or not. The results showed that the purified knob structurehas very similar binding protein profiles to that observedin a DNA affinity chromatography using DLP4-L2. Thesame size of 35 kDa protein was also found as acomponent of the mtDNA-protein complex, andcharacterized as p35 by immunoblot analysis. Our data strongly support the conclusion that two important factors, i.e., energy metabolism andmtDNA function, regulate the aging process during thelifespan. References 1.

In the past few years, we havereported the occurrence of an aging-dependent largeaccumulation of point mutations in the mtDNA main control region of leukocytes in the majority of individuals above a certain age. To understand the role of these pointmutations in human aging, a fast and accurate genotypingof a large number of samples is essential. The time-consuming steps includingradiolabeling, and are not applicable for large-scaleanalysis. Recently, another efficient method usingquantitative PCR has been developed for large-scale genotyping, but this method is too expensive. Therefore, we planned to develop an efficient way to analyzepolymorphisms of human mtDNA on a large scale. In the differential primer extension technique, a radiolabeled primer targeted to a specific locus isextended by Vent DNA polymerase, and the extensionproducts are differentially terminated by incorporation ofa dideoxynucleotide at the 3' end. The extended primers carrying wild-type or mutated mtDNA sequence havedifferent length, and can be analyzed by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. Usually, the whole procedurerequires a whole week, and the quantification of thepolymorphism is not possible in some cases. We have modified the original procedure by using different fluorescent dye-labeled ddNTP mixtures. In this newmethod, a single base is incorporated at the 3' end of anunlabeled primer by using two different fluorescentdye-labeled ddNTPs (for example, green Cy3-ddCTP and red Cy5-ddTTP). The extended primers are blotted on aZeta-probe nylon membrane using a 96-well dot blottingsystem, and the membrane is washed twice with buffer toremove un-incorporated fluorescent ddNTPs. Thegenotype of the each sample is analyzed by the color-difference detected by the Molecular Imager FX Pro Plussystem (Biorad). This system is very sensitive and can detect 0.2 fmol of Cy3 or Cy5 end-labeled DNA using laser light. The quantification of polymorphisms is quiteefficient and easy. The quantity and ratio of wild-typeand mutant genomes can be calculated from the colordifference using standard mixtures containing variousknown amounts of wild-type and mutant DNA. Thewhole procedure of this new technique just needs a singleday even for a large-scale analysis, and is still economic.We named this new technique as two-color single-baseextension genotyping (2C-SBEG). By using the method described above, we detected and confirmed the occurrence of a C150T heteroplasmy as low as 20% in a human total cell(leukocyte) DNA sample. Usually, a conventionalsequencing procedure cannot detect a heteroplasmicgenotype under 30%. Therefore, our method may providea significant improvement in the analysis of the variousranges of heteroplasmy in human mtDNA. 188. Iwata, Jin Our previous an mtDNA homoplasmic C150T transition adjacent to theheavy- strand replication origin at position 151 is greatly increased in frequency in Italian centenarians, as comparedto the rest of the population, has prompted us to analyze agenetically distinct population. Thus, in collaboration withGil Atzmon*, Suzanne Leanza*, Robert D. Burk*, and NirBarzilai*, analyzed leukocyte mtDNA from threegroups of an Ashkenazi Jew of female probands (95-108 years-old), theirmixed-gender offspring and mixed-gender control subjects. This analysis revealed a very low incidence of the C150T transition and, by contrast, the fairly highfrequency of a homoplasmic T152C transition and of ahomoplasmic T195C transition in all three groups ofsubjects. Furthermore, most significantly, an aging-relatedincrease in incidence of the heteroplasmic T152Ctransition, presumably resulting from somatic events, was125 demonstrated in the Ashkenazi Jews. In these, the T152C transition was not associated with a change in thereplication origin at position 151, unlike the C150Ttransition in the Italian centenarians.*Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 189. Association between the aging-dependent T414G mutation in human mtDNA shows an aging-related accumulationoccurring in subjects above 65 years old (1). The positionof this mutation is at a critical control site for mtDNAreplication, in particular, within the promoter for the RNAprimer of H-strand replication. Therefore, last year, westarted to investigate the role that the mutation could play, and the reason for its increase in incidence in old individuals. Our studies were focused especially on apossible association of the mutation with a particularphenotype. In particular, we studied some biochemicalaspects of transformant cells in which the nuclear background is that of mtDNA-less 143B \u0001 o cells, while the mtDNA background is that of mutation-carrying fibroblasts. As previously described, we analyzed transformant cell lines carrying mitochondria that containmtDNA either 100% mutant or 100% wild type at the 414position. In our previous experiments we had observedthat one of the non-mutant cell lines had a higherdoubling time as compared to a mutant one.Subsequently, the measurement of rate of respiration,either endogenous or substrate-driven respiration, showed higher values in mutant cells than in control cells. These findings seemed to indicate, that, as a result of themutation, there was a significant improvement in thefunction of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Inorder to confirm these results, we analyzed other pairs oftransformant cells derived from different fibroblastdonors. Our preliminary experiments have corroboratedour hypothesis about a possible energetic improvementassociated with the mutation. We are also sequencing theentire mitochondrial genome in these transformant celllines in order to investigate the possible presence ofmultiple mutations co-segregating with the T414G, which could influence the phenotype. Further investigations will concentrate on the analysis of other pairs of transformantcells in order to validate the association of a definedphenotype with the T414G mutation.

Effects of C150T mutation of mtDNA D-loop in human cellsAi Chen, Anne ChomynMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is highly polymorphic, and its variations in humans may contributeto individual differences in function. Recently, our laboratory has found a strikingly higher frequency of a C150T mutation in mtDNA from centenarians and twins,and has also demonstrated that the mutation causes aremodeling of the mtDNA 151 replication origin in humanleukocytes and fibroblasts (Zhang et al., 2003). To further understand the mechanism of the C150T mutation locatedin the mtDNA D-loop region, we have investigatedtransformants obtained by transferring human fibroblastmtDNA carrying the C150T mutation into human mtDNA-less cells ( \u0001 0 cells) derived from an osteosarcoma cell line. Some of the transformants used in our studies were constructed earlier (N. Raule, Biology AnnualReports, 2004, No. 181). In particular, we chose foranalysis six non-mutant transmitochondrial clones derivedfrom one clones fromanother fibroblast strain. A biochemical characterization of these non- mutant or mutant transformants was carried out bymeasuring in intact cells their doubling times and theirrates of total O 2 consumption, coupled or dinotrophenol (DNP)-uncoupled, or of ascorbate/N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD)-driven respiration.TMPD- driven respiration reflects the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Compared to the average levels measured in the non-mutant transformants analyzed,a reduction in doubling times, and an increase in total O 2 consumption rate, in the ratio of DNP-uncoupled to coupled endogenous respiration rates, and in the TMPD- driven respiration rate were observed in the C150Tmutation-carrying transformants. We also checked themembrane potential of the cells and found that it tended toparallel the endogenous respiration rate. In addition, whenwe checked the reactive oxygen species (ROS) productionrate by usingof CM-H 2DCFDA as a fluorescence probe, a significantly decreased ROS production was observed in the C150Tmutant transformants. We also measured the manganesesuperoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein level in C150Tmutant and wild-type cells, and observed that the mutant cells had higher levels of this antioxidant protein than did wild-type cells. Furthermore, we checked themitochondrial protein synthesis rate in C150T mutant andwild-type cells by labeling the cell lines for 45 min with[ 35S]methionine in methionine-free culture medium in the presence of emetine. The results showed that C150Tmutant cells have a higher mitochondrial protein synthesisrate than wild-type cells. These results prompted us tocheck the protein level of COX by Western blots. Theresults showed that C150T mutant cells have higher levelsof COX subunits I and II, which are encoded by mtDNA, whereas COX subunit IV, which is encoded by nuclear DNA, does not differ significantly in level between the126 mutant and the wild-type cell lines. By contrast, the mRNA level of COX subunit I did not exhibit importantdifferences between the two types of cell lines. It is known that the frequency of certain mtDNA mutations may be dependent on the mtDNA haplogroup.Therefore, we checked the haplogroup of the C150T mutation-carrying mt DNA and of the mtDNA of the wild-type cells used for the aforementioned experiments. We found that the C150T mutant cells that we analyzedexhibited the U haplogroup and the non-mutant cellsexhibited the J haplogroup. As the haplogroups weredifferent, we searched through our stocks of fibroblaststrains for a non-mutant strain of the U haplogroup and aC150T mutation-carrying strain of the J haplogroup. We have found these, and have made \u0001 0transformants from them. The biochemical analyses of these new cybrids are underway.

Identification of a novel mitochondrial complex containing mitofusin 2 and stomatin-like protein 2Petr H\u00e1jek, Anne ChomynA reverse genetics approach was utilized to discover new proteins that interact with the mitochondrialfusion mediator mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), and may participatein mitochondrial fusion. In particular, in vivo formaldehyde (FA) crosslinking of whole HeLa cells andimmunoprecipitation with purified Mfn2 antibodies of SDS cell lysates led to the detection of a ~42 kD protein. This protein was identified by liquid chromatography andtandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as stomatin-likeprotein 2 (Stoml2), previously described as a peripheralplasma membrane protein of unknown function associatedwith the cytoskeleton of erythrocytes (1). Immunoblotanalysis with anti-Stoml2 antibodies showed that Stoml2could be immunoprecipitated with Mfn2antibody either from digitonin. cell fractionation experimentsfully supported the conclusion that Stoml2 is indeed a mitochondrial protein. Furthermore, demonstration of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent import ofStoml2 accompanied by proteolytic processing, togetherwith the results of sublocalization experiments, suggestedthat Stoml2 is associated with the inner mitochondrialmembrane and faces the intermembrane space. Notably,FA crosslinking revealed a \"ladder\" of high the presence ofStoml2- Mfn2 hetero-oligomers. Knockdown of Stoml2 by the siRNA approach showed a reduction of themitochondrial membrane potential, without, however, any obvious changes in mitochondrial morphology.Reference (1) Wang, Y. and Morrow, J.S.

One is to understand how the powerful transcription factor, NF- \u0002B, is controlled. The other is to develop a method of reprogramming immune function to allow the immunesystem to deal with diseases that normally elude it. The work on NF- \u0002B extends studies that date back 20 years ago when we discovered this transcription factor. In the ensuing time, NF- \u0002B has emerged as a multi- potent factor able to activate many genes in many physiological settings but the primary function is in orchestrating inflammatory responses. Today, our main concern is with how such a plieotropic protein couldexhibit the exquisite specificity of response that ischaracteristic of NF- \u0002B and how the body resolves NF- \u0002B activation episodes. The latter point is critical because NF-\u0002B activation leads to such a broad change in cellular behavior, even the generation of cancer, which it has to be under tight feedback control. The work on feedback control involves the study of many proteins but most recently has led us to examinethe possible role of microRNAs. In fact, we have found anumber of microRNAs that are induced by inflammatorymediators and depend on NF- \u0002B for their synthesis. We are continuing this line of investigation, studying the mode of activation of one microRNA, miR-146, and theinduction of others. Our attempts to understand specificity have led us to investigate the pathways of NF- \u0002B activation. Most recently, we have taken that to the single cell level. This is technically very demanding but we now have the systemunder control and are starting to get data. Another approach to specificity is to examine the various dimers that constitute the NF- \u0002B system. We have developed mutant NF- \u0002B subunits that form only certain complexes and are investigating their properties. NF-\u0002B plays a critical role in non-inflammatory processes in the brain. There, NF- \u0002B is activated byglutamate. We are actively studying the biochemistry of this process. Our work on reprogramming immune functions we call Engineering Immunity. This is a wide-rangingprogram involving studies of T cell function in cancer and B cell function in HIV infection. Our goals here are clinical but the problems we are investigating aremolecular and cellular. We are collaborating with otherson the clinical aspects. We have made significant progressin this area but it is still an early-stage program. 192. Dynamics of LPS and taxol-stimulated activation of NF- \u0002B Markus Covert, David Baltimore Last year, we found that the activation dynamics of the transcription factor NF- \u0002B exhibit damped oscillatory behavior when cells are stimulated by tumor necrosis factor \u0001 (TNF\u0001) but stable behavior when stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS binding to Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR-4) causes activation of NF- \u0002B that requires two downstream pathways, each of which when isolated exhibits damped oscillatory behavior.Computational modeling of the two TLR-4-dependentsignaling pathways suggests that one pathway requires atime-delay to establish early anti-phase activation of NF-\u0002B by the two pathways. The MyD88-independent pathway required IRF-3-dependent expression of TNF \u0001 to activate NF- \u0002B, and the time required for TNF \u0001 synthesis established the delay. This work was published by Science last September. There are some interesting questions raised from the work described above, which require single-cellanalysis to answer. For example, we indicated thatautocrine signaling plays a significant role in TLR- 4-dependent NF- \u0002B activation. However, we have since found it difficult to detect a significant concentration of the autocrine signal. This raises the question, is thesignal propagating outside of the cell? To answer this and other questions, we are looking at NF- \u0002B-related autocrine signaling at the single-cell level. We have cloned a p65-dsRed construct under the control of the endogenous p65 promoter into a lentiviral vector developed in theBaltimore lab, and have used time-lapse confocal microscopy to observe NF- \u0002B shuttling in and out of the nucleus under TNF \u0001 stimulation conditions. We will use this system to study NF- \u0002B localization under a variety of stimulation conditions and in a variety of knockout cells. We can use this system to observe propagation of theautocrine signal between cells. We will see if the signalradiates out evenly from the initiator cell, if it is polarized,or only strong enough to re-stimulate the same cell thatsecreted it. We can also grow the cells more sparsely todetermine how close the neighboring cells need to be toreceive the signal. From a computational side, we canobtain parameters that describe the propagation of the signal, in terms of diffusion, and indirectly of IRF-3 activation and TNF \u0001 synthesis.128 Publications Covert, M.W., Leung, T.H., Gaston, Baltimore, D.

Dissecting the glutamate activation pathway for NF-\u0001 B Chee Kwee Ea, David Baltimore Nuclear factor \u0001B (NF-\u0001B) transcription factor is activated within the CNS in several forms of neuronal disease. Recent studies using a number of model systems clearly indicate an additional role of NF- \u0001B in the normal physiological settings. NF-\u0001 B is present at synapses and is activated by glutamate. Genetic study has revealed a rolefor NF-\u0001B in spatial learning. However, the molecular mechanism of glutamate-induced NF- \u0001B activation is still unclear. This project will characterize the signalingpathway leading to NF- \u0001B activation in response to glutamate by combining cell biology, biochemistry and microarray gene profiling. Specific aims are: 1) To determine the role of IKK in NF- \u0001B activation by glutamate; 2) To identify the factor (GRAI) required forNF-\u0001B activation by glutamate; and, 3) To determine genes that are regulated by NF-\u0001 B in response to glutamate. Understanding how glutamate leads toactivation of NF-\u0001 B will provide fundamental insights into the regulation of NF- \u0001B in the CNS under physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, identification ofNF-\u0001B regulated genes in response to glutamate will shed light on spatial learning and memory. 194. Analysis of regulation and function of microRNA miR-146 Konstantin D. Taganov, Mark P. Boldin, andDavid BaltimoreInflammation is a complex, highly regulated defense reaction orchestrated by the host in response toinvading pathogen or injury. Innate immunity is the firstline of defense, designed to recognize pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns represented by conserved componentsof microorganisms unique to microbial world. Thepathogen molecules are sensed via a limited number ofpattern-recognition receptors of the Toll receptor (TLR) family expressed in innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Stimulation of the TLRsby their respective ligands initiates appropriate responsesleading to a production of variety of cytokines, which inturn shape and enhance the inflammatory and adaptiveimmune responses. Activation of mammalian innate and acquired immune responses must be tightly regulated by elaboratemechanisms to control their onset and termination.MicroRNAs have been implicated as negative regulatorscontrolling diverse biological processes at the level ofposttranscriptional repression. Expression profiling of 200microRNAs in human monocytes revealed that several ofthem (miR-146a b, miR-132, and miR-155) are endotoxin-responsive genes. Analysis of miR-146a and miR-146b gene expression unveiled a pattern of induction in response to a variety of microbial components and proinflammatorycytokines. By means of promoter analysis, miR-146a was found to be a NF- \u0001B-dependent gene. Importantly, miR- 146a/b were predicted to in genes, andwe found that these UTRs inhibit expression of a linkedreporter gene in a miR-146-dependent fashion. Thesegenes encode two key adapter molecules downstream ofToll-like and cytokine receptors. Thus, we propose a rolefor miR-146 in control of Toll-like receptor and cytokinesignaling through negative feedback regulation loopinvolving down-regulation of IRAK1and TRAF6 proteinlevels. 195. Regulation of inflammation by the NF- \u0001B system Shengli Hao, David BaltimoreThe inflammatory response is a double-edged sword. Whereas it is important for the host to clear outpathogenic insults and to repair injuries, an unregulated or prolonged inflammatory response leads to tissue damage which underlies a great number of diseases includingautoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes, multiplesclerosis (MS), cancer, and vascular diseases. Therefore,the effective prevention and treatment of these diseaseswill be aided by a deep understanding of how the inflammatory response is controlled in the body. NF- \u0001Bi s a key regulator of the inflammatory response. It functions as a homodimer or heterodimer drawn from a pool of five members: RelB, c-Rel, p50 and but not each NF -\u0001B member, that determines the specificity of gene regulation. In addition, the NF- \u0001B dimers have different functions in regulation of various aspects of the inflammatory response, and thus maycontribute differently to the pathogenesis of the inflammation-associated diseases. Therefore, exploration of the specific properties and function of each dimer iscrucial to understanding inflammation and ultimately todiscover effective treatments for diseases of uncontrolledinflammation. However, this approach faces a huge obstacle because altering one NF- \u0001B protein member affects all the dimers containing this member. To overcome this problem, we proposed in last year's annual report reconstructing NF- \u0001B protein (using p50 as an example) such that this new NF-\u0001 B molecule (designated as p50*) can only form a homodimer with itself(p50*/p50*) but not with any wild type of NF- \u0001B members. In order to approach this goal, we have used the following strategies to overcome various difficulties: 1)Since p50 lacks a transactivation domain, it is very129 difficult to quantify the relative activity of a mutant, so we have solved this problem by fusing the transactivationdomain of p65 to the C-terminus of p50, whose activity is greatly amplified and easily measured using a \u0001B-luc reporter assay, and the relative activity of each p50 mutant can be readily detected and compared under the constantconditions; 2) With this easy, quick, sensitive, andquantitative tool, we have generated over 80 mutants ofp50, concentrating on 10 amino acids at the dimerizationinterface, by site-directed mutagenesis. The relativeimportance of these residues in forming the dimer were therefore analyzed. With this knowledge, a mutant that perfectly matches our requirements has been created,which maintains the full activity of wild-type but does not associated with any other wild type NF- \u0001B monomer proteins as detected by luciferase assay and co- immunoprecipitation. The same strategy has also applied to create a specific p50 and p65 mutant, each of whichdoes not have any (or barely detectable) activity, thus doesnot function as a homodimer, but functions in the presenceof the other as the p50:p65 heterodimer. Now we have afew p50 and only form p50:p65 heterodimer. The followingapproaches are under and p50:p65 2) creating p65 and p52 homodimer and otherdimers using a similar strategy. 196. Engineering immunity to treat cancer Lili Yang, Abigail Elliott, David BaltimoreThe concept of Engineering Immunity is to reprogram the immune system so that it is able to handlediseases that the unperturbed system cannot deal with. Tothis end, we developed the ability to genetically programhematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the common immunecell progenitors, to develop into T cells with the desiredspecificity in vivo . In a mouse tumor model, we were able to show that this method could generate large number of anti-tumor T cells that resulted in efficient tumor resistance and eradication (Ref. #1). To further advanceand mature the method, we have been actively working onthe following areas: a. Engineering immunity to treat melanoma In July 2005, we started collaboration with several research and clinical groups at UCLA, USC,CHLA and UCHC to move the Engineering Immunitymethod into clinical trials to treat melanoma. A Phase Iclinical trial is planned for launch in 2007 at UCLA,conducted by Dr. James Economou's clinical team. b. Generation of antigen-specific T cells with enhanced function in vivo As an extension of our Engineering Immunity concept, we have been working on the generation ofantigen-specific T cells with enhanced function in vivo . Taking advantage of our lab's extensive experience withengineering viral vectors, we are able to construct vectorsthat efficiently co-express multiple genes under the control of a single promoter. This technique allows us to put intoone vector the two genes encoding an antigen-specificTCR, together with a regulatory gene that can endow Tcells with a desired function. One such gene we tested isthat encoding IL-15, which has been considered to play an important role on CD8 cytotoxic T cell homeostasis and memory. We are in the process of testing the anti-tumoreffect of these genetically enhanced T cells. c. Targeted g ene delivery to genetically modify HSCs in vivo As a hallmark of gene therapy, targeted gene delivery in vivo can greatly facilitate the application of gene therapy, including our \"Engineering Immunity\"strategy. To this end, we have developed a gene deliverysystem to transfer genes to chosen cell types (Ref. #2). Inparticular, we have generated lentiviruses that can specifically infect cells expressing mouse c-kit, a marker for mouse HSCs; and human CD34, the sole reliablemarker for human HSCs. We have proved this system tobe highly specific and efficient, by targeted infection ofcell lines expressing the c-kit or CD34 marker. Thetargeted infection of primary mouse HSCs and humanHSCs are under testing, both in vitro and in vivo . Other applications of this system include the in vivo correction of blood cell genetic deficiencies, holding potential fortreating diseases such as SCID and the X-linkedautoimmunity. d.In situ dendritic cell vaccination Dendritic cell (DC) vaccination has been broadly used to mount T cell immunity against cancer andinfectious diseases. Genetically modified DCs that expresstumor or viral antigens are considered to be powerfulvaccines. However, the current protocol involves a costlyand tedious process including collecting peripheral bloodfrom a patient, culturing DCs in vitro , tranducing the cells with vectors, and infuse the cells back to the same patient.Falling into the category of personal medicine, the processis costly, tedious and likely inconsistent. We developed a novel method of in situ DC vaccination. Our strategy is to engineer the tropism of a lentiviral vector to make it infectonly DCs, but not any other tissue cells. Using ChickenOvalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen, we were able toinduce a strong anti-OVA T cell response and memory in amouse via a single shot of such lentivector encoding OVA.What's more, by modifying the expression pattern of OVA,we can also induce a strong antibody response in mouse.In the tumor challenge experiments, all mice receivingsuch a vaccination showed complete resistance to OVAtumor challenge. Currently, we are in testing of the method for authentic tumor antigen, in a B16 mouse melanoma model. This new method could potentially beused to replace the current DC vaccination approaches, bya single shot of a common lentivector stock, to treat abroad range of diseases including cancer and HIV.130 197. Engineering immunity to treat HIV and other dangerous pathogensXin Luo, Ryan Michael O'Connell, Angie Frausto,Dongzi Yu, Lili Yang*, David Baltimore, (*Lead Scientist and Project Manager)Supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative, we are exploring a fundamentally new way of stimulatingthe immune system to fight off infectious diseases,focusing on HIV as a test of the concept. The promise ofthis project is that for some infections, including HIV, theimmune system's natural responses are inherentlyinadequate, and therefore, the traditional approach of usingvaccines to stimulate and boost these responses is likely tobe ineffective. As an alternative, we propose to geneticallyengineer immune cells so that they can produce anadequate responses. Our work is intended to eventuallylead to immunotherapy for people who are infected with HIV. It could also lead to new ways to prevent HIV infection. Our strategy is to use gene therapy for expression of genes encoding neutralizing antibodies or antibody-likeproteins against HIV. Multiple problems must be solvedto allow expression of purposely-designed genes in thecells of infected people. We plan to implant genes inblood stem cells and allow the cells to give rise to B cells,the body's natural antibody-producing cells, requiring thesolution of particular problems posed by the architecture ofantibody genes. We must also design antibodies or antibody-like proteins that can efficiently neutralize the infectivity of HIV. This will be done by design methodsor by selection. We must then prove the effectiveness ofthe design in human cells or in a mouse/human chimera.Finally, we have to drive the cost of the process to a lowenough level to use in the less developed world. At lowcost, it could even be a vaccine. With the goal of developing this general method, captured by the phrase \"Engineering Immunity\" to treatinfection by HIV and other dangerous pathogens, we havethe following objectives:(Note: This project is a joint effort led by the Baltimore group, and joined by Dr. Pamela Bjorkman's group at Caltech, and Dr. Pin Wang's group at USC.) Objective 1: To perfect lentiviral expression systems that can impart the desired specificities to the murineAb repertoire. ( Lili Yang, Dongzi Yu) The Baltimore laboratory has devised methods to generate functional T cells of defined antigen specificity inmice by retrovirus-mediated expression of T cell receptorgenes in hematopoietic precursor cells (Ref. #1). We willadapt these methods to generate functional B cells capable of secreting antibodies (Abs) or Ab-like proteins upon stimulation with antigen. Using a model antibody/antigensystem, we will construct lentiviral vectors that co-expressa membrane-bound form of a lysozyme-specific Ab, and asecreting form of anti-HIV neutralizing Abs (Nab). Upontransferring into HSCs, such a lentivector will direct thegeneration of B cells in mouse that can go through clonalexpansion upon injection of lysozyme, and will secrete high titers of anti-HIV Abs. So far we have achieved thegeneration of lysozyme-specific B cells in mouse.Functional analysis of these B cells in response to antigenstimulation in vitro and in vivo is ongoing. Objective 2: To engineer bispecific and other designer anti-HIV antibodies and evaluate them for binding toand neutralizing HIV. (This objective is performed by Dr. Pamela Bjorkman's group, Division of Biology,Caltech) Using protein engineering and design methods,we will increase Ab affinities to allow them to be effectiveat low concentrations in the blood or in secretions, andmake bispecific Abs containing two different combiningsites. We will express, purify and determine affinities ofthe following Abs and Ab-like proteins: bispecificantibodies with specificities for two different HIV epitopes, bispecific antibodies with one HIV specificity and one host immune effector cell specificity, chimericproteins containing the gp120-binding domains of CD4linked to a CD4-induced antibody specificity, multivalentantibodies (triabodies or tetravalent antibodies). Also, wewill increase affinities of Abs or Ab-like proteins usingphage display or computational protein design methods.Function of the designer anti-HIV Abs and Ab-likeproteins will be evaluated using an in vitro neutralization assay. After obtaining DNA encoding the broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies 4E10, 2F5, 2G12, and b12, we have proceeded to construct expression plasmidsfor this starting set of NAbs in several forms: full-lengthIgG, Fab, and single-chain Fv (scFv). We are now theprocess of expressing and purifying the IgG and Fabsusing the baculovirus expression system. These reagentsrepresent the foundation for future work on the project intwo ways: (1) they provide benchmarks for comparison offuture engineered reagents; and (2) the scFv and Fab formsare the building blocks that will be combined or mutated toform improved reagents. Objective 3: To test anti-HIV-producing lentiviral constructs in vitro using a B lymphopoiesis culture system and in vivo using human/mouse chimeras. ( Xin Luo, Ryan Michael O'Connell, Angie Frausto) The overall goal of this objective is to generate and evaluate at least five optimized lentiviral vectors, eachof which will encode a different human anti-HIV NAb orAb-like protein. We will perfect an in vitro B lymphopoiesis culture system and creating human/mousechimeras that have been reconstituted with a humanimmune system. These will be used to test lentiviral constructs. We will also construct anti-HIV producing lentiviral systems, with an initial focus on engineering\"dual specificity\" B cells that will secrete desired anti-HIVAbs or Ab-like proteins upon vaccination with a linearpeptide antigen. Our goal is to produce lentiviralconstructs that will drive transduced CD34 + human cord blood cells to differentiate into human B cells with dual131 specificity in the in vitro lymphopoiesis culture system and in vivo in the human/mouse chimeras. Objective 3a: To establish an in vitro B lymphopoiesis culture system (Xin Luo, Angie Frausto) Based on the reported long-term, in vitro culture system initiated with CD34+ human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells that supports normal humanB-lineage development (Fluckiger et al., 1998), we have started a two-stage system in order to perfect theconditions required for B lymphopoiesis in vitro and subsequently, for future testing of lentiviral constructs thatdrive the transduced human HSCs to differentiate intohuman B cells with dual specificity in vitro . The first stage is to generate an adequate supply of CD19 + B cells from CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using a MS-5 stromal cell line for the co-culture system in thepresence of growth factors, we have achieved the generation of CD19+ cells. We further proved that we can transduce the CD34+ cells with a reporter lentivector athigh efficiency (>80%), and differentiate the transducedcells into CD19+ cells. The second stage is to activatena\u00efve CD19 + B cells and differentiate them into Ab-producing plasma cells. By stimulating na\u00efve B cellswith mitogens in the presence of T cell help, we observedthe class switching and upregulation of B cell activationmarkers. Future work will be to further perfect the culturesystem and use it to test the candidate lentiviral vectors fordirecting B cell development and mediating production of specific proteins. Objective 3b: To establish a human/mouse chimeras model (Ryan Michael O'Connell) Manz and co-workers have reported that intrahepatic injection of human CD34 + cord blood cells in newborn RAG2-/-\u0001c-/- mice results in reconstitution of a human adaptive immune system in mice (Traggiai et al., 2004). The transplanted mice develop human B, T anddendritic cells, generate structured primary and secondarylymphoid organs, and establish a functional immuneresponse. This could provide us with a convenient in vivo model with which we can evaluate the efficacy of thegenetically programmed human HSCs to develop into functional B cells. We have obtained the RAG2 -/-\u0001c-/- mouse strain, and have located a source for human cord blood cells. We are now starting to establish thishuman/mouse chimeras model for testing candidatelentivectors. Objective 4: To develop a novel murine model of HIV infection and to test the efficacy of the anti-HIV engineered B cells to prevent and clear HIV infection in vivo. To test our Engineering Immunity approach, we will develop a new mouse model of HIV pathogenesisinvolving human/mouse chimeras that have beenreconstituted with a human adaptive immune system andinfected with HIV.Objective 5: To engineer the lentivector delivery system for the application of Engineering Immunityapproach. (This objective is performed by Dr. Pin Wang's group at USC's Mork Family Department of ChemicalEngineering and Materials Science.) We have identified an efficient and flexible method to target lentivirus-mediated gene transduction to a pre-determined cell type (Ref. #2). involvesincorporation of a cell-specific binding determinant (CBD)and a fusogenic protein as two distinct entities into thelentiviral surface. The fusogen is modified so that it willnot bind to its cognate receptor, so the CBD determines thetargeting specificity. Using CD20 as a target antigen forhuman B cells, we have demonstrated that this targetingstrategy is effective both in vitro and in intact animals. This methodology is flexible and can be extended to otherforms of cell-type specific recognition to mediatetargeting. The only requirement is that the antibody (or other binding protein) must be endocytosed after interaction with its cell-surface binding determinant. Thetechnique allows for targeting of gene therapy by directinjection of a vector. CD34 is the sole reliable marker for human HSCs. We plan to use our new method to target lentiviralvectors to CD34-positive cells. We have cloned out ananti-CD34 antibody that can induce endocytosis uponbinding to CD34, and have shown that lentivectorenveloped with this antibody can efficiently infect a stable293T cell line that expresses CD34. Transduction efficacy of the lentivector to primary human CD34 cells in vitro in cell culture, and in vivo in the RAG2-/- \u0001 c-/- human mouse chimeras is under testing. Reference 1.

BjorkmanMember of the Professional Staff: Anthony Fellows: Wanzhong He, Yongning Elizabeth Sprague, Zhiru(Jenny) Yang Graduate Students: Alex Farley, Joshua Klein, Adrian Devin Tesar, Fan Students: The work described in the following research reports has been supported by: Arnold and Mabel Beckman Fellowship (fellowship to Rich Olson) Cancer Research Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship (fellowship to Yongning He) Foundation for the NIHBill and Melinda Gates FoundationTechnology Transfer Grubstake AwardLife Sciences Research Foundation Fellowship supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute(fellowship to Zhiru (Jenny) Yang) Howard Hughes Medical InstituteMax Planck Research Award for International Cooperation NIH Summary: My laboratory is interested in protein-protein interactions, particularly those mediating immunerecognition. We use X-ray crystallography andbiochemistry to study purified proteins (Figure 1), and are beginning to include confocal and electron microscopy toexamine protein complexes in cells. Some of our workfocuses upon homologs and mimics of class I MHCproteins. These proteins have similar three-dimensionalstructures, but different functions including immune functions (IgG transport by the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, and evasion of the immune response by viral MHCmimics), and non-immune functions (regulation of iron orlipid metabolism by HFE and ZAG, and serving achaperone function for pheromone receptors in the case ofthe M10 proteins). We are also comparing the structuresand functions of host and viral Fc receptors with FcRn. Transfer of maternal IgG molecules to the fetus or infant is a mechanism by which mammalian neonatesacquire humoral immunity to antigens encountered by themother. The protein responsible for the transfer of IgG is the MHC class I-related receptor FcRn. MHC class I molecules have no reported function as immunoglobulinreceptors; instead they bind and present short peptides to Tcells as part of immune surveillance to detect intracellularpathogens. We solved the crystal structures of rat FcRnboth alone and complexed with Fc. We are now interestedin using information obtained from our crystallographicand biochemical studies to address how FcRn-IgG complexes are transported across polarized epithelial cells.We are using a combination of confocal and electronmicroscopy to study the itineraries of FcRn-containingendosomes in transfected epithelial cells and in theproximal small intestine of neonatal rats. We are also doing structure/function studies of other Fc receptors that are not MHC homologs: gE/gI, a viral Fc receptor for IgG, Fc\u0001RI, a host receptor for IgA, and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), a receptor that transports dimeric IgA and polymeric IgM into secretions. HFE is a recently discovered class I MHC homolog that is involved in the regulation of ironmetabolism, an unexpected function for an MHC-relatedprotein. The gene encoding HFE is mutated in patientswith the iron overload disease hereditaryhemochromatosis. HFE has been linked to iron metabolismwith the demonstration that it binds to transferrin receptor,the receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin.We solved crystal structures of HFE alone and HFE boundto transferrin receptor. The interaction of HFE withtransferrin receptor is a fascinating system to studybecause we can use crystal structures to answer biochemical, functional, and evolutionary questions that address how binding of HFE interferes with transferrinbinding, if conformational changes in the receptor areinvolved in the binding of either transferrin or HFE, whichpart of the MHC-like HFE structure binds transferrinreceptor, and how the HFE interaction with the receptorcompares with interactions of ligands with MHC andMHC-like (e.g., FcRn) proteins. We are expanding ourstudies to include cell biological investigations of HFE andtransferrin receptor intracellular trafficking in transfectedcell lines using confocal microscopy and other imaging techniques. We are also interested in other MHC homologs, including proteins encoded by viruses. Both human andmurine cytomegalovirus (HCMV, MCMV), expressrelatives of MHC class I heavy chains, probably as part ofthe viral defense mechanism against the mammalianimmune system. Our biochemical studies show that theHCMV homolog associates with endogenous peptidesresembling those that bind to class I MHC molecules. Ourcurrent efforts focuses upon defining the structure andfunction of these homologs in order to understand whyviruses make them and how they interfere with the host immune system. Recent studies from other laboratories have revealed expression of an interesting family of class IbMHC proteins (M10s) that interact with putativepheromone receptors in the rodent vomeronasal organ.This interaction may play a direct role in the detection ofpheromonal cues that initiate reproductive and territorialbehaviors. We have solved the crystal structure of M10.5,an M10 family member. The structure shows that M10.5folds into a similar structure as a bona fide class I MHC molecule. Unexpectedly, however, the M10.5 counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove is open and unoccupied, revealing the first structure of an empty class I134 MHC molecule. Our biochemical data suggest that M10.5 associates with some sort of groove occupant, most likelynon-peptidic. The challenge now is to discover thephysiological ligand(s) of M10 proteins and understandhow they associate with pheromone receptors to influencemating behaviors. Our structural work on class I MHC homologs has elucidated new and unexpected recognition propertiesof the MHC fold. For FcRn and HFE, the structural andbiochemical studies have revealed a similar fold and somecommon properties, including the assumption that bothreceptors \"lie down\" parallel to the membrane whenbinding ligand, and a sharp pH-dependent affinitytransition near neutral pH. In the case of FcRn, we haveelucidated the structural basis of its pH-dependentinteraction with IgG and will now focus upon cellbiological studies of intracellular trafficking, for which thepH-dependent interaction is critical.The pH dependence of the HFE-TfR interaction suggested to us that intracellular trafficking studies of HFEwould be interesting, so much of our future efforts on boththe FcRn and HFE systems will center around probingtheir function in a cellular context using imagingtechniques. Our functional studies of M10 proteins are just beginning, since we do not understand the nature of the interaction between an M10 protein and a pheromonereceptor and how that relates to binding to an as yetunidentified groove occupant. We are at an even earlierstage in our studies of the viral MHC homologs, in whichour primary goal will be to solve crystal structures of aviral homolog alone and complexed with its cellularreceptor. 135 across epithelial cell barriers to provide maternalantibodies to offspring and serves as a protection receptor by rescuing endocytosed IgG and albumin from lysosomal degradation. We have generated polarized Madin-DarbyCanine Kidney (MDCK) cell lines expressing rat FcRn(rFcRn) to investigate the potential requirement for ligandbivalency in FcRn-mediated transport. The rFcRn-MDCKcells IgG and Fc across polarized cellmonolayers. However, they cannot be used to study FcRn-mediated transport of the monovalent ligand albumin, aswe observe no specific binding, internalization, or transcytosis of rat albumin at concentrations up to 10 \u00b5M. To address whether ligand bivalency is required for transport, the ability of or that ligand bivalency is notabsolutely required for transcytosis or recycling to occur, but that wtFc is transcytosed and recycled more efficiently than hdFc, particularly at lower concentrations. We havefurther shown hdFc and wtFc have different intracellularfates, with more hdFc than wtFc being trafficked tolysosomes and degraded, suggesting a role for avidityeffects in FcRn-mediated IgG transport. 199. Characterization microscopyDevin B. Tesar, Galina JerdevaMovement of specific protein molecules across epithelial cell barriers by their cognate receptors is achieved via a multivesicular transport pathway known as transcytosis. Discrete steps in the procession of a receptor-bound ligand through the transcytotic network arecharacterized by association with distinct subpopulationsof endosomal compartments. subpopulations ofendosomes can be identified microscopy usingfluorescent markers (such as transferrin) or antibodiesagainst such markers (such as anti-Rab antibodies). Weare currently working to decipher the transcytotic without IgG with different endosomal markers. Toachieve this, FcRn can be visualized by expressing a C- terminal GFP-fused form of FcRn, or by staining with an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody that is directly conjugatedto Alexa488. Rat Fc fragment can as or Cy3), andantibodies specific endosomal markers can beviewed using secondary antibodies conjugated to a far-reddye (such as Cy5). This allows for three-color confocalanalysis to determine the intracellular localization of FcRn,it ligand, and marker proteins for particular compartmentsat different stages within the transport process. These datacan then be compared to the transport pathways of more well characterized receptors such as the polymeric Igreceptor (pIgR) to evaluate which steps might be unique to, or particularly important during FcRn-mediatedtransport of IgG. Future work will focus on developingtechniques for following trafficking events in live cellsover the course of several minutes in real time. 200. Identification of effector molecules that mediate the trafficking of FcRn in cellsDevin B Tesar, Johannes Graumann * The intracellular trafficking of a receptor and its ligands requires the coordinated association of the receptorcytoplasmic tail with effector molecules responsible forregulating and executing specific steps of the traffickingpathway. Determinants within the cytoplasmic tail of agiven receptor confer the specificity of these interactions.While many of the molecular components of the cytosolictrafficking machinery are very well conserved acrossdifferent organisms, different receptors may utilize different components while being directed to their target destinations. We wish to determine the identity of effectorproteins associated with FcRn during its intracellulartrafficking itinerary. FcRn obtained from both naturalsources (neonatal rat intestine) and tissue culture cells(transfected MDCK cells) is co-immunoprecipitated usingFcRn-specific antibodies, IdentificationTechnology (MudPIT) analysis. MudPIT allows massspectrometric analysis of a complex protein mixture bycoupling a two-dimensional chromatographic separation of the mixture to direct downstream injection of the sample into the mass spectrometer. Identified targets will beverified by performing pull downs of the identified bindingpartner and demonstrating the co-precipitation of FcRn.Further experiments will then be carried out to assess therole of these targets in FcRn-mediated intracellulartrafficking. *Ray Deshaies Lab, Division of Biology, Caltech 201. Characterization and visualization of the FcRn-dependent * Specific delivery of proteins across polarized epithelia is controlled by receptor-mediated transcytosis.Based on studies of the trafficking of model receptors suchas the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), thepathways for receptor-mediated transport proteinligands in the basolateral to apical direction are relativelywell understood. Less is known about the traffickingpathways for receptors that transport from the apical to basolateral surface. One such receptor is the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which transports maternalimmunoglobulin G (IgG) across intestinal or placentalepithelial barriers to provide immunity to fetal or newbornmammals and serves as a protection receptor for IgG,thereby increases its serum half-life. To investigate FcRn-mediated transport of IgG, we are using Madin-Darby136 Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells stably FcRn (MDCK-FcRn). The cells specificallytranscytose IgG and Fc across polarized cell monolayers,therefore presenting an ex vivo system that mimics the in vivo FcRn-dependent transport system. Using high- resolution confocal and multiphoton microscopy, we will identify intracellular compartments involved labeled Fc and itsligands with trafficking of a to receptor,pIgR, which transports dimeric dIgA common dIgA. compare FcRn- andpIgR-dependent intracellular pathways ,we Fluorescently-labeled Fc and MDCK-FcRn-pIgR and intracellular locations by confocal or multi-photon microscopy.

Th ree-dimensional pathways of transport maternal antibody across the epithelialbarriers in suckling rat small intestinerevealed by electron tomographyWanzhong He, Christine Kivork, Mary Morphew *, J. Richard McIntosh*, Grant Jensen** Before its own immune system is fully developed, the suckling rat is dependent upon the neonatal Fc receptor(FcRn) to transport maternal IgG from ingested bloodstream. FcRn also functions to protect IgG fromlysosomal degradation. In both its transport and protectionroles, FcRn binds to IgG at acidic pH (6.0) inside endosomes and releases IgG at the pH (7.4) of blood. Early conventional electron microscopy studies usinglabeled IgG provided direct evidence that the proximalsmall intestine of neonatal rat selectively transportsantibody into the circulation. However, due to the largesize and non-specific coupling of the labels that were used(e.g., ferritin), not all of the labeled IgG is likely to bindFcRn, thus these studies may not reveal the true pathwaysof IgG uptake in intestinal epithelial cells. In order to tracethe precise three-dimensional (3D) pathways duringdynamic endocytic processes and to examine possible configurations of FcRn-Fc complexes within different types of intracellular vesicles in the intact neonatal ratsmall intestine, we need technique that permits us to tracefully functional antibody conjugates in an in vivo system with high resolution. We are 1.4 nm nanogold clusters,which are small chemically-defined particles, covalentlyattached to the hinge region of rat Fc then purified on anFcRn affinity column, as a more reliable label to explore functional endocytic processes. However, it is stillchallenging to visualize 1.4 nm gold particles within thinsections of tissue samples. Therefore, we are combiningtechniques: improved gold-enhancement methods forchemically-fixed samples, a newly developed freeze substitution (FS)-based silver-enhancement method for high pressure frozen samples, and electron tomography tovisualize the gold particles and trace the precise pathwaysof antibodies in 3D. Our results clearly demonstrate thatthe proximal small intestine takes up the antibodiesthrough an FcRn-specific mechanism with most goldparticles located in tubular vesicles and coated vesicles,and discharges the conjugates to the basolateralextracellular space. Only a small portion of conjugates arefound in lysosomes. In the distal small intestine, whichdoes not express FcRn, we find the gold particles aredelivered to the lysosomal degradation pathway. Hence, these techniques are confirmed to be very useful to trace 3D transport pathways and to analyze dynamic events inthe process of transcytosis. *Laboratory for 3D Electron Microscopy of Cells, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 **Assistant Professor, Division of Biology, Caltech 203. Cr ystal structure of the HSV-1 Fc receptor bound to Fc reveals a mechanism for antibodybipolar bridgingElizabeth R. Sprague, *, expresses gE-gI, on the surfaces of virionsand infected cells that binds the Fc region of hostimmunoglobulin G (IgG) and is implicated in the cell-to-cell spread of virus. gE-gI binds IgG at the basic pH of thecell surface and releases it at the acidic pH of lysosomes,consistent with a role in facilitating the degradation of anti-viral antibodies. Here we identify the C-terminal domainof the gE ectodomain domain of gE (CgE) as the minimalFc-binding domain and present a 1.78 \u00c5 CgE structure. A5\u00c5 gE-gI/Fc crystal structure, which was independentlyverified by a theoretical prediction method, reveals that CgE binds Fc at the C H2-C H3 interface, the binding site for several mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins. Thestructure identifies interface histidines that may confer pH-dependent binding and regions of CgE implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus. The ternary organization of the gE-gI/Fc complex is compatible with antibody bipolarbridging, which can interfere with the anti-viral immuneresponse. *University of Washington, Seattle, Washington137 204. Intracellular trafficking of an antibody bipolar bridged HSV-1 Fc receptor-antiviral IgGAlex FarleyHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a member of the alphaherpesvirus family, which also includes Varicella-Zoster Virus (ZVZ) and Pseudorabies Virus (PrV). Alphaherpesviruses are characterized by arelatively short replicative cycle in epithelial tissues andegression to and latent infection of the sensory neurons.HSV encodes two type 1 membrane-bound glycoproteinswhich together function as a receptor for the Fc portion ofIgG. The heterodimer is composed of glycoprotein E (gE)and glycoprotein (gI) and it is found on the surface ofvirions and infected cells. The Fc receptor function of gE-gI is thought to provide a mechanism for immune evasionby blocking the effector function of host Fc recognitionproteins in both the adaptive and innate immune systems. The gE-gI heterodimer is thought to bind to antigen-bound IgG in a process called bipolar bridging in which theantigen-binding fragments (Fabs) bind to an antigen, andgE-gI binds to the Fc. This process could provide amechanism for HSV-1 to evade antibody-mediatedimmune responses via Fc receptors. binding gE-gI for Fc is pH-dependent, whereby gE-gI binds IgGwith high affinity at the slightly basic pH of the cellsurface (~7.4) and releases IgG at acidic pH ( that isendocytosed by gE-gI dissociates from gE-gI at the low pH of endosomal compartments, where it could be degraded, while gE-gI is recycled back to the cell surface. Ourhypothesis is that Fc binding to gE-gI results inendocytosis of the antibody/antigen complex and itsconsequent degradation possibly in the lysosome. Wehave shown that the gE-gI heterodimer can internalize theFc domain of IgG. Future work will include experimentsto address the intracellular trafficking patterns of gE-gIand the fates of gE-gI/IgG and gE-gI/IgG/antigencomplexes. 205. Structural studies of the human cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G receptors Elizabeth R. Sprague, Alex Farley, EvelynCheung, Hartmut Henge * We have expanded our work on viral Fc receptors to include the recently cloned Fc receptors from HCMV,which is a member of the betaherpesvirus family. HCMVencodes two glycoproteins, gp34 and gp68, that IgG; however, unlike gE-gI, the HCMV Fcreceptors are composed of a single polypeptide whosesequence is unrelated to either gE or gI. We haveexpressed the ectodomain of gp68 in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified milligrams of the protein. Using an analytical gel filtration assay to investigate binding ofone of these receptors to Fc, we have shown that therecombinantly-expressed ectodomain of gp68 binds to theFc portion of human IgG1 with a stoichiometry of twogp68 molecules per one Fc homodimer. Furthermore, welocalized gp68 site to the H2-C H3 hingeregion of Fc, which is where gE-gI binds, using Fc molecules where residues in this region were mutated ineither one or both of the Fc subunits, analogous to ourstudies of the gE-gI/Fc interaction. In a surface plasmonresonance-based binding assay, the affinity of gp68 for Fcwas measured as ~300 nM, and preliminary data suggest that unlike gE-gI/Fc, the gp68/Fc complex is unaffected by small changes in pH near neutral, indicating a possibledivergent function between betaherpesvirus andalphaherpesvirus Fc receptors. We are undertakingcrystallization gp68 glycosylationvariants) alone and bound to Fc. For gp34, we do not seeexpression of the gp34 ectodomain in baculovirus-infectedinsect cells, whereas we do see expression in CHO cells.The gp34 from CHO cell supernatants binds IgG; however,because it appears to be oligomerized, it is not ideal forfurther characterization at this time. *University of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany 206. Biochemical and structural studies of ferroportinAdrian E. Rice, Douglas C. Rees * All known organisms, save two bacteria, require iron for survival. Despite its importance, iron inoverabundance is toxic. In order to maintain a balance ofiron levels, organisms have developed a highly specializednetwork of molecules designed to monitor and maintainiron homeostasis. When the fidelity of these networks iscompromised, diseases such as iron deficiency and iron overload result. Mammals lack any regulated mode of iron excretion and therefore must have highly regulatedmechanisms for controlling the acquisition of iron from thediet. The primary site of iron absorption is the duodenumof the small intestine. This process can be categorized bytwo phases: 1) iron uptake across the brush border into thecytoplasm of duodenal enterocytes; and 2) iron exportacross the basolateral membrane of these cells into theblood. Iron from the diet is reduced from Fe3+ to Fe2+ bythe membrane-bound iron reductase Dcytb brush border by an integralmembrane protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1; also known as DCT1 and NRAMP2). Iron is then transported across the cell to the basolateral side where itis exported by the basolateral integral membrane irontransporter ferroportin (Fpn; also known as IREG1 andMTP1). Fpn is the only identified iron exporter invertebrates and is an integral membrane protein containing9-12 predicted alpha-helical transmembrane segments.Point mutations in Fpn lead to autosomal dominant ironoverload disease called ferroportin disease. Our projectaims to characterize Fpn from both a structural andbiochemical standpoint. Current plans in our laboratory aim at obtaining purified recombinant Fpn for these studies. *Professor, Division of Chemistry, Caltech138 207. Characterization of hemojuvelin and its interaction with neogenin Fan Yang, Anthony P. West, Jr., Anya E. Wyman,An Sheng Zhang *, Caroline A. Enns* Mutations in HJV, the gene encoding hemojuvelin, cause juvenile hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that affects young people of both sexes. Recent studies have showed that HJV might functionthrough affecting the transcription of hepcidin, the key ironregulatory peptide. How this is achieved is not clear yet.Recent advances in Caroline Enns lab at OHSU found thathemojuvelin co-immunoprecipates with neogenin, a cellsurface receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig)family. Based on previously published data indicating thatthe six fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains of neogeninbinds to a weexpressed both neogenin ectodomain and neogenin FNIIIdomains and found they have nearly identical affinities for hemojuvelin. Several proteolysis experiments were performed using neogenin FNIII domains substrates andproducts were analyzed followed bySDS/PAGE, Western blotting and N-terminal sequencing.We were able to narrow down the hemojuvelin-bindingepitope of neogenin to two of the six FNIII repeats.Binding data obtained by a biosensor assay confirmed highaffinity binding between neogenin and the isolated twoFNIII domain fragment. Crystallization trials ofhemojuvelin alone and complexed with the neogeninfragment have been initiated with the goal of obtaining high-resolution structural information about the interaction. *Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health & Science University 207. Structural and functional studies of MHC class I homologs in HCMVZhiru (Jenny) YangHCMV affects 70-90% of all human populations and can be life threatening to immuno-compromisedindividuals, such as cancer, transplant, and AIDS patients.HCMV achieves its lifelong infection in host cells by adopting multiple mechanisms to evade the primed immune system, including down-regulation of host class IMHC molecules. HCMV encodes two Ihomologs, UL18 and UL142, which may be componentsof a strategy to avoid immune detection of class I-MHCnegative cells. UL18 is heavily glycosylated (13 potentialN-linked glycosylation sites) and able to bind host-derived \u00012-microglobulin (the class I MHC light chain) and endogenous peptides. The host cell receptor for UL18 is LIR-1, which is most abundant in B cells, monocytes,macrophages, and dendritic cells. The UL18/LIR-1interaction is likely to contribute to the latency andpersistence of HCMV as well as the viral evasion of hostNK cell surveillance. In addition to UL18, LIR-1 alsobinds a broad range of host MHC class I molecules, butwith an affinity that is over 1000 times reduced compared to its affinity for UL18 1. The structures of LIR-1 and a LIR-1/HLA-A2 complex have recently been solved in ourlab2,3. We are working on the co-crystallization and structure determination of UL18 with LIR-1. We have generated deglycosylated mutants of UL18, Crystals ofmutant UL18/LIR1 complexes have been obtained, and weare now optimizing the crystallization conditions to getbetter diffraction. These studies will be extended to include a newly identified HCMV class I MHC homolog, UL142, which is present in clinical HCMV strains such asToledo 4. UL142 shares about 20% amino acid sequence identity with MHC class I molecules. It could play a rolein the virulence of the wild-type HCMV. Immunological,biochemical and structural studies are underway tocharacterize this protein. Altogether, our work on UL18and UL142 will expand our basic understanding of theMHC class I homologs and the virus-host interaction. References 1. T.L., Heikema, Immunol. In press. 4. A.J. et al.

Huey Tubman Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules have been implicated in a number of non-immune roles in the central nervous system, particularly insynaptic development and plasticity. The discovery ofM10 (50% sequence identity to classical MHC molecules)proteins expressed in the vomeronasal organ adds to thelist of non-traditional roles of MHC homologs. M10molecules associate with the V2R class of vomeronasalreceptors, a family of G-protein coupled receptors(GPCRs) thought to function as pheromone receptors.Recent studies showing that classical MHC-bindingpeptides activate V2R-expressing neurons offer tempting clues that M10s might participate directly in the recognition of pheromone ligands, but M10 proteins do notbind to these peptides with significant affinity. Instead ofpresenting MHC-binding peptides, M10s might function asmolecular more generallyas modulators of neuronal function, as demonstratedelsewhere in the brain for classical MHC molecules. We are using GFP-fusion constructs of V2R receptors to investigate expression strategies for makingV2R/M10 complexes for structural studies. This includesusing a fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) system to evaluate the chromatographic behavior of multiple genes in variousdetergents without the need for initial purification.Eventually we plan to scale up the expression of promisingV2R/M10 complexes for S-ray crystallographic trials andelectron microscopy. This information will allow us touncover the unique nature of the interaction and design139 functional experiments targeted towards understanding the possible role of MHC molecules in pheromone detection. 210. Improved neutralizing antibodies against HIV Anthony P. West, Jr., Joshua Klein, KrystineSpiess, Priyanthi Peiris, Lili Yang, David Baltimore * Together with David Baltimore's laboratory, we have begun an \"Engineering Immunity\" project that has theoverall goal of developing a new approach to treatingHIV/AIDS. This strategy envisions using lentiviralvectors to program a patient's immune system to producedesigned anti-HIV molecules. The Bjorkman labcomponent of this project entails developing an improvedset of antibody reagents that neutralize HIV. Although thevast majority of natural anti-HIV antibodies are highlystrain-specific, a small number of broadly neutralizinganti-HIV antibodies have been identified. We are attempting to take this antibodies as a starting point to develop antibodies or antibody-like proteins engineered tobind more tightly to HIV or to recruit immune effectorcells. The goal of our part of the Engineering Immunityproject is to design, produce, and evaluate a series ofoptimized antibody or antibody-like anti-HIV proteins forfurther testing in a mouse model system. *President, Caltech 211. Studies in the design and characterization of HIV neutralizing molecules Joshua S. Klein Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is estimated to currently infect approximately 40 millionpeople worldwide and approximately three million AIDS-related deaths occurred in 2005. Conventional vaccinedesign methodologies have yet to yield an immunogencapable of eliciting protective immunity to HIV and theantiretroviral therapies credited with the precipitousdecline in AIDS-related deaths in the developed worldremain largely unavailable in underdeveloped regions ofthe world such as Southern Africa and parts of Asia, wheremost HIV infections occur. To address these issues, we are collaborating with the laboratory of David Baltimore to develop a hematopoietic stem cell transduction-basedtherapeutic vaccine capable of providing protectiveimmunity and clearing an established infection. We havesuccessfully produced a small array of single-chain Fv(scFv) anti-HIV molecules and shown them to be stable,monodispersed, able to bind their epitopes with lownanomolar affinities, and capable of neutralizing HIVpseudovirions in vitro . We are now in the process of fusing these molecules to various protein scaffolds in orderto increase their potential therapeutic efficacies. For example, it has been estimated that peak HIV production in an infected individual may reach ten billion virions perday with at least one mutation in every virion produced,making the capacity to remove infected cells critical toreducing viral load and limiting the opportunity of escapeby mutation. To address this issue, we will fuse our scFvmolecules to an IgG-derived Fc domain bearing mutationsrecently observed to confer a much greater capacity for the recruitment of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, animportant immune mechanism for clearing infected cells in vivo. We are also developing a novel method to examine the question of whether affinity correlates withneutralization effectiveness through the combination of surface plasmon resonance and multiplex array technologies. If a strong correlative relationship exists,this method would vastly increase the rate by which theeffectiveness of constructs such as ours and otherconventional antibodies may be assayed againstmeaningful numbers of different HIV isolates. 212. Structural study of L1 homophilic adhesion by cryoelectron tomographyYongning He, Grant Jensen * L1 (CD171) is a cell surface molecule expressed on many cell types, especially on nerve tissues, and involved in many cellular processes such as cell migration, axonal growth, myelination, etc. L1 mediates bothhomophilic and heterophilic adhesion for cells. Thehomophilic adhesion of L1 is important for cell migrationfor both neural and tumor cells, which plays an importantrole in tumor invasion and migration. L1 istransmembrane protein with a large extracellular portion, asingle-pass transmembrane domain a cytoplasm (Ig)domains and five fibronectin type III (FN) domains. Ithas been shown that only ectodomains are required for performing homophilic cell adhesion function. Based on the known structure of L1 homologues, the four N-terminal Ig domains are hypothesized to adopt ahorseshoe-shaped conformation in which the first and thesecond Ig domain folds back to interact with the fourth andthe third Ig domains, respectively. The role of fibronectindomains in of large molecularstructures at resolutions approaching 4nm. Instead ofusing real cells for aggregation, we utilize synthetic liposomes to which the ectodomain of L1 has been attached. The L1 liposomes can be used to monitorhomophilic adhesion and visualized directly, henceproviding a 3D picture of homophilic adhesion. 3Dtomograms of L1 show recognizable features at liposomesurfaces and a common distance between adjacentadhering membranes. Furthermore, L1 forms regularstructures between neighboring L1 molecules on adjacentmembrane surfaces. Based on the observed structurefeatures, a potential homophilic adhesion model for L1 hasbeen proposed. *Assistant Professor, Division Caltech140 213. Mono- and multivalent Fvs bind unaggregated poly-Gln according model Pingwei Li, Kathryn E. Huey Tubman, AnthonyP. West, Jr., Melanie J. BennettHuntington's and related neurological diseases are caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding a poly- glutamine (poly-Gln) tract. Some antibodies preferentially recognize expanded poly-Gln (>36), which has beeninterpreted as supporting a model in which expanded poly-Gln adopts a pathologic conformation that can be targetedfor drug design. However, our previous resultsdemonstrated that huntingtin Exon 1 fusion proteins with16 to 46 glutamines have random coil conformations insolution, with no evidence for a global conformationalchange above 36 glutamines, and that both normal andexpanded poly-Gln bind anti-poly-Gln antibodies [1].These results suggested that poly-Gln in the soluble (pre-aggregation) state is better described by a \"linear lattice\" model. In this model, soluble expanded poly-Gln differs from normal poly-Gln mainly in containing greaternumbers of an epitope that is recognized by antibodies,rather than adopting a novel global fold. The linear latticemodel predicts that multivalent compounds will bind withhigh avidity and specificity to expanded poly-Gln tracts.We expressed the Fv (variable domains) of the anti-poly-Gln antibody MW1, solved its crystal structure at 2.1\u00c5,and produced monovalent and multivalent Fvs to comparetheir binding to normal and expanded poly-Gln. Aspredicted by the linear lattice model, dimeric and tetrameric anti-poly-Gln Fvs bind more tightly to long than to short poly-Gln tracts, and the multimeric Fvs bindexpanded results suggest thatlinkage is aneffective strategy to achieve therapeutics with high avidityand specificity for expanded poly-Gln in the pre-aggregation state.

Campbell Member of the Professional Staff: Elizabeth Bertani, Martin Budd, Piotr PolaczekPostdoctoral Scholars : Students : Barbara Kraatz Fortini, Clara Reis Laboratory Staff : Santiago Laparra Support : The work described in the following research reports has been supported by: Margaret Early FoundationNIHPhillip Morris Summary : A hallmark of cancer cells, in addition to uncontrolled proliferation, is genomic instability, whichappears in the form of chromosome loss or gain, grosschromosomal rearrangements, deletions, or amplifications.The mechanisms that suppress such instability are of the utmost interest in understanding the pathogenesis of cancer. Our lab studies the components of the DNAreplication apparatus that promote genomic stability,primarily using yeast genetics, biochemistry, andfunctional genomics. Several years ago, Rajiv Dua in the laboratory discovered that DNA polymerase \u0001, one of four essential DNA polymerases in yeast, had not one, but two essential functions. Deletion of the polymerase domain left the cellsviable because another polymerase activity couldsubstitute. Conversely, deletion of the remaining, non-catalytic half of the protein was lethal. Shaune Edwards inthe laboratory carried out a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the enigmatic C-terminal region of pol \u0001 in order to discover its function. She found that pol \u0001interacts with Trf5, a protein involved in establishing cohesion of sister chromatids during passage of the replication fork. She has gone on to develop evidence that the essential function of the C terminus of pol \u0001 is to aid in establishing efficient sister chromatid cohesion during S phase. Another postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory, Caroline Li has characterized the Trf5 protein. She hasshown that it encodes a previously unknown poly A polymerase and that it stimulates the activity of pol \u0001 dramatically. Future studies are aimed at defining the mechanism by which these two proteins regulate interaction of the replisome with the cohesin complex, theglue that holds the chromosomes together, and how failureof cohesion leads to genomic instability. At least seven human diseases characterized by cancer predisposition and/or premature aging arecorrelated with defects in genes encoding DNA helicases.The yeast genome contains 134 open reading frames withhelicase motifs, only eight of which have beencharacterized. Martin Budd in our laboratory identified thefirst eukaryotic helicase essential for DNA replication, Dna2. He showed by interaction studies that it was a component of the machine that is required for accurateprocessing of Okazaki fragments during lagging strandDNA replication. Enzymatic studies to elucidate thesequential action of the DNA polymerase, helicase, andnuclease required for this processing form an ongoing mechanistic biochemistry project in the laboratory. Stimulated by various reports in the literature implicating Dna2 in telomere biogenesis and structure,Wonchae Choe made the interesting observation that thebulk of Dna2 is localized to telomeres and that this localization is dynamic. During G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, Dna2 is at telomeres. During S phase Dna2 ispresent on the replicating chromatin. Current studies areaimed at defining the genes that regulate the localization,including phosphorylation by the yeast ATR ortholog,Mec1. In addition to defects in replication, dna2 mutants are also very sensitive to agents that induce double strandbreaks (DSBs). Osamu Imamura has shown that Dna2 in response to the induction ofdouble strand breaks. He is carrying out experiments totest the model that Dna2 delocalization from telomeres ispart of the signaling system that induces the DNA damage and S phase checkpoints, as has also been suggested for yKU, a protein involved in non-homologous end joiningand in stabilizing telomeres. One model of cellular aging suggests that accumulation of DNA damage leads to replicativesenescence. Most endogenous damage occurs during Sphase and leads to replication fork stress. At least threehuman diseases of premature aging or cancerpredisposition, Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund-Thompson,are caused by defects in helicases similar to Dna2. MartinBudd and Laura Hoopes found that dna2 mutants have a significantly reduced life span. Microarray analysis by Isabelle Lesur shows that the dna2 mutants age by the same pathway as wild-type cells; they just age faster.Interestingly, the human Bloom and Werner genessuppress the replication defect of dna2 mutants. Yeast transcriptome analysis shows that old dna2 mutants have a gene expression pattern strikingly similar to cellssenescing due to telomerase defects. Future work will takeadvantage of the yeast system to further delineate the roleof BLM and WRN proteins in mammalian cells. The workof Tao Wei in the lab suggests that instability of repetitiveDNA, such as the ribosomal locus and telomeric DNA, is a major cause of genomic instability in the aging dna2 gene encodes an analogue of tubulin and is essential for bacterial cell division. Although mostorganisms have just one such gene, four sequences with atubulin signature can be seen in the draft genome sequenceof the magnetotactic organism, Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum. The of 53% (1), 52% (2), 49% (3) and 42% (4) whereasthe loop in paralog 4 is incomplete. Paralog 1 is clusteredtogether with other genes involved in cell division, but the143 other three are scattered at different sites in the chromosome. What are the functions of the four Magnetospirillum paralogs? Because of its conserved structure and location, paralog 1 seems most likely to bethe ftsZ gene responsible for cell division in Magnetospirillum. The others might be involved in the division or organization of the magnetite-containingorganelle that makes the bacteria magnetotactic, althoughmultiple copies of ftsZ are not necessarily found in other magnetotactic organisms. If a heterologous ftsZ gene is expressed in E. coli , cell division is blocked and the bacteria form longfilaments. When the paralog 2 protein is overexpressed inE. coli , the bacteria form long filaments and are unable to produce colonies. Thus, in spite of the conservation seenin paralog 1, paralog 2 has the phenotype expected of atrue ftsZ gene. In contrast, overexpression of the paralog 4 protein does not result in filament formation and does not affect colony formation. The phenotypes of the other twoparalogs remain to be investigated. Are all these paralogs expressed in Magnetospirillum ? In E. coli the ftsZ protein is found scattered throughout the cytoplasm, until cell divisionwhen it localizes to the midplate. We will attempt to detectthe presence of the proteins in Magnetospirillum by Western blotting using antibody against E. coli ftsZ. 1Undergraduate, California Institute of Technology 215. Strand annealing ex change J. J. Polaczek DNA2 is an essential gene conserved from yeast to human. Budding yeast Dna2p (ScDna2p) is anuclease/helicase, and required for assisting FEN1nuclease in a subset of Okazaki fragments thathave long, single-stranded 5' flaps. Additionally, DNA2 performs an essential function in the maintenance oftelomeres. In S. cerevisiae ,dna2 mutants have defects in the maintenance of telomeres and in de novo telomere synthesis, and ScDna2p shows dynamic localization to telomeres at G1 and G2 phases. Last year, I have characterized biochemical activity of human Dna2 (hDna2p), showing that both helicase activities of Dna2p are conserved ineukaryotes [1]. Further studies in this year demonstratedtwo novel activities of both the yeast and human Dna2helicase/nuclease protein: ATP independent single-strandannealing and strand exchange. These activities areindependent of ATPase/helicase and nuclease activities inthat mutations eliminating orATPase/helicase do not inhibit strand annealing or strand exchange. Since similar annealing/exchange properties have been reported for BLM and WRN, which has beenshown to suppress yeast dna2 mutant, we propose amodel that the shared strand equilibration, promoting the processing of Okazakifragment flaps during DNA replication and repair [2].Another interesting property of yeast DNA2 is its interaction with PIF1, encoding a helicase whose majorfunction is to regulate telomere length by inhibition oftelomerase. A deletion of DNA2 is normally lethal, butthe lethality can be suppressed by deletion of PIF1. Toinvestigate the interaction between DNA2 and PIF1 biochemically, we investigated if nuclease of Dna2 is stimulated by Pif1 protein. Preliminary results show theefficient cleavage of short fork substrates only in thepresence of both Pif1 and Dna2. This stimulation wasdependent on ATP. On the basis of these results, wesuggest that the helicase activity of Pif1 provides asubstrate for Dna2 nuclease, explaining why deletion null References [1] Masuda-Sasa, T.M., activitiesof yeast and human DNA2: Possible role in Okazakifragment maturation.

CampbellTo elucidate the network that maintains high fidelity replication, we have introduced two mutant alleles of Dna2 into each of 4700 viable yeast deletion mutants and determined the fitness of the double mutants. Fifty-sixDna2 interacting genes were identified. Clusteringanalysis of genomic synthetic lethality profiles of each ofthe 43 of the Dna2 interacting genes defines a networkconsisting of 322 genes and 876 interactions whosetopology provides clues as to how replication proteinscoordinate replication and repair to protect genomeintegrity. In this network, Dna2 is one of the major hubsthat link DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cyclecheckpoints, chromatin structure, osmotic stress, oxidativestress, and RNA metabolism. From work on the network, an important interaction of Dna2 with Pif1 was analyzed. Pif1 is a 5' to3' helicase whose major function is regulation of telomerelength and mitochondrial recombination. The lethality of dna2D can be suppressed by deletion of Pif1. The dna2\u0001 pif1\u0001 strain is temperature sensitive and mms sensitive. The temperature sensitivity of the dna2\u0001pif1\u0001 strain is suppressed by an additional deletion of Pol32, and subunit of DNA polymerase \u0002. Deletion of Pif1 presumably results in a reduction of long flaps requiring Dna2 for processing. In addition, Pif1 has synthetic suppressive with interaction of pif1 withlagging-strand proteins. In addition we are examining the role of Dna2 in the synthesis of telomeres. Dna2 is required for creatingthe long telomeres in the pif1 mutant. Dna2 and Exo1nucleases share redundant in OFP at the telomeres144 since dna2-2 exo1 mutants have increased amounts of single-stranded DNA at the telomere overhang. We areanalyzing the overlapping roles of Dna2 and Mre11 insynthesizing the telomere overhang. *Department of Medical Genetics and Microbiology, University of Ontario, Canada PublicationsBudd, M.E., Tong, A.H., Polaczek, P., Boone, C. and Campbell, J.L.

Saccharomyces Martin Budd, Katsuhiko Shirahige *, Judith L. Campbell The only essential function of Pol epsilon, which lies at the extreme C-terminus of Pol2, still remainsenigmatic. Our finding of the in vivo interaction between Mrc1 and Pol2 might shed light on this puzzle, because,like Pol2, Mrc1 participates in DNA replication as part ofthe replication fork, the cell cycle checkpoint as a keymediator, and sister chromatid cohesion. The interaction between Mrc1 and Pol2 was firstly identified in a global two-hybrid screen for all geneproducts in yeast that interact specifically with the Pol2 Cterminus. Both Mrc1 and the non-phosphorylatablemrc1AQ mutant interact with Pol2-C terminus. It suggeststhat this interaction is independent of phosphorylation. Wecharacterized the interactions functionally using yeastgenetic techniques - synthetic lethality and suppression. The mrc1 \u0001 and pol2 11 double mutant strain is lethal, while the mrc1AQ and pol2 11 double mutant stain is viable. The mrc1AQ mutant is defective in the checkpoint but not in DNA replication. Furthermore, the latter double mutant strain shows almost the same sensitivity to growthtemperature and drugs (HU, MMS) as a pol2 11 mutant strain. The mrc1AQ/pol2 11/rad9 \u0001 triple mutant strain is viable, but very sick. In response to DNA replicationstress, Mrc1 and Pol2 may probably be involved in thesame checkpoint pathway, that is, they are epistatic in thecheckpoint pathway, while Rad9 belongs to anotherparallel pathway. Strains transformed with the multicopyplasmid containing the MRC1 gene can grow at temperatures higher than those transformed with the emptyvector. Overexpression of MRC1 can also suppress HU sensitivity of the pol2 11 cells. This suggests that overproduction of Mrc1 can help mutant pol2 11 protein folding, which in turn may mean that they truly interactphysically in vivo . Interaction between Mrc1 and Pol2 and their interaction domain are characterized by the in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assay. Mrc1 asynchronized cells.This also suggests that Pol2 associates with Mrc1throughout the whole cell cycle, which is further confirmed by using \u0002-factor arrested (G1) and HU- arrested (S) cells.

Contribution of Trf4/5 and the nuclear exosome to genome stability through regulation of histone mRNA levels cerevisiaeClara C. Reis, Judith L. CampbellBalanced levels of histones are crucial for chromosome stability, and one major component of thiscontrol regulates histone and involved in a quality control mechanism that mediates polyadenylation and consequent degradation ofvarious RNA species by the nuclear exosome. None of theknown RNA targets, however, explains the fact that trf mutants have specific cell cycle defects consistent with arole in maintaining genome stability. Here, we investigatethe role of Trf4/5 in regulation of histone mRNA levels.We show that loss of Trf4 and Trf5, or of Rrp6, acomponent of the nuclear exosome, results in elevatedlevels of transcripts encoding DNA replication-dependent histones. Suggesting that increased histone levels account for the phenotypes of trfmutants, we find that TRF4 shows synthetic genetic interactions with genes that negativelyregulate histone levels, including RAD53. Moreover, synthetic lethality of trf4 \u0001 rad53\u0001 is rescued by reducing histone levels whereas overproduction of histones is deleterious to trfs and rrp6\u0001mutants. These results identify TRF4, TRF5, and RRP6 as new players in the regulation of histone mRNA levels in yeast. To our knowledge, the histone transcripts are the first mRNAs that are upregulated in Trf mutants. 219. Dna2 a substrate of Mec1 Barbara Fortini The Dna2 protein is a yeast helicase/nuclease that is involved in Okazaki fragment processing, repair ofX-ray- and MMS-induced DNA damage, rDNA stability,and the telomere position effect. We have shownpreviously that Dna2 exhibits an unusual subcellulardistribution for a replication protein. The bulk of Dna2 islocalized to telomeres in G1, leaves telomeres in S phaseto be found at internal chromosomal sites, and returns to telomeres in G2. In addition, upon treatment with DNA damaging agents, Dna2 is released from telomeres. Wehave also shown that damage-induced release from145 telomeres depends on the Mec1 checkpoint kinase. Further, an in vitro kinase assay demonstrates that Dna2 is an efficient substrate or damage. To ascertain whether Dna2 is anin vivo substrate of Mec1, we the putative phosphorylationsites in Dna2 alanine residues and analyzed thephenotypes of the resulting mutants. Two of these singlemutants show increased DNA damage sensitivity to avariety of DNA damaging and replication stress causingagents. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments alsoshow suggesting Mec1 phosphorylation may play arole of Dna2. Publications Budd, M.E., Reis, C.C., Smith, S., Myung, K. and Campbell, J.L.

Detmer Rotating students: Maya Garcia, Jingli Zhang Research and Laboratory Staff: Priscilla Tee Support: The work described in the following research reports has been supported by: The Arnold and Mabel Beckman FoundationDonald Bren HealthUnited Mitochondrial Disease Foundation Summary: The primary focus of our lab is to understand the role of mitochondrial dynamics in normal cellular function and human disease. Mitochondria are remarkably dynamic organelles that undergo continual cycles of fusionand fission. The equilibrium of these two opposingprocesses determines the overall morphology ofmitochondria in cells and has important consequences formitochondrial function. Our research falls into several broad areas: (1) What are the cellular and physiological functions of mitochondrial fusion and fission? (2) What is the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial membrane fusion and fission? (3) What role do mitochondrial dynamics play in human diseases? To address these issues, we use a wide range of approaches, including genetics, biochemistry, cell biology,and structural biology. Cellular and physiological functions of mitochondrial fusion and fissionA typical mammalian cell can have hundreds ofmitochondria. However, each mitochondrion is notautonomous, because fusion and fission events mix mitochondrial membranes and contents. As a result, such events have major implications for the function of themitochondrial population. We are interested inunderstanding the cellular role of mitochondrial dynamics,and how changes in mitochondrial dynamics can affect thefunction of vertebrate tissues. Much of our work focuses on proteins called mitofusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2), which are transmembraneGTPases embedded in the outer membrane ofmitochondria. These proteins are essential for fusion ofmitochondria. To understand the role of mitochondrial fusion in vertebrates, we have constructed mice deficient in either Mfn1 or Mfn2. We find that mice deficient ineither Mfn1 or Mfn2 die in mid-gestation. Mfn2 mutantembryos have a specific and severe disruption of a layer ofthe placenta called the trophoblast giant cell layer. Thesefindings indicate that mitochondrial fusion is essential forembryonic development due to a cell type-specificdependence on mitochondrial fusion. More recently, we have generated mice with conditional alleles of Mfn1 andMfn2, and analyses of these mice indicate important rolesfor mitochondrial fusion in adult tissues such as brain andskeletal muscle (Hsiuchen Chen). These studies arerelevant to our understanding of several human diseases, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathies and peripheral nerve degeneration. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Mfn1 or Mfn2 display fragmented mitochondria, a phenotype due to a severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion. Cells lackingboth Mfn1 and Mfn2 have completely fragmentedmitochondria and show no detectable mitochondrial fusionactivity. Our analysis indicates that mitochondrial fusionis important not only for maintenance of mitochondrialmorphology, but also for cell growth, mitochondrialmembrane potential, and respiration (Hsiuchen Chen). Weare also using RNA interference to disrupt the function of other proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission. Molecular mechanism of membrane fusion and fission The best understood membrane fusion proteins are viralenvelope proteins and SNARE complexes. Viral envelopeproteins, such as gp41 of HIV, reside on the lipid surfaceof viruses and mediate fusion between the viral andcellular membranes during virus entry. SNAREcomplexes mediate a wide range of membrane fusionevents between cellular membranes. In both cases, cellular and crystallographic studies have shown that the formation of helical bundles plays a critical role in bringing themerging membrane together. We would like to understandmitochondrial fusion at a similar level of resolution and todetermine whether there are common features to thesediverse forms of membrane fusion. Mitofusins are the only conserved mitochondrial outer membrane proteins involved in fusion. Therefore, itis likely that they directly mediate membrane fusion.Consistent with this idea, mitofusins are required onadjacent mitochondria to mediate fusion. In addition,mitofusins form homotypic and heterotypic complexes that are capable of tethering mitochondria. We are trying to determine how tethered mitochondria, mediated bymitofusins, proceeds to full fusion. It should be noted thatmitochondrial fusion is likely to be more complicated thanmost other intracellular membrane fusion events, becausefour lipid bilayers must be coordinately fused. Our workwith mammalian cells carrying mutant Mfn2 moleculesindicates that Mfn1 and Mfn2 cooperate closely with eachother to mediate fusion (Scott Detmer). In addition tostudies in mammalian cells, we have used yeast studies toshow that mitofusins engage in key intermolecular interactions necessary for fusion (Erik Griffin). We have used proteomic approaches in yeast cells to identify novel proteins involved in mitochondrial fusionand fission (Erik Griffin). The structures of proteinsinvolved in mitochondrial fusion and fission are beingsolved by X-ray crystallography to gain an understandingof molecular mechanism. For example, we have recently147 solved the structure of Fis1 in complex with a fragment of Mdv1 (Yan Zhang). This structure provides a basis forunderstanding assembly of the mitochondrial fissionapparatus. Mitochondrial dynamics in human disease Two inherited human diseases are caused by defects in mitochondrial dynamics. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)disease is a neurological disorder that affects the peripheralnerves. Patients with CMT experience progressiveweakness of the distal limbs and some loss of sensation. Aspecific type of CMT, termed CMT2A, is caused bymutations in Mfn2 and result from degeneration of axonsin peripheral nerves. We are currently analyzing thefunctional consequences of such disease alleles, and usingtransgenic and targeted mutagenesis approaches to developmouse models (Scott Detmer). The most common inherited form of optic neuropathy (autosomal dominant optic atrophy) is caused by mutations in OPA1. This mitochondrial protein islocalized to the intermembrane space and is essential formitochondrial fusion. Little is known about themechanism of OPA1 action. In particular, there has beenno good cell culture system to perform basic structure-function analysis of OPA1. To develop such a system, wehave collaborated with Christiane Alexander (Max-Delbr\u00fcck-Center for Molecular Medicine) to isolate mousecell lines lacking OPA1 (Hsiuchen Chen). Using these celllines, we have identified a protein that regulates the activity of OPA1 and thereby the levels of mitochondrial fusion (Zhiyin Song). Finally, an understanding of mitochondrial dynamics will be essential for understanding a largecollection of diseases termed mitochondrialencephalomyopathies. Many mitochondrialencephalomyopathies result from mutations inmitochondrial DNA diseases,tissues maintain their mitochondrial function untilpathogenic mtDNA levels exceed a critical threshold.Experiments with cell hybrids indicate that mitochondrialfusion, by enabling cooperation between mitochondria, can protect respiration even when >50% of mtDNAs are mutant. To understand the pathogenesis of mtDNAdiseases, it is critical to explore how mitochondria can befunctionally distinct and yet cooperate as a populationwithin a cell. We anticipate that our studies with micelacking mitochondrial fusion will help to shed light on thisgroup of often devastating diseases (Hsiuchen Chen). 220. Mitochondrial fusion is required for brain developmentHsiuchen Chen Mitochondrial fusion is developmentally and physiologically important. Genetic targeting of any of thethree known fusion genes, Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1, leadsto embryonic Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A)and autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA), are caused by mutations in Mfn2 and OPA1, respectively. To further explore the physiological requirements for mitochondrial fusion, we have created mice carryingconditional null alleles for both Mfn1 and Mfn2. Analysisof these mice has revealed several tissues particularly dependent on mitochondrial fusion. First, Mfn2 is required for proper cerebellar development during thepostnatal period. When Mfn2 is disrupted in cerebellarprimordia during embryogenesis, young pups displaysevere problems in balance and motility, resulting infeeding problems and death by about two weeks of age.Histologically, the mutant cerebella are much smaller thanwild-type cerebella due to apoptotic cell loss. We havetraced the primary defect in these animals to improperdevelopment of the cerebellar Purkinje cells. When Mfn2is disrupted in mature Purkinje cells (the only efferentprocesses of the cerebellum), electron transport activity is affected and the neurons degenerate. As a result, the mice develop a resting tremor and have poor coordination whilewalking, classic signs of cerebellar dysfunction. Thus,mitochondrial fusion is required in both the developmentof cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as their maintenance.Our studies provide a powerful model system to study therole of mitochondrial fusion in neurodegenerative disease,with relevance to human disorders. In addition, they showthat mitochondrial fusion is required in the central nervoussystem as well as in the peripheral motor neurons and opticnerve affected in CMT and DOA. 2221. Mitochondrial fusion and muscle function Hsiuchen ChenMany mitochondrial encephalomyopathies by many disease-related mtDNA mutations havebeen documented, the of these diseasesremains incompletely understood. In particular, little isknown about the natural history of mtDNA mutations, andwhy certain cells accumulate high levels of mutantmtDNA. Mitochondrial fusion is likely to play animportant role in modulating the inheritance of mutant mtDNA molecules during cell division, because fusion mixes contents between mitochondria, including mtDNA. To explore these issues, we have disrupted both Mfn1 and Mfn2 in skeletal muscle. Such mutant mice areseverely runted and die at around two months of age.Muscle mass is greatly reduced in these mice, andhistological analysis reveals significantly decreased musclefiber diameters. In addition, a succinate-dehydrogenase(SDH) enzymatic assay reveals greatly increased activityin all fibers. Increased SDH activity is a sign ofmitochondrial proliferation and is a hallmark of many mitochondrial diseases. Our results suggest a common link between deficiencies in mitochondrial fusion andtraditional mitochondrial diseases.148 222. Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseaseScott DetmerMitochondrial undergo continual fusion and fission, and these dynamic properties are important formitochondrial and cellular function. Interestingly, mutations in two of the known mammalian mitochondrial fusion proteins, Mfn2 and OPA1, cause neurodegenerativedisease in humans. In the case of Mfn2, over 40 mutationshave been reported that cause Charcot-Marie-Toothdisease Type2A (CMT2A), a peripheral motor neuropathythat results in distal muscle and sensory deficits. We areusing cell culture and biochemical experiments tofunctionally study these disease alleles. We have characterized the nine originally reported Mfn2 CMT2A alleles. We find that all thesealleles localize mitochondria when expressedin mouse fibroblasts. Like wild-type Mfn2, the these alleles co-immunoprecipitate with both Mfn1 and Mfn2. However, we find that the CMT2A alleles arefunctionally heterogeneous - approximately half canpromote mitochondrial fusion and tubulation in doubleMfn-null cells whereas the remaining cannot. In addition,when overexpressed, both the functional and non-functional alleles induce dramatic mitochondrialaggregation that is not observed with wild-type Mfn2.These phenotypes likely represent a conformationalchange in the disease alleles and may be related to diseaseprogression. Mfn1 and Mfn2 can cooperate in promoting mitochondrial fusion. We further find that the non-functional Mfn2 is, the non-functional Mfn2CMT2A alleles can promote tubulation in the presence ofMfn1 but not in the presence of Mfn2. These resultsprovide a testable hypothesis for the specific loss of motorand sensory axons in CMT disease. Mfn1 appears to havea protective role in masking the defect in some CMT2Aalleles, and the relative expression level of Mfn1 and Mfn2in specific tissues may be the key to the cell type specificity. 223. Mouse models of Charc ot-Maria-Tooth Disease Type 2AScott Detmer We have established both transgenic and knock- in mouse models of CMT2A. We have generated multipletransgenic lines of mice expressing mutant Mfn2 under amotor neuron-specific promoter and have confirmedlocalized transgene expression. Interestingly, one of theselines exhibits a striking phenotype: affected mice are unable to dorsi-flex their hindpaws and subsequently display a gait defect characterized by dragging of thehindlimbs during walking. Over time this leads todeformities in the hindlimbs. This phenotype isremarkably similar to the symptoms of CMT2A patients.Such patients have distal limb weakness, which ismanifested by an inability to dorsi-flex the foot, leading to\"foot drop\" during walking. Eventually this leads to foot deformities such as hammertoe caused by muscleimbalance. In a second approach, we have generated knock- in mutations corresponding to two of the Mfn2 mutantalleles. Transmission and expression of the knock-in alleles have been confirmed. In the heterozygous state neither allele manifests a behavioral phenotype up to sixmonths of age; we will continue to age and monitor theseanimals. However, for one of the alleles, bothhomozygous mutant animals and animals with the mutantallele over a Mfn2 null allele develop an unsteady gait, areseverely runted and die by four weeks of age. Bypinpointing the physiological defects in these animals, wewill also gain clues to more subtle defects in theheterozygous animals. We are characterizing bothtransgenic and knock-in and neuronal mitochondrial morphology. We expect these to be valuable models for the study of CMT disease progression. 224. Structural and functional studies of the fission apparatus of mitochondriaYan ZhangMitochondrial formation of normal Dnm1p puncta requires the mitochondrial outer membrane anchor protein Fis1p. The core domain of Fis1 consists of a six \u0001-helical bundle composed of two tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR). Previous studies in our lab indicated that Fis1p mediates the mitochondrial localization of Dnm1p through its interactions with two adaptor proteins, Mdv1p or Caf4p. Both Mdv1p andCaf4p can independently recruit Dnm1p, but complexesrecruited by Mdv1p appear to be more active for fission. To elucidate the mechanism of Dnm1p recruitment to mitochondria, we are studying theinteractions between Fis1p and the adaptor proteins Mdv1pand Caf4p biochemically and structurally. We haveestablished a system in E. coli to co-express the cytosolic portion of Fis1p with a His-tagged interacting fragment ofMdv1p or Caf4p. Purification of the His-tagged fragmentleads to co-purification of Fis1p. The complexes of Fis1p/Mdv1p and Fis1p/Caf4p have been purified and crystallized. The structure of the Fis1p/Mdv1p complexhas been solved by molecular replacement using thestructure of Fis1p as a model. The structure reveals that a stretch of residues on Mdv1p forms an \u0001 helix that binds in a novel mode to the TPR domains on Fis1p. Mutational studies of critical Mdv1 residues confirm the in vivo relevance of this binding mode. Meanwhile, a native dataset of the Fis1p/Caf4p complex has been collected butphasing using molecular replacement with the structure ofFis1p as a model has failed. Heavy metal derivatives arebeing screened for phasing. These structural studies will149 be essential for understanding assembly of the mitochondrial fission apparatus. 225. Domain interactions within Fzo1 oligomers for mitochondrial fusionErik Griffin Mitofusins are essential for the of mitochondria. These mitochondrial outermembrane proteins contain a GTPase domain and two orthree regions with hydrophobic heptad repeats, but little isknown about how these domains interact to mediatemitochondrial fusion. To address this issue, we haveanalyzed the yeast mitofusin Fzo1p and find that mutationof any of the three-heptad repeat regions (HRN, HR1, andHR2) leads to a null allele. Specific pairs of null allelesshow robust complementation, indicating that functionaldomains need not exist on the same molecule.Biochemical analysis indicates that this complementation is due to Fzo1p oligomerization mediated by multiple domain interactions. Moreover, we find that two non-overlapping protein fragments, one consisting ofHRN/GTPase and the other consisting of HR1/HR2, canform a complex that reconstitutes Fzo1p fusion activity.Each of the null alleles disrupts the interaction of these twofragments, suggesting that we have identified a keyinteraction involving the GTPase domain and heptadrepeats essential for fusion. 226. Regulation of mitochondrial fusion Zhiyin Zhang To identify molecules involved in control of mitochondrial fusion, we used tandem affinity purificationof Mfn1 and Mfn2 from mouse cells to identify mitofusin-associated proteins by mass spectrometry. Such associatedproteins were screened by RNAi knockdown to identifythose involved in mitochondrial fusion. Remarkably, wefound a protein that is essential both for mitochondrialfusion and also for regulating the proteolytic processing ofOPA1. OPA1 is proteolytically processed to a long andshort isoform. In yeast cells, both forms are necessary formitochondrial fusion, but their functions in mammalian cells are poorly understood. We are currently using OPA1-null cells to explore how the processing of OPA1 isregulated to control its fusion activity. Publications Chan, D.C.

Cell Biol. 170:237-248.150 Associate Professor Smith Support: The work described in the following research reports has been supported by: Beckman InstituteGordon and Betty Moore FoundationHoward Hughes Medical InstituteNational Institutes of Health Summary: The Deshaies lab works on two basic biological processes: Control of cell division, andregulation of cell function by attachment of ubiquitin orubiquitin-like proteins to target polypeptides. We areparticularly interested in how attachment of ubiquitin toproteins enables their degradation, and how proteindegradation via this mechanism is used to regulate celldivision. Defective control of cell division can result in disease, as when unrestrained cell proliferation leads tocancer. Defects of the ubiquitin system can also lead to cancer, as well as neurodegenerative diseases. An understanding of how the cell division machinery and theubiquitin system operate will thus, provide insight intobasic cellular processes essential to the life of eukaryoticcells, and may suggest cures for diseases that affectmillions of people. We are using biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches in baker's yeast and mammalian cells toinvestigate cell proliferation and the ubiquitin system. Ourlong-term goal is to understand how these processes workand how they are controlled. Baker's yeast is an excellentorganism for basic cell biological studies because it is easy to work with, and many studies have confirmed that yeast and animal cells largely use the same proteins to regulatebasic cellular processes. Below, I summarize in more detail the four major areas of investigation in the lab, and provide thumbnaildescriptions of all current projects. SCF ubiquitin ligases: Mechanism, regulation, and physiologyCellular proteins are marked for degradation by attachmentof the polypeptide ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is attached proximity so that ubiquitin from the E2 to substrate. Specificity andregulation of ubiquitination are typically imparted by E3s,which are the most diverse components of the system. Once ubiquitin is attached to a substrate, the reaction caneither terminate (in which case the ubiquitin serves as aregulatory signal to modulate protein function orlocalization) or continue, leading to the assembly of amultiubiquitin chain. A chain of four ubiquitins suffices to specify destruction of the substrate by the proteasome. Mechanism of action of SCF ligases: In 1999, we and others reported that RING domains underlie ubiquitinligase activity (Seol et al., 1999). This discovery revealed the largest class of ubiquitin ligases, with up to 385members. The progenitor of SCF (which we in a subfamily of multisubunit cullin-RING ligases that may number as 300-350members, due to combinatorial mixing of subunits. Thus,there may be as many as 700 distinct RING ligasecomplexes, which would make it the largest-known family of enzymes in human cells (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005). As befits such a large family, the cullin-RING ligaseshave been implicated in a dazzling array of cellular andorganismal processes, ranging from circadian rhythms tosulfur assimilation. However, despite the biologicalimport of these enzymes, the mechanism of how they workremains unknown. Over the past few years, we have made substantial progress towards understanding how SCFenzymes work. Our key innovation was to develop areconstituted system in which a physiological substrate (budding yeast Cdk inhibitor Sic1 assembled into is ubiquitinated by SCF anddegraded by the proteasome - work that was carried out byRenny Feldman, Craig Correll, and Rati Verma (Feldmanet substrates bearing single ubiquitinacceptor lysines, and used these substrates to characterizethe impact of ubiquitin chain position on substraterecognition and degradation by the proteasome (Petroskiand Deshaies, 2003). We believe that the system that we have developed is the best available for studying biochemical mechanisms of ubiquitination, because our substrate is multiubiquitinated and degraded at rates that approachthose that must occur in vivo , and the nature of the reaction products is defined due to the substrate having only asingle lysine acceptor. I now perceive a terrificopportunity to exploit our in vitro systems to address basic questions that are of central importance to understandingthe mechanisms that underlie the operation of theubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). For example, howdoes a RING domain activate ubiquitin transfer fromubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to substrate? What is the basis for the synthesis of the lysine 48-linked ubiquitin chains that signal proteolysis? How is processiveubiquitination of Sic1 achieved, and how does it relate tothe dynamics of substrate and Cdc34 (E2) association withSCF? How does ubiquitin transfer occur across an ~50 \u00c5gap that is thought to exist between the substrate and E2enzyme bound to SCF? None of these questions are151 resolved for any RING E3, and thus, illuminating the answers will establish paradigms that inform ourunderstanding of how hundreds of ubiquitin ligases work.The insights that emerge from this effort may also provideclues to the development of drugs that modulate theactivity of RING-based ligases. Regulation of SCF that SCF ubiquitin ligases are constitutively active, and substrate turnover is regulated byphosphorylation of the substrate. Subsequently, it wasshown that the Cul1 subunit of SCF is modified ubiquitin-like protein thus raising thepossibility that SCF might be regulated post-translationally. In 2001, two students from the lab,Svetlana Lyapina and Greg Cope, reported that a poorlyunderstood protein complex known as COP9 Signalosome(CSN) binds SCF in animal cells, and promotes from Cul1 via a tightly-associated Nedd8 isopeptidase activity (Lyapina et al., 2001). This was the first biochemical function ascribed to CSN, andopened the door to the study of SCF regulation byreversible cycles of 'neddylation.' Subsequently, GregCope discovered that the Csn5 harbors a motif thatwe named 'JAMM' (for JAb1/Mpn domainMetalloenzyme) (Cope et al ., 2002). We predicted that JAMM comprises a novel metalloprotease active site.Later, Xavier Ambroggio, who was a joint student Rees in Chemistry, substantiated this prediction byemploying X-ray crystallography to show that the conserved residues of the JAMM motif coordinate a zinc ion in an active site-like cleft of the protein AF2198 fromArchaeglobulus fulgidis (Ambroggio et al., 2004) . We continue to investigate the regulation of SCF by CSN. Wehope to understand how CSN itself is controlled, and whatrole CSN plays in sustaining active SCF complexes andsculpting the repertoire of SCF complexes in a cell. Mechanism of action and regulation of the 26S proteasomeOnce substrates are ubiquitinated proteasome. The 26S proteasome is a large protein machine that comprises two major subcomplexes: The 20S 'core' proteasome and the 19Sregulatory 'cap.' The 20S core forms a cylindrical structurethat houses the protease active sites of the proteasome.Each end of the 20S cylinder is decorated by a 19S cap.The 19S cap can be further subdivided into the 'lid' and the'base.' The base contains six ATPases that are thought toform a ring that abuts the end of the 20S cylinder. The lid,in turn, sits upon the base. The base is thought to controlaccess of substrates into the 20S proteolytic chamber,whereas the lid confers ubiquitin-dependence. The 26S proteasome degrades proteins that are linked to a chain of at least four ubiquitins. The tetraubiquitin chain mediatesbinding of the attached substrate to the proteasome, afterwhich it is disengaged from bound partners, unfolded,deubiquitinated, and translocated into the proteolyticchamber of the proteasome where the denuded isdegraded.A fully reconstituted system to study Sic1 degradation: Pre-2000, all in vitro studies of protein degradation by the UPS relied either on crude systems such as Xenopus or reticulocyte extracts, or non-natural substrates. No assay was available to harness the power ofyeast molecular genetics to enable dissection of the mechanism-of-action of the proteasome. We thus, developed a system wherein ubiquitinated Sic1 generatedin vitro with recombinant SCF Cdc4 is affinity- purified yeast proteasomes (Verma al ., 2001). Remarkably, purified proteasomes can extractubiquitinated Sic1 from complexes with S phase cyclin-Cdk, degrade the Sic1 and release active S phase cyclin-Cdk protein kinase. This result emphasized that theproteasome has the intrinsic ability to disassemble proteincomplexes to selectively degrade ubiquitinated substrates,and set the stage for our subsequent studies on substratetargeting and deubiquitination. Role of deubiquitination in the degradation of Sic1: In the course of characterizing the degradation of ubiquitinated Sic1, we noticed that when 20S protease inhibitor was present, ubiquitinated deubiquitinated species (Vermaet al ., 2002). Fortuitously, at about the same time as this we observed that the CSN - which is related to the lidsubcomplex of the proteasome 19S cap from the subunit ofSCF. Spurred this confluence of observations, wedemonstrated that the Rpn11 subunit of the proteasome lid contains a putative JAMM metalloprotease active site analogous to that of Csn5, and this motif is essential forthe deubiquitination of Sic1 in vitro and the degradation of multiple UPS substrates in vivo . Multiubiquitin chain receptors target substrate to the proteasome: Although it has long been clear that a multiubiquitin chain targets an appended substrate to theproteasome for degradation, the mechanism of targetinghas remained controversial. Genetic studies in yeast havesuggested a potential role for and Rpn10. Incontrast, biochemical studies in mammalian have emphasized a role for the proteasome ATPase Rpt5 as a multiubiquitin chain receptor, and have suggested thatproteins such as Rad23 prevent premature metabolism ofsubstrate-linked ubiquitin chains. We reasoned that ourreconstituted system would enable us to address thisfundamental question from a functional, mechanisticperspective. We first demonstrated using mutantproteasomes and add-back experiments that Rad23 andRpn10 play a direct in targeting ubiquitinated Sic1 tothe proteasome for degradation (Verma et al., 2004a). We then went on to show that the multiubiquitin chain receptor activities of Rad23 and Rpn10 play a redundant role in sustaining turnover of Sic1 in vivo . Surprisingly, individual deletion of these and other receptor proteins ledto the accumulation of different UPS substrates, suggestingthat the receptors define a layer of specificity that residesdownstream of the E3s and upstream of the proteasome.This hypothesis opens up a host of interesting questions152 about how specificity is achieved in the targeting step, and what its biological purpose is. We plan to address thesekey questions over the next several years using acombination of biochemical, molecular genetic, andproteomic approaches. In a parallel effort, we demonstrated that the substrate-targeting step can be blocked by a small molecule that emerged from a chemical genetic screenconducted in the lab of our collaborator, Dr. Randy King.We demonstrated that this compound, which we named'ubistatin A,' binds to the ubiquitin chain in the sameintersubunit cleft that is normally bound by themultiubiquitin chain receptors (Verma et al ., 2004b). We believe that ubistatins will be useful tools for studies onthe UPS. Role of Cdc48 in targeting and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins: R ecently, we have become intrigued by a poorly understood protein, Cdc48, that, like the ubiquitin chain receptors, operates downstream of ubiquitin ligases to promote degradation of ubiquitinatedproteins by the proteasome. The role of Cdc48 in proteinturnover was originally thought to be confined to pullingmalfolded secretory proteins through the endoplasmicreticulum membrane so that they can be degraded by theproteasome. However, several lines of evidence hint at afar broader role. Interestingly, there may be as many asseven distinct Cdc48 complexes in budding yeast, andunpublished data from my lab points to the existence of~15 distinct Cdc48 complexes in human cells (see abstract by G. Alexandru). Why all of this complexity? It is difficult to even begin to answer this question, because weknow so little about Cdc48's function apart from its role intranslocation across the ER membrane. Whatever Cdc48is doing, it appears to be a fundamental component of theUPS, and thus, understanding how it works is important.We plan to attack this problem by first identifyingsubstrates whose degradation depends on particular Cdc48complexes by employing the mass spec-based proteomicstechnology discussed below (see abstract by J. Graumann).We will then reconstitute the degradation of thesesubstrates using defined components. The objective will be to develop a reconstituted system in which turnover of the substrate is dependent upon Cdc48. We will then usethis system to establish the mechanism-of-action of Cdc48.Armed with this information, we will be in a position toinitiate investigations on how ubiquitin receptors andCdc48 complexes collaborate to enable degradation ofubiquitinated substrates. Given the diversity of receptorsthat guide ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome and thediversity of Cdc48 complexes that appear to act in concertwith these receptors, there is clearly much about thetargeting and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins that we do not understand, and thus, this topic may be fertile ground for making unexpected discoveries. Proteomics The Yates laboratory at Scripps has developed a methoddubbed, \"multidimensional protein identificationtechnology\" (MudPIT). In this method, a complex mixtureof proteins is digested with protease and the resulting peptides are fractionated by two-dimensionalchromatography on a column that is in-line with theelectrospray interface of a mass spectrometer. JohannesGraumann and Thibault Mayor have been applyingMudPIT to the study of ubiquitination in yeast. As an example of this approach, we have used subtractive comparisons of samples from wild-type and mutant cells toidentify the ubiquitinated polypeptides that accumulatewhen the Rpn10 multiubiquitin chain receptor is absent(see abstract by T. Mayor). During the next few years, weplan to more fully integrate multidimensional massspectrometry into ongoing projects in the lab. I believethat this technology will allow us to ask questions that wehave never been able to ask before, and will also provideus with a new perspective. Our initial focus will be tomarry our approach with quantification methods tosystematically identify proteins that are targets of the various multiubiquitin chain receptors encoded in the yeast genome. By identifying the set of substrates whoseabundance is altered when a particular ubiquitin pathwaycomponent is mutated or blocked by the action of a drug,we can gain insight into enzyme-substrate relationships,which in turn may yield insights into the mechanisms thatunderlie specificity. Moreover, knowledge of thesubstrates affected can provide clues to the phenotypes thatmay occur upon inactivation of a particular component.Finally, the ability to quantify substrate accumulation mayenable us to see subtle defects, such as those that occur when one member of a redundant pair of enzymes is mutated. Functions of the RENT complex in cell cycle control and nucleolar biogenesisSeveral years ago, a graduate student, Wenying Shou,discovered the RENT complex, and proposed that themitotic exit network (MEN) specifies the exit from mitosisin budding yeast by promoting disassembly of RENT(Shou et al., 1999). RENT is comprised of the nucleolar anchor protein Net1, the cell cycle regulatory proteinphosphatase Cdc14 and the chromatin silencing protein Sir2. Cdc14 is required for the exit from mitosis, which it promotes by dephosphorylating (and thereby activating)proteins that mediate the inactivation of cyclin/CDKactivity at the end of mitosis. Throughout the cell cycle,Cdc14 is confined to the nucleolus through its interactionwith Net1. At the end of mitosis, trigger the exit from mitosis. This hypothesis forhow the exit from mitosis is controlled in budding yeast was dubbed 'RENT control' by Shou, et al ., 1999. Over the past few years, it has become apparent that RENT isdisassembled by a two-step mechanism. In earlyanaphase, Cdc14 is released from Net1 through novelactivity of Separase is activateschromosome segregation thecohesin protein chromatids together.153 Throughout interphase and early mitosis, separase activity is repressed by a tightly bound inhibitor, securin. At themetaphase-anaphase boundary, securin is abruptlydegraded, thereby liberating separase to cleave cohesin andinitiate chromosome segregation. In addition to being aprotease, separase has a second activity that promotes the phosphorylation of Net1 by cyclin B-Cdk. A graduate student in the lab, Ramzi Azzam, had identified thisphosphorylation and demonstrated that it induces thedissociation of Cdc14 from Net1 (Azzam et al ., 2004). Thus, the action of separase links initiation of the exit frommitosis with the initiation of chromosome segregation. Inlate anaphase the MEN serves to sustain Cdc14 releasesuch that its substrates are dephosphorylated and the cellexits mitosis. Our current goal is to understand how theterminal signaling component of the MEN, the proteinkinase Dbf2, mediates the sustained release of Cdc14 fromthe nucleolus, thereby triggering exit from mitosis.

AlexandruThe 97 kDa valosin-containing protein (p97 is a type II AAA (ATPase a ssociated with a variety of activities) ATPase. AAA-ATPases are highly conserved from archaebacteria to mammals. p97 plays a role in seemingly unrelated cellular activities, such asmembrane fusion, endoplasmic reticulum-associateddegradation (ERAD) and cell cycle regulation. All ofthese functions involve recognition of ubiquitinatedprotein substrates and, at least in some cases, theirsubsequent degradation by the proteasome. In its activeform, p97 forms homohexameric barrel structures in whichthe N-termini are free to bind specific co-factors. Thus,p97 in complex with p47 is thought to regulate membrane fusion, while p97/Npl4/Ufd1 complexes are mainly required for ERAD. In an attempt to further understandthe molecular basis of p97's diverse functions we haveanalyzed p97 immunoprecipitates from fornew p97 co-factors. This analysis revealed a whole groupof previously unidentified p97-binding partners, all sharinga domain structure similar at least in part to p47. Two ofthem have been linked to human diseases, such as atopicdermatitis and alveolar soft part sarcoma. However, thebiological function for most of these proteins is largely unknown. Comparative analysis of immunoprecipitates from human cells transfected with a Flag-tagged version ofeach of the newly identified co-factors revealed that someof them can bind ubiquitinated proteins ERAD be investigated by154 checking the effect of their siRNA depletion on the degradation of various ERAD model substrates. 228. Regulation of SCF ubiquitin ligase activity Ethan Emberley Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation has emerged as a pivotal process in many areas of cell biology.Members of the superfamily of multi-subunit CRL(cullin- RING ligase) ubiquitin enzymes transfer proteins destined fordegradation by the 26S proteosome. Despite impressiveadvancements in our CRLs, including theprototypical CRL, SCF, many fundamental questionsremain about the mechanism of action and regulation ofthese key enzymes. We have begun to study whethersubstrate binding to its respective substrate receptorsubunit might control CRL activity. We propose thatsubstrate binding either positively regulates the attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to the cullin subunit of CRLs the COP9 signalosome. Neddylation ofcullin is necessary for activity of SCF and other CRLs, andprovides an important mechanism by which these enzymesmay be regulated. Our results suggest that substratebinding promotes neddylation of the associated cullinmolecule, which may serve as a feedback mechanism thatlinks the activity of a CRL to the level of availablesubstrate for that particular enzyme. 229. Role of ubiquitination in protein substrates to the 26S proteasome Nazli GhaboosiThe ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway by the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme. E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and issubsequently attached to the substrate with the aid of an E3ubiquitin ligase. The multi-ubiquitinated substrate is thentargeted for destruction by the 26S proteasome through apoorly understood mechanism. While the list of knownE2s, E3s, and substrates is steadily growing, there is only one E1 gene in all somatic eukaryotic cell types. At the apex of this intricate network, E1 offers a uniqueperspective from which to address the many unansweredquestions regarding the physiological roles of ubiquitinconjugation. We created a temperature-sensitive mutant of the essential yeast E1 gene, UBA1, using random PCR mutagenesis . The resulting mutant strain, uba1 204 , allows us to conditionally disrupt the entire downstreamubiquitination pathway. At the restrictive temperature,mutant cells exhibit rapid loss of all detectable ubiquitin- protein conjugates, as well as stabilization of diverse ubiquitin pathway substrates. These cells also have thehallmarks of other ubiquitin pathway mutants, such as cellcycle arrest and sensitivity to cellular stress. Using this novel yeast mutant, we are examining the effect that ubiquitin activation has on substraterecognition and interaction of substrate receptors with theproteasome. Recent work in the lab showed thatmultiubiquitin chain-binding proteins (MCBPs) such asRad23, Dsk2, and toselectively recruit substrates to the proteasome (Verma et al., 2004). While the ubiquitin activation and conjugation defects in uba1 204 do not affect proteasome assembly or activity, we have shown that they do influence how theproteasome interacts with some MCBPs. Our findingsindicate the activatestargeting of MCBPs to the proteasome. Reference Verma et al. (2004) Cell 118(1):99-110. 230. Using MudPIT to characterize components of the proteasome pathway in yeastJohannes GraumannMultidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) is a method developed by thelaboratory of John Yates at Scripps to analyze complexprotein mixtures. In MudPIT, a sample is digested withprotease and the resulting peptides are separated on amultidimensional capillary column that is in-line with theelectorspray interface of an ion trap mass spectrometer 1. As a first test of the utility of MudPIT for discoveryapplications in cell biology, we applied this technology tothe proteomic characterization of multiple components of acellular reaction pathway - i.e., pathway proteomics 2. Recent work in the lab3 has revealed a novel layer of substrate specificity in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Ubiquitinated proteins bind specific receptor proteins,which help guide the substrate to the proteasome forproteolysis. By performing MudPIT analysis ofimmunoprecipitated proteasomes from wild-type cells andmutants lacking specific substrate receptor proteins, wehope to shed light on the mechanism by which differentsubstrates are sorted to different receptors.

Mo lecular mechanism of multiubiquitin chain synthesis by Cdc34Gary KleigerCdc34 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is an essential component of the Ubiquitin ProteasomeSystem (UPS). It functions by catalyzing the formation ofpolyubiquitin chains on protein substrates destined fordegradation the ubiquitin ligase SCF, which is also an essential component of the UPS. Cdc34 is a processive enzyme that shows at least 10-fold greater activity for producing K48-linked poly- ubiquitin chains than all other ubiquitin chain linkagescombined. One potential explanation for this processivityis that Cdc34 contains a ubiquitin-binding site on itssurface that places K48 near the active site. To test this155 hypothesis, we have used molecular docking simulations to generate a model of the Cdc34-ubiquitin complex.From this model, residues at the intermolecular interfacewere chosen such that mutations would disrupt theinteraction. Several biophysical assays are beingemployed to both measure the binding affinity and confirm the orientations of Cdc34 and ubiquitin in the complex, including surface plasmon resonance, NMR and chemicalcross-linking. If the model is correct, mutation of residuesat the intermolecular interface will reduce or eliminateubiquitin binding. Mutations that have an effect onubiquitin binding will be tested for Cdc34 function usingspecific Cdc34 activity assays. Detailed molecular analysis of the Ubc7 (Cdc34 and Ubc7 are closely related both in function and instructure) active site for residues involved in the catalysisof isopeptide bond formation identified a conservedhistidine found in all Cdc34 and Cdc34-like amino acid sequences. We hypothesized that this residue is involved in either stabilization of the transition state complex ordeprotonation of the incoming epsilon amino group on thelysyl side chain that attacks the donor ubiquitinthioesterified to Cdc34. Mutation of this residue to alanineresulted in a defect in a Sic1 ubiquitination assay. Thismutant will be further characterized to determine its role inCdc34 catalysis. 232. The roles of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in transcription Rusty Lipford The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays numerous diverse roles in the regulation of transcription.We are studying the impact of the UPS on the function ofyeast transcriptional activators, like Gcn4 and Gal4, whichare targeted for and degradation. Gcn4 established that this activator of aminoacid biosynthesis genes is a target for SCF-mediatedubiquitination and proteolysis. In addition, these studiesilluminated a role in Gcn4 ubiquitination for the cyclin-dependent kinase, Srb10, a component of the mediatorcomplex of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. These findings suggest that the transcription machinery and, therefore, the transcription process are coupled to turnoverof the activator. To characterize further this coupling wehave determined that Srb10-dependent phosphorylationand subsequent ubiquitination and proteolysis of Gcn4require promoter association transcriptional activationfunction. In addition multiple transcription initiationmutants disrupt phosphorylation and turnover of Gcn4. On the other side of the coupling between transcription and turnover, we have now demonstrated thatinhibition of the UPS at any step (e.g., ubiquitin expression, E2 function, E3 function, or proteasome function) reduces the transcriptional activity of Gcn4 andGal4. In fact, compromised UPS function appears toprevent the association of RNA polymerase II with targetgenes despite the accumulation of excess activator at theirpromoters. In addition, the transcriptional activity ofstable versions of Gcn4 that lack CDK phosphorylation islargely insensitive to UPS impairment. These findings suggest that CDK-phosphorylation of Gcn4 creates arequirement for subsequent turnover to promote normallevels of transcriptional activation. We call this mode ofactivator regulation, where turnover is required to fullystimulate a reaction, \"activation by destruction.\" Such a mode appears to be a common regulatory motif involved in numerous normal and disease-related cellular processes. 233. Prof iling of ubiquitylated proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry to study theUPSThibault MayorUbiquitylation is one of the most common posttranslational modifications in eukaryotic cells and amajor goal in proteomics is to catalog these modificationsand understand their role. A classical function ofubiquitylation is to target substrates for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here, we employ a method in which affinity-purified ubiquitin conjugatesarising from experimentally perturbed and referencecultures of Saccharomyces differentiated by proteins that accumulated orbecame de-enriched in response to a particular treatment.By adding to one of the two cell populations a proteasomalinhibitory drug, we identified over 280 proteins that specifically accumulated in treated cells, hence are UPS substrates. We extended our analysis to mutants of theRpn10 UPS-delivery pathway. Rpn10 is a proteasomereceptor protein that specifically promotes the degradationof some ubiquitylated substrates. To what extent Rpn10 isinvolved in targeting of UPS substrates was not known.We, therefore, compared wild-type vs. rpn10\u0001 cells - using 14N and 15N labeling- and observed an elevated accumulation of ubiquitylated forms of ~40% of theproteasomal substrates. We then further analyzed Rpn10function by selectively deleting its ubiquitin-binding UIMdomain and only as many as one-third of proteins accumulated. To our knowledge, these represent the first physiological UPS substrates that have been shown to beaffected by loss of the UIM domain. This also confirmsthat the dominant function of Rpn10 is provided by itsVWA domain. This approach illustrates the feasibility ofsystems-level quantitative analysis of enzyme-substratenetworks in the UPS that can be now used for identifyingtargets of specific ubiquitin ligases and DUB enzymes. 234. Regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc14 Dane Mohl Our work hopes to illuminate the mechanisms that monitor the duplication of the genome, and linkcompletion of chromosome segregation to the initiation ofcell division. In my research I have used the model yeastsystem S. cerevisiae to look more closely at the regulation of a key cell cycle phosphatase, Cdc14. Our work hasdemonstrated that a protein complex called Dbf2/Mob1,156 that becomes active when each of the two new nuclei are segregated to opposite compartments of a pre-divisionalcell, regulates a Cdc14 phosphatase complexed with Net1pthereby linking genome duplication to cytokinesis. The aim of my project has been the identification ofcis-acting sequences within Cdc14 and its inhibitor Net1p that are required for properly regulating the stability of this complex in late mitosis. We have also beensearching for the transacting factors that act upon keyregulatory sequences in both proteins. Live cell imagingand GFP fluorescence localization led us to conclude that asmall portion of Cdc14-GFP visited the daughter boundspindle pole bodies of anaphase cells, and could therefore,be a direct substrate of Dbf2/Mob1. 235. Targeting cancer-promoting proteins for ubiquitination and degradationAgustin Rodriguez We are developing a new approach to cancer therapy that exploits the ubiquitin-dependent proteolyticsystem of eukaryotic cells. This approach employs cell-permeable molecules bind to the substrate-docking siteof an ubiquitin ligase. Covalently linking such a moleculeto compounds that bind to a desired target protein yields aheterobifunctional compound that we refer to as a ProTac(Proteolysis Ta rgeting C himeric Pharmaceuticals ). Protacs can be used, in theory, to trigger the destruction of anyprotein for which there exists a small, cell-permeableligand. As \"proof of principle,\" we designed a ProTac that contains a peptide that binds with high affinity to the substrate-docking domain of the ubiquitin ligase SCF \u0001-TRCP. We then chemically linked this peptide to the small molecule ovalicin, which binds covalently and specifically to the cellular enzyme methionine aminopeptidase-2 SCF\u0001-TRCP, and degradation1. To determine whether ProTacs could different to the SCF\u0001-TRCP ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination through non-covalent interactions, we generated ProTacs containing the same ligase-bindingpeptide linked to either estradiol or testosterone. Both theestrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) havebeen shown to enhance growth of breast and prostate cancer, respectively. We demonstrated that Protacs containing estradiol or dihydroxytestosterone can triggerthe degradation of ER and AR, respectively 2. Making a cell-permeable ProTac was the next step to inducedegradation of a target in living cells. The latest-generation ProTaCs are based on a hydroxyproline-containing peptide from HIF-1 that binds to the These new ProTaCs based onthe HIF-1 peptide induced the degradation of AR and ERin tissue culture cells 3. Induced degradation of ER arrested cell proliferation of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cellsas a consequence of down regulation of ER signaling. On the other hand, breast cancer cell lines that do not express ER and are not dependent upon ER signaling forproliferation were not affected by treatment with ProTaCs.We are now focusing on developing ProTacs into effective drugs for cancer treatment in vivo .

Mechanism of ubiquitin chain assembly by SCF by ubiquitination mediated by and extensive superfamily of cullin-RING ligases(CRLs). CRLs plays a central role in various cellularprocesses. We are utilizing the human SCF complex tounderstand how the dynamics of substrate and E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme) association with E3 regulate the specificity and the processivity ofubiquitination. These studies will aid in establishing howSCF distinguishes substrates from non-substrates andprovide insight into how SCF ligases achieve specificity in vivo. In addition, we are also examining how covalent modification of CRLs by Nedd8 affects the kinetics ofsubstrate ubiquitination. 237. for covalent attachment of amultiubiquitin chain on acceptor Ubiquitinatedproteins are then recruited to the 26S proteasome, wherethey are destroyed. We have recently shown that themultiubiquitin chain-binding proteins (MCBPs) Rad23 andRpn10 function as receptors to recruit substrates to theproteasome *. Under physiological conditions, the receptors display selectivity in substrate targeting, eventhough all substrates presumably contain the sameuniversal targeting signal-a tetraubiquitin chain. We are currently investigating the molecular basis of this selectivity. In addition, we are also investigating specificputative receptor pathways, namely those involvingCdc48. Reference *Verma et al.

Baxter FellowshipEllison Medical Research FoundationGordon Ross FellowshipNational Institutes Health, USPHS Summary: In eukaryotic cells, the cyclin-dependentkinases (Cdks) control the progression of the cell cycle byregulating the accurate replication of the genome duringS-phase and the faithful segregation of the chromosomes atmitosis (M-phase). The entry into these phases of the cellcycle is controlled by Cdks called S-phase promotingfactor (SPF) and M-phase promoting factor (MPF). of these Cdks must be controlled both temporallyand spatially in a very stringent manner. This strictregulation is imparted by a number of checkpointmechanisms. For example, cells containing unreplicatedDNA cannot enter mitosis due to the mobilization of thereplication checkpoint. The Dunphy laboratory is engagedin the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlyingthe regulation of SPF and MPF during the cell cycle. Mostof these experiments are conducted with Xenopus egg extracts, a system in which the entire cell cycle can bereconstituted in vitro . The first member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family described is M-phase promoting factor(MPF), which contains the Cdc2 protein kinase and aregulatory subunit known as cyclin B. Since theidentification of the molecular components of MPF, therehas been rapid and extensive progress in unraveling thebiochemistry of mitotic initiation. It is now wellestablished that MPF acts by phosphorylating a myriad ofstructural and regulatory proteins that are involved directlyin mitotic processes such as nuclear membranedisintegration, chromosome condensation, and mitoticspindle assembly. An ongoing challenge to the cell cyclefield is the elucidation of how these phosphorylationreactions regulate the structural and functional propertiesof the various targets of MPF. We have been most interested in how the cyclin- dependent protein kinases are regulated during the cellcycle. The principal focus of our laboratory has been onthe regulatory mechanisms that govern the activation ofMPF at the G2/M transition. Some immediate and long-term issues that we are tackling include: (1) What controlsthe timing of MPF activation so that it occurs at a definedinterval following the completion of DNA replication; (2)How do various checkpoint or feedback controls influencethe Cdc2/cyclin B complex; and, (3) What are themolecular differences between the simple biphasic cellcycle found in early embryonic cells and the more complexcell cycles that arise later in development? More recently, we have been able to study at the molecular level some of the key events leading to theinitiation of DNA replication at the G1/S transition. Theseevents involve a cooperative interaction between theOrigin Recognition Complex (ORC), the Cdc6 protein, andmembers of the Mcm family. These studies mayultimately help us understand how S-phase and M-phaseare integrated with one another. In principle, the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases such as MPF could occur at any of several levels,including synthesis of the cyclin protein, associationbetween the Cdc2 and cyclin proteins, or posttranslationalmodification of the Cdc2/cyclin complex. Theposttranslational regulation of the Cdc2/cyclin complex isparticularly important, even in early embryonic cells thatmanifest the simplest cell cycle programs. In recent years,many of the elaborate details of this Cdc2 modificationprocess have been defined. For example, the binding ofcyclin results in three phosphorylations of Cdc2: one atthreonine 161 that is required twodominantly inhibitory phosphorylations at threonine 14and tyrosine 15. A variety genetic and biochemicalexperiments have established that the inhibitory tyrosinephosphorylation of Cdc2 is an especially importantmechanism of cell cycle regulation. As described ingreater detail below, there is now strong evidence that thedecision to enter mitosis involves considerably more thanthe tyrosine Cdc2. understanding controls the phosphotyrosine content of Cdc2 willprovide a firm foundation for understanding other facets ofmitotic regulation. Our laboratory has made substantial contributions to understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling theactivation of the Cdc2 protein. For our studies, we utilizecell-free extracts from Xenopus eggs. Due to pioneering work in a number of the laboratories, it is now possible tore-create essentially all of the events of the cell cycle inthese extracts. Consequently, it is feasible to study themolecular mechanisms of Cdc2 regulation in intricatedetail with this experimental system. To facilitate thesestudies, we make extensive use of recombinant DNAtechnology to overproduce cell cycle proteins in eitherbacteria or baculovirus-infected insect cells. Moreover, inconjunction with our biochemical studies, we are takingadvantage of the fission yeast system to exploit geneticapproaches to identify novel Xenopus regulators of the cell cycle. 238. Claspin, a Chk1-regulatory protein, monitors DNA replication on chromatin independentlyof ATR, and Rad17Joon Lee, Akiko Kumagai, William DunphyClaspin is required for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 in Xenopus egg extracts containing incompletely replicated DNA. We show here that Claspinassociates with chromatin in a regulated manner duringS-phase. Binding of Claspin to chromatin depends on thepre-replication complex (pre-RC) and Cdc45 but not on159 replication protein A (RPA). These dependencies suggest that binding of Claspin occurs around the time of initialDNA unwinding at replication origins. By contrast, bothATR and Rad17 require RPA for association with DNA.Claspin, ATR, and Rad17 all bind to chromatinindependently. These findings suggest that Claspin plays arole in monitoring DNA replication during S-phase.Claspin, ATR, and Rad17 may collaborate in checkpointregulation by detecting different aspects of a DNAreplication fork. 239. Pho sphorylated Claspin interacts with a Kumagai, William DunphyClaspin is essential for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 in Xenopus egg extracts containing incompletely replicated or UV-damaged DNA. Theactivated form of Claspin contains two repeatedphosphopeptide motifs that mediate its binding to Chk1.We show that these phosphopeptide motifs bind to Chk1by means of its N-terminal kinase domain. The bindingsite on Chk1 involves a positively charged cluster of aminoacids that contains lysine 54, arginine 129, threonine 153,and arginine Mutagenesis of these residues stronglycompromises the ability of Chk1 to interact with Claspin.These amino acids lie within regions of Chk1 that areinvolved in various aspects of its catalytic function. Thepredicted position on Chk1 of the phosphate group fromClaspin corresponds to the location of activation-loopphosphorylation in various kinases. In addition, we haveobtained evidence that the C-terminal regulatory domain ofChk1, which does not form a stable complex with Chk1under our assay conditions, nonetheless has some role inClaspin-dependent activation. Overall, these resultsindicate that Claspin docks with a phosphate-binding sitein the catalytic domain of Chk1 during activation by ATR.Phosphorylated Claspin may mimic an activatingphosphorylation of Chk1 during this process. *Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Korea University 240. Adaptation of a DNA replication checkpointresponse depends upon inactivation of Claspinby mediator essential for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 inXenopus egg extracts containing aphidicolin-induced DNA replication blocks. We show that during this checkpointresponse Claspin becomes phosphorylated on threonine-906 (T906), site for Plx1, theXenopus Polo-like kinase. This interaction promotes a nearby serine (S934) byPlx1. After a prolonged interphase arrest, aphidicolin-treated egg extracts typically undergo adaptation and enterinto mitosis despite the presence of incompletely replicatedDNA. In this Claspin dissociates from chromatinand mutants of alanine substitutions at positions 906 or 934 (T906Aor S934A) are unable to undergo adaptation. Under suchadaptation-defective conditions, Claspin accumulates onchromatin at high levels and Chk1 does not decrease inactivity. These results indicate that the Plx1-dependentinactivation of Claspin results in termination of a DNAreplication checkpoint response. 241. Mcm2 is a direct substrate of ATM and ATR during DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoint responsesHae Yong Yoo, Anna Shevchenko, AndrejShevchenko, William G. DunphyIn vertebrates, ATM and ATR are critical regulators of checkpoint responses to damaged andincompletely replicated DNA. These checkpoint responsesinvolve the activation of signaling pathways that inhibit thereplication of chromosomes with DNA lesions. In thisreport, we describe isolation of a cDNA encoding a full-length version of Xenopus ATM. Using antibodies against the regulatory domain of ATM, we have identified theessential replication protein Mcm2 as an ATM-bindingprotein in Xenopus phosphorylation 92 (S92) in responseto the presence of double-stranded DNA breaks or DNAreplication blocks in egg extracts. This phosphorylationinvolves both ATM and ATR, but the relative contributionof each kinase depends upon the checkpoint-inducingDNA signal. Furthermore, both ATM and ATRphosphorylate Mcm2 directly on S92 in cell-free ATM and ATR fromegg extracts abrogates the checkpoint response that blockschromosomal DNA replication in egg extracts containingdouble-stranded DNA breaks. These experiments indicatethat ATM and ATR phosphorylate the functionally criticalreplication protein Mcm2 during checkpoint responses thatprevent the replication of abnormal chromosomes. *Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany 242. Claspin and the activated form of ATR-ATRIP collaborate in the activation of Chk1Akiko Kumagai, Soo Mi Kim, William G. DunphyClaspin is necessary for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 in Xenopus egg extracts containing incompletely replicated DNA. ATR possesses a regulatorypartner called ATRIP. We have studied the respectiveroles of ATR-ATRIP and Claspin in the activation ofChk1. ATR-ATRIP binds well to various DNA templatesinXenopus egg extracts. ATR-ATRIP bound to a single- stranded DNA template is weakly active. By contrast, theATR-ATRIP complex on a DNA template containing bothsingle-stranded and double-stranded regions displays alarge increase in kinase activity. This observation suggeststhat ATR-ATRIP normally undergoes activation uponassociation with specific nucleic acid structures at DNAreplication forks. Without Claspin, activated ATR-ATRIPphosphorylates Chk1 weakly in a reaction.Addition in the160 absence of ATR-ATRIP. Taken together, these results indicate that the checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation ofChk1 is a multi-step process involving activation of theATR-ATRIP complex at replication forks and presentationof Chk1 to this complex by Claspin. 243. Roles of replication fork-interacting and Chk1- activating domains from Claspin in a DNAreplication checkpoint responseJoon Lee, Daniel A. Gold, Anna Shevchenko,Andrej Shevchenko, William G. DunphyClaspin is essential for the ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 in Xenopus egg extracts containing incompletely replicated DNA. Claspin associates withreplication forks upon origin unwinding. We show thatClaspin contains a replication fork-interacting domain(RFID, residues 265-605) that associates Cdc45,DNA and two RFC complexeson chromatin. The RFID contains two basic patches (BP1and BP2) at amino acids 265-331 and 470-600,respectively. Deletion of BP1 or BP2 compromisesoptimal binding of Claspin to chromatin. Absence of BP1has no effect on the ability of Claspin to mediate activationof Chk1. By contrast, removal of BP2 a largereduction the Chk1-activating potency of contains (CKAD, residues 776-905) that does not bindstably to chromatin, but is fully effective at highconcentrations for mediating activation of Chk1. Theseresults indicate that stable retention of Claspin onchromatin is not necessary for activation of Chk1. Instead,our findings suggest that only transient interaction ofClaspin with replication forks potentiates itsChk1-activating function. Another implication of thiswork is that stable binding of Claspin to chromatin mayplay a role besides the activation of 244. Pho sphorylation of Chk1 by ATR in Xenopus egg extracts requires binding of ATRIP to ATR but not the stable DNA-binding or coiled-coil Mi Kim, Akiko Kumagai, Joon Lee, WilliamG. DunphyATR, a critical regulator of DNA replication and damage checkpoint responses, possesses a binding partnercalled ATRIP. We have studied the functional propertiesofXenopus ATR and ATRIP in incubations with purified components and in frog egg extracts. In purified systems,ATRIP associates with DNA in both RPA-dependent andRPA-independent manners, depending on the compositionof the template. However, in egg extracts, only theRPA-dependent mode of binding to DNA can be detected.ATRIP adopts an oligomeric state in egg extracts thatdepends upon binding to ATR. In addition, ATR andATRIP are mutually dependent on one another for stablebinding to DNA in egg extracts. The ATR-dependentoligomerization of ATRIP does not require an intactcoiled-coil domain in ATRIP and does not change in thepresence of checkpoint-inducing DNA templates. Eggextracts containing a mutant of ATRIP that cannot bind toATR are defective in the phosphorylation of Chk1.However, extracts containing of ATRIP of Chk1 in response todefined DNA templates. Furthermore, activation of Chk1does not depend upon RPA under these conditions. Theseresults suggest that ATRIP must associate with ATR inorder for ATR to carry out the phosphorylation of Chk1effectively. However, this function of ATRIP does notinvolve its ability to mediate the stable binding of ATR todefined checkpoint-inducing DNA templates in eggextracts, does not require an intact coiled-coil domain, anddoes not depend on RPA. 245. ATR-ATRIP complex Akiko Kumagai, Joon Lee, Hae Yong Yoo, William G. DunphyATR is a key regulator of checkpoint responses to incompletely replicated and damaged DNA, but themechanisms underlying control of its kinase activity areunknown. TopBP1, the vertebrate homolog of yeastCut5/Dpb11, has dual roles in initiation of DNAreplication and regulation of checkpoint responses. Weshow that recombinant TopBP1 induces a large increase inthe kinase activity of both Xenopus and human ATR. The ATR-activating domain resides in a conserved segment ofTopBP1 that is distinct from its numerous BRCT repeats.The isolated ATR-activating domain from TopBP1 inducesectopic activation of ATR-dependent signaling in bothXenopus egg extracts and human cells. Furthermore,Xenopus egg extracts containing a version of TopBP1 with an inactivating point mutation in the ATR-activatingdomain are defective in checkpoint regulation. Thesestudies establish that activation of ATR by TopBP1 is acrucial step in the initiation of ATR-dependent signalingprocesses. 246. Site-specific phosphorylation of a checkpoint mediator protein controls its responses todifferent DNA structuresHae Yong Yoo, Seong Yun Jeong *, William G. DunphyThe checkpoint mediator protein Claspin is indispensable for the ATR-dependent phosphorylation ofChk1 in response to stalled DNA replication forks inXenopus egg extracts. We show that Claspin alsoparticipates in the detection of chromosomal double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in this system.Significantly, removal of Claspin from egg extracts onlypartially abrogates the activation of Chk1 in response tochromatin with DSBs, whereas depletion of both Claspinand BRCA1 completely abolishes this Thefunction Claspin on thesesites nor the presence of BRCA1 is necessary for activationof Chk1 in response to stalled replication forks. Thus, site-specific phosphorylation of a checkpoint mediator proteinis a crucial determinant in the discrimination betweenvarious checkpoint-inducing structures. Furthermore,checkpoint mediator proteins exhibit functional overlapthat varies depending on the nature of the checkpoint-triggering DNA signal.161 *Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Korea University Publications Kim, S.-M., Kumagai, A., Lee., J., and Dunphy, W.G.

Wright, Zhiheng YuGraduate Students: Jordan Benjamin, Gregory Henderson, Peter Leong, Dylan Morris, Gavin Murphy Undergraduates: Bingni Wen Support: The work described in the following reports has been supported by: AgouronDOEMooreNIHSearle Foundations Summary: If we could simply look inside a cell and see its molecular components in all their complexes and conformations, cell biology would be all but finished. Weare developing electron-cryomicroscopy-basedtechnologies to do this for at least the largestmacromolecular complexes, hoping to show both howindividual proteins work together as large \"machines\" andhow those machines are organized into \"assembly lines\"within living cells. Our electron cryomicroscopy projectsrange from imaging individual macromolecules to largerprotein assemblies to viruses to organelles and even tointact cells. In addition, we have now begun simulation projects to understand how such spatial relationships affect cellular processes. We use two basic data collection strategies. The first, called \"tomography,\" involves imaging a singleunique object (such as a cell) from multiple directions andthen merging those projections into a three-dimensionalreconstruction. The second, called \"single particleanalysis,\" involves imaging a large number of identical copies of a target object (such as a purifiable proteincomplex), and again merging the images to produce athree-dimensional reconstruction. Both techniques are stillrapidly developing, but together hold the promise ofcompleting what could be called the \"structural biology continuum\" (Figure 1) in a step-wise fashion by showing first how individual proteins (visible by X-raycrystallography and NMR spectroscopy) come together toform complexes (visible by single particle analysis), andhow those complexes are organized within living cells(visible by electron tomography). This structural data, inturn, will inform whole-cell models of the interactions ofall the cell's molecular components. Both single particle analysis and tomography begin by spreading the sample in a thin film (~300 nm)across an electron microscope grid and then plunging itinto liquid ethane, which causes the water to form vitreous, rather than crystalline, ice, and preserves the sample in a native state without any unnatural fixatives, resins, orstains. For tomography, the sample is imaged from aseries of angles by incrementally tilting a goniometerthrough ~140 degrees. For single particle analysis, eachcopy of the sample (one \"particle\") freezes with a randomorientation with respect to the plane of the grid so thattilting is not necessary. Instead, images of hundreds ofthousands of individual particles are recorded and thenaligned and averaged in three-dimensions computationally.The target resolution for single particle analysis is 4-10\u00c5, where the secondary structure of a particle can be seen and fitting atomic models of components is possible. Thetarget resolution for tomography is 3-6 nm, where theidentity, location, and orientation of individualmacromolecules can be seen in their cellular contexts. 163 Our work involves technology development as well as its application to key biological questions. Weenjoy the use of a state-of-the-art, 300 kV, helium-cooled,energy-filtered, fully automated, dual-axis tilting, FEG\"Polara\" TEM. This year's technical efforts were directedtowards (1) simulation studies to understand the effect of alignment errors in single particle reconstructions, (2) theoretical work on methods to correct for curvature of theEwald sphere, and (3) developing software to automatetilt-series acquisition. Some of the biological questions wehave addressed this year are (1) the nature of theprokaryotic cytoskeleton as seen flagellar motor; (2) the structure of immatureHIV-1 virus-like particles; (4) the quaternary structure ofvarious RNA polymerase complexes; (5) the structure of the bacterial carboxysome; and (6) the ultrastructure of the smallest known eukaryotic cell. 247. Cr yo-electron microscopy and single particle analysisAndrew A. Rawlinson, Grant J. Jensen, J.Bernard HeymannSingle particle analysis techniques allow us to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of frozenhydrated proteins by 'averaging' many thousands ofelectron microscope images of the protein. A crucial step in the process is the accurate determination of the alignment parameters - i.e., center, orientation and defocus- of each protein molecule/complex in the image - asinaccuracies (together with the effects of the contrasttransfer function, Poisson (shot) noise, distortions due tomicroscope, etc.) can cause loss of high frequencyinformation - thereby reducing the quality of thereconstructions. The usual paradigm to overcome the loss of information is to collect more and more images, therebyimproving the signal-to-noise ratio - but this depends onvarious factors, including the magnitudes of the alignment errors. Published in the literature are theoretical relations between the magnitudes of such errors and the number ofimages required to achieve a given resolution in areconstruction. We are testing these relations by usingsimulated images (produced by Bsoft) and introducingalignment errors of varying magnitudes, so we canexamine how many images are needed to achieve 'nearatomic resolution' (~4 to 6 \u00c5) reconstructions. Using the Biology Division's supercomputer, we have created two 50,000-image databases, one database ofthe 20S proteasome, and the other of RNA polymerase. Alignment errors in each image are introduced and the quality of the resulting reconstructions is measured bycomparing each reconstruction against a three-dimensionalreference via the Fourier shell correlation function.Knowledge gained from these simulations can help usunderstand how robust orientation-finding programs (e.g.,Bsoft) need to be in order to achieve near atomicresolution reconstructions of proteins when using real electron microscope images. Preliminary indications arethat around 10,000s - 100,000s of images are required -something that is within the capability of current computertechnology.

Leong, Grant J. JensenWhen an electron microscope records an image of an object, information from the Fourier values on theEwald sphere contribute to form an image. The usual approximation made is that the image is a perfect projection of the object and instead contains informationfrom a central slice of the 3D Fourier transform of theobject. However, the approximation begins to fail at highresolutions, low acceleration voltages and for large virusparticles because under these conditions, the informationon the Ewald sphere becomes significantly different fromthe information found on a central slice, thereby limitingthe maximum resolution of the 3D reconstruction of theobject. We have developed a reconstruction algorithm to take into account the curvature of the Ewald sphere and are implementing it in two different image-processingpackages. Our simulations have shown that the resolutionlimit, which is a result of the central slice approximation,can be corrected for, thereby improving the resolution of3D reconstructions. The algorithm is also being applied toan experimentally obtained dataset of a large virus particleto confirm the resolution improvements on real data.164 4\u00c5 (left) and 2\u00c5 (right) reconstructions of Foot and Mouth Virus capsid using Ewald-sphere-simulated-images illustrate the improvement in resolution when taking the Ewald sphere into account. 249. Automatic multiple TEM tilt series acquisition using LeginonChristian Suloway, Grant J. JensenDespite available data collection software, transmission electron microscope (TEM) tomography is still a labor-intensive technique requiring a user to spendhours or even days at the instrument. The problem arisesfrom the need to not only tilt and track the specimen whenimaging, as implemented in current software, but locate,position and focus multiple areas of interest. Byintegrating the predictive tracking algorithm and tilt seriescollection capability from the software applicationUCSFTomo 1 into a software package for automating data collection on TEMs, Leginon2, the data collection process is now fully automated. Many new features have been added to Leginon during the integration including general utilities for acquiring and storing tilt series data and optimization ofthe geometric model for change in position of thespecimen in three dimensions as it is tilted. Additionaldatabase structures for storing tilt series and trackinginformation have been added. New web pages for viewingimage data, analyzing specimen tracking algorithmperformance, and accessing collected data have beenadded to the Leginon support tools. The data acquisition workflow begins by Leginon collecting low magnification images of the specimen and stitching them together into an atlas. Areas of the atlas can then be selected in the user interface to be imaged atincreasing magnifications, and this information is used tochoose targets for tilt series collection. Leginon thenproceeds from one target to the next, performing all of thetasks necessary for collecting high quality cryo-electronmicroscope tilt series data using an energy filter, includingsetting focus and eucentric height, realigning the energyfilter slit, and recording full tilt series without ever needinghuman interaction. A drift monitoring system in Leginonensures tilt series are taken at the correct locations on the specimen regardless of specimen drift over time. Thecurrent rate of data acquisition is roughly 30 seconds pertilt image on a 2048 pixel square CCD camera, comparable to UCSFTomo. This software is expected to significantly increase productivity by facilitating routine 24-hour data collection,reducing the perturbations caused by a constant rotation ofusers and their individualized setup routines, andidentifying microscope performance problemsimmediately.165 Figure 1.

JensenGene phylogenetic profiles have become a powerful tool for comparative genome analysis. For a given set of sequenced genomes, the phylogenetic profile of a particular gene is a vector of ones and zerosthat indicate whether homologues of that gene arepresent or absent in each of these genomes. Theseprofiles have traditionally been used to assign functionsto newly sequenced genes based on their statisticalrelationships to the profiles of genes of knownfunction. In a recent paper, Slonim et al., introduced a method for using phylogenetic profiles to probe correlations between genes and behavioral phenotypes.Specifically, they used mutual information analysis todetermine those genes whose presence in a microbialgenome is highly predictive of that organism exhibitinga particular phenotype. They performed this analysisand a subsequent aggregation step to arrive at a set ofgeneric gene modules that give high information abouteach of the examined phenotypes. We are currently extending this work by creating a comprehensive, machine-readable databaseof all microbial organisms whose genomes have beencompletely sequenced. This database will containphylogenetic profiles for every gene in each of thesegenomes and will characterize the organisms across awide range of phenotypes. We are constructing thephenotype database by manually mining the publishedresearch literature. We will use these data to search for sets of phenotype-specific genes (genes that are highly conserved across those microbial organisms thatdisplay the phenotype and absent from those that donot) across the entire range of sequenced microbialgenomes. At present, there are 354 completedmicrobial genomes available on the NCBI server, andan additional 594 are currently in progress. As newly completed genomes are added to the NCBI database, our software will automatically build the corresponding set of phylogenetic profiles andincorporate them into our database. The software willperiodically recalculate the global genotype-phenotyperelationships in order to include newly added genomesin the analysis. The results will be presented on aninteractive website, where users will be encouraged toadd new phenotype information to the database andwill be allowed to run the genotype-phenotype correlation analysis against their own data. 251. I mage processing software tool development and applications H. Jane Ding, Grant J. Jensen Today's electron microscopy is strongly dependent on software development. Software in image processing plays crucial roles in the field. From singleparticle reconstruction to tomography, we use varioussoftware packages for reconstructions and structuralanalysis. We employ existing software packages aswell as write our own packages as needed. We have been developing various techniques in tomogram analysis forobtaining structural information of the molecular complexesthrough electron microscopy, for example, building modulesthat project layers of density maps to surfaces so a better viewof the layer structure of object can be obtained. Below are some of the major projects we are currently working on: Tomogram segmentation: Manual segmentation of tomograms is often subjective and can be tedious. We areworking on algorithms for quantitative approaches to theinterpretation of features in tomograms, eitherautomatically or semi-automatically. Tomogram search: Computationally search the three- dimensional reconstructions of cells to identifymacromolecular complexes and cytoskeletal elements ofinterests. Tomogram analysis is challenging because of the low signal-to-noise ratios of the EM images as well as the \"missingwedge\" in tomography. Our future work is also aiming atimproving the quality of the images, which includesimplementing new software or improving the software that iscurrently used in three-dimensional reconstruction intomography, especially for \"dual-tilt\" tomography. The figure below is an image of an icosahedral layer of rubisco molecules inside of a carboxysome. Computed andgenerated from actual EM data by various software tools. 167 252. E lectron-cryo-tomography of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton Li, *, Brun*, Christine Jacobs Wagner, Zemer Gitai\u00a7, James W. Gober, Grant J. Jensen Until relatively recently, it was thought that bacteria had very little regular internal structure andthat they were essentially a \"bag of macromolecules.\"There is now mounting evidence that this is not thecase, including the discovery of FtsZ and by bacteria. The sequencing of the C. crescentus genome revealed the presence of cresentin, a homologto a third type of cytoskeletal element, intermediate filaments. This bacterium is thus an excellent place to look for a bacterial version of the eukaryoticcytoskeleton. Last year, we successfully visualizedseveral types of filaments in wild-type C. crescentus. This year, we have obtained three-dimensional structures of several types of mutant C. crescentus with the purpose of identifying the proteins that make upeach of the filaments that we have seen. These mutantsinclude one in which FtsZ hydrolysis has been blockedand which exhibited elongated constriction sitescontaining large numbers of filaments partially circling the cell, perpendicular to the long axis (see figure).This result is compelling evidence that similar filaments seen in wild-type cells are composed of FtsZ. Strains with mutations for crescentin overexpression,crescentin deletion and non-functional crescentin are similarlyhelping to identify which wild-type filament is composed ofcrescentin, although the results are not as clear-cut as in the FtsZ case. Mutants with MreB overexpression and ParA overexpression are also being studied by electron-cryo-tomography. The ParA gene product is essential for chromosome segregation in C. crescentus and B. subtilis and has been localized to a transient filamentous structure by fluorescentlight microscopy (fLM). We are also interested in the relatedtopic of general cell shape determination in Caulobacter, andto that end are studying mutants that start bleeding whendepleted of a cell envelope regulator kinase. These blebsappear to be formed by the separation of the outer membranefrom the inner membrane. *Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology Dept., Yale University, New Haven, CT \u00a7Molecular Biology Dept., Princeton University, Princeton, NJ Dept. of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA Figure 1. FtsZ rings in Caulobacter crescentus . A dividing wild-type cell ( A, B) and an FtsZ mutant cell ( C, D ) were flash- frozen in vitreous ice and imaged by electron cryotomography. ( A) and (C ) are snapshots after tilt series collection. ( B) and (D) show segmentations from tomograms of regions indicated by the white boxes in ( A) and (C ), respectively. The width of wild-type Caulobacter crescentus is ~500nm. The extended area in the mutant cell has a width of ~ 300 nm.168 253. Co rrelated tomography (ECT) when compared with fluorescent light microscopy (fLM) is that there is currently no way to directly label a protein for ECT in the same way that GFPcan be used to label proteins for fLM. The only labelingmethods in use for ECT are immunology-based, and thusof limited accuracy and scope. Another disadvantage ofECT versus fLM is that fLM can capture dynamicprocesses, while ECT is necessarily a static image of thespecimen (it is frozen, after all). However, the hugeadvantage of ECT over fLM is its much higher resolutionand, in the case of conventional fLM, the three-dimensional nature of ECT structural data. To takeadvantage of the best of both techniques, we are developing a method for correlated fLM and ECT of bacteria. The concept is to obtain an image of a bacteriumin the fLM and then image the same exact bacterium byECT. We have so far succeeded in immobilizing GFP-labeled Caulobacter crescentus on EM grids, then placing these grids on glass slides and imaging them in the fLM atboth low and high magnifications. We also successfullyplunge-froze the grid with the imaged bacteria and wereable to find the same bacterium and image it in our FEIPolara microscope. So far the fLM-imaged cells appear tobe distressed compared to cells that have gone from culture straight to being plunge-frozen. Current efforts are directed at optimizing the process to reduce the timeneeded for fLM imaging and to introduce other measuresto reduce the stress on the cells.*Department of Microbiology, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark 254. The structure of Mycoplasma 's attachment organelle and its role in motilityGregory Henderson, Grant J. JensenWhile most motile bacteria propel themselves with flagella, other mechanisms have been described including retraction of surface-attached pili, secretion of polysaccharides, or movement of motors along surfaceprotein tracks. These have been referred to collectively asforms of \"gliding\" motility. Despite being simultaneouslyone of the smallest and simplest of all known cells,Mycoplasma pneumoniae builds a surprisingly large and complex cell extension known as the attachment organellethat enables it to glide. Previously, three-dimensionalimages of the attachment organelle were produced with unprecedented clarity and authenticity using state-of-the-art electron cryotomography. The attachment organelle was seen to contain a multi-subunit, jointed, dynamic motor much larger than a flagellar basal body andcomparable in complexity. A new model for its functionwas proposed wherein inchworm-like conformationalchanges of its electron-dense core are leveraged against acytoplasmic anchor and transmitted to the surface throughlayered adhesion proteins. 1 Above: Cover photo, Molecular Microbiology This model is currently being tested with further work on Mycoplasma pneumoniae and its mutants.

JensenI generated a 7 nm resolution, 3-D average of an in situ flagellar motor. The elusive stators are visible for the first time and their natural interactions with othercomponents and the membrane are preserved. This workadvances our structural understanding of the flagellarmotor, much of which focused on the purified basal body,which lacked the stators. The flagellar motor is anamazing nanomachine built from many different proteinsand uses an electrochemical ion gradient to drive rotationat speeds up to 300 Hz in some organisms. The motorconsists of a fixed, membrane-embedded, torque-generating stator and a typically bidirectional, spinningrotor that changes direction in response to chemotactic signals. Stator studs extend into the periplasm and grip the peptidoglycan layer (PG) for rigidity, while thecytoplasmic stator portion spins a wheel, the C ring, and itsattached hub, the rotor. The flagella rod rises from therotor through a proteinaceous P ring \"bushing\" in the PG. The final structure shows the stator studs extending above the membrane and leaning CCW (dottedline in Figure 1a, below). The center-to-center diameter ofthe stator studs is 61 nm. The stator is embedded in theinner membrane (IM) and contacts the C ring through thinbridging density (connection #1 in Figure 1b), and169 unexpectedly, it also contacts the rotor in two places (#2 and #3) and a P-ring-like shape labeled the P collar (#4).The stator studs (asterisked in 1d) are 8 nm thin-bridging density connects them (arrowhead). A pore shapelies on the rotor's bottom (arrow in 1e), with an \"exportbundle\" shape beneath it. The PG and outer membrane (OM) are not visible in the averaged structure but are pictured in their expected locations (Figure 1c). It isthought that the torque-generating interaction occurs atconnection #1.These results highlight the ability of cryoelectron tomography to not only reconstruct the 3D structures ofindividual macromolecular complexes but to also averagethem for increased resolution. *Assistant Professor of Environmental Microbiology, Division of Environmental Science and Engineering, Caltech Figure 1: The Treponema primitia periplasmic flagellar motor. a,b,d,e: Isosurfaces of the T. primitia motor, with components marked in b.c: Cartoon of the T.p. motor with labeled components. f: Cartoon of the isolated Salmonella basal body with labeled components. 256.

While assembly of themature virion from the immature form has been studied extensively, and the structural elements of both have been identified and determined, a complete understanding of theimmature virion has remained elusive. Here, we report thefirst three-dimensional structure of individual immatureHIV-1 virions obtained by electron cryotomography. Wemeasured the virions and found the diameters to rangefrom 115 to 140 nm with a mean of 127 nm. The radialspoke arrangement of the Gag polyprotein was clearlyvisible in the tomograms. The thicknesses of the domains of the Gag polyprotein were measured as 78 \u00b1 10 \u00c5 formembrane-MA, 77 \u00b1 10 \u00c5 for CA, and 43 \u00b1 10 \u00c5 for NC. Upon producing surface projections of each layer of Gag, it was determined that only the CA domains containedregions of order within the virions (Figure 1). The CA domains were arranged in hexagonal lattices interspersed between patches ofdisorder. We developed a novel method for detection andaveraging of unit cells from highly ordered regions withinthe Gag shell. A three-dimensional map produced byaveraging 120 unit cells revealed a two-layer hexagonallattice in the CA and SP1 domains. The ring-to-ringspacing of the CA NTD lattice was 8 nm and the ring-to- ring spacing of the SP1 lattice was 7.5 nm. From our data, we describe a pseudoatomic model of the CA and SP1domains of immature HIV-1 in which SP1 hexamersappear to stabilize individual CA hexamers (Figure 2).170 Figure 1.

I maging transcription complexes using cryoelectron microscopyZhiheng Yu, Grant J. JensenTranscription is one of the most complicated cellular processes with many proteins participating atvarious stages to regulate gene expression. In eukaryotes, for a TF to fulfill its biological function of transcribing certain protein-encoding genes, it usually needs to interactwith RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) basal transcriptioncomplexes. It is critical to pursue the structural details ofthe RNAP II transcription complexes in order tounderstand transcription in general and mechanismsleading to specific diseases in particular. The two transcription complexes studied in this work are PTB and PFB, respectively. The former iscomposed of RNAP II, TATA-box binding protein (TBP),basal transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and a 41mer-5merDNA-RNA hybrid and the latter is composed of RNAP II, TFIIB, TFIIF and a 53mer-7mer DNA-RNA hybrid. The significance of these complexes is that the complexes arecaptured in an early \"transcribing\" state. Electron tomography was performed on ~150 copies of the PTB complexes suspended in thin vitrifiedice. The projected images in the tilt series were backprojected and processed to generate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. From the 3D reconstruction, I boxedout 80 copies of the PTB complexes, aligned them andaveraged them to generate a low-resolution 3D model forthe PTB particle. Figure 1a shows the averaged 3D modelin which the main features can be clearly seen. Considering the relatively small molecular weight of the transcription complexes (600-700 kDa), it is encouragingto see that electron tomography can produce a 3D model ofsuch quality. This model will serve as the initial model forthe higher-resolution single particle analysis. I havealready collected hundreds of high-resolution projectionimages of PTB and PFB particles suspended in very thinice at random orientations with an optimized dose and atvarious defocus values. A first round single-particlereconstruction using the software EMAN was carried outfor PTB and a similar process for PFB is currently underway. Figure 1(B) shows the difference map of the reconstructed PTB relative to the crystal structure (PDB ID: 1SFO) of RNAP II with a 15mer- We can clearly see the dumbbell shaped c-TFIIBlocated at almost the same location as in the co-crystal ofRNAPII and TFIIB (PDB ID: 1R5U).

Jane Ding, Dylan M.Morris, Grant J. J. JensenCarboxysomes are organelle-like polyhedral bodies enclosed by a proteinaceous shell and filled withribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase(RuBisCO) molecules, a key enzyme in CO 2 fixation. They are part of the CO 2 concentrating machinery (CCM) in cyanobacteria and many chemoautotrophic bacteria, andare produced in a greater number when the organisms aregrown under low-CO 2 conditions. Exactly how carboxysomes help the organisms compete when CO 2 is limited is still unclear. We employ electroncryotomography to explore the 3D structure of purifiedcarboxysomes. These studies will provide a more detailed view of these organelles allowing us to determine theiroverall shape, the number and organization of RuBisCOs,thus leading to a better understanding of the structure-function relationship. We have looked at carboxysomes purified from two different sources: the Synechococcus strain WH8102 and Halothiobacillus neapolitanus (H. neapolitanus). Both kinds of carboxysomes vary in size and they have an icosahedral overall shape that seems more regular forSynechococcus . RuBisCO molecules are organized in shells spaced about 12 nm apart. Simulations ofcarboxysomes in which RuBisCO molecules are randomlyplaced revealed that, as the number of enzymes increased,shells spontaneously arise similarly to the ones in the data. A B172 172So far the resolution of the data is insufficient to support specific interactions between RuBisCOs. Recent studies onthe shell proteins showed that two of these proteins formcharged pores that probably provide charged metabolites tothe RuBisCOs, and another shell protein is a novelcarbonic anhydrase supposed to concentrate CO 2 proximally to RuBisCOs. Thus it appears that thecarboxysome shell acts both as a permeable membrane forsubstrates and as a template, organizing RuBisCO inspecific patterns that optimize CO 2 fixation. Figure: Slice through a tomogram of purified H. neapolitanus carboxysomes. Scale bar corresponds to 150 nm. 259. E lectron cryotomography of in situ carboxysomesCristina V. Iancu, Grant J. JensenIn parallel with the studies of purified carboxysomes, we also examine carboxysomes within cellsto ensure that the purified material is representative for the in vivo carboxysomes and to establish what cellular ultra- structural elements are associated with them. A long-termgoal is to capture different stages of carboxysomeassembly within cells. As Synechococcus cells are too large to be amenable to electron cryotomography studies we chose H. neapolitanus cells for visualizing carboxysomes in situ . Tomograms of these cells typically show about sevencarboxysomes/cell. Most cellular carboxysomes aresimilar in size and shape to the purified ones, however,there are also some unusually long. There are no visible filaments linking the carboxysomes, they just seem to be dispersed randomly in the cytoplasm of the cell. The mostsurprising finding is the existence of a high-densityaggregate of variable size within the majority of thecellular carboxysomes. As this element has never beenseen in the purified carboxysomes we speculated that itmight be the result of accumulated metabolites that havenot been released yet from carboxysomes and that thepurification process would dilute them away. We are inthe process of testing this hypothesis by looking at cells that are slowed down metabolically. Figure : Slice through a tomogram of an H. neapolitanus cell. Scale bar corresponds to 150 nm. Arrows indicate the high-density aggregates present in cellular carboxysomes. 260. Electron cryotomography of the minimal eukaryote, Ostreococcus Lu Gan, Grant J. JensenThe picoplankton Ostreococcus tauri is the smallest known eukaryote. The 12.6 MB genome of O. tauri has just 5,441 nuclear genes, but includes a minimal- yet-complete set of cell-cycle control genes. This photoautotrophic unicellular organism, which measures 1 - 2\u00b5m in diameter, is also the simplest of eukaryotes: it has just one nucleus, one chloroplast, and one mitochondrion. These properties make O. tauri , to our knowledge, one of the few eukaryotes that can be imaged in toto by electron cryomicroscopy. We have used electron cryotomographyto determine the first life-like structures of whole, vitrifiedO. tauri cells. We confirmed earlier findings that each cell has one copy of each the organelles listed above, and wealso found that each cell has a number of storage vesicles,and a Golgi body that is adjacent to the endoplasmicreticulum (ER). The remaining volume within the cytosolis packed with dense, ribosome-like particles. Thechloroplasts, mitochondria, and storage vesicles haveconsistent shapes in most of the cells we have analyzed.By contrast, the nuclei are pleiomorphic. Most of the cells that we have examined have an \"open\" nucleus, indicating that O. tauri undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by either partial or full nuclear-envelope breakdown. Thenucleus is simultaneously adjacent to the ER, thechloroplast, the mitochondrion, and the plasma membrane;this is a consequence of the small cell-size. The lumen,which separates the inner- and outer-nuclear envelope, hasuniform width when the outer envelope is in contact withanother organelle, but variable width when it faces thecytosol. Our tomograms of O. tauri provide eukaryotic ultrastructure.173 A) Tomographic XY-slice (3.6-nm thick) through the center of an O. tauri cell.

Parson's Foundation Summary: The focus of the lab has been the coupling of theoretical, computational, and experimental approachesfor the study of structural biology. In particular, we haveplaced a major emphasis on developing quantitativemethods for protein design with the goal of developing afully systematic design strategy that we call \"proteindesign automation.\" Our design approach has beencaptured in a suite of software programs called ORBIT (Optimization of Rotamers By Iterative Techniques) and has been applied to a variety of problems ranging fromprotein fold stabilization to enzyme design. 261. Efficient optimization algorithms for multi- state protein design Benjamin D. Allen 1, Stephen L. Mayo Traditional protein design methods select amino acid sequences that are consistent with a single, fixed, main-chain structure by optimizing the identities and conformations of the side chains. However, real proteinsassume an ensemble of conformational states, andmodeling sequences on a single backbone restricts ourability to select sequences that reflect this essentialcharacteristic. Similarly, it is difficult to generatesequences with altered catalytic or binding specificitywhen only one state is modeled at a time. Theselimitations of single-state design have prompted interest inmulti-state design (MSD) algorithms, such as multi-statedesign Monte Carlo (MSD-MC). Previous results haveindicated that the Fast and Accurate Side-Chain Topology and Energy Refinement (FASTER) algorithm is significantly more efficient than Monte Carlo for single-state design. We developed and implemented a newoptimization algorithm for multi-state protein design basedon FASTER, and compared its performance to MSD-MC.Application of the MSD algorithms to several difficultsingle-state design problems revealed that MSD-FASTERwas always able to find the optimal solution (asdetermined using well-tested single-state designalgorithms), whereas the best solutions found by MSD-MC were sub-optimal. Both algorithms were able tosuccessfully optimize the straightforward core design of a60-member NMR ensemble. Although neither methodwas able to thoroughly sample a difficult surface design ofthe same ensemble in a reasonable time frame, the solutions produced by MSD-FASTER were significantly better. Finally, both algorithms were applied to a negativedesign problem with three states, and both were able tofind an optimal sequence that stabilized one structure anddestabilized the other two, as desired. The performance ofMSD-FASTER was nearly 100-fold better than MSD-MCin this case. We conclude that MSD-FASTER is moreefficient than MSD-MC for multi-state design in a varietyof contexts. 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 262. Using negative design to increase HIV protease specificity Oscar Alvizo1, Stephen L. Mayo HIV protease is essential for viral maturation. Its main role is to recognize and cleave sequences in the Gagand Pol polyproteins. The enzyme is of unique interest because its symmetrical binding region recognizes and cleaves asymmetrical substrates. In addition, its naturalsubstrates exhibit little sequence homology (three areshown in the table below). Our goal is to exploit HIVprotease's asymmetric substrate recognition by designinghetero-dimer mutants with increased ofthree natural substrates, p2-NC or RT-RH. Crystalstructures are available for an inactive variant of HIVprotease bound to each of these substrates; thesecomplexes serve as scaffolds for computational proteindesign. The optimization procedure uses all three scaffolds simultaneously and employs a scoring function chosen to predict mutations that will stabilize one scaffoldover the other two. To insure viable sequences, onlysequences with energies within 20% of the globalminimum energy conformation (GMEC) of the positivedesign structure are evaluated. Within this restraint, thesearch algorithm tries to recover sequences withdetrimental interactions in the two negative designstructures. The predicted mutants are visually inspectedand promising mutations are selected for experimentalvalidation. This type of negative design procedure proved to be the most effective in producing desirable mutants. Todate, three mutants, one for each of the substrates, havebeen selected and experimentally tested. Preliminary datasuggest that each of these mutants exhibits increasedspecificity towards its intended substrate. More rigoroustesting is currently underway to quantitate this effect.Subsequent rounds of negative design calculations areexpected to further increase the specificity of the mutantstowards their intended substrates. 1Graduate Option in Glu Ala Met Ser p2-NC Pro Ala Thr Ile Met Met Gln Arg Gly Asn RT-RH Gly Ala Glu Thr Phe Tyr Val Asp Gly Ala 263. Designing nonspecific lipid transfer proteins for biosensor applications Eun Jung Choi*, Jessica Mao*1, Stephen L. Mayo Biosensors are biological molecules that recognize specific ligands and relay the message to an easily measured physical signal. Recently, bacterialperiplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) with different ligandspecificities were tagged with a fluorophore to producebiosensors for their natural ligands or for novel ligands [1].The natural ligands of PBPs are hydrophilic and relativelysmall. The binding site residues are also hydrophilic, thusmaking it difficult to design in large hydrophobic ligands.Our aim is to expand the chemical scope of target ligandsby developing a protein platform capable of specificallybinding large and/or hydrophobic ligands. For this purpose, we selected nonspecific lipid transfer protein (LTP) from maize (mLTP). Our strategy was touse the ORBIT protein design software to design out thedisulfide bonds and thus allow flexibility in the mLTPmolecule. ORBIT predicted five variants:C4H/C52A/N55E, C4Q/C52A/N55S, C14A/C29S,C30A/C75A and C50A/C89E. Circular dichroismwavelength scans indicated that three of the five variants(C4H/C52A/N55E, C4Q/C52A/N55S and C50A/C89E) were properly folded. Thermal stability studies in the absence and presence of palmitate showed thatC4H/C52A/N55E and C4Q/C52A/N55S gained the moststability upon binding palmitate, suggesting that thesemutants might undergo a large conformational changeupon ligand binding. Therefore, they were predicted to begood candidates for biosensor design. We mutated one of the original cysteine residues back in two of the variants, C4H/C52A/N55E andC50A/C89E. Acrylodan (Ac), an to theresulting free cysteine protein. We titrated the protein-acrylodan conjugates with palmitate to test the ability of the engineered mLTPs to act as biosensors.C52A/C4-Ac and C4H/N55E/C52-Ac showed the mostmarked difference in signal when palmitate was added.We determined the Kd of palmitate to be 0.6 mM for C52A/C4-Ac and 4 \u00b5M for C4H/N55E/C52-Ac. These values were close to the 3 \u00b5M Kd of palmitate that we had using tyrosine fluorescence. *Equal authorship 1Division of Chemistry Engineering, designed protein G variantsKarin Crowhurst, Stephen L. MayoProtein function is frequently reliant on dynamic processes; successful protein-protein interactions andenzyme catalysis often require structural flexibility and plasticity. These entropic factors can also contribute to protein stability. Understanding dynamic motions incomputationally designed proteins compared to wild typecould therefore be crucial for improving the accuracy andconsistency of stable de novo protein and enzyme production, with wide-ranging medical and industrialapplications. My current project goal is to understand thedegree to which our current protein design algorithm(ORBIT) produces proteins with native-like backbonedynamics; information learned can be used to target futurealgorithm modifications and to move towards deliberately incorporating backbone flexibility into designs. NMR spectroscopy has been employed for detailed analysis of the backbone dynamics of several mutants of Streptococcal protein G \u00011; the structural flexibility of these mutants is believed to significantly impact their respective stabilities compared to wild type [1]. Previously, we reported that a highly thermostable variant (G \u00011-c3b4) [2] dimerizes in solution; our 2.3 \u00c5 crystal structure shows that the interface is formed through a\u0001-bridging interaction with antiparallel \u00012 strands. NMR relaxation experiments have revealed significant conformational exchange for all backbone amides in the \u00012 strand and the adjacent region of the helix (caused in part by the monomer-dimer equilibrium). In contrast, the backbone amides involved in both fast and intermediatetimescale motions in the six-fold core mutant (FILIIW) arelocalized in residues close to mutations. Dynamics in bothvariants may be attributed to sidechain overpacking or theloss of specific interactions (such as aromatic ringstacking, which rigidifies the core of FILIIW). However, increased motion is likely due to new nonspecific interactions created by greater hydrophobic burial in thevariants, which would lead to higher overall entropy (andtherefore altered stabilities) compared to wild type. Thesedata provide insight into the properties of proteinsequences generated by ORBIT according to specificdesign criteria and highlight aspects of the algorithm thatmay require modification to produce variants with desireddynamic characteristics.

MayoBy combining our fast Fourier transform-based docking algorithm and our protein design algorithm, wehave generated de novo homodimers by changing the surface properties of a previously redesigned homeodomain molecule. The formation of the homodimeris hydrophobicity-driven, and our current best dimer has a dissociation constant of ~20 \u00b5M, determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. We are in the process of determining the X-ray crystal structure of our latest version of the designed homodimers, as X-ray structural data is essentialto validate the design. High quality crystals were obtainedby vapor diffusion sitting drop experiments, and theirX-ray data were collected at both home rotating anodesources and synchrotron sources. We were, however,unable to obtain a solution for the phases using molecularreplacement methods due to the large number of moleculesin the asymmetric unit. We are using a bromine-labeledvariant to obtain experimental phases and are exploringother possible crystallization conditions for alternativespace groups. 266. Designing cal modulin specificity: Incorporation of explicit negative design Jennifer R. Keeffe 1, Stephen L. Mayo Protein-protein interactions are essential to many processes within cells, including signaling pathways, theimmune response and in the formation of the functional,oligomeric state of many proteins. The ability to design aprotein with high affinity and specificity to a particular protein or peptide target would not only increase our understanding of protein-protein interactions, but also aidin the generation of new therapeutics, diagnostics andresearch tools. Calmodulin (CaM) is an ideal system for studying the specificity of protein-protein interactions bycomputational design. CaM is a small Ca2 +-binding protein that binds to and regulates numerous proteins in vivo with high affinity, including smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) and CaM kinase I (CaMKI).In addition, several high-resolution CaM-peptide complexes have been solved by X-ray crystallography. Shifman and Mayo [1] successfully used the ORBIT computational design software to generate a CaMvariant with increased specificity toward the smMLCKpeptide. However, this feat was accomplished byoptimizing the interface between CaM and the smMLCKpeptide and did not use any negative design to disfavor thebinding of other CaM-binding peptides. In addition, thisvariant did not discriminate between the smMLCK andCaMKI peptides [2], indicating that there is potential forimprovement by including a negative design componentagainst the CaMKI target. Our current studies are focused on designing a CaM variant that can efficiently discriminate between thesmMLCK peptide and the CaMKI peptide byincorporating explicit negative design. Toward this goal,we are using ORBIT to optimize 25 CaM positions in the peptide-binding interface. Using an optimizationalgorithm written by graduate student Benjamin Allen, thepositions are simultaneously optimized on the CaM-smMLCK peptide structure (for a favorable solution) andthe CaM-CaMKI peptide structure (for an unfavorable solution). We are currently investigating various negative design scoring functions and parameters to obtain the mostfavorable results. Future experimental validation of thecomputationally designed variants will include tryptophanfluorescence titrations to determine the binding affinity ofCaM to the peptides. 1Graduate Option in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Caltech References [1] 100:13274-13279. 267. Computational design of a novel enzyme for catalysis of a pericyclic reaction J. Kyle Lassila1, Stephen L. Mayo We are working towards the goal of fully automated enzyme design. In particular, we hope to applycomputational protein design methods to the task ofcreating a completely novel catalyst for the Claisenrearrangement of chorismate to prephenate. Naturallycatalyzed by the chorismate mutases, this reaction offersmany desirable features as an early test of enzyme designmethods. The reaction is a first-order sigmatropicrearrangement of a single substrate and has neitherintermediate steps nor involvement of catalytic groupssuch as general acids or bases. The reaction has beenextensively studied in many contexts - as a rare enzyme- catalyzed pericyclic process, as an essential step in the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, and as a rareexample of a reaction that occurs through identicalmechanisms enzymatically and in solution. Our method ofenzyme design involves identifying amino acid sequenceslikely to bind to an ab initio transition state structure of the chorismate-prephenate rearrangement. As a part of thisprocess, we are testing new methods that allow translationand rotation of the transition state structure within abinding cavity while simultaneously optimizing proteinside chain identity and conformation. When the design procedure was applied to a natural Escherichia coli chorismate mutase active site, a mutation was predictedthat was shown experimentally to increase the catalyticefficiency of the enzyme [1]. These methods will begenerally applicable to the design of ligand binding sitesand enzyme active sites. The ability to computationallydesign new reaction catalysts can be expected to haveimportant implications for organic synthesis,bioremediation, and biotechnology. 1Graduate Option in Oelschlaeger, S.L.

Perryman*, Stephen HIV- inactivating protein that binds carbohydrate moietieslinked to the viral gp120 envelope protein. CV-N hasproven effective in preventing rectal and vaginal HIVinfections in macaques. CV-N also displays moderateactivity against influenza and Ebola. At physiologicaltemperatures CV-N is monomeric, but at room temperatureit is a complex mixture of monomers and domain-swappeddimers, which complicates experimental analysis of this system. Despite considerable effort, no crystallographic data have been developed that provide insight into themechanism by which the primary site of CV-N binds highmannose oligosaccharides on HIV envelope proteins. TheMayo Lab's ORBIT software was used to predict novelvariants of CV-N that preferentially stabilize themonomeric structure. We will now synthesize and testthese mutants. It is hoped that our variants will not displaythe crystal packing artifacts that prevent the acquisition ofstructural information on the mode by which a sugar bindsto the primary site of CV-N. Further, we intend to investigate the effect of designed multimerization on the anti-viral activity of CV-N. These studies should at leastfacilitate a greater understanding of the structure-functionrelationships that govern the anti-viral function of thisimportant protein. Results from these inquiries shouldhelp identify improvements to CV-N that will enhance itsbinding to HIV and therefore its utility as a therapeutic andpreventive agent.*Equal authorship 269. I mproved protein scoring functions using explicit solvent Barry D. Olafson, Stephen L. Mayo With our current design software, we can score the stabilities of various protein configurations veryquickly and use this information to select proteins withdesired properties. The scoring functions used withprotein design algorithms rely on the use of rotamerlibraries for amino acid sidechain placements and treat theeffects of solvent implicitly, usually by evaluating surfaceareas of solvent-exposed atoms. At the end of the initialdesign process, we generate a number of viable 3D proteinconfigurations (on the order of tens to hundreds) that are candidates for synthesis and experimental validation. We are now developing a follow-on procedure to reevaluatethese final candidate configurations with more extensivescoring functions that treat the effects of the solventexplicitly and also relax the requirement that the sidechainpositions conform to a given set of rotamers. Thecomputational requirements for this new procedure aresubstantial, but the expectation is that by using a more rigorous scoring function we can improve the probabilitythat we synthesize and validate the more usefulconfigurations from the candidates generated by the designalgorithms. With the new methods, we explicitly add solvent molecules to completely envelope the candidate protein configurations. The scoring function estimates the relativestabilities of various protein configurations, which dependsupon their internal structure and their additionalstabilization or destabilization due to solvent interactions.Because we have explicit solvent atoms and their positionsin the calculation, we are able to calculate the interactionbetween protein and solvent directly. In addition, weestimate the impact the presence of the protein has oncausing the solvent water molecules to reorganize and addthis contribution to the overall protein configuration score.It is essential that the combined system, protein and solvent, be allowed complete conformational freedom to allow the explicit water molecules to pack tightly to theprotein surface, and for the amino acid sidechains tooptimize their positions. Results to date indicate that thesethree general components (internal energies, proteininteractions with solvent, and solvent reorganization) allcontribute comparably for folded, stable proteins. 270. Bacteriorhodopsin-based bioelectronic devices: Developing optical data storageAlex L. Perryman, Stephen L. Mayo The Mayo group's approach to protein engineering has been used to design variants ofbacteriorhodopsin (BR) that could be useful in three-dimensional optical memory devices. We are trying tocreate mutants of BR that display an increased yield of theO state of its photo-cycle, so that they can be used as theprincipal component in two-photon volumetric memorydevices. Increasing the yield of the O state will increasethe percentage of BR molecules that traverse the branchedphoto-cycle shunt to arrive at the Q state, which has a half-life of 5 to 20 years. This branched photo-cycle can beexploited for the generation of bioelectronic devices by having the ground state represent bit 0 and by utilizing both the P and the Q states for bit 1. If we are able toengineer variants of BR that display the desired properties,this could both increase the speed and decrease the size ofcomputers by 300- to 1,000-fold, and it could also lead tothe creation of the principal component that would makeassociative memory devices possible (i.e., it couldfacilitate the development of true artificial intelligence). From the results of computational protein design calculations on the O-state crystal structure, the N-statecrystal structure, and the ground-state crystal structure of BR, we proposed four mutants for synthesis and testing. Professor Bob Birge's lab at the University of Connecticutis now determining both the Q[O] (the yield of the O state)and the Qtotal of our proposed mutants. Qtotal is arelative measure of how well several different aspects ofthe photo-cycle have been improved, with respect to the178 mutant's utility in the three-dimensional optical memory device. 271. Computational design of an enantioselective binding protein Heidi K. Privett1, Stephen L. Mayo Fully automated enzyme design can be envisioned as the solution to many complex syntheticorganic chemistry problems. Enzymes are ideal catalystsof organic reactions because of their extremely high ratesof catalysis and their ability to perform a wide variety ofchemical transformations with extreme regio- andenantioselectivity. With an increasing demand forenantiomerically pure, complex, biologically activecompounds (i.e., drugs), synthetic chemists will have to look beyond standard chemical strategies in favor of the high yields and strict selectivity of enzymatic reactions.Designed enzymes will not be restricted to the reactionsaccessible by natural enzymes, broadening the range ofpossible substrates and products. Kinetic resolution is a powerful method for transforming a racemic starting material into anenantiomerically pure product. Our goal is to show that anenzyme can be designed to carry out a kinetic resolutionusing the enantioselective hydrolysis of 2-phenyl-4-benzylphenyloxazolin-5-one (FOX) to produce N-benzoyl- L-phenylalanine as a model system. As a first step in the design of this enzyme, we will make a protein capable of selectively binding L-FOX and then design catalyticfunctionality into the optimized binding protein. We have used the ORBIT protein design software to design an optimal binding pocket around an internallyand externally flexible L-FOX structure using thehyperthermophilic T. thermophilus protein aspartate amino transferase as a scaffold. Within context of apoly-alanine scaffold, the location and conformation oftwo important binding residues were first chosen based onthe geometric constraints between the ligand and the sidechains that describe \"optimal\" contacts. The remainder of the binding pocket residues were repacked around thecatalytic residues and the ligand, resulting in a twelve-foldmutant, named 1GCK-FFBP. We are currently evaluatingthe binding of FOX to 1GCK-FFBP using fluorescenceanisotropy and attempting to determine the protein's effecton the enantiomeric enrichment of the product. Oncebinding of the ligand has been established, catalyticresidues that support hydrolysis of the L-enantiomer ofFOX can be introduced into the binding pocket. 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech272. Preservation and diversity of function in designed combinatorial libraries of GFP Thomas P. Treynor, Christina L. Vizcarra1, Daniel Nedelcu2, Stephen L. Mayo Protein engineering is inefficient if each new protein functions identically to the one before it or not atall. In order to determine which of seven library-designalgorithms best introduces new protein function withoutdestroying it altogether, seven combinatorial libraries ofgreen fluorescent protein (GFP) variants were designedand synthesized. Each was evaluated by distributions ofemission intensity and color compiled from measurementsmade in vivo . Additional comparisons were made with a library constructed by error-prone PCR. Among the designed libraries, fluorescent function was preserved forthe greatest fraction of samples in a library designed usinga novel structure-based computational method. A trendwas observed towards greater diversity of color indesigned libraries that better preserved fluorescence.Contrary to trends observed for libraries constructed byerror-prone PCR, preservation of function was observed toincrease with a library's average mutation level among thefour libraries designed with structure-based computationalmethods. 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 2SURF student, undergraduate MIT 273. E lectronic structure and stability of fluorescent proteins from designed libraries Thomas P. Treynor, Christina L. Vizcarra1, Marco A. Mena2, Daniel Nedelcu3, Barry D. Olafson, Patrick S. Daugherty2, Stephen L. Mayo In order to investigate structure-function relationships with a reductive approach that is more thorough and nuanced than site-directed mutagenesis, one would ideally have many differently functional variantsrelated by the permutation of a small set of mutations. Inthis way, one would isolate the effects of many individualmutations in many different contexts. Not just anycombinatorial library will do; however, since randommutations at random positions are not likely to affectprotein function except to destroy it altogether. Bytargeting positions close to green fluorescent protein'schromophore with mutations that have beencomputationally pre-screened for their effects on stability,we have generated considerable spectral diversity in a library of only 29 variants. We have sequenced many of these functional variants and show that three of ninedesigned mutations are chiefly responsible for much of theobserved diversity of function. Using these mutations andthe T203Y mutation that defines the class of yellowfluorescent proteins, we have constructed andcharacterized a quadruple mutant cycle for whichsubstantial emission is observed in vivo for 12 of 16 variants. We find that the effects of these four mutationson emission and excitation spectra can be quite differentdepending on context. Many observations suggest that179 vibronic mechanisms underlie much of the observed spectral changes. 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 2Department of Chemical Engineering, UCSB 3SURF student, undergraduate MIT 274. Improved continuum electrostatic and solvation for protein design Christina Vizcarra1, Frederick E. Tan2, Stephen L. MayoComputational protein design protocols use energy functions to score interactions between pairs ofsidechains in the context of a given fold. These energyfunctions guide the search for a sequence or library ofsequences that will stabilize the folded structure. Theaccuracy of the energy function is a limiting factor indesigning stable, well-folded proteins and can also hinderefforts in enzyme design. We are interested in improvingthe energy terms that correspond to electrostatic interactions and the solvation of polar groups in the ORBIT protein design program. To this end, we haveincorporated into ORBIT the Finite Difference PoissonBoltzmann (FDPB) model, which is generally considered astandard for accuracy among continuum electrostaticsmodels. In order to use the FDPB model for proteindesign, we formulated it to be compatible with 'two-body'scoring functions, where each 'body' is a sidechainconformation. We have found that, for the FDPB solverDelPhi, using approximate representations of the proteinsurface and a two-body energy model, it is possible to reproduce the results of traditional FDPB calculations in which the entire dielectric environment around the proteinis defined. Using this model, we have designed a variantof the all alpha-helical protein, Drosophila engrailed homeodomain, by only varying the identities of aminoacids on the protein surface. Experimentalcharacterization of this designed sequence has shown thatit is thermophilic and unfolds at a higher temperature thansequences designed using electrostatic heuristics to biassequence composition. This result shows that the two-body requirement of most protein design protocols does not preclude use of an FDPB model. This study also underscores the power of electrostatic optimization of aprotein's surface as a means to stabilize the folded state. 1Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Caltech 2Graduate Option in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Caltech 275. Force field development for protein design Eric Zollars1, Stephen L. Mayo Protein design is an exceptionally difficult problem characterized by unique complications.Necessary restrictions such as a fixed backbone anddiscrete side-chain conformations require differentconsiderations of structure-energy relationships than otherfields of protein simulation. This structure-energyrelationship is the focus of our recent research, which hopes to address issues including the identity of the forcesthat lead to protein stability and the relative strengths ofthese forces. Additionally, the mathematicalrepresentation of these forces must be relatively simple toallow for tractable design calculations. It is thought that local side-chain-backbone interactions are responsible for a great deal of the basicstructure of proteins. A purely physical representation ofthese interactions is complex due to the small distancesinvolved. An accurate statistical treatment of theseinteractions may allow for better designs in areas ofprotein secondary structure. We are thereforeinvestigating the utility of including a statistically-basedsecondary structure propensity term in the force field. An entropic term has also been added to the forces considered during a design calculation. It is oftenobserved that an enthalpic-entropic \"balance\" occurs in proteins. Simply, a protein's overall stability is a result of contributions from entropic and enthalpic components.Since most of the other energy terms used in proteindesign are enthalpic in nature, the addition of an entropicterm is a useful feature. A previous component of this research included the development of a method to allow for quickparameterization of the energy terms used in the designcalculations. The use of a large database ofthermodynamic data to arrive at useful parameters wasdropped because of the large relative errors within the database. The current method is based on the assumption that naturally occurring protein sequences are nearlyoptimal for their respective structures [1]. This methodwill achieve parameters that are not perfectly optimized,but because of the conservative nature of this approach, theparameters are expected to lead to stable designed proteins. 1Graduate Option in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Caltech Reference [1] Kuhlman, B. and Baker, D.

Understanding how modernmicroorganisms with archaic metabolisms function is anecessary step toward this end. Due to the basic nature of our questions, and the fact that many microenvironments on Earth today are anaerobic (such as the environmentsthat characterize the majority of bacterial infections), thispath of inquiry leads inexorably to insights about cellularelectron transfer mechanisms that have broad relevance. Because rocks provide the primary record of ancient events and processes, microbe-mineral interactionsare our focus. In particular, we investigate how bacteriacatalyze mineral formation, transformation, anddissolution, with a focus on how these processes arerelated to cellular energy generation and how they affectthe geochemistry of their environment. For every metabolism that we study, we work with model organisms that we can genetically manipulate. Through acombination of classical genetic, biochemical, andmolecular biological approaches, we identify the genes andgene products that control the processes of interest. By understanding the way extant organisms function at themolecular level, we hope eventually to gain insights intothe evolution of ancient metabolic and biomineralizationpathways, interpret the chemical signatures of early lifefound in the geologic record, and viewed as living a primarily planktonic lifestyle. In the last decade, however, it hasbecome more apparent that bacteria spend much of their lives as surface-attached microbial communities, i.e., biofilms, and it has been suggested that this biofilmlifestyle may account for the remarkable persistence ofbacterial populations in the face of changingenvironmental conditions. Biofilms are composed ofmany hundreds of cells, each of which experiences it ownmicroenvironment due to strong chemical gradients thatare established by metabolism and diffusion. Biofilmcommunities are therefore heterogeneous and spatiallystratified, such that the environments within differentregions of the biofilm can vary markedly. Although muchis known about how biofilms form, develop and detach, very little is understood about how these events are related to metabolism and its dynamics. It is commonly thoughtthat large sub-populations of cells within biofilms aredead, but it may be that within the growth inactivedomains of biofilms, significant populations of living cellscontinue to persist and retain the capacity to dynamicallyregulate their metabolism. To explore the spatiometabolic stratification of developing and mature biofilms, versatility. S. oneidensis can use oxygen and many other lower potential substrates, including metals, as electron acceptors inrespiration, making it an attractive experimental system inwhich to explore domains of metabolism within a biofilm.To study this metabolic patterning, we have fused differentpromoters to the unstable green fluorescent proteingfp(AAV) , such that the activity of the promoter can be tracked by measuring fluorescence levels in vivo over the course of biofilm development. The ribosomal promoterrrnB P1 is being used to measure growth activity levels. Fluorescence levels from this promoter/GFP system havebeen shown to be a good indicator of cell growth and replication. To determine if metabolism (i.e., protein synthesis and energy generation) might occur in regionswhere cells are not actively growing, the promoter formtrB , a gene expressed under anaerobic conditions, is used. We are growing the biofilms in a flow cell systemand imaging them using confocal fluorescencemicroscopy. Using this technique we can correlate thelevel of fluorescence we see using microscopy withmetabolic activity and can determine the regions of thebiofilm in which cells are the most metabolically active aswell as explore how quickly this state can change in response to environmental perturbations. We have developed a quantitative routine to compare these domainsof activity among independently grown biofilms. We have found that S. oneidensis biofilm structures stereotypically stratify with respect to growthactivity and metabolism as a function of their size. Withindomains of growth inactive cells, genes typically182 upregulated under anaerobic conditions are expressed well after growth has ceased. These findings reveal that, farfrom being dead, the majority of cells in mature S. oneidensis biofilms have actively turned on metabolic programs appropriate to their local microenvironment anddevelopmental stage. We are continuing to investigate what defines and controls the capabilities and activities of this growth state, as this information is not only essentialfor understanding basic aspects of biofilm biology, but isalso is also extremely relevant for applications that aim toexploit the metabolic activity of biofilms for energyconversion and other purposes 277. Characterization of a bacterial arsenate respiratory reductase Davin Malasarn, Dianne K. gram- negative bacterium Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 represents a highly conserved group of enzymes that allowsome microbes to gain energy by reducing arsenate,As(V), to arsenite, As(III), in the absence of oxygen. Thisprocess is environmentally relevant (1), and understandingits biochemical mechanism may provide valuableinformation about how anaerobic respiration evolved toallow the utilization of such diverse substrates arsenate,nitrate, DMSO, and selenate. We have overexpressed the arsenate respiratory reductase from ANA-3 in E. coli and isolated wild-type and mutant forms for characterization. The reductase is stable as a heterodimer consisting of ArrA and ArrB, and both subunits are required to transfer electrons from theelectron donor methyl to arsenate. Alternatesubstrates such as selenate, nitrate, sulfate, tungstate,molybdate, and phosphate do not get reduced by theenzyme, nor do they serve to inhibit arsenate reduction.ArrA contains a twin-arginine translocation (TAT) signal,suggesting that it is secreted to the periplasm of ANA-3(2). However, this signal is not required for proper proteinsynthesis, and a truncation lacking the TAT signal is stillactive. In contrast, W293A and K295A mutations result incomplete loss of activity. The role of W 293 and K 295 is unknown, and current efforts are focused on thecrystallization of ArrAB in the hopes of identifying thesubstrate-binding site of the reductase. Additionally,kinetic, analytical, and spectroscopic characterization isbeing completed, and systematic mutational analysis isbeing performed to identify additional residues that areimportant for function. Lastly, as a member of the DMSOreductase family, ArrAB requires molybdenum, iron, andsulfur to function. Through our studies, we hope tounderstand the coordination and redox properties of thesecofactors. This will allow us to understand how enzymes within this family are individually fine-tuned for each mode of respiration.

Newman Several members of the genus Pseudomonas excrete of a class of brilliantly colored compounds, called the phenazine derivatives, in stationary phase. Theseredox-active compounds are taken up and reduced by thebacteria, and then shuttle to extracellular substrates forreoxidation. Given that electron transfer reactions fuelcellular metabolism, and stationary-phase cells are oftenthought to be limited for metabolic substrates (such as theterminal electron acceptor oxygen), it is often thought thatintracellular reductants accumulate in stationary phase dueto the lack of a suitable electron acceptor. Wehypothesized that phenazine reduction could allow for disposal of excess reducing power, and significantly affect the intracellular redox state of stationary-phase cells. Totest this, we redox state of NAD(H), a majorintracellular redox cofactor, throughout the thephenazine-producing opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, as well as a P. aeruginosa mutant that is unable to produce phenazines. We found that the NAD(H) pool was significantly more reduced in stationary phase ina phenazine-null mutant relative to the wild type. Thisresult implies that P. aeruginosa is able to utilize phenazine reduction as a mechanism for the maintenanceof redox homeostasis. Consistent with this, addition ofpyocyanin, a major phenazine produced by P. aeruginosa, to the phenazine-null mutant leads to a decrease in theNADH/NAD+ ratio. We are interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying phenazine redox cycling in P. aeruginosa. We plan to perform a mutant screen toidentify genes required for phenazine reduction.Additionally, we have identified genes in the sequenced P. aeruginosa genome that potentially encode enzymesresponsible for the reduction of flavins, another class of common intracellular redox cofactors. Flavins bear strong structural and chemical similarities to phenazines, leadingus to postulate that enzymes annotated as putative flavin-reducing proteins may actually serve to catalyze phenazinereduction. We will evaluate this hypothesis throughtargeted mutagenesis and characterization of whole-celland cell-free extract phenazine reduction activity. 279. Production and function of 2-methylhopanoids inRhodopseudomonas palustris Sky Rashby, Alex Sessions *, Dianne K. Newman The diagenetic derivatives of 2-methylbacteriohopanepolyols have been utilized extensively as biomarkers for cyanobacteria and, byassociation, oxygenic photosynthesis. Recently, we haveidentified quantitatively significant production of thesecompounds in the alpha proteobacteriumRhodopseudomonas palustris growing phototrophically183 under anoxic conditions. This suggests that these compounds cannot be used as markers of oxygenicphotosynthesis, and cause us to rethink when thismetabolism evolved. Additionally, preliminary datasuggest that specific modes of phototrophic growth maypromote the production of these compounds in R. palustris , implying physiological functions that may refine our use of bacteriohopanoid biomarkers aspaleoenvironmental proxies. Our future goals are toidentify their cellular function, as well as to understandtheir biosynthetic pathway. *Assistant Professor of Geobiology, Caltech morphogenesis using Synechocystis PCC6803 Mike Tice, John Grotzinger*, Dianne Newman Stromatolites are laminated, three-dimensional structures found in sedimentary rocks deposited as early as 3.5 billion years ago. Many macroscopic morphologies are known, including domes, cones, and branched orunbranched columns, and sizes range from millimeters totens of meters. Nearly all known modern analogs aredominated by microbial mats, and consequently, nearly allgeologic interpretation of these structures has been interms of benthic microbial communities thought todominate construction and morphogenesis. However, verylittle is known about how specific biological processescontribute to ultimate stromatolite shape, or whystromatolites should develop three-dimensional relief at all. Indeed, modeling suggests that many types of stromatolites could be formed by simple microscopicgrowth laws that may not be unique to specific groups oforganisms. We are conducting experiments designed toexplore macroscopic spatial arrangement of populations ofseveral species of bacteria under a range of autotrophic andheterotrophic growth conditions. Preliminary resultssuggest that a diffusible signal may be involved inorganizing colonies of a unicellular cyanobacterium,Synechocystis PCC6803. Future experiments will examine the effect of chemical precipitation simultaneous to matgrowth on overall mat/stromatolite morphology. *Professor of Geobiology, GPS division, 281. Role of sec ondary metabolites in biofilm communitiesItzel Ramos, Dianne K. NewmanSecondary metabolites are often defined as chemical compounds that are non-essential for growth,development or survival of the producing organisms. Thisidea has relegated their function(s) to a merely adaptiveadvantage conferred by their known anti-microbialactivities. Recent studies, however, have uncovered the possibility that secondary metabolites have primary physiological roles. Phenazines, for instance, which areredox-active compounds produced by pseudomonadspecies, seem to act as signaling factors up-regulating anumber of different genes (1). Also, because of theirredox properties, it has been suggested that phenazinesmight act as electron shuttles to power oxidation of NADHwhen oxygen is limited (2). We are presently investigating the physiological functions of phenazines in biofilmcommunities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Biofilms are thought to be the most common form of bacterial growthin nature. In these structures oxygen limitation could be achallenge for bacterial survival, but phenazines might be participating actively to maintain redox homeostasis. First, we are analyzing biofilm development of mutant strainspartially or totally impaired in their ability to producephenazines. Second, to track expression of genes involvedin phenazine production, we are constructingtranscriptional fusions of unstable florescent proteins.This will allow us to determine where and whenphenazines are produced during biofilm development, aswell as to investigate the effect of different environmentalfactors in the production of phenazines. Also, takingadvantage of the fluorescent properties of thesecompounds, we are exploring the possibility to detect phenazines directly in biofilms using two-photon microscopy. Our general hypothesis is that during thecourse or biofilm development and maturation, theproduction of phenazines will follow specific patternsdepending on the local environmental conditions,specifically oxygen concentration. These studies willbring insight into how phenazines might contribute tosurvival of biofilm communities. Publications (1) Dietrich, Tice, Newman, D.K. (2006) Curr. Biol. 16:R395-R400.

NewmanCertain bacteria are known to frequently transfer electrons outside their cell to insoluble or inaccessibleelectron acceptors using either direct surface-mediatedelectron transfer or soluble redox-active electron shuttles.We have been studying this process in two systems:surface-mediated reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) aeruginosa PA14 biofilms. In oneidensis system, during the characterization of the extracellular nature of the DMSOreductase complex, we determined that, although localizedon the exterior surface of the cell, the complex wasprotease resistant in whole cells or cell lysates, unlike thecase for the highly related DMSO reductase from E. coli . Additionally, we developed quantitative assays for DMSOreductase activity and analyzed S. oneidensis mutant strains defective in components co-expressed with the DMSO reductase, as well as mutants defective in proteinexport that affect the DMSO reductase of this organism. In the P. aeruginosa system, we are using a novel flow cell capable of performing electrochemical analyses(the E-Tongue III) to analyze and electrochemicallymanipulate biofilms of this organism. Our initial184 experiments have determined when pyocyanin production by strain PA14 is electrochemically detectable in the E-Tongue biofilms and we currently correlating thisanalysis with biosynthetic geneexpression in the using fluorescent transcriptionalreporters. Additionally, we are examining the metabolic state of PA14 cells in biofilms using a ribosomal RNA fluorescent transcriptional reporter and whether we canalter that state by electrochemical water-splittinggeneration of H 2 or O 2 gas beneath the biofilm with the E- Tongue. Follow-up studies will examine whetherpyocyanin production by PA14 influences the metabolicstate under these conditions. 283. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 's SoxR is activated by phenazine antibiotics and controls genes that regulate phenazine shuttlingLars E.P. Dietrich, Alexa Price Whelan, Dianne K. Newman The transcription factor SoxR is well characterized in E. coli as a stress response regulator. Upon exposure to superoxide-generating compounds,SoxR induces the transcription of more than 60 genesinvolved in protection from harmful oxygen radicals.Homologues of E. coli SoxR are present in a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting aconserved response to superoxide. The opportunisticpathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa apparently does not comply with this paradigm: P. aeruginosa's SoxR does not control any of the genes typically involved in theconversion of superoxide, but instead regulates theexpression of two transporters and a monooxygenase. Thisprovoked two questions: (i) What is the function of theSoxR regulon in P. aeruginosa? (ii) Does SoxR respondto signals other than superoxide? A defining characteristicofP. aeruginosa is the production of phenazines. These are colorful, redox-active antibiotics that shuttle in and outof the cell. Reduced phenazines can generate superoxide,which contributes to virulence in eukaryotic infectionmodels. Affymetrix GeneChips analyzed theeffect of the phenazine pyocyanin on P. aeruginosa gene expression and found a specific response with only 22genes being up regulated, amongst them the completeSoxR regulon. This established pyocyanin as anendogenous activator of address the function ofits regulon we deleted soxR and detected a dramatic defect in the cell's ability to reduce phenazines. This could bedue to the lack of SoxR itself or to the missingupregulation of SoxR target genes. The latter turned out tobe correct as deletion of one of the target genes, encodinga MFS (major facilitator superfamily) transporter, alsoprevented phenazine reduction. We speculate that the MFS transporter is required for phenazine import. Based on our findings that phenazines activate SoxR and that theSoxR response is required for the reduction of phenazines,we propose that in P. aeruginosa SoxR and its regulon adapted to specifically ensure the redox shuttling ofphenazines.284. A role for phenazine antibiotics in contributing to iron acquisitionYun Wang, Dianne K. Newman In aerobic environments, Fe is present as insoluble Fe(III) minerals, causing the available Feconcentration ([Fe 3+(aq)] = 10-17 M) to be ten orders of magnitude lower than the concentration needed forbacterial growth (>10 -7 M). It is well known that P. aeruginosa can acquire iron via the production ofsiderophores (pyoverdin and pyochelin) to dissolve Fe(III)minerals by forming Fe(III)-siderophore complexes insolution. We are testing the hypothesis that P. aeruginosa may be even more effective at acquiring iron via theproduction of redox-active phenazine antibiotics, whichcan function as extracellular electron shuttles to reduce andsubsequently dissolve Fe(III) minerals. Our studiessuggest that clinical- and reduction. Phenazine reactivity properties, morespecifically, the phenazine structure with lower reductionpotential yields higher rates of Fe(III) reduction. Phenazine reactivity is influenced by environmentalfactors, e.g., the reaction rate is higher at lower pH; the reaction is more likely to happen in the presence of thepoorly crystalline Fe(III) (hydr)oxide Fe(III) dissolution synergistically, and we are working on understanding the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon. 285. Genetic identification of phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation systems Yongqin Jiao, Laura Croal *, ferrous iron[Fe(II)] to reductive CO 2 fixation using light energy, but little is known about the molecular basis for this process.Using Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain TIE-1 as a model organism, we report the discovery of three genesnecessary for phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation. De novo synthesis of a unique soluble c-type cytochrome of approximately 40 KDa was identified under Fe(II) Mass spectrometry indicates that it is adecaheme in the sequenced stain R. palustris CGA009. Using primers based on CGA009, three consecutive open reading frames (ORFs),designated as pio genes (p hototrophic i ron o xidation), were found in TIE-1. under Fe(II) contains a signal sequence characteristic of secreted proteins. The amino acid sequence of PioAexhibits 38% identity to MtrA in Shewanella found were designated pioB and pioC . RT-PCR results indicate that these three ORFs are arranged in an operon.pioB encodes a putative outer membrane beta-barrel185 protein and the N-terminal sequence contains a potential signal for secretion. PioB is 21% identical to the outer membrane in S. oneidensis MR-1. pioC encodes a putative high and it contains a twin-arginine translocation (tat)signal. The amino sequence of PioC exhibits 44% a putative iron oxidase (Iro) from Acidothiobacillus ferroxidans . Deletion of pioABC resulted in the loss of Fe(II) oxidation activity but did not affect growth on othersubstrates. Complementation studies confirmed that thisphenotype was due to the loss of the pio operon. D eletion ofpioA alone resulted in loss of almost all Fe(II) oxidation activity, however, deletion of either pioB or pioC alone resulted in partial loss of Fe(II) oxidation activity. Theseresults suggest that proteins encoded by the pio operon interact, and are essential and specific for phototrophicFe(II) oxidation in R. palustris . The Fe(II) oxidation Rhodobacter sp. SW2. collaboration with Laura Croal, we investigated the Fe(II) oxidation system in another purple nonsulfurbacterium Rhodobacter sp. SW2 that had previously been isolated by Fritz Widdel et al . For practical purposes, SW2 is not amenable to traditional genetic analysisbecause it does not form single colonies on agar plates.Thus, to identify genes involved in Fe(II) phototrophy bySW2, we expressed a genomic cosmid strainin its close relative Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 and screened cell suspensions of each clone Fe(II) oxidation activity. We enhanced Fe(II) oxidation activity when The operon, foxE , encodes a c-type cytochrome with no similarity to other known proteins. Expression of foxE alone confers light-dependent Fe(II) oxidation activity to SB1003, however, maximalactivity is achieved when foxE is expressed with the downstream genes foxY and foxZ . Sequence analysis suggests that protein containing the redox third gene in thisoperon, foxZ , is predicted to encode a protein with transport function. Together, our results suggest that the foxEYZ operon encodes proteins that play key in the deposition ofbanded iron formations (BIFs). Both molecular hydrogen (H 2) and Fe(II) can serve as electron donors for anoxygenic photosynthesis and are predicted to have beenpresent in the atmosphere and ocean of the Archean inquantities sufficient for phototrophic energy metabolism. If H 2, given its more favorable redox potential compared to Fe(II), were the preferred substrate for anoxygenic phototrophs, the presence of H 2 in an Archean atmosphere/ocean may have precluded the involvement ofphototrophs capable of Fe(II) photoautotrophy in thedeposition of BIFs. In collaboration with Laura Croal, weinvestigated the effect of H 2 on rates of Fe(II) oxidation by cell suspensions of R. palustris TIE-1 and Rhodobacter sp. SW2. We found that Fe(II) oxidation still proceeds underan atmosphere containing ~3 times the maximum predicted concentration of H 2 in the Archean, as long as CO 2 is abundant. Thus, it seems that the presence of H 2 in an Archean atmosphere would not have posed a barrier toFe(II) photoautotrophy, given the high estimates of CO 2 at this time, consistent with the hypothesis that Fe(II) oxidizing phototorphs may have catalyzed ancient BIF deposition. *Graduate student, Division of Biology, Caltech Reference Widdel, F., Schnell, S., Heising, S., Ehrenreich, A., Assmus, B. and Schink, B.

The electron transportpathway for phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation, however, is encoding a that transfers electrons from Fe(II) to subsequent electron carriers during TIE-1 growth on Fe(II). Currently, I am trying to overexpress and purify PioA in E. coli so that the mechanism by which it oxidizes Fe(II) can be unraveled.pioA was PCR amplified and cloned into the overexpression vector pETGEX. The resulting plasmidwas sequenced and will be transformed into E. coli BL21 for overexpression and purification. In order to assist the purification of PioA, I am also developing an activity assay for Fe(II) oxidation byTIE-1 cell extracts. The spectrum of the soluble fraction isolated from TIE- 1lysate contained peaks indicative of c- type cytochromes. These c-type cytochromes were first oxidized by treatment with potassium ferricyanide. After dialysis to remove excess potassium ferricyanide, sampleswill be reacted with Fe(II) under anaerobic conditions andchanges in cytochrome c peaks (from the oxidized form to the reduced form) will be monitoredspectrophotometrically to determine whether some c-type cytochrome(s) in the soluble fraction are able to react withFe(II). As a negative control, these experiments will alsobe performed on the extracts of a pioA deletion mutant of TIE-1.186 287. Anoxygenic phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation NewmanRhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 is a purple sulfur,\u0001-proteobacteria that can oxidize soluble Fe(II) in a light-dependent manner. Interestingly, R. capsulatus SB1003, unlike its close relative Rhodobacter ferrooxidans SW2, cannot grow photoautotrophically using solubleFe(II) as a sole source of electrons. However, it can growphotoautotrophically using Fe(II) as a source of electronsif the Fe(II) is chelated with an agent such as nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). It is feasible that the chelator facilitates Fe(II) oxidation by altering the reductionpotential of Fe(II) oxidation. We have tested biological chelators to see if they can stimulate Fe(II) based photoautotrophic growth in R. capsulatus SB1003. When Fe(II)-citrate is provided as an electron source it resulted in high levels of bacterialgrowth. While citrate is an excellent nutrient source formany microbes it is not used by R. capsulatus SB1003 as a sole source of carbon and energy under phototrophic conditions. However, Fe(III)-citrate is a photochemically active species and in the presence of light is rapidlyconverted to Fe(II) and acetoacetic acid.

Theseviruses contain an RNA genome of about 11,000 nucleotides and are enveloped, having a lipid envelope that surrounds an icosahedral nucleocapsid. Both alphavirusesand flaviviruses are vectored by mosquitoes or otherhematophagous arthropods and infect both their arthropodvectors as well as a wide range of vertebrates. We wish tounderstand the replication of alphaviruses and flavivirusesat a molecular level and to study the evolution of these twovirus groups and more broadly the evolution of all RNAviruses. The flaviviruses contain about 70 members, most of which are important human pathogens causing hundreds of millions of cases of human disease annually, which include hemorrhagic fevers and encephalitis. West Nilevirus, which first appeared in the Americas seven yearsago in New York state and then spread rapidly over mostof the United States, is a member of this family. Otherimportant flaviviruses include yellow fever virus anddengue virus. The alphaviruses consist of about 30members of which several cause encephalitis, polyarthritis,or febrile illnesses in humans. Although the alphaviruses and flaviviruses are not closely related, the structures of the virions in the twogroups have been found recently to be related. One of the two glycoproteins present on the exterior of the virions, called E in the case of flaviviruses and E1 in alphaviruses,are structurally identical. There are other similarities inthe structures of the virions in the two groups, includingthe formation of a heterodimer between E or E1 and thesecond external glycoprotein that function in an equivalentfashions. It seems clear that the virus structures, althoughthey differ in important ways, are derived from a commonancestral source. We have suggested that this commonstructure may be important in the life of these viruses asarboviruses, capable of infecting both hematophagous arthropods and vertebrates. We have started an ambitious collaboration with structural biologists at Purdue University to determine thestructures of alphaviruses and flaviviruses to highresolution, and to determine the structures of all of theproteins encoded by the viruses to atomic resolution. Wehave now determined the structure of dengue virus to 9.5\u00c5 and the structure of immature dengue virus that contains uncleaved prM to 11 \u00c5. This resolution is high enoughthat the glycoproteins can be positioned with confidence inthe virus particle, that carbohydrate side chains of theglycoproteins can be seen, and even the membranespanning domains that anchor the glycoproteins can be identified and traced. One interesting result from such analysis is that protein E has a different bend in the virionfrom that in the immature virus, and that this bend alsodiffers in the crystallized forms of E. Of even greaterinterest is the fact that E undergoes large structuralrearrangements upon conversion of the immature virus tothe mature form and again upon conversion of the maturevirus to the fusion-competent form. We are extendingthese structural studies by constructing viruses withmutations in various proteins in order to study theinteractions among proteins required for virus assembly.Such studies are important not only for our understanding of virus replication, but will be useful in the design of antivirals or of vaccines to control these important diseaseagents. 288. The fun ction of yellow fever envelope protein in virus assemblyMarlene Biller, Brian Blood, Maria FarkasYellow fever belongs to the Flaviviridae family, which are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. Theviral envelope (E) protein of yellow fever virus has severalmajor functions, including receptor attachment and membrane fusion, and it also carries the major antigenic epitopes leading to a protective immune response. Eproteins in mature virions form 90 head-to-tail dimers thatlie parallel and completely cover the viral membrane.Dimers of E protein have also been fitted into thecryoelectron density envelope of Dengue virus and therehas been interest in determining how important dimerformation by E protein is for the overall configuration (andperhaps the stability) of flaviviruses. The E protein has anelongated shape and is composed of three major parts: acentral domain that contains the N-terminal region(domain I), the fusion and dimerization domain (domain II), and a C-terminal putative receptor-binding domain (domain III). A set of mutants have been made toinvestigate dimer formation. These mutants are in contactregions of the homodimer and were carefully selected,based on where they are located in the protein and whetherthey are conserved among flaviviruses. We have nine mutations in the E protein to the current time. Three are in domain II: F1 mutation E251 K,F2 mutation E251Q, and F3 mutation S253P to insert ahelix breaker. There are four in domain III: F4 F6 consists of an insertion of three Ala residues at aa 155 in domain I. The mutations were madein a transient expression vector, and all of them have beenintroduced into the full-length yellow fever virus clone(pACNR vector). RNA is transcribed in vitro and used to transfect BHK cells. RNA replication is detected by188 immunofluorescence, and virus infectivity is checked by plaque assay. All the mutants in domain III altered the infectivity. F4 and F5 were not infectious. A mutantcalled F4a was made, where aa T313-G314 were replacedby alanines, instead of deleted, as in F4. F4a had very low infectivity. Immunofluorescence showed primarily single cells transfected, so the infectivity is probably caused byrevertants. RT-PCR will be done to check the sequence ofthe plaque. It is interesting that this change in F4a (TG toAA) affected the virus infectivity this much. had low infectivity. The infectivity of F8 wasprobably caused by revertants. The domain III area is veryimportant for the virus, and the areas we have been lookingat probably cover the fusion peptide in the opposite Eprotein. Mutant F1 in domain II had nearly no infectivitywhen titered with plaque assay of 1h transfected cells, butbecome infectious when doing a plaque assay of 3-day transfected cells, probably due to revertants. Mutants F2 and F3 in domain II had low infectivity.Mutant F6 in domain I was less infectious than wild typeand gave plaques of significant smaller size. Next we willpurify the virus and crosslink the E proteins to see if theyproduce dimers. We have also started to do some doublemutants. The ones we are most interested in at themoment are F1, F4a and F8. We are going to put F4atogether with F1 and with F8, to see if that affects thedimerization. Since the mutants we are most interested inare the ones with no or very low infectivity, the challenge for us now is to produce enough particles of those mutants to send to Purdue for cryo-electron currently working with three different alphaviruses: Sindbis, Ross River and Aura virus. Theyare members of the Togaviridae family. They contain a plus-strand RNA genome in an icosahedral nucleocapsid,surrounded by a lipid envelope. Alphaviruses 240copies three structural proteins: twotransmembranal glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and a capsid protein. The structural proteins of Alphavirusea are translated from a 26S subgenomic RNA as a polyprotein.The capsid protein is cleaved by the viral capsidautoprotease shortly after synthesis, and in ER PE2(precursor of E2) and E1 are trimers aredelivered to the plasma membrane, by furin, to form E2and E3. The last four amino acids of E3 (aa 61-64 in SINand RR) contain the furin recognition sequence (R-X-R-Ror R-X-K-R) in almost all alphaviruses. PE2 containing particles have been produced for Semliki Forest virus and shown to be non-infectious. We want to produce PE2 containing particles of Sindbis, Ross River and Aura for structural studies. Weare removing the furin cleavage sites between E3 and E2in ofSKR62-64). For Ross River we have done two mutantsRRI2 (creates a N-glycosylation site) and RRI3 (deletionmutant). For Aura virus we plans to do the N-glycosylation mutant and the deletion mutant. We have cloned all the Sindbis and Ross River mutants intofull-length cDNA clones. Sindbis results : They were infectious, but grew to a lower titer than wt. We have determined that the virus produceddid contain PE2 by protein gel electrophoresis and withWestern blots stained with anti E2 antibody. We sentpreparations of SB I3 and SBI4 purified on sucrosegradients to Purdue University for EM and Cryo EM andare awaiting the results. We are very interested in theN-glycosylation mutants, because the additional glycan might be visible on the Cryo-EM, and thereby showing the furin cleavage site is in the particle. Ross River result : The Ross River deletion mutant was not infectious. We have collected and purified particlesproduced from electroporation. The N-glycosylationmutant was less infectious that wt. We have doneinfections and purified the virus. These samples are alsosent to Purdue University for EM and Cryo EM. 290. Flexibility of yellow fever E protein Marlene Biller, Ashley GrantThe flavivirus E protein (which was described in the preceding abstract) adapts different conformations in immature and mature virus particles and in its low pHfusion competent configuration. The immature flavivirusparticle contains 60 trimers of prM-E heterodimers. TheprM protein covers the E protein, and protects it fromundergoing premature fusion when passing through theacidic compartments and vesicles of the trans Golginetwork. Following cleavage of prM by furin the virusenter its mature state in which the E proteins form 90 head-to-tail dimers that lie parallel to and completely cover theviral membrane. After entering cells by receptor-mediatedendocytosis, fusion with the host membrane is initiated by a low pH-induced conformational change of the E protein. Thus, flexibility of the E protein is a functionalrequirement for both assembly and infection. Zhang et al. (Structure , Vol. 12, September, 2004) compared crystal structures of Dengue sE and the structures of the Emonomer in the immature and mature virions and foundthat the E protein can bend about a hinge between domainII and domains I plus III. By fitting the E glycoproteininto the cryo-electron microscopy maps of both immatureand mature dengue virus, they showed that duringmaturation DI+DIII reorients with respect to the viral membrane and the hinge angle changes. Similarly rearrangement of E into a fusion competent state involvesan even larger hinge motion. We have mutated a numberof conserved glycine and alanine residues in the hingeregion, hoping to affect the flexibility of E without189 completely destroying its conformation. These mutants are A54I (mutation full-length cDNA clone ofyellow fever virus and have been confirmed bysequencing. RNA was transcribed from the mutants and used to transfect BHK cells. RNA replication was detected by immunofluorescence, and virus infectivitychecked by plaque assay. Mutants containing theunderlined changes were infectious, but produced lessvirus than wild-type yellow fever. Mutants containing thenon-underlined mutations had undetectable infectivity,which may mean that the flexibility of the protein has beenaltered. For these latter three mutants, we need todetermine whether non-infectious particles are beingproduced, and if so, to produce sufficient quantities ofthese particles for cryoelectron microscopicreconstructions.

Theseproteins, called prM and E, initially form a heterodimer.At some point in the assembly of virions prM is cleaved bythe cellular protease furin to produce E then rearrangesto form homodimers in the mature virion. It is possible toproduce immature virus particles that contain uncleavedprM by growing the virus in the presence of ammoniumchloride. This lysosomotrophic agent causes the pH of endosomal vesicles through which virus is transported to rise, which in turn prevents cleavage of prM by furin. It isnot known if these immature particles are trueintermediates in virus assembly; it has been reported thatnoninfectious, prM-containing particles can be convertedinto infectious virions by treatment with furin. We havetreated immature dengue virus (DEN) in vitro with furin after low pH treatment. Cleavage of prM to pr and M wasdetected by silver staining and Western blot assay usinganti-serum against DEN prM. However, we could notdetect M protein due to the small size of the protein andunavailability of antiserum to M. Reactivated infectivity was assayed by infecting BHK cells with furin-treated virions. Infected cells were detected byimmunofluorescence using anti-DEN antiserum. We havebeen able to reactivate immature particles to forminfectious particles. However, we were unable to detectthe reactivated particles by electron microscopy. Theultimate goal is to reactivate sufficient numbers ofparticles for cryo-electron reconstructions. We have madeprogress in increasing the number of particles by finetuning the pH of the furin reaction. We are also going topursue increases in the amount of furin.292. In vitro reconstitution of an enveloped animal virusOdisse M. Gelbart*,Charles M. Knobler*, Marlene BillerSindbis virus (SINV) is an enveloped animal virus composed of a spherical nucleocapsid (NC) and a viral membrane. The NC is made of 240 identical copies of the capsid protein forming a shell around a positivesense RNA molecule. The NC is in turn enveloped by themembrane, which contains 240 heterodimers of spikeproteins embedded in a lipid bilayer. The nucleocapsidsare assembled in the cell cytoplasm and migrate todomains of cell plasmalemma containing the viral spikes.There the spike protein heterodimers interact one-to-onewith the capsid proteins through hydrophobic bonds and asa final stage in the viral life cycle, the nucleocapsids budout of the cell as mature, infectious virions. The goal ofthis project is to mimic in vitro this last stage of the SINV life cycle by wrapping viral membranes around naked nucleocapsids to form mature, infectious virions and toshow in this way that budding is a thermodynamicallyfavored event and that no active processes are required. Our approach involves removing the envelope from intact virions using minimal amounts of a suitablenon-denaturing detergent that preserves the integrity of themembrane and prevents loss of the spike proteins. Wehave found that such a detergent treatment leads to loss ofinfectivity, as measured by plaque assays. Currently, weare testing for the disassembly of the envelope from the NCs by running the detergent-treated samples on gradients to separate the NCs from envelopes by eithersedimentation velocity or by equilibrium sedimentation. Ifthe disassembly has occurred, envelope and NCs will befound in different fractions. Fractions containing themembranes and NCs will then be mixed together andallowed to interact again as the detergent is removed. Weanticipate that reassembly will be facilitated by highconcentrations of both components and by the gradualremoval of the detergent. In preliminary experiments,detergent-treated virions (but not separated fractions) wereloaded onto Centricon devices and the detergent was removed gradually by incremental addition of buffer. Under these conditions there was partial restoration ofinfectivity, suggesting that enveloped particles hadreformed. We intend to confirm the formation of intact,enveloped virions by electron microscopy. Since NCs canbe self-assembled in vitro , we also plan to synthesize NCs containing a reporter gene such as Luciferase or GreenFluorescent Protein within the SINV genome, under thecontrol of a second subgenomic promoter. These in vitro assembled NCs will be added to the reassembly reactionsin the Centricons. If infectious enveloped particles are formed, the reporter gene should be expressed in the plaques. This is an important control to prove that NCsand membranes had been completely separated before thereassembly process.*Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, UCLA190 Publication Mukhopadhyay, S., Zhang, W., Gabler, S., J.H.

M.G. glycoproteins Raisa Solomatina Support: The work described in the following research reports has been supported by: Ellison Medical FoundationHoward and Gwen Laurie Smits Professorship in Cell Biology Human Frontiers Science Program (HFSP)National Institutes of Health, USPHS Summary: Our main subject is the ubiquitin system. The field of ubiquitin and regulated protein degradation wascreated in the 1980s, largely through the complementarydiscoveries by the laboratory of A. Hershko (Technion,Haifa, Israel) and by my laboratory, then at MIT. Thesediscoveries revealed three sets of previously unknownfacts: 1. That ATP-dependent protein degradation involves a new protein modification, ubiquitin conjugation,which is mediated by specific enzymes, termed E1, E2and E3. 2. That the selectivity of ubiquitin conjugation is determined by specific degradation signals (degrons)in short-lived proteins, including the degrons that giverise to the N-end rule. 3. That ubiquitin-dependent processes play a strikingly broad, previously unsuspected part in cellularphysiology, primarily by controlling the in vivo levels of specific proteins. Ubiquitin conjugation wasdemonstrated by us to be required for the proteindegradation in vivo , for cell viability, and also, specifically, for the cell cycle, DNA repair, proteinsynthesis, transcriptional regulation, and stressresponses. In addition, ubiquitin-dependentproteolysis was also discovered to involve a substrate-linked poly-Ub chain of unique topology that isrequired for protein degradation. The ubiquitin systemwas also discovered to possess subunit selectivity, i.e.,the ability to destroy a specific subunit of amultisubunit protein, leaving the rest intact andthereby making possible protein remodeling . The Hershko laboratory produced the first of these fundamental advances (item 1), and my laboratoryproduced the other two (items 2 and 3). Over the last 15years, these complementary discoveries led to theenormous expansion of the ubiquitin field, which becameone of the largest arenas in biomedical science, the point ofconvergence of many disparate disciplines. (For anaccount of the early history of the ubiquitin field, seeVarshavsky, 2006). Our biological discoveries of the1980s, together with later studies by many excellentlaboratories that entered the field in the 1990's andafterward, yielded the modern paradigm of the centralimportance of regulated proteolysis for the control of the levels of specific proteins in vivo , as distinguished from their control by transcription and protein synthesis. Inother words, these advances revealed that the controlthrough regulated protein degradation rivals, and oftensurpasses in significance the classical regulation throughtranscription and translation. This radically changedunderstanding of the design of biological circuits will have(in fact, is already beginning to have) a major impact onmedicine, given the astounding functional range of theubiquitin system and the multitude of ways in whichubiquitin-dependent processes can malfunction in diseaseor in the course of aging, from cancer andneurodegenerative syndromes to perturbations of immunityand many other illnesses, including birth defects. Ourwork at Caltech continues to focus on ubiquitin-dependentprocesses. The effect of an intracellular protein on the rest of the cell depends on the protein's concentration. The latteris determined by the rate of synthesis and/or import of theprotein in relation to the rates of its degradation,inactivation by other means, or export from thecompartment. The in vivo half-lives of intracellular proteins range from a few seconds to many days. Over thelast decade, a vast number of biological circuits wereshown to contain either constitutively or conditionallyshort-lived proteins. In addition, damaged or otherwiseabnormal intracellular proteins tend to be recognized assuch and selectively degraded, largely by the sameubiquitin-proteasome system that mediates the controlledproteolysis of short-lived regulatory proteins. Themetabolic instability of a regulator provides a way togenerate its spatial gradients and allows for rapidadjustments of its concentration (or subunit composition)through changes in the rate of its synthesis or degradation.192 Fig. 1. (A) The N-end rule pathway in mammals. N-terminal residues are indicated by single-letter abbreviations for amino acids. The ovals denote the rest a protein substrate. MetAPs, methionine aminopeptidases. The \"cysteine\" (Cys)sector, in the upper left corner, describes the discovery, by Hu et al. (2005), of the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated oxidation of N-terminal acid (CysO 3(H)). Type 1 and type 2 primary destabilizing N-terminal re sidues are recognized by multiple E3 Ub ligases the N-end rule pathway, including UBR1 and UBR2 (Tasaki et al., 2005). Through their other substrate-binding sites, these E3s also recognize internal (non-N-terminal) degrons in other substrates of the N-end rule pathway, denoted by a larger yellow oval. (B) MetAPs remove Met from the N-terminus of a polypeptide if the residue at position 2 belongs to the set of residues shown. Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76-residue protein that exists in cells either free or conjugated to many other proteins.Degradation of intracellular proteins by the Ub-proteasomesystem regulates a multitude of processes: cell growth;cell division and differentiation; signal transduction;responses to stress; and a broad range of metacellular(organismal) processes, such as embryonic development,immunity and the functions of the nervous system.Ub-dependent proteolysis the \"marking\" of asubstrate through of Ub and a specific Cysresidue of E1. In the second step, activated Ub istransesterified to a Cys residue of a Ub-conjugating (E2)enzyme. a complex of E2 and another enzyme,E3, conjugates Ub to a Lys residue of a substrate. Thefunctions of E3 include the recognition of a substrate'sdegradation signal (degron). The numerous proteolyticpathways of the Ub system have in distinct E2-E3complexes. Specific E3s recognize (bind to) specificdegrons of their substrates. The diversity of E3s and E2s(there are more than 500 distinct E3s in a mammal) underlies the enormous range of substrates that arerecognized and destroyed by the Ub system, in ways thatare regulated both temporally and spatially. Ub hasnonproteolytic functions as well. One pathway of the Ub system is the N-end rule pathway (Fig. 1). A specific class of degrons recognizedby this pathway comprises degradation signals calledN-degrons. In eukaryotes, an N-degron consists of threedeterminants: a destabilizing N-terminal residue of aprotein substrate, its internal Lys (K) residue(s) (the site offormation of a poly-Ub chain);, and a conformationallyflexible region(s) in the vicinity determinants thatis required for the substrate's ubiquitylation and/ordegradation. The set of destabilizing residues in a givencell type yields a rule, called the N-end rule, which relatesthein vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue. The N-end rule has a hierarchic structure (Fig. 1). In eukaryotes, N-terminal Asn (N) and Gln (Q) are tertiarydestabilizing residues (denoted as Nd t) in that they function through their enzymatic deamidation, to yield thesecondary destabilizing N-terminal residues Asp (D) andGlu (E) (denoted as Nd s). The destabilizing activity of N-terminal Asp and Glu their one of the primary destabilizing residues (denoted as Ndp). The latter N-terminal residues are recognized by E3 Ub ligasesof the N-end rule pathway, called N-recognins. The N-endrule pathway of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a single N-recognin, UBR1, while at least fourN-recognins, including UBR1, mediate this pathway inmammals (Fig. 1) (Tasaki et al., 2005). An N-degron is from pre-N-de gron through a proteolytic cleavage. Methionineaminopeptidases (MetAPs) remove Met from theN-terminus of a newly formed protein if the residue atposition 2, to be made N -terminal after cleavage, has asmall enough side chain. Consequently, amongst the 13destabilizing residues of the mammalian N-end rule (Fig.1A), only Cys can be made N-terminal by 1B). (Any destabilizing residue, including Cys, canbe made N-terminal through internal cleavages of such as separases, caspases, andcalpains (Fig. 1A).) Our previous work showed that inmammals and other eukaryotes that produce nitric oxide(NO), the set of arginylated residues contains not only Aspand Glu, but also N-terminal Cys (C), which is arginylatedafter its oxidation (Kwon et al ., 2002). The in vivo oxidation of N -terminal Cys requires NO, as well asoxygen (O 2) or its derivatives (Fig. 1) (Hu et al., 2005). Although prokaryotes lack Ub conjugation and Ub itself, they contain (Ub-independent) N-end rulepathways. The sets of destabilizing residues in prokaryoticN-end rules contain secondary destabilizing (Nd s) residues as well. Their identities (Arg and Lys in E. coli ; Arg, Lys, Asp and Glu in some other prokaryotes) are eitheroverlapping with, or distinct from, the eukaryotic Nd s residues (Graciet et al., 2006). The activity of Nds residues in prokaryotes requires their conjugation to Leu (an Ndp residue) by transferases(L-transferases), in contrast to the conjugation of Arg toN-terminal Glu, or (oxidized) Cys in eukaryotes(Fig. 1). Prokaryotic L-transferases are of two distinctkinds, differing in both amino acid sequence and substratespecificity. Remarkably, L-transferases of one class,encoded by bpt genes, are In this (Varshavsky, 2004), \"sequelog\" and \"spalog\" denote, respectively, a sequencethat is similar, to a specified extent, to another sequence,and a 3D structure that is similar, to a specified extent, toanother 3D structure. \"Sequelog\" and \"spalog\" aremnemonically helpful, single-word terms whoserigor-conferring advantage is their evolutionary neutrality . The sequelog terminology conveys the fact of sequencesimilarity (sequelogy) without evolutionary or functionalconnotations, in contrast to interpretation-laden suchas homolog, ortholog and paralog. The latter terms arecompatible with the sequelog/spalog terminology and canbe employed to convey understanding about functions andcommon descent, if this information is actually available(Varshavsky, 2004).]The functions of the N-end rule pathway (see also Abstracts below) include the regulation of import of shortpeptides (through the degradation, modulated by peptides,of the import's repressor), the fidelity of chromosomesegregation (through the degradation of a conditionallyproduced cohesin fragment), the regulation of apoptosis(through the degradation of a caspase-processed inhibitorof apoptosis), the regulation of meiosis, the leaf senescencein plants, as well as neurogenesis and cardiovasculardevelopment in mammals. M. Zenker and colleagues havediscovered, in a collaboration that included our lab as well,that mutations in human UBR1, one of several functionallyoverlapping N -recognins (Fig. 1), are the cause ofJohanson-Blizzard Syndrome (JBS), which comprisesmental retardation, physical malformations, and severepancreatitis (Zenker et al. , 2005). Abnormalities of the previously constructed UBR1 / mouse strains (Kwon et al ., 2001) include pancreatic insufficiency, a less severeversion of the defect in human JBS (UBR1 /) patients (Zenker et al., 2005). The cardiovascular and (probably) other functions of the N-end rule pathway involve thearginylation-mediated degradation of RGS4, RGS5, andRGS16 (Hu et al ., 2005; Lee et al ., 2005). These \"GTPase-activating\" proteins function by inhibiting thesignaling by specific G proteins, and are themselvesdown-regulated through the NO/O 2-dependent degradation by the N-end rule pathway (Hu et al ., 2005). The N-terminal residues of RGS4, RGS5 and RGS16 areoxidized in vivo at rates controlled by NO and oxygen, followed by the arginylation of oxidized Cys andprocessive proteolysis by the rest of the N-end rulepathway (Fig. 1). The arginylation branch of this pathwayis also essential for chromosome stability, through itstargeting and selective destruction of a separase-producedC-terminal fragment of a cohesin's subunit that bears adestabilizing N-terminal residue (Rao et al., 2001). While the identity of the key residue that becomes N-terminalupon cleavage by separase varies amongst cohesins ofdifferent eukaryotes, it is a destabilizing residue in alleukaryotes examined, indicating the importance ofmaintaining, in evolution, a short in vivo half-life of the cohesin fragment. In particular, the N-end rule pathway isalso required for degradation of the in vivo -produced fragment of the mammalian RAD21/SCC1 subunit ofcohesin (J. Zhou, J. Sheng, R.-G. Hu and A. Varshavsky,unpublished data). Functional and mechanistic studies of the N-end rule pathway in yeast and mammals are a major theme ofour current work. References Graciet, E. Hu, R.-G., Piatkov, Sci.

N-end rule pathway as a nitric oxidesensor controlling the levels of multipleregulatorsCory Hu, Jun Sheng, Xin Qi, Zhenming Xu, TerryTakahashi, Alexander VarshavskyNitric oxide (NO) is produced in eukaryotes largely by NO synthases. This compound and itsderivatives play a role, as either stressors or regulators, in avast range of functions, including cardiovascularhomeostasis, immunity, neurotransmission, ionconductance, glycolysis, and apoptosis. Biological effectsof NO are mediated by its covalent modifications ofproteins, either of their prosthetic groups or amino acidresidues, particularly Cys and Tyr. The reactivity of theseresidues toward NO is modulated by their sequencecontexts. NO converts Cys residues to S-nitrosothiols, aprocess that can involve oxygen or its derivatives.S-nitrosylation modulates protein functions either directlyor after additional (often oxygen-dependent)transformations yield oxidized Cys, 3(H)). The lab's previous work has shown that in mammals destabilizing N-terminal residues which functionthrough their arginylation are not only Asp and Glu butalso Cys, which is a stabilizing (unarginylated) residue inthe yeast S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1A) (Gonda et al., 1989; Kwon et al., 2002). In 2005, we demonstrated that the oxidation of N-terminal cysteine is essential for its arginylation (Hu et al., 2005). Most importantly, it was also discovered thatthein vivo oxidation of N-terminal cysteine, prior to its arginylation, require nitric oxide (NO) (Fig. 1) (Hu et al ., 2005). This accounted for N-terminal Cys being adestabilizing residue in mammalian cells, which produceNO, but stabilizing in yeast, which lack NO synthases.Thus, the N-end rule pathway is a new kind of NO sensorin mammalian cells, functioning through its ability todestroy specific regulatory proteins bearing N -terminal Cys residue, at rates controlled by NO, and by oxygen aswell. The levels of regulatory proteins with a specific N-terminal motif [Cys-(basic residue)], such as RGS4,RGS5 and RGS16, were found to be greatly increased inmouse ATE1( / ) embryos, which lack arginylation (Hu et al., 2005). Given the known involvement of these RGS proteins in the control of heart functions, angiogenesis, andother tubulogenesis pathways, the demonstratedstabilization / ) embryos is likelyto underlie the previous findings by our lab of abnormalangiogenesis and heart defects in the absence ofarginylation (Kwon et al ., 2002).

The N-end rule pathway thus, regulates signalingby G-protein-coupled receptors, through the conditional(NO-dependent) destruction of RGS4, RGS5 and RGS16(Hu et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2005). Our study (Hu et al., 2005) has also revealed other NO-dependent N-end rulesubstrates that are encoded by the mouse (and human)genome. Specifically, a mammalian genome encodesapproximately 30 proteins, including RGS4, RGS5 andRGS16, that contain residue]N-terminal motif, which acts as a MetAP-cleaved,NO-dependent, arginylation-mediated, Cys-containingpre-N-degron. Together, the above discovery identifiedthe arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway as a newsensor of NO in mammalian cells (Hu et al., 2005). The resulting \"unification\" of a ubiquitin-dependent proteolyticpathway and the signaling by NO uncovered a newmechanism of NO signaling in the heart and other organs:the modulation of activity of regulatory proteins bearingN-terminal Cys through their NO-dependent, arginylation-mediated degradation by the N-end rule pathway. Onemedical ramification of this discovery is thatpharmacological manipulation of arginyl-transferases islikely to yield a more selective route to beneficial effectsthat are currently achieved using drugs that alter the levelsof NO [62].

Davydov 1, Jun Sheng, Jianmin Zhou, Yong Tae Kwon2, and Alexander VarshavskySubstrates of the N-end rule pathway include proteins with destabilizing N-terminal residues. Three ofthem - Asp, Glu and (oxidized) Cys - function throughtheir conjugation to Arg, one of destabilizing N-terminalresidues that are recognized directly by the pathway'subiquitin ligases. The conjugation of Arg is mediated byarginyl-transferase, encoded by ATE1 . Through its regulated degradation of specific proteins, the arginylationbranch of the N-end rule pathway mediates, in particular,the cardiovascular development, the fidelity ofchromosome segregation, and the control of signaling bynitric oxide (see Introduction, Fig. 1, Abstract 1, and Hu et195 al., 2005). We found that mouse ATE1 specifies at least six mRNA isoforms, which are produced through alternative splicing, encode enzymatically active arginyl-transferases, and are expressed at varying levels in mousetissues. We also found that the ATE1 promoter is bidirectional, mediating the expression of both ATE1 and an oppositely oriented, previously uncharacterized gene.In addition, these proteins in extractfrom ATE1 / embryos, suggesting that specific isoforms may have distinct functions. While the N-end rulepathway is apparently confined to the cytosol and thenucleus, and although GRP78 and PDI are located largelyin the endoplasmic reticulum, recent evidence suggests thatthese proteins are also present in the cytosol and othercompartments in vivo , where they may become N-end rule substrates. 1Meso Scale Discovery, 16020 Industrial Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20877. 2Center for Pharmacogenetics and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy,University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261.

Mechanistic and functional studies ofN-terminal arginylationChristopher Brower, Jianmin Zhou, Rong GuiHu, Haiqing Wang, Jun Sheng, AlexanderVarshavskyThis Abstract mentions some of our ongoing projects that aim to further advance the understanding ofthe arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway, beyondthe recent advances that are described in Abstracts 1 and 2. (i) Construction and functional analyses of mouse strains (and cells derived from them) in which theexpression of ATE1 -encoded Arg-tRNA-protein transferases (R- transferases) is selectively and conditionally abolished in specific cell lineages duringembryogenesis, or postnatally ( Christopher Brower ). This set of projects should make possible, among other things, afunctional dissection of N-terminal arginylation in specificorgan systems and cell types of adult mice.(A nonconditional ATE / genotype is embryonic lethal (Kwon et al., 2002). (ii) Construction and functional analysis of knock-in mouse strains that contain a doxycycline- inducible allele of ATE1, and thus, can overproduce manner, in specific celltypes or postnatally ( Jianmin Zhou, Christopher Brower). (iii)Analysis of chromosome stability and regulation of apoptosis in mouse ATE1 / cells ( Jianmin Zhou, Jun Sheng, Cory Hu, and Christopher Brower ).These projects stem from the discovery of the function oftheS. cerevisiae N-end rule pathway in the maintenance of chromosome stability (Rao et al., 2001), and from the conjecture that an analogous function in mammalian cellsinvolves the (ATE1 -dependent) arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway. Recent work indicated thatN-terminal arginylation is essential for the in vivodegradation of the separase-produced fragment ofSCC1/RAD21, a subunit of mouse cohesin. Moreover,ATE1( / ) fibroblasts were also found exhibit a strong chromosome instability (CIN), presumably because, atleast in part, of their inability to destroy the separase-produced cohesin's fragment ( Jianmin Zhou ).

New aminoacyl-transferases and the N-endrule pathway of prokaryotic/eukaryoticspecificity Graciet, relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue (seeIntroduction). Primary destabilizing N-terminal residues(Nd p) are recognized directly by the targeting machinery. The recognition of secondary destabilizing N-terminalresidues (Nd s) is preceded by conjugation of an Ndp residue to Nds of an Ndp residue, to Nds residues Asp (D), Glu (E) or oxidized Cys (C*) (Fig. 1). Ub ligasesrecognize the N-terminal Arg of a substrate and target the(ubiquitylated) substrate to the proteasome. In prokaryotessuch as Escherichia coli , Nd p residues Leu (L) the aat-encoded Leu/Phe-tra nsferase (L/FK,R-transferase), to N-terminal prokaryotes but Ndp in eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, substrates bearing the Ndp residues Leu, Phe, or Tyr are degraded by the proteasome-like protease(Tobias al., 1991; and prokaryotic L/FK,R-transferases, there is no significant sequelogy (sequence similarity) between them (see a brief description, in square parentheses in Introduction, of therecently introduced terms \"sequelog\" and \"spalog)(Varshavsky, 2004). We have identified a new aminoacyl-transferase, termed Bpt, in the human pathogen Vibriovulnificus (Graciet et al., 2006). Although it is a sequelog of eukaryotic R D,E,C*-transferases, this prokaryotic transferase exhibit a \"hybrid\" specificity,conjugating Nd p Leu to Nds Asp or Glu, the first such Nds residues in prokaryotes. Another new aminoacyl-transferase, termed ATEL1, of is a sequelog of the specificity of eukaryotic RD,E,C*-transferases (ATE1) (Graciet et al., 2006). In addition, our phylogenetic analysis suggests thatthe substrate specificity of R-transferases arose by twodistinct routes during the evolution of eukaryotes (Gracietal., 2006). 1National Research Laboratory of Molecular Research Center forEnteropathogenic Bacteria, Chonnam NationalUniversity Gwangju Piatkov, (2004) Curr. Biol. ligaseTakafumi Tasaki 1, Yong Tae Kwon1, Alexander VarshavskyKwon et al. (1998) identified two distinct mouse (and human) genes, termed UBR2 and UBR3, which encode proteins that are similar to mouse and yeast UBR1,the first E3 of the N-end rule pathway to be characterized.(It was also the first Ub ligase of the entire Ub system to beidentified.) In contrast to the highly similar mouse UBR1and UBR2 proteins (47% identity and 68% similarity), themouse UBR3 protein, while clearly a member of the UBRfamily, is less similar to UBR1 (25% identity and 51%similarity) UBR2 (25% identity and 48% similarity).In addition, mouse UBR3 lacks some of the residues in itsN-terminal region that have been shown to be essential forthe function of yeast UBR1, and are also present in themouse (and human) UBR1 and UBR2 proteins. Wemapped and partially sequenced the mouse UBR3 gene, and more recently constructed UBR3( / ) mouse strains. UBR3( / ) mice are viable, and are being characterized. 1Present address: Dept. of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213ReferenceKwon, Y.T., Reiss, Y., Fried, Sci.

Quanti tative analyses of interactions between components of the N-end rule pathway andtheir substrates or effectorsZanxian Xia, Alexander VarshavskyDetailed understanding of the N-end rule pathway requires, among other things, the knowledge ofequilibrium binding constants for the reversibleinteractions between UBR1 and its effectors or substrates.(With some interactions, it would be desirable to know thecorresponding rate constants, as well.) We are carrying outthese measurements using the fluorescence polarization(FP) technique, with purified S. cerevisiae UBR1 (or its fragments) and a variety of UBR1 ligands, includingpeptides with destabilizing N-terminal residues. Theseanalyses will be expanded to include other physiologicalligands of UBR1 such as UBR1. 299. Phos phorylation of UBR1: Its Zanxian Xia, AlexanderVarshavskyS. cerevisiae UBR1, the E3 rule pathway, is phosphorylated in vivo , but the role(s) of this UBR1 modification in the multiple functions of the N-end rule pathway is unknown. Phosphorylation sites onUBR1 and the kinases/phosphatases involved remain to beidentified, as well. We are using biochemical and geneticapproaches to understand, in functional and mechanisticdetail, this modification of UBR1. 300. A family of mammalian E3 ubiquitin ligases that contain the of the N -end rule pathway include proteins that contain degradation signals called N-degrons(Fig. 1A). One determinant of N-degron is a substrate'sdestabilizing N-terminal residue. Previous work (Kwon et al., 1998; Kwon et al., 2001; Kwon et al. , 2003) as E3 here that while UBR1 / UBR2 / mice died as early embryos, the rescued UBR1 / UBR2 / fibroblasts still had the N-end rule pathway. An affinity assay for proteins that bind to destabilizingN-terminal residues has identified, in addition to UBR1and UBR2, a huge (570 kDa) mouse protein, termedUBR4, and also the 300-kDa UBR5, a mammalian E3 as mammalian UBR4 known in BIG in plants.197 UBR1 / UBR2 / fibroblasts that were made also deficient in UBR4 were impaired in the degradation of N-end rule substrates, confirming that UBR4 is a part of the N-endrule pathway. The recognition of destabilizing N-terminalresidues by UBR4 and UBR5 is a new property UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, UBR5, and at least threeother mouse contain a motif termed the UBR box.The resulting UBR family consists of either demonstratedor inferred Ub ligases. A major part of this family are E3sof the N-end rule pathway. Thus, in contrast to the yeast S. cerevisiae , where the N-end rule pathway is dependent on just one Ub ligase, UBR1, a mammalian N-end rulepathway is mediated by at least four distinct Ub ligases,which have in common at least the UBR box. 1Center for Pharmacogenetics and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy,University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 2Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10016 3Protein Research Network, Inc., Yokohama, Kanagawa 236 0004, Japan Discovery, 16020 Industrial 20877 ReferencesKwon, Xia, An, J.

Zenker(Germany) that involved this lab as well mapped thedisease locus to chromosome 15q14-21.1. Zenker et al. (2005) identified mutations, mostly truncating ones, in theUBR1 gene in 12 unrelated JBS families. As described inIntroduction, UBR1 encodes one of at least four functionally overlapping ubiquitin ligases of the N-endrule pathway, a conserved proteolytic system whosesubstrates include proteins with destabilizing N-terminalresidues (Fig. 1). Pancreas of JBS patients did not expressUBR1, and exhibited intrauterine-onset destructivepancreatitis. We also show that UBR1-/- mice, whosepreviously reported phenotypes include reduced weightand behavioral abnormalities, have an exocrine pancreaticinsufficiency, with impaired stimulus-secretion couplingand increased susceptibility to pancreatic injury. Thesefindings (Zenker et 2005) indicate that of UBR1 perturbs pancreatic acinar cells and other organs,presumably owing to stabilization of specificsubstrates of the N-end rule pathway. 1Institute of Human Genetics, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 10, 91054 Erlangen,Germany 2Center for Pharmacogenetics and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy,University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 *Multiple addresses Kwon, Y.T.

Miner,Assistant Professor, Washington University Support: The work described in the following research report has been supported by: American Heart Association Howard Hughes Medical InstituteNASANational Institutes of Health (NINDS, DE) Summary: This laboratory's research centers on the earlyformation of the nervous system in vertebrate embryos.The peripheral nervous system forms from two cell typesthat are unique to vertebrates: neural crest cells andectodermal placodes. We study the cellular and molecularevents underlying the formation, cell lineage decisions andmigration of these two cells type. The neural crest iscomprised of multipotent stem cell-like precursor cells thatmigrate extensively and give rise to an amazingly diverseset of derivatives. In addition to their specific neuronaland glial derivatives, neural crest cells can also formmelanocytes, craniofacial bone and cartilage and smooth muscle. Placodes are discrete regions of thickened epithelium that give rise to portions of the cranial sensoryganglia as well as form the paired sense organs (lens, nose,ears). Placodes and neural crest cells share severalproperties including the ability to migrate and to undergoan epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Their progeny arealso similar: sensory neurons, glia, neuroendocrine cells,and cells that can secrete special extracellular matrices. Our laboratory concentrates on studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying theinduction, early development and evolution of the neural crest and placodes. This research addresses fundamental questions concerning cell commitment, migration anddifferentiation using a combination of techniques rangingfrom experimental embryology to genomic approaches tonovel gene discovery and identification of gene regulatoryregions. These studies shed important light on themechanisms of neural crest and placode formation,migration and differentiation. In addition, the neural crestand placodes are unique to vertebrates. In studying theevolution of these traits, we hope to better understand theorigin of vertebrates. Because these cell types are involved in a variety of birth defects and cancers such as neurofibromatosis, melanoma, neuroblastoma, our results on the normal mechanisms of neural crest development provideimportant clues regarding the mistakes that may lead toabnormal development or loss of the differentiated state. 302. Importance of neural crest in development and evolution of the pharynx David W. McCauley *, Marianne Bronner Fraser Neural crest cells are a defining character of vertebrates and of prime importance in the evolutionaryorigin of the vertebrate body plan. To understand neuralcrest evolution, we explored molecular mechanisms underlying craniofacial development in the basal jawless vertebrate, lamprey, focusing on Sox10) family. In jawed vertebrates, these havebeen shown to be important transcriptional regulators ofneural crest development and loss of Sox9 specificallycauses abnormal cartilage formation. Here we show that alamprey SoxE gene, PmSoxE1, is expressed in migrating neural and crest-derived prechondrocytes of thebranchial arches. Furthermore, morpholino-inducedprotein knock down revealed that it is essential forbranchial arch development. Thus, function of this transcriptional regulator can be traced to the lamprey- gnathostome common ancestor, suggesting that a SoxEgene was important in the evolution of vertebrate branchialarches and chondrogenesis. Our findings renew questionsregarding the homology vertebrate branchial arches.*Assistant Professor, University of Oklahoma (former postdoc) 303. Sp ecification of neural crest occurs during gastrulation and requires Pax7Mart\u00edn L. Basch *, Marianne Bronner Fraser, Mart\u00edn I. Garc\u00eda Castro** The neural crest is a stem population critical development of vertebrate craniofacial skeleton andperipheral ganglia. Classically, neural crest has beenthought by interactions at the border betweenneural and non-neural ectoderm. In contrast, we reportthat neural crest induction is underway before properneural plate appearance, during gastrulation. We showthat a restricted region of stages 3 and 4 chick epiblast isspecified to generate neural crest cells when explantedunder non-inducing conditions. This same region of thegastrula begins to express the transcription factor Pax7 at stage 4+ and later contributes to neural folds and migrating neural crest, both of which express Pax7. Finally we showthat Pax7 is required for neural crest formation in vivo , such that preventing Pax7 translation inhibits expression ofthe neural crest markers Slug, Sox 9, Sox10 and HNK-1.Our results suggest that neural crest specification initiates202 earlier than previously assumed and that Pax7 plays a critical role during neural crest development. *Postdoctoral fellow, House Ear Institute (former grad student) **Assistant Professor, Yale University (former postdoc) 304. Neuropilin-2/semaphorin3F signaling is essential for S. Gammill, crest cells migrate in a segmental fashion in vertebrate embryos. We demonstrate that migratingneural crest cells express the receptor neuropilin-2 (npn-2),and that mice mutant for this receptor exhibit a variety ofdefects during neural crest migration. In the trunk, neuralcrest cells normally invade the rostral but somitic sclerotome. In npn-2 neural crest cells are evenly distributed throughout the sclerotome, resulting in the loss of segmental migration. The of npn-2 Atcranial npn-2 of migrating cellscrossing between neural crest streams entering branchialarches 1 and 2. The results definitively show that npn-2/sema3F signaling directs neural crest migration,including rostral-only migration through the Interestingly, dorsal root ganglia still condense in a segmental pattern in npn-2 mutant mice, apparentlysorting out from the uniform sheet of migrating neuralcrest, suggesting that segmental neural crest migration maynot be essential for the formation of individualized ganglia. 305. The \u00015 subunit of laminin is required for proper murine neural crest cell migration Edward G. Coles, Laura S. Gammill, Jeffery H.Miner, Marianne Bronner FraserAlthough numerous in vitro experiments suggest that extracellular matrix molecules like laminin caninfluence the neural crest migration, little is known abouttheir function in cell migration in the embryo. We previously identified the \u00015 subunit of laminin in a screen for genes upregulated in response to neural crest induction.Here, we show that laminin \u00015 transcripts are localized in regions of the newly formed cranial and trunk neural folds as well as adjacent to neural crest migratory pathways.The expression pattern is largely conserved between chick and mouse. In laminin \u00015 mutant mice, neural crest migratory streams appear expanded compared to wild-type mice. Conversely, growing neural crest cells in the presence of laminin \u00015 subunit in vitro results in a reduction of migratory cells by about half. During neurogenesis, laminin\u00015 mutant embryos exhibit defects in the condensing cranial sensory and trunk sympatheticganglia. However, the ganglia are not totally missing andat later stages apparently recover. These data suggest thatthelaminin\u00015 subunit, as a component in the extracellular matrix, acts as a non-permissive cue and is essential forproper migration and timely differentiation of some neuralcrest populations. 306. Neural crest-derived Marianne BronnerFraserCranial neural crest cells migrate into the periocular region of the eye and contribute to the cornea. Upon reaching the presumptive corneal stroma, neural crest cells differentiate, synthesize extracellular entrapped. investigated whether cornealstromal keratocytes could dedifferentiate and contribute toneural crest derivatives when challenged with a newenvironment by injecting them into neural crest migratorypathways. Stromal keratocytes were enzymaticallyisolated from quail corneas, as a single cell suspension andthen injected alongside the dorsal neural tube of stage 9chick embryos. Analysis of embryos at various stages ofdevelopment revealed that the injected stromal keratocytesdedifferentiated, proliferated and migrated ventrally adjacent to host neural crest cells. Injected stromal keratocytes contributed to the corneal endothelial andstromal layers, muscular of the mandibular process, bloodvessels and cardiac cushion tissue. However, they failed toform neurons in cranial ganglia and dedifferentiate and contribute to the derivatives. These results suggest thatcorneal stromal keratocytes even at late embryonic stagesare not terminally differentiated, but rather maintainplasticity and multipotentiality. 307. Dynamic alterations in gene expression during avian neural crest induction Lisa A. Taneyhill, Marianne Bronner FraserThe Wnt signaling pathway is important in the formation of neural crest cells in many vertebrates.Because the downstream targets of induction are largelyunknown, we have examined gene expression regulated byWnt-mediated neural crest using quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (QPCR). inductionwas recapitulated in vitro by adding soluble Wnt to intermediate neural plate tissue cultured in collagen, and induced versus control tissue were assayed using gene- specific primers at times corresponding to premigratory(18 and 24 hours) or early (36 hours) stages of crestmigration. The results show that Wnt signaling upregulates the expression of several genes crest Pax3 ,FoxD3, Msx1 and cadherin 6B all are downregulated by the start of migration. These results contrast somewhat to thetemporal expression of these genes in response to the addition of recombinant BMP4. Interestingly, expression ofrhoB is unchanged or even decreased in response to203 Wnt-mediated induction at all times examined, though it is upregulated by BMP signals. The temporal QPCR profilesin our culture paradigm approximate in vivo expression patterns of these genes prior to neural crest migration, butsuggest that additional signals maintain these genes in vivo. Our results are the first to quantitatively describe changes in gene expression in response to a Wnt or BMPsignal during transformation of a neural tube cell into amigratory neural crest cell. 308. Axial p atterning in cephalochordate s and the evolutionary origin of the gastrula organizer Jr Kai Yu, Marianne Bronner Fraser, NickHolland, Linda HollandThe organizer of the vertebrate gastrula, which induces and patterns dorsal axial structures, expresses acharacteristic suite of transcription factors of BMP-, Nodal- and Wnt-signaling pathways. Despite long-standing interest, the evolutionary origin of the organizer remains unclear. Here we show that thegastrula of the cephalochordate amphioxus expressesorthologues of organizer genes in patterns reminiscent oftheir deployment in vertebrates. Genes involved indorso/ventral (D/V) dorsallyexpressed group Lefty, Chordin, and ADMP) as well as a ventrally expressed group (including BAMBI andTolloid, which are BMP signaling modulators). Keytranscription factors for dorsal/ventral (D/V) patterningalso are expressed vertebrate orthologues. Genes involved in anterior/posterior (A/P) patterning include a suite of Wnt genes expressed around the blastopore and several Wnt antagonists, mostexpressed anteriorly, consistent with a role for Wnts in A/P patterning. These findings suggest that bothcephalochordates and use homologous genenetworks for both D/V analyses placing cephalochordates basal in the chordate lineage, it is likely that separate D/Vand A/P signaling centers, as proposed for chick andmouse, may already have been present in ancestralchordates. 309. Neu ral crest gene regulatory network jawless neural crest is an embryonic cell population that is unique to vertebrates, forming much of theperipheral nervous system, facial skeleton, and bodypigmentation. To elucidate the evolutionary history of thegene network driving neural crest development, we used moderate-throughput transcriptome analysis to identify homologues of neural crest regulatory genes from the basaljawless vertebrate, lamprey. We have isolated andexamined the expression homologues ofgenes that function in gnathostome neural crestdevelopment. The roles of seven of these factors inlamprey neural crest cells were tested using a morpholino-mediated loss-of-function approach. We find a strikingconservation not only of gene expression patterns, but alsoof function for nearly every gene analyzed, suggesting thatthe complete neural crest gene regulatory network aroseearly in vertebrate evolution and has been tightlyconserved for over 500 million years. 310. Snail2 directly represses cadherin6B during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions of Edward G. Coles, MarianneBronner FraserThe neural crest, a transient migratory population of cells, forms craniofacial skeleton, peripheral nervoussystem, and other derivatives. The transcriptionalrepressor Snail2 is thought to be critical for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that promotes neural crestdelamination from the neural tube; however, little is known about its downstream targets. To this end, we depleted avian Snail2 protein in the premigratory neuralcrest using morpholino antisense tube genes were the celladhesion molecule cadherin6B was de-repressed as early as 30 minutes. Cadherin6B has a reciprocal expression pattern to Snail2, and its regulatory region contains threepairs of clustered E boxes, representing putative Snail2binding sites. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrate that Snail2 directlybinds to these sites. These results are the first to describe adirect target of Snail2 repression in vivo during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that characterizesneural crest development. 311. Neuropilin 2/semaphorin 3F signaling is essential for cranial ganglion condensationLaura Bronner FraserIn the head of vertebrate embryos, neural crest cells migrate from the neural tube into the presumptivefacial region and condense to form cranial ganglia andskeletal elements in the branchial arches. We neural folds and migrating neural crest cellsexpress the neuropilin 2 (npn2) receptor in a manner that is highly conserved in amniotes. The repulsive npn2 ligandsemaphorin (sema) 3F is expressed in a complementary pattern in the mouse. Furthermore, mice carrying nullmutations for either npn2 or sema3F have abnormal cranial neural crest migration. Most notably, \"bridges\" ofmigrating cells were observed crossing between neural crest streams entering branchial arches 1 and 2. In addition, trigeminal ganglia fail to form correctly in themutants and are improperly condensed and looselyorganized. These data show that npn2/sema3F signaling isrequired for proper cranial neural crest development in thehead.204 312. Lens is the gro und state of all sensory placodes, from which FGF promotes olfactory identityAndrew P. Bailey, Sujata Bhattacharyya,Marianne Bronner Fraser, Andrea StreitThe sense organs of the vertebrate head comprise structures as varied as the eye, inner ear and olfactoryepithelium. In the early embryo, these assorted structuresshare a common developmental origin within the pre-placodal region and acquire specific characteristics onlylater. Here we demonstrate for the first time a fundamentalsimilarity in placodal precursors: all are specified as lensprior to acquiring features of specific sensory orneurogenic placodes. Lens specification becomesprogressively restricted in the head ectoderm, initially byFGF and subsequently by signals derived from migratingneural crest cells. We show that FGF8 from the anteriorneural ridge is both necessary and sufficient to promote olfactory fate in adjacent ectoderm. Our results reveal that placode precursors share a common ground state as lensand progressive restriction allows the full range ofplacodal derivatives to form.

Markey Charitable Trust NASA/AmesNational Institutes of Health, USPHSNational Science FoundationNorman Chandler Professorship in Cell Biology Summary: The major focus of research in our laboratory is on gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that controldevelopment, and the evolution of these networks. Mostof our research is done on sea urchin embryos, whichprovide key experimental advantages. Among these are: an easy gene transfer technology, which makes this a system of choice for studying the genomic regulatorycode; availability of embryonic material at all seasons ofthe year; an optically clear, easily handled embryo that isremarkably able to withstand micromanipulations,injections and blastomere recombination anddisaggregation procedures; simple embryonic process; and in-house egg-to- egg culture of the species we work with,Strongylocentrotus purpuratu s (in a special culture system we have developed, located at Caltech's Kerckhoff MarineLaboratory). There is also a rich collection of arrayedcDNA and BAC libraries for sea urchins and a large EST database. The genome of S. purpuratus has now been sequenced at HGSC (Baylor) and annotated. A veryextensive repertoire of effective molecular technologies forexperimentation on sea urchin gene regulatory systems hasevolved. The experimental model that we utilize forevolutionary GRN comparisons is another echinoderm,also of local provenance, the starfish Asterina miniata . The embryo of this animal proves to be as excellent asubject for gene regulation molecular biology as is that ofthe sea urchin. We pursue an integrated, \"vertical\" mode of experimental analysis, in that our experiments are directed at all levels of biological organization, extending from the transcription factor-DNA interactions that control spatialand temporal expression of specific genes to the system-level analysis of large regulatory networks. It has becomeapparent that the only level of analysis from whichexplanations of major developmental phenomena directlyemerge, is the system level represented by the sea urchinGRN. The main research initiatives at the present time are as follows: i. Analysis of the gene regulatory network underlying endomesoderm specification in S. purpuratus embryos : At present about 50 genes have been linked into this GRN. The architecture of the network is emergingfrom an interdisciplinary approach in which computationalanalysis is applied to perturbation data obtained by geneexpression knockouts and other methods, combined withexperimental embryology. Regulatory and downstreamgenes required for skeletogenesis and for territorialspecification have been isolated utilizing high-densityarrayed cDNA libraries. A predictive model of the GRNhas emerged which indicates the inputs and outputs of thecis-regulatory elements at its key nodes. Most of the individual projects reported below are contributing to understanding of this network .ii. Testing the cis-regulatory predictions of the GRN: The GRN was constructed essentially by integrating the results of amassive perturbation analysis of expression of individualgenes with spatial and temporal expression data for thesegenes. It predicts the required specific regulatory inputsand outputs linking the genes within the GRN. Thesepredictions are subject to direct experimentalcis-regulatory test, and correction, if need be. We have now authenticated the predicted cis-regulatory inputs into genes at all but two or three of the key nodes of the current GRN. At these nodes are regulatory genes into which there are multiple regulatory inputs from genes elsewherein the GRN, and multiple outputs to other genes in theGRN. For some regions of the GRN the analysis isapproaching maturity, in that it extends convincingly frommaternal inputs to cell-type differentiation. The bestexample is the GRN subregion determining skeletogenic206 micromere specification. Overall, the results of these experiments are converting the GRN from a modelproposition into a hard-wired map of the genomic controllogic for this portion of development. iii. Completion of the repertoire of regulatory genes engaged in theendomesoderm GRN: We used the data emerging from the genome sequence project to identify and assemble computationally all gene sequences that encodetranscription factors. The temporal patterns of expressionof these genes have been determined, and for those genessufficiently expressed in the embryo, the spatial patterns aswell. A handful of regulatory genes have been identifiedin this manner that evidently play a role in endomesodermspecification, but that are not yet incorporated into theGRN as it now stands. These are now being linked intothe GRN by perturbation and cis-regulatory analysis, but the analysis shows that the endomesoderm GRN is nearingcompletion (with respect just to regulatory genes, and just to the endomesoderm from 6 to about 30 hrs of development, i.e., early cleavage to the onset ofgastrulation). Evolution, viewed as a process of change in GRN architecture: Starfish and sea urchins shared a last common ancestor about 500 million years ago. Thus,analysis of the GRN controlling endomesodermspecification events in the starfish embryo will reveal boththe nature of functional change in the GRN, andconservation of features that are so essential that they haveresisted alteration for half a billion years. Examples ofboth have now been documented. The underlying processes are of course change, or alternatively, conservation, of functional cis-regulatory features. To study this we are examining starfish/sea urchin GRNdifferences at the cis-regulatory level. In a separate, large- scale effort, we have nearly completed the isolation ofBACs containing 12 genes the cis-regulatory elements of which are known in S. purpuratus , from genomic libraries of five different sea urchin species ranging from 15 to 250million years since divergence from the lineage leading toS. purpuratus . These will afford the opportunity of studying by computational and experimental methods theprocess of cis-regulatory evolution, which is very poorly understood. v. Oral and aboral ectoderm GRNs: We have begun work on the GRNs that control oral and aboralectoderm specification. This is an effort in collaborationwith the lab of David R McClay at Duke to extend thesame kind of causal, system level GRN analysis to thewhole embryo. This means obtaining GRN architecturefor ectoderm and embryonic territory, the apical neurogenicregion, which is being studied in other sea urchinlaboratories. The aboral ectoderm generates a single celltype, but the oral ectoderm gives rise to several distinctly functioning domains: mouth, columnar \"facial\" epithelium, neurogenic ciliary band, and the ectodermalsignaling stripes which determine the location of theskeletal rods. The approach is to obtain all the regulatoryplayers expressed in oral and aboral ectoderm from theanalysis of all genes encoding transcription factorspredicted in the genomic sequence, and engage them in aprovisional network by carrying out a matrix of perturbation experiments. The network will be anchored atthe onset of the ectodermal specification process, of whichthe initial gene zygotically expressed on the oral side isnodal . The cis-regulatory module controlling early oral ectoderm expression of nodal is in our hands and its target sites should provide the link between the initial cytoplasmic anisotropy and zygotic gene expression. vi. Computational and experimental cis-regulatory model:To build a logic model of the information processingfunctions of a cis-regulatory element that relates the input kinetics (i.e., the temporal changes in relevant transcriptionfactor levels) to its output, we have returned to the cyIIIa gene. The logic model of the regulatory system of thisgene is being completed by additional mutational genetransfer experiments. vii. Various explorations by new methods and approaches: As always, we are trying to expand knowledge by use of novel technologies for analysis of the GRN and the genome. Current applications of new technology include increasingly widespread use ofin vitro reengineered BAC recombinants, which we are supplying to the whole sea urchin field; use of these in firstattempts to \"redesign\" the process of embryonicdevelopment, by introduction of altered regulatorysubcircuits in novel spatial domains; and application of anewly developed quantitative imaging method forassessment of expression construct output. We have alsodeveloped a completely novel method for blockingexpression of any gene whenever and wherever desired, though this has so far been tested only in sea urchin embryo skeletogenic cells. This method should allow us todetermine the function of regulatory genes which havemultiple activity phases in one of the later phases, inembryos which develop normally up to that point.viii. Computational approaches to regulatory genenetwork analysis: The GRN visualization BioTapestry, developed by our collaborators HamidBolouri and Wm. Longabaugh at ISB, is now in wide use,and we are further expanding its capacities so that it willautomatically generate allowed network architectures frommachine readable time and space of expression data plus results of perturbation analysis. In addition, studies of network regulatory logic are being undertaken incollaboration with Professor Sorin Istrail of BrownUniversity. Many additional computational genomics andother projects are summarized below. ix.Theory: A new conceptual approach to the evolutionary mechanismswhich account for both change and conservation of animalbody plans, based on modes of alteration of GRNarchitecture, was developed in collaboration with DougErwin of the Smithsonian Museum. An integratedtreatment of genomic regulatory systems in development and evolution at both cis-regulatory and network levels is presented in a new treatise by the PI, \"The RegulatoryGenome\" (Academic Press/Elsevier, 2006).207 The Center for Computational Regulatory Genomics CCRG Highlights This is an exceptional year for the Sea Urchin Genome Resource. The first draft assembly of the purplesea urchin genome has been posted, the annotation of thepredicted gene models has been completed to the first freeze and the publications reporting this work are being submitted for publication in the late summer or early fall.There will be an entire issue of Developmental Biology dedicated to the annotation of the sea urchin genome.Science has agreed to publish the genome presentation paper and several satellite papers as perspectives orreviews. It is not an exaggeration to say that this could nothave been accomplished without the materials from theSea Urchin Genome Resource. We provided genomic DNA,BAC libraries, cDNA libraries, unpublished sequence dataand scientific management. In addition we acted as liaison between volunteers from the sea urchin research community and the Baylor College of Medicine HumanGenome Sequencing Center, the entity that performed theactual sequencing work. Genomics Technology Facility The operation of the Facility centers on the Genetix Arraying Robot, a large flatbed robotic arm withvideo camera used to produce bacterial macro-arraylibraries and filters. We currently maintain in -80\u00b0Cfreezers 27 different echinoderm libraries comprising a total of approximately 3 million arrayed clones. In addition to providing these materials to academic researchgroups, we also offer the opportunity for outside groupsfrom Caltech and elsewhere to array and spot their ownlibraries. During the past year we have arrayed a total262,820 colonies and printed a total of 129 macroarrayfilters A variety of cell type-specific and tissue-specific cDNA libraries are especially useful for annotationprocesses because expressed sequences verify predictedgene models and additional tissue- and cell-specific genesare added with each new library. The cDNA library from primary mesenchyme cells was extensively used for this purpose. We have also made, arrayed and distributed twoseparate cDNA libraries made from the radial nerve tissueof adult sea urchins. A random collection of about 2,000clones from these libraries was sequenced at Baylor.Similar numbers of clones from previously made gut,lantern, mesentery and testis were sequenced in thiscampaign. We anticipate the need for additional genome resources to extend the recently obtained draft sequence.Gene clusters, long low-frequency interspersed repeats, and similar features are likely to require additional sequencing for proper inclusion in the draft genomesequence. To that end we have made a genomic BAClibrary using sperm from an animal that resulted from theself-cross of a hermaphroditic sea urchin from our colony.Theoretically this individual could have as many as 50% ofthe chromosomes completely homozygous. Of courserecessive lethal mutations could reduce this number but nevertheless, a large fraction will be identical. We expectthat this library will be especially useful for disentanglingregions of problematic assembly since mosaic regions thatwould be otherwise difficult to assemble will be identicalin all clones. Research Center The goal of the Center for Computational Regulatory Biology is to develop, refine and testcomputational approaches in genomics broadly and cis- regulatory analysis specifically. The primary focus for thelatter is the elucidation of gene regulatory networks indevelopment. The Center interacts with the wider researchcommunity in several ways: it provides open sourcesoftware for use by academic research groups; it providesweb-based servers for genomic analysis using softwaredeveloped locally; and it maintains databases fundamental to the Sea Urchin Genome Project, an initiative that began in the Davidson laboratory and at the GenomicsTechnology Facility. The Facility provides to the Caltechand external scientific community upon request servicesand materials stemming from the macroarray libraries andarraying equipment that we maintain. One aspect of the Center is the Sea Urchin Genome Resource which maintains information resourcesthat are used widely in the sea urchin research community.We provide sequence information through the Sea UrchinGenome Project web site ( http://sugp.caltech.edu/ ). With the advent of the web resources for annotation established at the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor Collegeof Medicine and the Sea Urchin Genome Resources atNCBI, we have not seen the need to expand our localdatabases. However, we have refined the cross-indexbetween our library clones and sequences stored in publicdatabases at NCBI. Since so many of our libraries wereused for the sequencing project, and the library location forthe clones was preserved in the sequence information, wecan provide a searchable sequence database from whichthe user can obtain clone information and order the clone.This \"clone by computer\" method renders our arrayed libraries extremely useful and readily accessible for the working molecular biologist. As in previous years our sequence analysis software and server continue to be productively used. 61laboratories situated all over the US and Europe, andextending to Argentina maintain folders on our server.Since the last startup in February 2005, there have beenalmost 10,000 Seqcomp program job requestsaccomplished for a total of about 1250 CPU hours. Thelargest number of request has been for Blast jobs but theyhave only used about 834 CPU hours.208 New Cluster Hardware and Configuration We have replaced the set of 20 in-house assembled Pentium machines that previously comprisedone-half of our Beowulf cluster with new Dell machinesthat achieve a significant increase in speed. To improvecluster deployment, maintenance, and management, we have adopted a proven software operating system and toolkit, NPACI Rocks, which is an open source, Linux-based system of software components that can be used tobuild, maintain, and operate the cluster. The toolkit wasdesigned in November 2000 by the National Partnershipfor Advanced Computational Infrastructure led by theUniversity of California, San Diego, and the San DiegoSupercomputer Center. 313. Ann otation of the draft sea urchin genome sequenceR. Andrew Cameron, Kevin Berney, KrisKhamvongsaWe continue to provide computational analyses in order to facilitate gene discovery and annotation of thegenomic sequences as part of the Sea Urchin GenomeSequencing Consortium. We have modified our datapipeline to compare the assembled sequences to small candidate gene databases as part of the analysis strategies we have used during the manual annotation phase of thesequencing effort. Our curatorial work on gene familiesand functional groups has revealed several interestingaspects of the genes in the sea urchin genome. The spiculematrix protein genes function in the bio-mineralizationprocess by which the clade-specific calcium carbonatestereom is secreted. Judging from comparisons tohemichordate and cephalochordate EST collections, theseproteins are unique to echinoderms and are likely to havediverged from the larger C-type lectin gene family 540million years ago. The most surprising expansion of a gene family in the sea urchin genome is the toll-like receptor family with ~220 members. These genes areinvolved in innate immunity and number only ten inhumans, for example Additionally, the predicted gene models derived from the sea urchin assembled genomic sequence werecompared in several ways to the gene catalogs of othercompleted genomes. Thus, an overview of the sea urchingenetic toolkit was obtained and by extension the sharedfeatures of the gene catalogs that characterize otherbilaterian animal groups was revealed. About one third of the most prevalent protein domains in the sea urchin gene models are not as abundant in the other genomes and thusconstitute expansions that are specific at least to seaurchins if not to the complex of echinoderms andhemichordates that form the sister group to the chordatedeuterostomes. A number of homologous groups of genespreviously restricted to vertebrates have sea urchinrepresentatives thus expanding the deuterostomecomplement. And obversely, the absence ofrepresentatives in the sea urchin confirms a number ofchordate-specific inventions. Although the specificcomplement of genes in the sea urchin genome resultlargely from minor expansion and contractions of existing families already found in the common bilaterian \"toolkit\"of genes, several striking expansions shed light on how thesea urchin lives and develops. 314. Transcription factor utilization in larval development Eve Helguero, R. Andrew CameronAn analysis of the complement of transcription factors in the sea urchin genome reveals that about 80%are expressed during the embryonic period. This perhapssurprisingly large proportion is explained by the nature ofgene regulatory networks, systems in which the interactionof transcription factors and the cis-regulatory modules that they bind is a stable but sensitive system that preciselycontrols development. The temporal utilization of theremaining 20% now becomes an interesting question.Previously, it would have been expected that a large proportion of transcription factors are first utilized in the larval period when the adult body plan is erected. Wehave begun to examine this issue by measuring theexpression of these regulatory proteins in the larval period.We have established a method to dissect the primordium ofthe adult ventral surface away from other larval tissue andmeasure transcript number in RNA amplified from thetissue. Preliminary results on the 20% reveals that overhalf of them are expressed in the rudiment and theseinclude many transcription factors known to be expressedduring neural development in other systems. 315. Network Gene Annotation Project Qiu Autumn Yuan, R. Andrew CameronThe sequence and expression information that underlies the establishment of gene regulatory networks(GRN) is accumulating rapidly as high-throughputmethods are adapted to these studies. We haveinaugurated a database and website that is the used tocollect these data for those genes identified in the course ofvarious gene regulatory network efforts that arecollaborations between the Davidson laboratory and otherresearch groups studying sea urchin development. The database contains information on about 550 sea urchin network genes and is increasing daily. For each gene in thedatabase the information includes fields with theannotations of the gene, its various sequence objects andexpression data. This database has been newlyimplemented in PostgreSQL. The functions of the websiteand management of the database are scripted in a varietyof languages: HTML, XML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.As these data are codified, they will be used to directlyerect gene regulatory networks in a computational versionof Biotapestry, our GRN viewer and editor.209 316. The evolution of cis-regulatory module sequence in lower deuterostomes R. Andrew Cameron, Elly Chow, Eve Helguero,Autumn Qiu Yuan, Ping Dong, Julie Hahn, RenaSchweizerThe DNA of cis-regulatory modules (CRM) known to be functional displays extensive sequenceconservation in comparisons between genomes frommodestly distant species . Patches of sequence several hundred base pairs in length within these modules areoften seen to be 80-95% identical, while the flankingsequence cannot even be aligned. Comparisons offunctionally characterized cis-regulatory modules from the Strongylocentrotus congener, that single nucleotide substitutions and small indels occur freely at many positions within the regulatory modules of these two species, as they do without. However, large indels (>20 bp) are statisticallyalmost absent within, though they are common in flankingintergenic or intronic sequence. With six cases analyzed,the indel suppression theory of cis-regulatory module sequence evolution is firmly established. The studies of CRM evolution has been extended and broadened during the past year. We have added twonew comparisons between S. purpuratus and S. fransciscanus to the analysis discussed above. Furthermore, we have expanded the panel of comparisons to be made. We now have partial results among five species and 10 genes. Recombinant BAC clones in whichGFP is substituted for the gene-coding region while thesurrounding genomic sequence is preserved have provedefficient constructs to test the regulatory function of largeDNA segments. Constructs were obtained for six of the 10genes in our panel from Arbacia punctulata (Ap), a sea urchin diverged from the reference species for about 150MY. These are particularly interesting because only delta, a gene encoding a signaling ligand, was efficientlyexpressed. Thus, a new dimension of sequence evolutionin our analysis panel is revealed. 317. Transcriptional control of the sea urchin brachyury gene Elly Chow, R. Andrew Cameron The brachyury gene is a participant in the endomesoderm specification pathway and the foundingmember of T-box family of transcription factors.Brachyury expression is localized to the vegetal plate andreaches a peak at about 24 hr postfertilization. By the 48hr gastrula stage transcripts are present in the oralectoderm and in the region of the blastopore. Expression then subsides and increases again during the larval stage. We have focused our attention on a construct thatrecapitulates the normal onset of expression in the vegetalplate. It contains 650 bp of the intron between exons 6, 7and the previously identified brachyury basal promoter. From earlier perturbations and computational analysis wehave discovered three classes of transcription binding siteslikely to be active in this fragment: Gata, Tcf and Etssites. When two of the four TCF sites are mutated, theexpression is increasingly ectopic in the ectoderm at theexpense of normal expression in the vegetal plate. Theseresults are consistent with the notion that Tcf is an activator when bound to \u0001-catenin that is localized to the nuclei of vegetal plate cells and an inhibitor through the co-factor, Groucho, in the ectoderm where nuclear \u0001-catenin is absent. This hypothesis requires that additional activators are present in the ectoderm. We are investigating the possibility that members of the Ets familymay fill this role since several canonical Ets factor-bindingsites are in the sequence and two Ets factors Sp-Erf andSp-ElfA are ubiquitously expressed at the right time. The discovery of a direct involvement for Tcf and \u0001-catenin downstream of the feedback loop that activates vegetal plate specification is novel. 318. A genome-wide survey of sea urchin transcription factors Meredith Howard Ashby, Stefan C. Materna, C. Titus Brown, R. Andrew Cameron The sea urchin sequencing project has provided he opportunity to undertake a definitive survey oftranscription factors involved in this organism'sdevelopment. The goal is to identify new genes andcharacterize when and where during development thesegenes are expressed so that they may be incorporated intothe current Strongylocentrotus purpuratus endomesodermal gene regulatory network (GRN), fillingin any missing connections and rendering the modelcomplete. In all, 283 sea urchin transcription factors were identified, including members of the homeobox, sox, ets,nuclear receptor, forkhead bHLH and basic zipperfamilies. Zinc fingers genes were not considered in thisstudy. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for all themajor gene families. The sea urchin in general has oneortholog for each set of paralogous transcription factorgenes found in vertebrates, resulting in a regulatory toolkitbetween one-third and one-half the size of the vertebratetoolkit. QPCR time courses from the fertilized egg stage through 48 hours of development were obtained for each gene. From this data, it is apparent that the vast majority, 75%, are used at least once during development. Aseparate study of the indicated that many of the remaininggenes are used during the feeding larval stage and duringelaboration of the adult body plan. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) for the more highly expressedgenes shows that the newly uncovered genes are expressedin a wide variety of tissues, including the vegetal plate,primary mesenchyme cells, the gut, and both oral andaboral ectoderm. This information, along withperturbation analyses of currently known genes, will allowus to place these genes into the endomesodermal GRN being constructed in the lab, as well as present a starting point for the construction of an ectodermal GRN.210 319. The C 2H2 zinc-finger genes of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and their expression in embryonic development Stefan C. Materna, Meredith Howard Ashby,Rachel F. GrayThe C 2H2 zinc-finger domain is one of the most abundant protein domains in metazoan genomes. With 22amino acids it is small and named for two cysteine andhistidine residues with which it coordinates the zinc atom.Genes carrying this domain are thought to have beenextensively replicated in diverse animal clades. Manywell-studied proteins that contain this domain aretranscriptional regulators. As part of an attempt todelineate all transcription factors encoded in theStrongylocentrotus purpuratus genome, we identified the C 2H2 zinc-finger genes indicated in the sequence, and examined their involvement in embryonic development.We found 377 zinc-finger genes in the sea urchin genome, about half the number found in mice or humans. This number, albeit preliminary due to redundancy issues,exceeds the number of all other, non-C 2H2 transcription factors. We determined expression profile by quantitativePCR. Up to the end of gastrulation less than a third ofthese genes is expressed, and about 75% of the expressedgenes are maternal; both parameters distinguish these fromall other classes of regulatory genes as was found incomplementary projects. Of all other transcription factorcandidates about 80% are expressed by the end ofgastrulation and only about one third of them is maternal. Spatial expression patterns were determined by whole mount in situ hybridization for 44 genes transcribed at a sufficient level, and localized expression was observedin diverse embryonic tissues. These genes may executeimportant regulatory functions in development. However,the functional meaning of the majority of this large genefamily remains undefined. Several examples from theliterature point at additional roles for the C 2H2domain in RNA and protein binding. The functional flexibilitytogether with their modular structure, which is thought toallow for rapid changes in binding site specificity, may bepartly responsible for their high popularity in today's genomes. 320. Trans-specification of primary mesenchyme cells through sea urchin Strongylocentrotus and regulatory relationship of a number oftranscription factors involved in endomesodermdevelopment have been well characterized. However, theultimate demonstration of intellectual control of the causal moving parts of a system is to reengineer it. The goal of the project is to determine whether the ectopic expressionof the transcription factor SpGcm is sufficient to trans- specify primary mesenchyme cells (PMC) into a secondarymesenchyme cell (SMC) fate. This can be done by placingthegcm coding sequence under the control of a promoter that directs PMC-specific gene expression. The Davidsonlab has developed a system whereby BAC-sized DNAfragments can be introduced into fertilized sea urchin eggsthrough microinjection and integrated into the genome asearly as the two-cell stage. This system has been used hereto probe the effects of creating novel connections betweenregulatory pathways. SpGcm is thought to play two roles in development. Its early expression in all presumptivemesoderm suggests it is capable of setting up amesodermal transcriptional state. This state gives cells acompetency to respond to signals that specify variousSMC or mesodermal cell lineages. Some evidence for thistheory already exists. For example, embryos injected withantisense morpholino against gcm do not correctly express gata c gene in the oral domain of veg2 mesoderm (A.Ransick and J. Rast, unpublished data). The later role ofGcm in pigment cell specification is perhaps more difficultto characterize through morpholino-analysis. However, in situ hybridization shows late gcm expression exclusively in pigment cells. The T-box transcription factor Tbrain is expressed in the large micromere descendants at swimming blastulastage. Its expression persists through gastrulation intoPMCs. A recombinant BAC has been constructedwhereby gcm-coding sequence is transcribed under the control of the tbrain cis -regulatory system. PMC cells expressing gcm have been shown to express a terminal differentiation gene, pks, which is normally transcribed only in pigment cells. Gcm-expressing PMCs also do not participate in skeletogenesis. Instead, they appear tomigrate towards the aboral ectoderm, in a manner similarto their pigment cell relatives. The degree to which Gcmcan both override the skeletogenic program of PMCs andspecify either pigment cell or mesodermal cell fate hasbeen assayed through whole mount in situ by measuring expression of other PMC and SMC-specific transcriptionfactors and markers. Such factors include Gata-c, amesoderm-specific transcription factor controlled by Gcm,Alx, a homeobox protein involved in PMC specification,and the forkhead factor Foxb. Due to difficulties in resolving expression patterns using colorimetric WMISH, a fluorescent in situ protocol has been developed that will allow precise spatialmeasurements of gene transcription. In the context of thisproject, a two-color fluorescent in situ will be a valuable tool for measuring coexpression of induced GCM and thegene targets whose expression it regulates. 321. cis-Regulation of Spgcm Andrew Ransick A variety of experimental approaches are being employed to define the cis-regulatory architecture and critical ' trans' inputs of spgcm, the urchin ( . Four cis-regulatory modules of the spgcm gene have been identified (distributed across ~15 kilobases ofsequence upstream of transcription start site) which whenincorporated in a GFP expression construct, recapitulateboth the early expression pattern of this gene in the211 secondary mesenchyme domain at the mesenchyme blastula stage, and the late expression domain in pigmentcells of post-gastrula stage embryos and larvae. Spatialexpression of this is of dn- Su(H) mRNA, confirming that spgcm is a direct target of canonical N signaling mediated through Su(H) inputs. cis-Perturbation analysis of the \"E module\" (~350 bases located ~9kilobases upstream of the transcription start site) usingmutation of consensus Su(H) sites, identified a conservedmotif paired-site and a lone site that function both to driveexpression in SMC precursors which receive the Deltasignal, and to repress expression in ectopic locations whichlack this signal. While these Su(H) target sites provide thecis-regulatory architecture with the core of a N-signaling transcriptional response switch, both the onand off outputs from this module require additional inputs. The regulatorymodule controlling the late expression in pigment cells is the current focus. This so-called \"G module\" (spanning ~500 base stretch located ~4 kilobases upstream of thetranscription start site) is composed of a clustered set ofshort conserved sequence elements, which includes apotential auto-regulatory site in the form of a consensussite match to the canonical GCM-binding site.Experiments are in progress to determine the specificsequence elements in G-module that account for the lateexpression pattern. 322. cis- and trans- regulatory analysis of SpNodal expression Jongmin Nam, Yi Hsien SuSpNodal is a member of TGFbeta gene family and is one of the earliest key components of oral-ectodermgene regulatory network during sea urchin embryogenesis.The goal of this project is to understand the regulatorylogic for initiating and maintaining the expression of nodal on the presumptive oral side of ectoderm. On the basis ofearlier studies from other species, we reasoned that theregulatory logic for nodal expression is composed of the followings: 1) early and nodal independent input; 2)positive feedback input; and, 3) repressor inputs that limit nodal expression on the presumptive oral side of embryo. A series of perturbation studies and cis-regulatory module analyses suggested that all of the three predictedcomponents indeed are parts of the regulatory logic fornodal expression. We are in the process of finding cis- andtrans - elements of the logic. 323. Re-engineering the embryo by rewiring the regulatory network - endoderming theectodermSmadar Ben Tabou de Leon The instructions for cell specification and differentiation are primarily encoded in the regulatory regions of the genomic DNA that control the expression oftranscription factors and signaling molecules. The inter-regulating factors create a network that is essentially thegenomic program for development. Once the network isknown it should be possible to re-engineer the embryomorphology by rewiring network components. This meansthat a network subcircuit that is believed to be sufficientfor domain specification can be turned on in anotherdomain and change its fate. If the domain fate changesaccording to the implanted subcircuit, it indicates thatindeed this subcircuit is sufficient for domain specification. If the domain fate remains unaltered it is either that the implanted subcircuit is missing a necessaryfactor or that the endogenous fate was already establishedwhen the implanted subcircuit was turned on so thedomain lost its plasticity. Therefore, rewiring the networkis a unique tool that opens the way to deepen theunderstanding of network completeness and plasticity. A central subcircuit in the sea urchin endoderm specification network is a positive feedback loop that isformed between the transcription factors otx and gatae. In order to check whether this positive feedback loop issufficient for the endoderm specification we would turn it on in the ectoderm. For that end we prepared different bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) constructs whereotx and gatae cDNA were knocked-in into genes that are expressed in the ectoderm. The constructs will be injectedinto sea urchin fertilized eggs and induce expression of otx andgatae in the ectoderm. Different driver genes are used to turn on otx and gatae at different time points, early and late in development so we will be able to observe whetherthe plasticity of the ectoderm changes with time. Weexpect to see activation of endoderm regulatory genes inthe ectoderm and possibly, formation of an ectopic gut demonstrating that the gene regulatory network architecture can be utilized to reengineer the embryomorphology. 324. A cis-regulatory analysis of spgata-e Pei Yun Lee SpGata e is S. purpuratus ortholog to vertebrate Gata genes 4/5/6 . The expression e is first detected in presumptive secondary mesenchymecells (SMCs) during the hatching blastula stage. Itsexpression both future in the mesenchyme blastula. In the gastrula, SpGata e is expressed at the tip of the archenteron and hindgut. By the end of embryogenesis, SpGata e is expressed in the midgut and coelomic pouches. A 600 bp DNA sequence in the first intron is responsible for directing SpGata e expression in the vegetal plate from the onset of zygotic SpGata e expression in the 15 hr blastula. This module also maintains expression in mesoderm cells at the tip of theinvaginating archenteron and endoderm cells until mid-gastrulation. When this module is deleted from a BACcontaining the entire SpGata e gene and a GFP reporter, early expression was abolished while late expression wasunaffected, demonstrating that it is required for the earlyexpression of SpGata e. Further analysis showed that a separate 360 bp fragment in the first intron is responsiblefor directing endoderm expression in the gastrula andpluteus.212 The endomesoderm gene network predicts that SpGata e is downstream of SpOtx and SpNotch . If the network prediction is correct, then functional binding sites must exist for these transcription factors in the SpGata e cis-regulatory region. A search in the sequence of the vegetal-specific cis-regulatory element identified three putative SpOtx-binding sites. Gel shift analysis has shownthat the Otx transcription factor binds to the SpOtx-bindingsites. Mutations of the sites abolish Otx binding.Furthermore, the vegetal-specific element also responds toperturbation of Notch signaling. When Notch signalingwas perturbed in a reporter construct with mutated SpOtx- binding sites, GFP expression was abolished, verifying thepresence of a SpNotch input into SpGatae. Closer examination of the module reveals four putativeSuppressor of Hairless binding sites. Mutation of two ofthese leads to a marked decrease in the expression of GFPreporter. 325. Evolution of skeletogenesis gene regulatory network build hard adult body parts (skeletal plates, tests, spines and so on), it is only in Echinoids and Ophiuroids that theembryo makes spicules that will be then discarded during later adult skeletogenesis. This begs the question: Howdid embryonic skeletogenesis - a through PMC (Primary Mesenchymal Cell) sub-network of sea urchin endomesodermal gene regulatory network (GRN) tells us the underlying the embryonicskeletogenesis in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [1] [2]. This program involves dozens of specification anddifferentiation genes. Expression of all these genes waschecked using WMISH of larval stage S. purpuratus. Preliminary data shows the same group of core genes usedto make embryonic spicules, are also used at the larvalstage to make adult skeleton. This finding indicates that part of the adult skeletogenic subcircuit was inserted into the embryonic PMC network during Echinoid evolution. The orthologs of this are currently being isolated from starfish Asterina miniata . Comparative expression analysis between Echinoidea and Asteroideawill be used to expand the understanding of the evolutionof skeletogenic specification programs in this phylum. References [2] Davidson et (2002) cis-Regulatory analysis of the sea urchin delta geneRoger RevillaThe delta gene plays two different roles in the specification of the endomesoderm of the sea urchinembryo. Each one of these roles requires Delta to be localized in a specific territory of the embryo. It is first required in the micromeres to serve as a signal that isnecessary to segregate the mesodermal and endodermalfates of the surrounding cells. It is later localized in theprospective SMCs, where it signals the endodermal cellsand is required for gastrulation to occur. The goal of thisproject is to analyze the cisregulatory system that localizes the expression of Delta in the right place and the right time to serve its roles in the specification of theendomesoderm. It has already been shown that the earlylocalization of Delta in the micromeres depends onactivator(s) that are present ubiquitously, and a repressor that is present everywhere except in the micromeres. Comparison of genomic DNA sequences ofStrongylocentrotus purpuratus containing with the orthologous region of Lytechinus variegatus genome has been used to identify conserved patches of sequencethat might contain cis-regulatory elements. Two sequence elements have been identified that are able to recapitulatethe two phases of expression of the delta gene. The element that recapitulates its early phase of expression hasbeen shown to contain binding sites for activator(s)ubiquitously present and binding sites for the repressor that localizes delta in the micromeres. Future work will identify the sites in the DNA that bind these factors. Finally, we also hope to be able to identify thetranscription factor that acts as a repressor of delta everywhere in the embryo except the micromeres, whichhas been suggested to play a key role in the installation ofthe skeletogenic program of gene expression.

The research in my lab focuses on one sucheveryday phenomenon - the motion of a fly through the air.While the buzz of fly wings is more likely to elicit a senseof annoyance than wonder, insect flight behavior links a series of fundamental processes within both the physical and biological sciences: neuronal signaling within brains,the dynamics of unsteady fluid flow, the structuralmechanics of composite materials, and the behavior ofcomplex nonlinear systems. The aim research in my lab isto elucidate the means by which flies accomplish theiraerodynamic feats. A rigorous mechanistic description offlight requires an integration of biology, engineering, fluidmechanics, and control theory. The long-term goal,however, is not simply to understand the material basis ofinsect flight, but to develop its study into a model that canprovide insight to the behavior and robustness of complex systems in general. The following projects in my lab, some well underway, others nascent and moving in thedirection of a deeper understanding of the genetic controland brain of this insect, are helping move us in thedirection of reverse engineering a fly. 327. GUF: Grand unified fly Will DicksonFlight, like all forms of locomotion, involves a complex interaction between an animal and itsenvironment. Although neural circuits, muscles, and wings make up the central physical plant of an animal's motor system, flight behavior does not result froma simple set of feed-forward commands. For example,most of an insect's nervous system is dedicated to thesensory information that is generated as the animal movesthrough its environment. The insect's brainrapidly processes and fuses this rich information stream tocreate a motor code that can modify wing motion on a stroke-by-stroke basis. Sensory feedback is essential bothfor short-term stability as well as long-term guidance andnavigation. What we view as behavior, such as a flyflitting across the room to land on the window, representsthe output of a complex set of sensory-motor circuits that operates through the dynamics of muscles, skeleton, aerodynamics forces, and the environment. Althoughbiologists have appreciated the central role of feedback inflight, conventional biological disciplines suchas neurobiology or biomechanics are not endowed with themathematical framework to deal with the feedback in arigorous manner. Fortunately, recent progress in insect aerodynamics has fostered new engineering approaches,such as the application of control theory, to animal flight.With this in mind we are developing a 3D dynamic modelof the flight system of a flying insect, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 1). Flies provide a convenient scaffold for an integrated control model,because they have been subject to extensive investigationsof aerodynamics, sensory processing, and motor control.The challenge is that certain features of our model are wellconstrained by detailed observation and experiment andeasily formulated (e.g., wing and bodyaerodynamics), while other components are poorlyunderstood and may be only roughly hewed inmathematical terms (e.g., neural circuitry and winghinge mechanics). Despite this limitation, we feel that enough is known to warrant our attempt. Our model is based on a framework that combines a simulation of insect flight dynamics, a model of insectsensory systems, and a model of the flight environment.Using this framework, control strategies can be evaluatedby allowing the outputs of the sensory systems tomodulate the forces produced by the wings and the resultsassessed in a quantitative manner. Such efforts are likelyto help produce miniaturized, unmanned flying robots(robotic flies) in the future.215 Figure 1. (A) Control block diagram for GUF.

The resolution of a paradox in the visually- mediated control of flight by Drosophila Michael ReiserTethered Drosophila flying in a flight simulator will steer themselves by adjusting the difference between right and left wing stroke amplitudes; this difference isused to control the velocity of a rotating pattern. Tosimulate straight flight, flies were presented with apanoramic visual stimulus consisting of a pattern of stripesthat diverges and an opposite pattern of stripes thatcontracts. In experiments, flies normally orient toward thecontracting stripes. This original observation wasperplexing given what you would expect a fly to see whenflying through the world. One possible explanation forthis apparent paradox is that the stimuli used are unnatural.For example, the expansion rate and contrast level are higher than would normally be encountered. The observed behavior may reflect an extreme response, such as anescape reflex. Our observations suggest a simple strategyfor navigating in varied conditions\u2014flies turn away fromexpanding objects at high visual speeds, thus avoidingcollisions when they are imminent (since closer objectsmove faster). They balance optic flow when objects intheir environment are farther away, thus flying straighterwhen it is safe to do so. To further explore conditions in which the focus of contraction is fixated, the contrast level of the pattern was lowered (mean luminance preserved). To test the hypothesis that the focus of expansion may be tolerated ifflies are undergoing directed flight, a high contrast stripewas embedded at the focus of expansion in half of thetrials. This experimental condition essentially places twoattractive stimuli in direct opposition, testing the relativeattractiveness of both. When confronted with thecompound stimuli, flies selectively orient towards the stripe at the focus of expansion. This result indicates thatthe expansion avoidance reflex is weakened when flies arefixating a visual object. This behavior suggests anothersensible navigation strategy\u2014orientation towards a prominent stationary object guarantees straight flight. Both behaviors suggest flight strategies that should enablestraighter flight in the face of varying, complex visualconditions. Straight flight should serve to enhance theinformation coming from the fly's other sensory systemsand thus, should enhance other visually-controlledbehaviors. These predictions are currently being tested ina detailed computer simulation. 216 329. To land or not to land: Decision-making in DrosophilaAndrew Straw The fruit fly is remarkably successful in implementing flying search strategies to find food and egg-laying sites in a wide range of external (wind, odor source,temperature) and internal (hunger, wing damage)conditions. We are investigating how the interplay of low-level sensory-motor reflexes might give rise to successfulhigh-level outcomes, such as the decision of whether andhow to land. Therefore, we developed a tracking systemcapable of resolving the position of a freely-flying fly overa large space in real-time while simultaneously capturingmovies allowing detailed, post-experiment reconstructionof movements near potential landing sites. We first quantify the approach angle of a fly toward or away from a vertical post. Because this effect must be mediatedvisually, and because vision, among all sensory systems, isparticularly well understood in the fly, we haveconstructed a realistic computer simulation of the visualsystem of Drosophila. Thus, we can reconstruct the view of the fly as it flew in the experimental arena, and we canmake detailed predictions about the early stages of visualprocessing and use those to inform our understandingabout how this information is used to decide whether toland. In this case, for example, the post is producing a strong expansion signal as the fly approaches. Another interesting question about landing is how, precisely, does a fly control it's flapping to ensure itsbody follows a particular course? By utilizing the real-time nature of the tracking system, we can trigger veryhigh frame rate (1000 or more frames per second) and highspatial resolution cameras to capture detailed wing andbody kinematics during particular maneuvers. The pitchangle of the body is thought to be especially important in control of forward and vertical velocity, and digitizingsuch data will allow us to test models of the control system governing these variables.217 Figure 3.

Red arrows indicate the direction of travel. (C) A false-colormontage of another trajectory in which the fly briefly contacts the post and leaves. (D) Reconstructed view of the image on afly's retina as it approaches the post (top panels) and the simulated output of biologically realistic motion detectors viewing the scene. 330. Flight initiation performance in voluntary vs. escape takeoffsGwyneth CardThe initiation of flight is a complicated maneuver, requiring a high degree of coordination among appendagesand wings. An animal must accelerate upwards whilemaintaining proper balance to remain stable. Differentcircumstances during takeoff may require varyingperformance requirements. For example, taking off toavoid a predator would require high speed but launching totrack an odor plume of a potential food source or mate mayrequire a smoother takeoff that allows an animal to follow its original orientation and heading. Behavioral studies of flight initiation of Drosophila suggest the fruit fly can perform two different types of takeoff, but these havenever been compared in detail. One study showed fliestaking off to follow enticing odors first raise their wings,then extend their middle legs while depressing their wings,thus coordinating leg movements with wing movements.In contrast, flies avoiding predators rapidly extends theirmiddle legs and propel themselves off the ground withoutcoordinating their legs and wings. Using digital high-speed video (6000 frames per second), we have been able to capture and compare the performances of these two types of take-off in wild-typeflies for the first time in detail (Figure 4). We found thatflies accelerated primarily during the time they extendedtheir legs for both voluntary and escape takeoffs but the period of leg extension was significantly shorter for escapejumps. As expected, the takeoff velocity was much greaterfor escape takeoffs than voluntary takeoffs, but this fasterspeed came with a cost. Escaping flies were far lesssteady, rotating rapidly and sometimes even turning upsidedown as they took off at extreme speeds. This lack ofsteadiness is not advantageous for controlled flight, but anobvious asset when avoiding predation.218 Figure 4. (A) Photo montage of an escape takeoff.

The red line indicates the moment when thelegs left the ground. This is the time at which \"Takeoff Velocity\" was measured for all trials. (D) Pitch velocity for the sa me escape takeoff. The red lines mark the period after liftoff during which \"steadiness\" was measured. 331. Feeding and mating status govern dispersal from food resources in the Drosophila Jasper M. Simon It is crucial to an animal's survival to be able to decide whether to stay or disperse from an establishedresource, such as a supply of rotting food. The maturationof the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , as a model system for neurogenetic research, allows us to revisitissues addressed in classic studies of dispersal carried outin the field and laboratory, with a new, more mechanisticperspective. Here we show results that suggest thatfeeding and mating status play a principle role in D. melanogaster dispersal. We developed an electronic vivarium - 'fly world' - a system of hardware and software to study the movement of flies within and between controlled sensory environments. We hope to use flyworld to better resolve the contribution and interaction ofthe physiological, environmental, and genetic factors thattogether determine an animal's movement. In one line of results (Figure 5), we found that if a chamber contained food, hungry flies stayed in thatchamber longer than when no food was available, asexpected. The effect was parametric: the more food, thelonger they stayed. Next, we placed food behind a meshsurface, such that the flies could see and smell the food,but could not consume the food. Hungry flies giveninaccessible food dispersed at the same elevated rate as hungry flies introduced to chambers without food. Incontrast, sated flies dispersed at a similar slow rate irrespective of the amount or accessibility of food. Thus, visual and olfactory food cues are not enough to keep fliesin one place. Flies must consume, or have contact withfood, to inhibit their tendency to disperse. In a second set of experiments, we examined the effects of mating history, sex, and sex ratio on dispersal.In the absence of food, we found that mated flies dispersedfaster than virgin flies. This was true for both males andfemales. In the presence of food, males exhibited littledispersal irrespective of mating history, and previouslymated females dispersed more slowly than virgin females. Curiously, the dispersal rate of virgin females was unaffected by the presence or absence of food. In general,mating looks to enhance the extremes of dispersal: Whenfood is present mated flies stay longer, when food is absentmated flies disperse sooner. Finally, we placed males andfemales together in a chamber, and compared dispersal inthis group to groups of only males or only females. Fromthese results we suggest that the dispersal observed inmixed-sex populations is largely driven by males. Ourdata reveal that while inherent differences in dispersal existbetween male and female flies, a requirement for food andnot cues from food determines dispersal for both sexes.219 Figure 5. Hunger and absence of food inhibits dispersal. Hungry flies (solid) disperse from chambers in which food cues are present, butaccess to food is inhibited (D), at a rate comparableto dispersal from chambers in which food is notpresent (A,B). In contrast, sated flies (dashed)disperse at a similar slow rate irrespective of thepresence and accessibility of food in the firsthabitat. We ran trials in all figure panels concurrently over several days. We monitored dispersal rates approximately every 10 seconds, butfor clarity bin dispersal rates in 1-hour windows.We report samples sizes near mean dispersal ratesand denote corresponding standard error of themeans (SEM) in grey. 332. Control of body saccades in Drosophila John BenderFruit flies exhibit a behavior known as \"body saccades\" in flight, which are changes in heading of about90\u00b0 in fewer than 100 milliseconds. These behaviors are acentral way for flies to change direction and can be evokedby looming visual stimuli (such as an approachingflyswatter, or a large, growing rectangle inside a flightarena.) In order to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the generation and control of saccades, we developed a novel preparation in which flies retain some ofthe sensory feedback they lack under standard tetheredconditions. We tethered a fly to a small, steel insect pin,which is held in the field between two magnets. The pincan rotate freely along its long axis. We are able tosimultaneously record both the visual stimulus presented tothe fly and the fly's turning responses. We quantified how saccade dynamics were affected by manipulation of the fly's visual environment.We stimulated the fly with virtual looming objects. Stimulus properties had no predictive power for saccade dynamics, except for a slight effect of the position of theexpansion relative to the fly's heading. However, thetiming of saccades relative to the expansion did dependstrongly on stimulus properties, in a manner suggestingthat the saccade response is triggered by an angularthreshold detector.These experiments address the initiation of saccades, but we also tested the role of sensory feedback insaccade termination. First, we rotated the visual stimulusduring spontaneous saccades. This rotation could be eitherin the same direction or the opposite direction from thesaccade, but neither of these manipulations had any effecton saccade dynamics. This suggests that, while vision isimportant in evoking saccades, it does not play a majorrole in terminating them once begun. Are saccades purely feed-forward behaviors, independent of sensory feedback? Flies possess anonboard gyroscope in the form of their halteres, modifiedhind wings sensitive to Coriolis forces. The haltere systemis a likely candidate to provide feedback into the saccademotor program since it is highly sensitive to fast angularrotations, and can provided sensory feedback on awingstroke-by-wingstroke basis, faster and more preciselythan the visual system is capable of doing. Wemanipulated the feedback received by the fly from itshalteres by adding mass to the endknobs of the halteres in some flies and ablating one haltere in others. We found that weighting the halteres significantly decreases the sizeof saccades, while ablating one haltere significantlyincreases saccade size. This demonstrates that the halteresystem does play a significant role in saccade termination. 220 Figure 6. (B) Experimental apparatus. (C,D) Definition of saccade statistics. (E) Saccade stimulation paradigm. The half- angle subtended by an object approaching the fly follows the black trace as it expands until a virtual collision occurs, holds,then contracts as it moves away from the fly with the same time course. (F) Flies perform saccades in response to expandingobjects (red bars). The specific stimulus type (varying velocities or geometries) did not affect the saccade probability. (G)Visual rotation during saccades did not affect saccade dynamics, so we tested whether haltere feedback was important. Thehalteres are the modified hindwings of dipteran flies, which respond to Coriolis forces proportional to the fly's angular veloc ity. (I) Altering the properties of haltere responses changes saccade dynamics. 333. Functional visual flight reflexes in Drosophila : Perch vs. predatorGaby Maimon Unmanned aerial vehicles require accurate environmental sensors, powerful flight actuators, and arobust control system to link them. While much is knownabout the design of sensors and actuators, the controlsystems required for these vehicles remain in their infancy.Our experiments seek to elucidate natural control systemswithin the flies that could then be replicated by engineers. One simple higher-order neural control that flies perform is differentiating a perch, or sitting position,which they approach, from a predator, which they avoid.Our current experiments focus on a developing aquantitative way to characterize attraction and repulsion in flies. Future experiments will dissect the neural substrates of these behaviors. Our experiments were performed on tethered, flying Drosophila placed in a flight arena that displays dynamic visual stimuli that can simulate predators (short stripes thatappear as small, moving objects like wasps) or perches(long stripes that look like stable landscape features)(Figure 7). The experiments showed that flies consistently turned away from short stripes and turned toward longstripes. In addition, when placed in a closed-loop experiments in which the flies could control the movements of the stripes themselves, they tended to keeplong stripes in front of them (fixation) and put short stripesbehind them (anti-fixation), or let the short stripes spinunstably around the arena. The data are consistent with flies using a simple visual heuristic - the ratio of length to width - to differentiatepredator from perch. The two features - long stripe vs.short stripe - appear to be processed in separatevisuomotor systems in the brain. These systems will bethe subject of future analyses.221 Figure 7. Turning responses to oscillating large ('perch') and small ('predator') stimuli. Flies turn towards the large stimuli, whereas they turn away from small oscillating stimuli. 334. Mechanisms of upwind odor tracking Seth Budick For a wide variety of insect species, olfaction is of central importance in locating both food and mates. Themeans by which flying insects search for attractive odorsources have been studied for decades, but research hastended to focus on just a few species of moths. It is thus,attractive to characterize odor source localization in themodel species, Drosophila melanogaster, as this provides an important source of comparative data, allowing us toassess the generality of mechanisms of odor search. Ourwork has involved the study of behavioral responses bothin free-flight and tethered-flight paradigms. In free flightstudies using a low velocity wind tunnel, we have shown thatD. melanogaster responds to contact with a narrow (1 cm diameter) plume of an attractive odorant by surgingupwind within approximately 250 ms. This surge responseis characterized by a shift from cross-wind to upwindheading, paired with a significant increase in airspeed.Flies subjected to continuous odor stimulation in ahomogeneous odor plume, meanwhile, maintain extremelystraight upwind trajectories while flying at increasedvelocities relative to a clean air control. Thus, while fliesbehave similarly to moths in surging upwind on odorcontact, they do not share the common lepidopteran response of shifting to cross-wind casting flight in a homogenous odor plume. In additional studies, we haveshown that when flies lose contact with a pulsed odorplume, they often initiate cross-wind casting flight as theyattempt to recontact the plume, with casting occurringwithin approximately 300 ms of plume loss. Thus, D. melanogaster does not seem to require intermittent olfactory stimulation in order to maintain upwind flight.We have recently subjected D. melanogaster to additional olfactory experiments in which flies were tethered while olfactory stimuli have been presented to them in the same wind tunnel used in our free-flightexperiments (Figure 8). By analyzing the wing kinematicsof flies exposed to continuous and pulsed odor plumes, wehave shown that flies respond in a qualitatively similarway to both, with wing beat frequency increasing as alogarithmic function of the total duration of plumeexposure. Flies responded more strongly to continuousplumes, suggesting a relatively simple algorithm wherebywing beat frequency is a simple function of total olfactorystimulation. Indeed, when we varied the duration betweentwo brief odor pulses, the responses simply summed together. In the process, flies are able to track subsequent odor pulses via changes in their wing beat frequency atpulse frequencies up to 1.2Hz.222 Figure 8. (A) Representative trajectories from pulsed banana odor illustrate flight prior to plume contact (red), within the plume (blue), and following plume loss due to truncation (gray). (B) In the continuous large diameter plume, casting rarely initiated within the plume. Arrows indicate the initiation of fly tracking. Behavioral responses are a function of total olfa ctory stimulation and are not increased in pulsed plumes. Flies were tethered and their wing beat frequencies were recorded underdifferent odor presentation schedules. Odor was presented (red) in the form of a 140 ms pulse (C), a 1.3 sec pulse (D) four 19 0 ms pulses delivered over a 1.2 second interval (E) or, (not shown) a 360 ms pulse, a 5.4 sec pulse and 16 200 ms pulsesdelivered over a 5.2 sec interval. For continuous pulses, response magnitude increased as a logarithmic function of pulseduration with an apparent maximal response of approximately 8 Hz (F). Responses to continuous plumes were greater thanthose to pulsed plumes delivered over approximately the same duration. 335. Neuronal control of locomotor activity in the fruit flyAllan M. Wong When presented with visual or olfactory stimuli, the fruit fly changes its behavior. For instance, whenexposed to an expanding pattern of visual stimuli, the flywill move away from an expanding object; when exposedto low concentrations of carbon dioxide the fly will moveaway from the gas. In order to accomplish these behaviors, the fly must detect environmental changes, decide what to do, andcoordinate its muscles to accomplish the behavior. Wewish to understand how these steps are encoded in thenervous system of the fly. A good entry point is to understand how locomotor information is encoded by the descending interneurons. These neurons connect the brainwith the thoracic ganglia (the equivalent of the spinal cordin vertebrates). All visually and olfactory-mediatedbehaviors must be transmitted through these neurons. We performed preliminary experiments to identify these neurons using the light-activatable tracerGFP. We expressed this molecule in all neurons in the fly,light-activated a small spot in the neural pathway betweenthe head and thorax and then examined the brain to revealabout 90 pairs of neurons. We plan to record the activity of these descending interneurons while the fly is freely walking. In order toaccomplish this, we built a walking arena modeled after Erich Buchner's design, where a tethered fly is walking ontop of a floating ball. This allows for a preparation that simulates walking behavior while the fly is stationary, permitting functional imaging and electrophysiologicalrecording with a two-photon microscope. We are alsointegrating the ball with the virtual flight arena hardwaredeveloped by Michael Reiser to present visual stimuli tothe walking fly.

Although theidentities and many of the properties of these componentsare now known, it remains unclear how the circuits theycompose function reliably within cells. In order to addressthese problems, we are applying experimental andtheoretical techniques to key model systems in severaldifferent ways: First, we construct synthetic genetic circuits and study their behavior in individual cells. These syntheticcircuits are simpler counterparts to the complex circuitsone finds in nature. This approach, often called \"syntheticbiology,\" allows one to analyze how various circuitdesigns might work, and begin to understand what isspecial about the specific circuit architectures observed inorganisms. We have constructed circuits that exhibitoscillations and other dynamic phenomena, (e.g., Elowitzand Leibler, 2000). We have also used synthetic circuits toanalyze the dynamics and variability of gene regulation atthe single-cell level (e.g., Elowitz et al., 2002, and Rosenfeld et al. , 2005). Current synthetic biology projects focus on regulation of two-component systems in bacteria,and higher-level developmental pattern formation ineukaryotic organisms. Second, we analyze the dynamics of specific natural genetic circuits in order to understand basicprinciples of their operation. We have developed theability to acquire and quantitatively analyze large time-lapse movie datasets. These movies allow tracking ofcircuit dynamics in individual cells as they grow anddevelop. By incorporating several distinguishable fluorescent protein reporter genes in these organisms, we can track several different circuit componentssimultaneously. The results constrain models of thecorresponding circuits and provide insight into basicprinciples of their operation. A recent example of thisapproach is our work on regulation of genetic competenceinBacillus subtilis (see Suel et al. , 2006).Third, we are pay particular attention to variability within cell populations. Variability is a basicfeature of biological systems. Genetically identical cellsappear to actively generate variability, even inhomogeneous environmental conditions. We focusspecifically on two complementary questions: How do cells use intrinsic \"noise\" (stochasticity) in their own components to make effectively random cell fatedecisions? And how do they suppress noise in order tooperate reliably despite of variability? Current projects areexamining these issues in Bacillus subtilis, a prokaryote that exhibits relatively simple models of differentiation anddevelopment, as well as in the more complicatedembryonic stem cell system. Projects in the lab make extensive use of relatively simple mathematical models of genetic circuits. We are also developing software and tools to improve genecircuit construction and quantitative analysis of movie data. References Elowitz, M.B. and Leiber, S.

Transient and probabilistic differentiation in the competence response of B. subtilisG\u00fcrol S\u00fcel, Rajan Kulkarni ,Jordi Ojalvo Garcia How do cells make random decisions about whether and when to differentiate? Can otherwiseidentical cells manage fluctuations, or noise, within their own components in order to effectively \"roll the dice\" when choosing cell fates? Recently, we have begun to useBacillus subtilis as a model organism to address these questions. In B. subtilis , competence is a transient differentiated state in which cells can take up extracellularDNA. The decision to become competent is probabilisticand occurs in at most 10-20% of cells. Using time-lapsefluorescence microscopy movies, we analyzed thedynamics of the genetic circuit controlling competence atthe single-cell level (S\u00fcel et al., 2006). Our results suggest that entry into competence and subsequent exit from it are controlled together by a core module of three genes that generate noise-excitable dynamics in a cell-autonomousfashion. (An excitable system, such as a neuron, is one inwhich a small perturbation can generate a well-definedresponse, such as an action potential.) This network makesuse of a combination of positive and negative feedbackloops to ensure that differentiation is transient.Additionally, we reengineered the competence circuit toaccess novel regimes of dynamic behavior, verifying a keyprediction of the model. These results show that cells haveevolved a dynamical mechanism which allows them toregulate the probability of competence much as a neural225 system can control the firing rate of action potentials. More generally these results suggest that quantitativemeasurement of decision-making circuit dynamics inindividual cells can reveal Suel, G.M., J., Liberman, Elowitz, M.B. 440(7083):545-550. Figure 1 :B. subtilis cells under nutrient-limited conditions. Here, some cells are sporulating (small phasebright (white) objects), while others grow vegetatively(labeled green), and one becomes genetically competent (labeled red). Genetic competence and sporulation represent two alternative stress response states that cellsenter probabilistically. 337. Variability in sporulation initiation in B. subtilisJoe Levine, Rajan KulkarniUnder stressful conditions, B. subtilis cells respond by deciding whether, and when, to form robustspores that can survive harsh conditions and re-germinatelater. Interestingly, even under conditions that favor this sporulation process, individual cells exhibit a large variability in the time it takes for them to initiatesporulation. This sporulation delay may function as a formof \"bet-hedging\" given the uncertainty of futureenvironmental conditions that may improve (favoringvegetative growth) or may continue to deteriorate(favoring sporulation). The sporulation initiation circuitryhas been well characterized using genetic and biochemicaltechniques, but it remains unclear how it functions tocreate long and variable delays in individual cells. In orderto analyze the behavior of this circuitry at the single-celllevel, we have constructed a variety of strains incorporating several different fluorescent reporter genes. Examining these strains with fluorescent time-lapsemicroscopy, we have observed variability in the expressionof sporulation-specific genes which correlates withvariability in the decision-making process. We are currently exploring how various dynamic mechanismsmight generate this variability and looking for signaturesof these mechanisms in gene expression patterns. 338. Phosphorelay dynamics Shaunak Sen Bacteria sense and react to environmental conditions using a variety of sensory systems. A dramaticexample of how environment shapes bacterial behavior isin the starvation response of B. subtilis . When single cells ofB. subtilis are in an environment with an abundant supply of nutrients, they grow and divide normally.However, when conditions are unfavorable, they make adecision to stop dividing and form spores. The genetic circuit responsible for initiating this response consists of a signal transduction unit called aphosphorelay, embedded in a complicated set of positive and negative regulatory feedback loops. The goal of this study is to relate the architecture and function of differentparts of this network. We have assembled a system thatallows us to study the dynamics of the circuit in isolationfrom downstream effects. This work should provide aframework for establishing the sufficiency of a set ofinteractions in producing complex dynamics. 339. Developmental noise Avigdor EldarStochasticity, or \"noise\" can affect the individual steps of many developmental processes. Yet, developmental systems operate reliably most of the time.In order to understand how developmental systemssuppress undesirable noise in their components, we areusing the simple developmental process of sporulation inB. subtilis. Sporulation involves the asymmetric division of a single cell into a small (forespore) and large (mothercell) compartment. After division, the two cells initiate two separate, but tightly coordinated, programs of geneexpression and morphological change. Eventually theforespore is engulfed in the mother cell whichsubsequently lyses. By constructing multiply-labeled fluorescent reporter strains of B. subtilis and imaging them using quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we areinvestigating the generation and propagation of noise inparticular steps of this process. This effort should revealgeneral principles of noise resistance in development. 340. D irectional selection modulates phenotypic fluctuations: On the noiseChiraj DalalMany biological traits are quantitative: levels of gene expression, sizes of appendages, and abundances of cellular components can vary over a wide range. Meanvalues of such phenotypes are genetically encoded andsubject to the forces of selection. Many such phenotypesalso appear to be noisy: that is, genes specify adistribution of possible values for the trait, rather than aprecise value. In some cases, it has been observed that the 226 variance of this distribution, like the mean, is under genetic control (Raser et al. , 2004). Recent work (Bar-Even et al., 2006, Newman et al., 2006) suggests that both means and variances of phenotypes are susceptible to selectivepressures. However, for an individual in a population,only its (random) phenotypic value is under selection, not the underlying parameters of the distribution. Here we ask how positive directional selection affects variance in asimple quantitative trait. Analytically, we find thatvariance increases under strong selection and decreasesunder weak selection. Furthermore, we find that this resultis not limited to variance, but also applies more generallyto the noise of phenotypes. This observation opens upseveral interesting questions about how noise is generatedand selected during evolution, which we are exploringthrough a combination of experimental and theoreticalstudies.

Newman, cis-regulation of bacterial promoters Robert Sidney Cox IIICombinatorial regulation of transcriptional initiation is a fundamental mechanism that cells use tointegrate multiple inputs and control gene expression. Wehave constructed a synthetic library of combinatorialpromoters, and developed a high-throughput assay formeasuring the cis-regulatory input logic of these promoters inE. coli. A total of 48 pieces of synthetic duplex DNA fragments were randomly assembled by 5' overhangligation and cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid.Each promoter was then assayed in a combination of inducers to determine its logical response to each transcription factor. The library has an estimated diversityof 1,000-4,000 unique regulatory sequences, comprising atotal of up to 400 kb of novel regulatory sequence. Eachpromoter is controlled by regulatory sequences for up tothree of five transcription factors. The types of regulatorylogic found in the library will provide insight into theregulatory mechanisms of natural combinatorialpromoters, and how promoter architecture governstranscriptional logic.342. A synthetic approach to pattern formation David SprinzakEmbryonic development frequently involves the spontaneous emergence of cell patterns within an initiallyequivalent field of cells. This process is required, forexample, for the specification and development of neurons in the central nervous system in vertebrates. It has been proposed that this type of patterning happens by amechanism known as 'lateral inhibition,' in which cellsacquiring a desired cell fate prevent their neighbors fromacquiring it. These patterning processes are executedthrough a combination of intracellular genetic cell-cell called juxtacrine is the Notch/Delta which themembrane-bound ligand, Delta, on one cell interacts withthe Notch receptor in neighboring cell. Here we utilize a synthetic approach to study 'design principles' underlying this type of cellular patterning. We are constructing a synthetic genetic circuitthat is based on the natural circuit of lateral inhibition. Byutilizing the relative isolation of the synthetic system wecan address some of the basic questions regarding theproperties of the natural circuits controlling developmentaldifferentiation: What are the design principles that governthese genetic circuits? What makes one circuit designperform better over others or be more robust than others?How do the properties of the signaling system affect theformation of the patterns? To construct these synthetic lateral inhibition circuits, we are developing and characterizing severalgenetic components including both regulatory componentsand synthetic intercellular signaling systems. Thesecomponents are integrated in mammalian cell culture via anovel genetic approach that enables a reproducible andquantitative investigation of the constructed circuits. Thedynamics of these circuits are studied using automatedtime lapse microscopy of fluorescent protein reporters. 343. Analysis of gene circuitry underlying embryonic stem (ES) cell to trophectoderm stem (TS) cell conversion Fred TanA fundamental question in development is how individual cells choose among possible cell fates.Embryonic stem cells now permit quantitative analysis ofthe dynamics of the gene circuits which control suchdecisions. Here we focus on specification oftrophectoderm, which marks the first differentiation eventof the mammalian embryo. Cells of the trophectodermlineage form the placenta, an extraembryonic organ thatinterfaces maternal and fetal environments for nutrient and gas exchange. Molecular determinants involved in trophectoderm specification act early in embryogenesis(prior to the morula stage), but the existence of distinct celltypes is not apparent until the formation of the blastocyst.Aside from the identification of a handful of genesabsolutely required for lineage specification, the227 underlying regulatory network governing trophectoderm fate specification remains to be characterized. Recently, an analogous process of differentiation has been observed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cellswhereby transient ectopic expression of the gene cdx2 is sufficient to generate a cell with morphological characteristics of trophectoderm stem (TS) cells. TS cells are a multipotent cell type that supports the developmentof the entire placental lineage. Cdx2 is thought to be amaster regulator of the trophectoderm fate in vivo and its repression in ES cells is dependent on the pluripotencyregulator Oct4. Although the role of Oct4 during in vivo trophectoderm specification is unknown, cross regulationbetween the two transcription factors may control fatespecification in early blastomeres, despite epigeneticdifferences with embryonic stem cells (a population mostsimilar to the embryonic epiblast). The interesting pattern of cross-regulation between these two key developmental transcription factors represents an opportunity to analyze a cell fate decision atthe single-cell level. To that end, we are buildingfluorescently labeled cell lines in which we willcharacterize gene regulatory dynamics between Cdx2 andOct4 using mouse ES cells as a model system. We willconnect the activities of Cdx2 and Oct4 to the emergenceof TS characteristics and the loss of pluripotent markers tobetter compare in vitro and in vivo differentiation programs. We will quantitatively analyze expressiondynamics of these key transcription factors and their target genes and use this data to develop a model of cell fate specification. In this way, we hope to understand howinteractions among key transcription factors permit cells toexist as discrete lineage types, and how Cdx2 expressionalone is coupled to a developmental program thatreinforces differences between cells to initiate theformation of a distinct cell lineage.

Summary: Our laboratory has dedicated itself to an integrative approach to defining the cell and molecularbasis of embryonic patterning, in which in vivo imaging tools play a central role. The explosion of data frommolecular approaches and the dramatic progress from in vitro culture assays have resulted in a rich set of proposals for the mechanisms that underlie developmental pattering. Systems biology provides a means to organize this wealth of data, but requires some means to test the proposedlinkages. Our goal is to test these proposed mechanisms inthe intact embryo, with the hope of moving forward to anunderstanding of which of the potential mechanismsoperate in the natural biological context. There are manychallenges to such tests, including the tagging of cells ormolecules so that they can be followed in the intactsystem, the visualization of the tagged structures, and theinterpretation of the time-varying events these imagesrepresent. Solutions to these challenges require the coordinated efforts of researchers spanning the life and physical sciences. In the past year we have made significant advances in understanding the formation of thecardiovascular system in the zebrafish embryo. A majorchallenge in studying the development of the heart hasbeen that key developmental events take place while theheart is beating twice a second. To answer this challenge,we have helped to refine a new microscope, now availablecommercially, with the ability to collect confocal laserscanning images at rates of 100's of frames per second.This permits the direct imaging of events within a normal embryonic heart as it is undergoing its dramatic morphogenesis, forming chambers and valves. New imageprocessing tools allow us to assemble time-series datafrom many optical sections into a four-dimensionalrendering of the moving cardiac cells together withdetailed maps of the blood flow. New image analysistechniques permit quantitative analyses of these motions,and are permitting tests, in collaboration with the GharibLab (Bioengineering, Caltech), of the roles fluid flows andforces play in the shaping of heart chambers and valves. In parallel with the refinement of new imaging tools, we have been creating new a more efficient means for creating embryos with genetically-encoded fluorescenttags. Through random insertion into the genome, thisapproach permits the creation of functional fusionsbetween a host protein and a fluorescent protein,permitting cells and developmental questions to be posedin normally developing embryos. The creation of thesenew lines is dramatically more efficient than previousapproaches, making it possible for even modest sizedfacilities to embark on large-scale screens. This increasedefficiency of creating marked strains requires a parallelincrease in imaging technologies, and the refinement of in toto image acquisition and analysis tools answers this challenge.229 There have been dramatic advances in other areas as well, ranging from the refinement of new sensortechnologies with researchers in the Kavli NanoscienceInstitute, to improved tools for acquiring information fromMRI images. Our combination of modern and classicaltechnologies continues to offer surprises, including the discovery of a novel sensory pathway in the mammalian olfactory system. 344. Towards a digital fish: in toto imaging of zebrafish development Sean Megason, Scott E. Fraser A representative image from an in toto image set of the developing inner ear of the zebrafish. Nuclei aremarked green using Histone2B-EGFP and cellmembranes are marked red using a membrane-localized mCherry. We are trying to determine thecomplete lineage of the inner ear. I am interested in studying zebrafish development using in toto imaging, a novel technology I am developing. The goal of in toto imaging is to digitize in vivo data in a quantitative and high-resolution manner, which is essentialfor the emerging field of systems biology. In toto imaging, in which nearly every cell in a developing embryo or tissuecan be tracked through space and time, may become astandard technique for small transparent embryos such aszebrafish, C. elegans , and early-stage chick and mouse embryos. There are several technical challenges that must be met in order to permit in toto imaging. Firstly, embryos must be labeled in such a way to allow all of the cells inthe region of interest to be individually distinguishable sothey can be segmented. I have developed a labelingmethod using Histone2B-EGFP and membrane localizedmCherry to label all the nuclei green and cell membranesred. This labeling technique allows each cell in a tissue tobe segmented and reveals cellular morphology very nicely.The next technical challenge that must be met for in totoimaging, is that embryos must be imaged at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to allow every cell to betracked during development without damaging the embryo.We have developed mounting, confocal imaging, and datastorage techniques that make it possible to continuouslyimage a zebrafish embryo at very high spatial and temporal resolution for 48 hours and to successfully archive the gigabytes of images. The final and most difficultchallenge for in toto imaging is to actually segment and track the cells in the image set. I have developed asoftware package called GoFigure for this purpose. GoFigure can automatically segment cells in image sets and connect the segmented cells to form cell tracks andcell lineages. I am first applying in toto imaging for determining the full lineage of the inner ear of zebrafish,but I would like to extend these methods to the wholeembryo. We are also developing methods to fluorescentlymark a wide range of biological data on a genome-wide scale such that it can be digitized with in toto imaging. 345. Four-dimensional image reconstruction and analysis for quantitative study of theembryonic heartMichael Liebling, Arian S. Farouhar, MortezaGharib *, Scott E. E. Dickinson** The temporal alignment of nongated slice- sequences acquired at different axial positions in the zebrafish heart permits the reconstruction ofdynamic, three-dimensional data (four-dimensional imaging). This approach overcomes the current acquisition-speed limitation of confocal microscopes forreal-time 3D imaging of fast processes. We developedsynchronization methods to perform either uniform ornonuniform temporal registration. When data is uniformlyscaled in time and aligned, slight variations in the heartrhythm that occur within a heartbeat are not compensated.Since this imposes constraints on the admissible dataquality, we derived a nonuniform registration procedurebased on the minimization of the absolute value of theintensity difference between adjacent slice-sequence pairs.The method compensates for temporal intra-sample variations and allows the processing of a wider range of data; in particular, it permits the reconstruction of datasetseven when some slices contain aperiodicities. The 4Dreconstructions, based on data acquired in living,fluorescent zebrafish embryos and combined withquantitative analysis approaches, have enabled thegeneration of heart function models, providing informationabout wall motion, muscle contraction, cushion and valvemotion, and blood flow, depending on which transgenicfluorescent protein marker line was used. *Option of Bioengineering and 3Graduate Aeronautical **Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX230 346. Investigating the role of the Grueneberg ganglion in mammalian olfactionDavid S. Koos, Scott E. FraserThe Grueneberg ganglion is a small nerve located in the lining of the far rostral rodent nasal vestibule.Historically, this nerve was thought to be a component ofthe terminal nerve, a non-sensory neuroendocrine nervethat does not innervate the first relay station of the primaryolfactory pathway, the olfactory bulb. After noting that theGrueneberg ganglion expresses the pan-olfactory markerOlfactory Marker Protein (OMP), we suspected that thisganglion might instead be part of the olfactory pathway. Through the use of axon tract tracing techniques we have demonstrated that the Grueneberg ganglion projects itsaxons to a little known specialized sub-domain of theolfactory bulb, referred to as the olfactory necklaceglomeruli. The expression of OMP combined with itsdirect wiring to the olfactory bulb suggests that theGruenberg ganglion is a previously unrecognizedcomponent of the primary olfactory pathway. Our currentwork is focused on elucidating the axonal behaviors andmolecular coding that underlie the connectivity of thisganglion with the necklace glomeruli. These experiments will provide important insight into the molecular nature and potential chemosensory function of this unusualolfactory nerve. Publication Koos, D.S. and Fraser S.E.

FraserEpithelial cells provide the structural basis for organ development; therefore, understanding the molecularand cellular biology of epithelial formation will providefundamental insights into the principles underlyingorganogenesis. To this end, we are using the embryonicheart tube as a model to study the dynamic cellularinteractions of epithelial cells during organ formation. Toassess epithelial cell behavior, we are performing four-dimensional imaging of transgenic zebrafish lines that mark the myocardial precursors, the epithelial cells of the developing heart tube. Using a green fluorescent proteinfused to a membrane localization of signal(membraneGFP), we detect extensive filapodia formationbetween the cells of the myocardial epithelia as theymigrate to the midline. Furthermore, we find thatmyocardial precursors delaminate from the bilateralepithelial sheets. We are currently testing the hypothesisthat these delaminating cells undergo a differentiationswitch to become endocardial cells. The availability ofmutations previously identified in forward genetic screens affecting epithelial formation provides a genetic framework into which these cell behaviors can be placed.The analyses of wild-type and mutant cell behaviorsduring heart tube formation should further facilitate ourunderstanding of the complex cellular interactions duringcardiac development as well as the mechanisms underlyingepithelial morphogenesis.231 348. Genetic and epigenetic of bilateral embryoJulien Vermot, Scott E. FraserThe LR asymmetric positioning of internal organs is in contrast with the bilateral symmetry of themusculoskeletal and dermal outer layers of the body wall in most, if not all, vertebrates. The bilateral symmetry arises from the synchronized segmentation of the paraxialmesoderm on both sides of the neural tube into alignedpairs of somites along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis.The LR axis arises from a complex cascade of epigeneticand genetic mechanisms that ultimately results in thedirectional transfer of laterality information to the regionsadjacent to the embryonic node by the late gastrulation andearly somitic stages. Recent studies demonstrated that theNotch signaling pathway is required for the determinationof the LR axis and the symmetry of somite formation,while retinoic acid (RA) protects the paraxial mesoderm from laterality determination to maintain bilateral symmetry. On the other hand, cilia rotating in theembryonic node act as an epigenetic mechanismresponsible for breaking early embryonic symmetry andinduce left-right axis specification. In order to better understand the mechanisms maintaining the axis of symmetry, we designed tools toinduce asymmetric growth and disrupt the bilateralsymmetry of somite formation in chick ( Gallus gallus ). Our result shows that the synchronization of somiteformation is actively controlled between the two embryonic sides. We are currently identifying the signals involved in this process using genetic tools available infish ( Danio rerio ). Furthermore, we study cilia rotation by using high speed imaging in order to understand their rolein instructing the left-right axis and the axis of symmetry.For that purpose, we are currently developing tools thatwill help us to understand the hydrodynamics and the flowgenerated by cilia in fish. 349. Assessing mobility differences of GFP zebrafish neuronal growth cones withmulti-photon FRAP Rajan P. Kulkarni, Scott E. Fraser Navigating growth cones need to integrate, process and respond to guidance signals, requiringdynamic information transfer within and between differentcompartments. Studies have shown that faced withdifferent navigation challenges, growth cones displaydynamic changes in growth kinetics and morphologies.However, it remains unknown if these are paralleled bydifferences in their internal molecular dynamics. Toexamine if there are protein mobility differences duringguidance, we developed multi-photon fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) methods to determine molecular diffusion rates in pathfinding growthcones in vivo . Actively navigating growth cones (leaders) have consistently longer recovery times compared to onesthat are fasciculated and less actively navigating(followers). Pharmacological perturbations point to actin as the primary modulator ofdiffusion in differently behaving growth cones. This approach provides a powerful means to quantify mobilityof specific proteins in neurons in vivo and reveals that diffusion is important during axon navigation. 350. Hydrodynamics of the zebrafish David a clearly defined anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral axis. Less noticeableis the left-right axis that exists primarily in the internalorgans. The present hypothesis for left-right asymmetrybreaking in zebrafish involves transport of signalingpackets from one side of the Kupffer vesicle to the other,in spite of continual circulation in spheroid vesicle. The Kupffer vesicle is a ~70 \u00b5m cavity that arises near the tail of the embryo at around 11 hours post fertilization. The circulation inside the vesicle is generated by theciliated lining, and the mechanism by which cilia createflow is also controversial. By modeling the cilia-generatedhydrodynamics and by measuring the in vivo flow field inside the Kupffer vesicle with optical tweezers, we hopeto elucidate the mechanism by which circulation is generated, and illuminate the physical aspects behind left- right asymmetry breaking. 351. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of two-state systemsDavid Wu, Scott E. FraserIn equilibrium statistical mechanics, the Gibbs algorithm for calculating probability distributions is aworkhorse that consists of maximizing the entropy undercertain constraints on the ensemble, such as a constantparticle number, energy, etc. However, there is no reason why this concept cannot be extended to non-equilibrium systems. In equilibrium, maximizing the entropy isnothing more than a statement that the underlyingdegeneracy of microstates should be maximal;equivalently, there are relatively few states.In instead of of microstates,there are degeneracies microtrajectories. We seek totest this hypothesis experimentally. Using scanningoptical tweezers, we generate microjectories by forming aW-shaped potential on which a colloidal particle maydiffuse: this can be thought of as a two-state system,wherein the colloid takes different trajectories along the curvature of the W-potential, each state being defined as one half of the potential. Here, using certain constraintssuch as the relative time spent in one state versus anotherand the switching rate between states, we maximize thetrajectory entropy that should give us the probabilitydistribution of a non-equilibrium system.232 352. Magnetic bead localization as a tool for interference with zebrafish development Luca Caneparo, Scott E. FraserDuring animal development a single cell is able to form different tissues and cell types. One of themechanisms, used several times during animal development, to create diversity is the asymmetric cell distribution of developmental determinants. Thedifferential localization of signals during development is amechanism repeatedly used among animals. For instance localization of \u0001 -catenin soon after fertilization is required to correctly position the axis in amphibian and fish embryos; later in development a similar strategy is used byneural precursors to give rise to differential cell populationin mouse cerebral cortex. The unequal distribution ofdeterminants it plays a key role during embryogenesis andis required for the correct development in different species. In order to understand the mechanisms of differential localization and to try to selectively perturbsuch events we test the possibility to use magnetic beads to modify cell behavior at different time points during zebrafish development. Zebrafish embryos injected at one cell stage with fluorescent magnetic beads (1 \u00b5m in diameter) coated with carboxyl group show no preferential localization or toxicity at 5 days post fertilization (5 dpf) once injected at one cell-stage. The carboxyl group present at the surface gives the opportunity to link proteinsto the beads, so as a test experiment we coupled Cherryproteins to the magnetic beads with similar results onceinjecting the modified beads at one cell stage. Soon after injection we applied a constant magnetic field in proximity to the embryos and we wereable to localize at the cell cortex the majority of the beads.Reorienting the embryos with respect to the magnetallowed us to reposition the magnetic beads. Thisvalidates the possibility of functionalizing beads withdevelopmental determinants and localizing the signals using an external magnetic field. 353. In vivo 4D magnetic resonance microscopy of neurulation and somitogenesis in Michael Tyszka, Yun Kee, Russell E. Jacobs,Marianne Bronner Fraser*, Scott E. FraserMagnetic resonance microscopy offers a unique window on deep tissue movements in optically opaque embryos. The aim of this project is to develop MR microscopy with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution toexplore key developmental processes during neurulationand somitogenesis in established amphibian embryonicmodels. The Xenopus laevis (African Clawed Frog) embryo is a classical vertebrate model of early embryonicdevelopment. Recent studies of vertebrate embryos havedemonstrated the potential of MR microscopy indevelopmental biology, particularly in gastrula-stage frogembryos (1,2). Optical imaging such as confocal laser-scanning microscopy are essential in thebiological imaging field but are limited by the opticalopacity of the organism. MRM may have a valuable roleto play in this area since it is unhindered by opticalopacity. We describe here initial experiences with highfield MR microscopy studying neurulation andsomitogenesis in single and multiple frog embryos. Wild- type Xenopus laevis oocytes were harvested, fertilized and incubated at room temperature (18-20\u00b0C) prior to imaging. A T 1 contrast agent was microinjected into either (a) both cells of the two cell-stage embryo or (b) the blastocoelfluid space of the blastula (stage 8-9) reducing T 1 to less than 200 ms. Volumetric spin echo MRM data wereacquired using an 11.7T 89 mm vertical bore microscope(Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA). Single embryos weremounted within a 1.8 mm id water-susceptibility matchedtube that was subsequently sealed with dental wax tominimize buffer evaporation. Spatiotemporal resolutionfor a nominal SNR of 5-10 was 10 to 20 minutes/volumewith 19 \u00b5 m isotropic sampling for single embryos. Volumetric time-courses of normally developing Xenopus laevis embryos were acquired over the complete course of neurulation and early tailbud stages. Gadoteridol did notcross the embryonic cell membranes, remaining in the labeled compartment following injection. These proof-of- concept experiments demonstrate that contrast-enhanced4D MR microscopy of developing frog embryos caneffectively visualize key tissue structures and movementsduring frog neurulation and somitogenesis, complementingcellular level light microscopy of superficial cell layers.*Professor, Division of Biology, Caltech References 1.

Ruffins, Melanie Martin, Scott E. Fraser,Russell E. Jacobs, Rusty Lansford We have developed a Quail Developmental Atlas (QDA) that provides a perfectly registered volumetric reconstruction of developing quail embryos using amagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) microscope. We arecollaborating with curators at the California ScienceCenter and the San Francisco Exploratorium to design anddevelop interactive exhibits that will bring the QDA to abroader lay audience and around which we intend todevelop more formal educational programming. We are inthe process of publishing our ex ovo (E5-E10) and then in ovo (E7-E15) data with TheScientificWorld in an online format for the developmental biology and anatomy research community. We have annotated the grossanatomical structures within the classic spatialcompartments comprising the embryo using Amirasoftware. Anatomy will also be used as primaryframework for incorporating specific patterns, such asgene expression, the distribution of receptors and theirligands, and cell migration routes. The QDA project has been greatly advanced with high school students helping to annotate the MRI data setsusing Amira software and to produce exhibit quality movies using Final Cut Pro movie editing software. We are updating on a weekly basis and a website has beenestablished to disseminate the QDA(http://atlasserv.caltech.edu/Quail/Start Quail.html ). Our use of high school students also provides several youngpotential scientists with their first exposure to 'cuttingedge' research and direct mentoring from researchscientists. Under current consideration, we propose to develop a publicly accessible educational exhibit. Thisexhibit would be replicated in at least two institutions andwould supplement and enhance existing displays of embryo development with high-resolution interactive imagery. In addition to these public displays, we arecollaborating with the Teacher Institute of the SanFrancisco Exploratorium to bring the QDA to high schoolclass biology, math, and physics classes. The students willbe able to carry out 'virtual dissections' of the quail embryos in the biology modules, run MRI-based simulations in the physics modules, and work on numerous\"EggMath\" and embryo growth math problems in the mathmodules. The Teachers Institute at the San Francisco Exploratorium will lead efforts to develop a QDAworkshop for high school teachers that will be taught firstat the San Francisco Exploratorium in Summer 2007 andthen at the California Science Center. We also plan todevelop and freely distribute self-contained interactiveDVDs that contain QuickTime movies of the QDA that students can easily use, along with the physics and math modules. Our long-term goal is that the website,interactive DVDs and museum exhibits will have anationwide audience within three years. The Quail Developmental Atlas represents the interests and intentions of scientists and educators from theSan Francisco Exploratorium, the California ScienceCenter, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,TheScientificWorldJournal, and the California Institute ofTechnology. 355. Quantitative in vivo imaging of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks Mat Barnet, Scott E. FraserThe fundamental question of developmental biology is how a single fertilized egg cell gives rise to acomplex organism containing thousands, millions, orbillions of highly integrated cells. As large-scale genomeprojects continue to reveal the striking genetic similaritiesamong different species, it is becoming more and moreclear that interspecies variation results not from any majordifferences in the sets of genes different organismspossess, but from differences in the regulation and expression of those genes. To better understand how gene regulatory networks govern embryonic development, we234 are collaborating with Eric Davidson's Lab, using sea urchins as a model system. The size, shape, and opticaltransparency of sea urchin embryos makes them ideal forstudy by light microscopy. We are developingfluorescence imaging tools and techniques to enable in vivo quantification of the dynamics of the gene regulatory network responsible for specification of the sea urchin endoderm and mesoderm. One technique involvesquantitatively imaging expression of a reporter gene (e.g.,green fluorescent protein (GFP)) in the three-dimensionalembryo laser (TPLSM). Byquantifying gene expression patterns in three dimensionsover time, we aim to better understand how the dynamicsof gene regulatory networks govern developmentalprocesses. Another technique involves the small-moleculefluorophores FlAsH and ReAsH, which recognize and bindtetracysteine tags of the form CCXXCC, which can be engineered into transcription factors and other proteins of interest. Use of FlAsH and ReAsH allows for in vivo pulse-chase type experiments, in which we aim to quantifyprotein production and turnover dynamics. By ourquantitative approaches, we hope to generate kinetic datathat can be applied to the current, largely qualitative(Boolean), gene network models, to enable the models tomake quantitative predictions of regulatory dynamics,thereby helping to further our understanding of howcomplex organisms develop from single cells. 356. The roles of EphA4 and Ephrin-A5 during cranial neural crest migration in the avianembryoCarole Lu, Scott E. FraserCranial neural crest cells are multipotent cells that arise in the dorsal neural tube and migrate in discretestreams in the avian embryo. In the posterior hindbrain,the neural crest cells first form a field of cells that thensegregate amongst branchial arches 3 and 4. Theunderlying mechanism of this sorting is unclear. However,this is similar to what occurs in Xenopus , where cranial crest cells first migrate as a wave and then segregate to different arches, a process which involves ephrin/Eph signaling. Here we investigate the role of ephrin-A5 andEphA4 in the migration of avian neural crest cells thatpopulate BA3 and BA4. When we misexpress ephrin-A5, neural crest cells are less likely to populate BA3; other branchial arches arenot affected. By labeling the crestcells with a and find that ectopic ephrin-A5 affects thedirection in which the cells migrate from the neural tube,specifically causing neural crest cells from r6 to delay their migration, and cease migration early. Misexpression of a constitutively active EphA4 construct causes neural crest aberrantly around the otic vesicle. Individual cellsdisplay erratic patterns of migration, where they actuallyturn around after extensive migration and migrate back towards the neural tube. A high level of EphA4 expressionalso causes premature cessation of migration.Misexpression of a dominant-negative EphA4 constructcauses a general reduction in the population of migratingneural crest cells. We also observe mismigration of neural crest cells around the otic vesicle. Eph/Ephrin signaling plays a role in ensuring the cranial neural crest cells migrate to their proper branchialarch destination. Surprisingly, the mechanism for this isnot limited to sorting of adjacent streams of migratingneural crest cells. Regulation of the cessation andcontinuation of migration is another potential mechanism. 357. Structural and functional integration in callosal agenesisJ. Michael Tyszka, Lynn Paul 1, Dirk Neumann2, Matthew Leonard1, Matthew Bridgman3, Scott E. Fraser, Ralph Adolphs1,2 Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is a relatively rare human developmental abnormality in whichthe corpus callosum is either completely or partiallyabsent. Many adult AgCC subjects have normal IQs andare asymptomatic in routine neurological or psychiatric examinations. As the rate of commissurotomies declines, individuals with AgCC are becoming our primary sourceof information about callosal transfer in the human brain.AgCC is particularly interesting to those studying networkplasticity and compensation since these subjects do notexhibit classical disconnection syndromes. The specificfocus of this project is to develop a more completeunderstanding of long-range structural and functionalintegration and the compensatory networks associated withAgCC using state-of-the-art non-invasive imaging andadvanced statistical modeling. To date we have studiedfive adult AgCC subjects using a battery of magnetic resonance imaging techniques including BOLD fMRI of coordinated bimanual motor tasks, somatosensorystimulation, high angular resolution diffusion imaging(HARDI) and time-of-flight angiography. Probabilisticfiber tracking (PFT) is now a routine tool for analysis ofHARDI data and infers structural connectivity bymodeling restricted anisotropic water diffusion withintissues in a non-deterministic framework. We arecurrently developing methods for integrating PFT withBOLD fMRI in order to characterize the remodeled motorsystem in AgCC from both the structural and functional standpoints. This project represents a multi-disciplinary, multi-center collaboration between the Divisions ofBiology, the Humanities and Social Sciences, CognitiveNeural Systems and the Fuller Graduate School using theadvanced resources of the Caltech Brain Imaging Center. 1Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences 2Computational and Neural Systems 3Fuller Graduate School, Pasadena235 Integrated probabilistic fiber tracking and BOLD fMRI localization in a normal control and AgCC subject. The left and right primary motor areas were localized using a coordinated finger tapping task (A,B,E,F).Probabistic fiber tracking results are overlaid on coregistered high-resolution structural MRI (C,D,G,H). Atotal of 5000 fibers were traced for each seed voxel within the motor areas. Exploration of the use of suchdata as a constraint or prior for connectivity modeling is a key element of this project. Note that in thissubject, the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles were significantly enlarged (colpocephaly, visible in axialsection in E,G) as were other CSF spaces. 358. Continued development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to age-related maculardegeneration (AMD)C.J. Yu, Jeff Fingler, Jon Williams, J. MichaelTyszkaAge-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss for people over 50 years of age in theWestern world. 90% of blindness related with this diseaseresults when sub-retinal neovascularization occurs anddamages the macular retina. Current therapies are directedtowards treating this form of the disease and halting theprogression. As for many diseases, recent studies suggest that treating AMD at early stages is more effective and has better long-term outcomes. One part of this project is using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to produce depth resolved reflectanceimaging of the retina. A commercially available OCTimaging system is currently being adapted to allowimaging of neovascularization much earlier in the diseaseprogression of AMD than possible with current clinicaltechnology. Before neovascularization occurs, lipid accumulation in Bruch's membrane reduces hydraulic conductivity and macromolecular permeability between the retina and its blood supply. Continued development ofMRI-based methods allows accurate measurement ofmembrane permeability indices using deuterium oxide as anegative contrast agent MRI. Model-based analysisof fluid equilibration fresh Bruch's membranesamples shows a consistent increase in membranepermeability following detergent treatment.359. A modified Golgi impregnation method for in vitro MR microscopy Xiaowei Zhang, Russell E. JacobsIn the late 19th century, Camillo Golgi revolutionized the budding discipline of neuroscience withhis Black [1, 2], now known as stain.The Golgi stain consists of pretreatment with potassiumdichromate and other additives [3] followed with silvernitrate resulting in black deposits clearly delineating soma,axons, and dendrites against a yellow background. MRmicroscopes with different weighting schemes (T1, T2 andproton density weighted, etc.) as well as contrast agents are used in an effort to highlight specific details in a manner analogous to Golgi Black Reaction [4]. Although there ismuch speculation as to what precisely the Black Reactiondoes, we hypothesized that, just as pretreatment withK 2(Cr 2O7) alters tissue properties in a dramatic way for subsequent silver staining, these altered tissue properties(and perhaps locally high concentrations of the Cr(III)paramagnetic) would give rise to different MRI contrastand/or differential absorption of a gadolinium contrastagent and lead to better definition of anatomical featuresand more facile identification of abnormalities. Golgi stain MR microscopy augments the MR contrast based on impregnation with potassium dichromateand a Gd-based contrast agent that allows differentiation ofthe cell layers of the brain (Fig. 1). MR images of brainstreated with the four procedures afford qualitativelydifferent contrast (Fig. 2). 3D FLASH images obtainedfrom ProHance plus K 2(Cr 2O7) treated samples show a high contrast-to-noise ratio and yield superior anatomical236 information (Fig. 3). With this new method, anatomical contrast is dramatically improved compared toconventional methods, suggesting potential applicationsfor studies of neurodegenerative diseases through itsability to highlight diverse anatomical regions at highcontrast and spatial 8(2):132-140.

Enlarged views of MR microscopy images (3D FLASH) selected from the brain treated with the modifiedGolgi method reveal a wealth of anatomic details, IZQ spectroscopy in a MR imagerBenoit Boulat, P.T. Narasimhan, Russell E.JacobsWe have utilized the effects the distant dipolar field (DDF) [1,2,3] to obtain one-dimensional high- resolution NMR spectra in the full head or a localized region in the brain of live mice. Experiments wereconducted on a 11.7T magnetic resonance (MR) imager.The method uses techniques of two-dimensional NMRspectroscopy [4] and can be well described within theformalism known as \"Intermolecular Zero Quantum (IZQ)spectroscopy\" [5] although a more classical descriptionusing the Bloch equations including the DDF wouldprovide for the same physical predictions [6]. The pulsesequences that were used to obtain the spectra werederived from the SEL-HOMOGENIZED class [5,7,8],adding when necessary a localization module. The t 1- modulated signal of the water and of the metabolites in the mouse brain was collected by the RF coil during the timet 2. After 2D Fourier transformation of the time domain data, the projection along the w 1 dimension provided a high-resolution IZQ spectrum exhibiting better immunityagainst broadening due to field inhomogeneities; indeed inthe setting described above, w 1labels the difference in frequency between the water resonance and the resonancesof the metabolites present in the brain of the mice studied.The figure below shows the in vivo 1D IZQ spectrum obtained in the head and a localized region in thebrain of a live transgenic mouse. Well-known metabolitesare identified in the spectra. Both spectra result from thecollection of 128x2048 time domain data points zero filledto 256x4096. Two averages were co-added for the full head spectrum, four for the one localized in a volume of 7x7x7mm 3 in the brain. References [1] Deville, G., Bernier M. and Delrieux, J.M. (1979) Magn.

Neuronal circuitry by magnetic resonance imaging in animal models of Down's syndromeElaine L. Bearer, Xiaowei Zhang, Russell E.JacobsThe Ts65Dn mouse is a widely used mouse model for human Down's syndrome (DS). DS is caused by a triple dose of chromosome 21 and is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation, affecting ~1/850 livebirths in the USA. In the fourth decade, DS individualsdevelop signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a major componentof senile plaques of AD, is triplicated on chromosone 21 inDS, thus linking Down's and AD at the molecular level.The Mobley lab at Stanford has shown that transport ofNGF, a growth factor for cholinergice neurons, may bedefective in DS and AD. Professor Bearer's laboratory at Brown University found that herpesvirus (HSV), the cause of the common cold sore, physically interacts with APP (Satpute- Krishnan, DeGiorgis et al., 2003). Using novel nano-bead technology, it was also found that APP is sufficient foranterograde transport. These discoveries raise thealarming possibility that HSV might be a risk factor forAlzheimer's disease. To test this possibility, we are taking several approaches, one of which is to study the pathways into andwithin the brain that the HSV virus might follow. Withcontrast agents such as manganese, MRI can revealcircuitry within the brain of living mice (Pautler, et al ., 2003), tracking brain circuitry and also allowing us to follow the course of a disease over time. We have used MRI to image relevant pathways in the living brain of an animal model of human Down'ssyndrome, the Ts65Dn mouse. Development of thistechnology is expected to transcend applications to theproblem of DS and AD, and provide insights about humanthought, behavior, and emotion--and even musicalappreciation.Methods: Mice were injected with 3-5 nL of 200 mM MnCl 2 into the hippocampus and imaged by MR before and at 30 min, 6 hr and 24 hr afterwards. An 11.7T 89 was used to acquire in vivo mouse brain images with a 35 mm linear birdcage RF coil. We employed a 3D RARE imaging sequence with RARE factor of 4, 4 averages, TR/TE eff = 300ms/21ms; matrix size of 256x160x128; FOV 23 mm x 14.4 x11.5 mm; yielding 90 mm isotropic voxels with 102minute scan time. A total of 13 (7 Ts65Dn and 6wild-type littermates) were imaged . averaged using full nonlinear nonlinear transformation was used to drive eachindividual mouse's pre-injected scan into a template of allscans and was then used to drive each mouse's 0.5 hr, 6 hr,and 24 hr scan into the same template. Anatomicaldifferences between the Ts65Dn and wild-type brain precluded successful nonlinear normalization into the same template. Students' t-test on a voxel-by-voxel basisdetermined differences with P<0.005 between sets of brainimages. Results and Interpretation: Statistical parametric mapping comparisons of the seven averaged DS brainswith averaged littermate controls demonstrated astatistically significant difference in the extent of Mn 2+ transport. In Ts65Dn mice, the Mn2+ travels further faster, being detectable in the medial septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens and other anterior brain structures at 6 hr after injection into the hippocampus in Ts65Dn brains but not inlittermate controls. These results suggest that transport isincreased in DS. This is further data supporting arelationship between intraneuronal transport and cognition,and provides us with tools to explore HSV transport and itsrole in AD. References Pautler, R.G., et al.

Applications of Terahertz imaging to medical diagnosticsPeter H. Siegel, Warren Grundfest (UCLA), ScottE. FraserThis research program aims to apply terahertz (THz) source and sensor technology towards (1) establishing and cataloging properties and contrast mechanisms in biomaterials and tissues and (2)investigating potential disease diagnostic applications.THz waves occupy the wavelength region between 100and 1000 microns, well beyond the traditional infrared. Asa consequence they can penetrate more readily into manyoptically opaque materials including plastics, wood,clothing, some crystalline structures and, as is theemphasis for this program, a small number of biomaterials- lipids, bone, skin, hair, etc. Unlike infrared and opticalsignals, THz penetration in tissue is dominated byabsorption not scattering, making the contrast mechanisms very different than those that are already being exploited in the optical regime. Water absorption is also extremelyhigh ( =100-300 cm -1) which has the disadvantage that very strong THz signal sources are required for significanttissue penetration, but the advantage that very subtlechanges in fluid content are detectable (the basis fordisease diagnostics). The first successful THz imagingsystems have been based on picosecond pulsed-laser timedomain spectroscopy techniques. These instruments offerunique spectral and time resolved information content buthave limited penetration depth (tens of microns in tissue) and only modest signal-to-noise ratio (100-1000). This program has now demonstrated three types of THzimaging systems based on continuous wave and sweptfrequency heterodyne techniques (more generally used inspace science and communications). One system operatesat a fixed frequency of 2520 GHz (120 micronswavelength) and boasts a signal-to-noise of more than10 10. A new frequency agile system, established last year, uses a millimeter wave vector network analyzer (MVNA)and can image between 100 and 1000 GHz (3 mm to 300microns wavelength). Finally, this year a swept frequencyinstrument, employing active illumination of the sample and real-time transmission, reflection and/or scattering measurements over 15% bandwidth can perform bothindex of refraction or narrow band spectroscopymeasurements on inserted samples between 550 and 650GHz. This system uses all solid-state components, hashand held transmit and receive heads and portableelectronics and power supplies. It is controlled by a laptop computer. Current work will extend this swept systemso as to enable imaging and time of flight (range finding)capabilities.ReferencesSiegel, P.H. (2004) THz technology in biology and medicine, IEEE Trans.

Siegel, Cavour Yeh *, Scott E. Fraser Recent interest in terahertz frequency imaging for medical applications (wavelength range from 1 mm to 100microns) has resulted in a flurry of new instrumentproposals using both time domain and high-resolutionfrequency domain spectral techniques. However, to date,there exists no methodology for transporting terahertzsignals from place-to-place with low loss, other than rigid-path free-space quasi-optical beam propagation. In orderto take advantage of modalities common at optical wavelengths, including in vivo and portable hand-held sensor/receiver systems, the equivalent of signal-confining optical fiber links must be developed for the far infraredand terahertz bands. Commonly employed transparentmaterials in the visible (i.e., amorphous glasses or clearplastics) are all extremely lossy at longer wavelengths dueto strong vibrational mode absorption. Dielectricsubstances with low absorption coefficient and high indexdo exist at terahertz frequencies, but they tend to becrystalline (quartz, silicon, germanium, GaAs) andtherefore have poor mechanical properties when it comesto forming flexible guiding structures. Metallic waveguide (hollow or coaxial), although somewhat flexible, has untenable high resistive wall loss. A few plastics such asTeflon, polyethylene and polypropylene, have very lowdispersion and absorption but have a low refractive indexthat makes it difficult to confine single-mode terahertzenergy as it propagates around bends or through joints.Earlier work by our collaborators has shown that highindex materials formed into ultra-thin ribbons can formvery low loss guiding media at millimeter-wavefrequencies (30-100 GHz). Extrapolating this concept intothe terahertz bands, and taking advantage of modern fabrication techniques, we believe it is possible to use a combination of high-dielectric-constant crystallinematerials in conjunction with low-loss, low-index plasticsto produce of flexible terahertz \"terahertz ribbon guide.\" Such a development wouldallow terahertz instruments to be freed from their fixed-beam-path table top environment, enabling, for the first241 time at these wavelengths, both hand-held scanner and in vivo endoscopic applications. This task has been investigating both the design and fabrication of low-loss single mode terahertz guiding structures. This year wehave developed a hybrid concept which combines theconcept of thin crystalline ribbon guide with a surrounding sheath of thin tubular quartz, that both holds the ribbon in place and serves as a dielectric shield to contain thepropagating fields. The new structure has a cross sectionthat resembles a \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign (below) andtherefore has been affectionately designated Do Not Enterguide. A prototype is now in production using drawnquartz fiber and will be evaluated this year. *California Advanced StudiesThis work is being funded by an NIH K25 training grantheld by Dr. Siegel, who holds a joint appointment as aTechnical Group Supervisor for Submillimeter WaveAdvanced Technology (SWAT) at JPL.

FraserSignaling regulates embryonic development by providing positional information to cells so that theydifferentiate properly as they proliferate to build up thefinal shape. However, defects leading to abnormalactivation of signal pathways often underlie mosttumorigenic events. In recent years, much has been discovered about the molecular and biochemical characteristics of a variety of signal transduction pathways.In contrast, the cell biology of such signaling events isstarting now to be studied. In particular, we are interestedin the following questions: 1) when does signaling occur;2) where does it take place; and, 3) for how long? We aimto address these questions by developing biosensors forfollowing in vivo signaling events with large sensitivity increase and high spatial and temporal resolution. We planto use nanobased biosensors that monitor signaltransduction through visualization of conformational changes and protein-protein interaction of components of signaling pathways. We aim to generate reagents that willenable us to follow various signaling events in real time.Ultimately, the established biosensors will be used toinvestigate signaling during zebrafish development and inthe manifestation of cancer. *JPL, Pasadena, CA For mation of self-assembled E. Fraser, RustyLansfordSelf-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are used to tune the chemical properties of solid surfaces.Specifically, we use functionalized alkylthiols to modifyAu substrates. These monolayers may be used to createsurfaces that specifically bind proteins, oligos, and cells. We have demonstrated that alkylthiols modified with biotin specifically bind avidin and avidin-likeproteins. Mixed monolayers of PEG- and biotin-modifiedalkylthiols were generated on gold and characterized byfluorescence microscopy (Figure 1).

Bjorkman*Specific delivery of proteins across polarized epithelia is controlled by receptor-mediated transcytosis. Based on studies of the trafficking of model receptors such as the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), thepathways for receptor-mediated transport of protein ligandsin the basolateral to apical direction are relatively wellunderstood. Less is known about the trafficking pathwaysfor receptors that transport from the apical to basolateralsurface. One such receptor is the neonatal Fc receptor(FcRn), which transports maternal immunoglobulin G(IgG) across intestinal or placental epithelial barriers toprovide immunity to fetal or newborn mammals and servesas a protection receptor for IgG, thereby increasing itsserum half-life. To investigate FcRn-mediated transport of IgG, we are using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK)cells stably expressing (MDCK-FcRn). The transfected specifically transcytose IgG and Fc across polarized cell monolayers, therefore presenting an ex vivo system that mimics the in vivo FcRn-dependent transport system. Using high-resolution confocal and multiphotonmicroscopy, intracellular labeled Fc and IgG in cells by colocalization studies with organelle-specificmarkers.

Single-bi omolecule resolution imaging with an optical microscopeLawrence A. Wade, C. Patrick Collier * Scott E. FraserA Fluorescence Apertureless Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope (FANSOM) has been developed with FWHM optical resolution below 10 nm when imaging at ~600 nm wavelengths [1]. The apparatus combines an epifluorescence optical microscope and an atomic forcemicroscope (AFM) to obtain single-molecule sensitivityand optical resolution limited by the sharpness of the AFMprobe. The AFM probe is used to stimulate or reduce thedetected fluorescence emission rate depending on the AFMtip material and the polarization of the excitation light.The probe-sample interaction is described by near-fielddipole-dipole physics, resulting in a stimulated emissionrate that varies by r 6. When tapping the probe over the substrate being imaged, the near-field component is sharply modulated at that tapping frequency, thereby enabling separation from the far-field background duringpost-processing. Images of fluorescent single moleculestaken in a physiological environment will be presented. We are also developing probe and substrate technologies to enable FANSOM to image and time-resolve the dynamics of biomolecular interactions. Thetools developed include generalized techniques for thegrowth and attachment of nanotubes for use in AFMimaging. With our nanotube tips we have generated 0.5nm resolution AFM images, potentially enabling optical imaging of single molecules with resolutions approaching 1 nm [2]. These nanotube probes can be uniquelyfunctionalized at their tips, serving as the foundation of aneffort to develop single-molecule sensors. Coating theseprobes with nm-thick films hasenabled the fabrication electrical We have also developed silane-chemistry dip-pennanolithography techniques for patterning coverslipswith functional proteins, peptides, etc. [4,5]. Bycombining FANSOM with these techniques we anticipatepatterning functional biomolecules onto glass coverslipsand then individually probing highly specific molecular interactions at in vivo -like molecular concentrations and characterizing cellular contents and expression with single-molecule discrimination. Finally, techniques are beingdeveloped for patterning phospholipid bilayers for use asmodel membrane systems. Together, these tools shouldprove particularly well suited for probing bio-interfaceproblems such as viral insertion, transmembrane proteintriggering and lipid raft formation and function. *Department of Chemistry Publications Canaria, C.A., Smith, J.O., Yu, C.J.

FergusonNational Institutes of HealthMoore Center for Biological Circuit Design Summary: We are interested in multiple questions in basic and applied insect biology. For further informationon Hay lab research consult our web page(http://www.its.caltech.edu/~haylab/). One goal of ourwork is directed towards understanding the genetic andmolecular mechanisms that regulate cell death,proliferation, innate immunity and spermatogenesis. WeuseDrosophila melanogaster as a model system to identify genes that function to regulate these processes.Important cellular regulatory pathways are evolutionarilyconserved; thus, molecules identified as regulators of these processes in Drosophila are likely to have homologs in vertebrates and the pathways that link these molecules are likely to be regulated similarly. A second goal of our workis to develop transgenic insects that will preventtransmission of mosquito-borne diseases such as malariaand Dengue fever. More than 500 million people areinfected with the malaria parasite each year, resulting inmore than 1 million deaths. Dengue, a mosquito-bornevirus infects more than 100 million people each year,resulting in more than 25,000 deaths. Effective vaccinesfor these diseases do not exist, and in the case of malaria, the causative agent, the parasite Plasmodium falciparum has acquired resistance to many drugs. Vector suppression through the release of sterile males, the use of insecticides,or modification of the environment provides an importanttool for limiting mosquito-borne disease. However, eachapproach has limitations. Release of sterile males providesonly transient population suppression, insecticides affectmany non-target species and mosquitoes often evolveresistance to these compounds, and wholesale modificationof the environment may not be feasible, or desirable insome situations based on ecological concerns. Our goalsare two-fold, to develop transgenic insects that lack the ability to transmit these pathogens, and to develop genetictools for driving these genes into wild populations of insects, thereby blocking disease transmission. 370. Drosophila models of human neuro- degenerative diseasesMing Guo (and the Guo lab), Bruce A. HayIn collaboration with the Guo lab at UCLA we are studying Drosophila models of the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease andParkinson's disease. References Guo, M. et al.

Gene activation screens for cell death regulators: MicroRNAs, small non-codingRNAs, define a new family of cell deathregulatorChun Hong Chen, Haixia HuangWe have carried out several screens for cell death regulators in the fly and have identified a number of new molecules. Among these are multiple microRNAs, small noncoding RNAs that function by inhibiting translation oftarget transcripts*. We are interested in determining whenand where these molecules regulate death, as well as thenature of their targets. We are also designing microRNAsthat target known cell death regulators as a way of probingthe function of these proteins in specific contexts. Reference *Xu, P. et al. (2003) Curr. Biol. 13:790-795. 372. Cell death, caspases and IAPs Israel Muro, Jun Huh, Soon Ji Yoo, H. Arno J.M\u00fcllerIn flies and vertebrates most, if not all, cells can undergo apoptosis in the absence of new gene expression,indicating that the components required to carry outapoptosis are present and ready for activation. The core ofthe cell death machine consists of members of a family ofproteases known as caspases, which become activated inresponse to many different death signals. Active caspasesthen cleave a number of different cellular substrates thatultimately lead to cell death and corpse phagocytosis. Most if not all cells constitutively express caspase zymogens (inactive precursors) sufficient to bring aboutapoptosis. Thus, the key to cell death and survivalsignaling revolves around controlling the levels of activecaspases in the cell. Several basic strategies are used toregulate caspase activity, and the core proteins that drivecaspase-dependent death are evolutionarily conserved. InDrosophila many cells experience chronic activation of the apical cell death caspase Dronc. If unrestrained, activeDronc cleaves and activates downstream effector caspasesthat bring about cell survive because theyexpress the IAP DIAP1, which suppresses Dronc activity, as well as that of caspases activated by Dronc. One major pathway through which caspase-dependent cell death in247 flies is induced is through the regulated expression of pro- apoptotic proteins that disrupt DIAP1-caspase interactionsthrough several different mechanisms, each of which hasthe effect of unleashing a cascade of apoptosis-inducingcaspase activity. We are interested in several questions.1) What are the signals that lead to caspase activation in cells that would normally live? 2) How do IAPs regulate caspase activity and when and where does this regulationdefine points of control? 3) How is IAP activity regulated?4) And finally, as discussed further below, how docaspases, IAPs and their regulators work to regulate non-apoptotic processes? We are using both genetic screensand biochemical approaches to identify the criticalmolecules. 373. Maintaining tissue size: the role of death- induced compensatory proliferationJun Huh Achieving proper organ size requires a balance between proliferation and cell death. Tissues oftenexperience stresses that lead to ectopic death. In order fornormal development to occur, this death must be followedby compensatory proliferation that fills in the gaps. Wewere interested in exploring the idea that it is the dying cellitself that sends a signal to neighbors, driving theirproliferation. We tested this hypothesis in several ways.In brief, we found that activation of the apical caspaseDronc, activity of which is required for many cell deaths inthe fly, is both necessary and sufficient to drive compensatory proliferation in neighboring cell*. Interesting questions for the future include: 1) What areDronc's proliferation targets? 2) Are there other contextsin which caspases function in a sense non-autonomously toalter cell fate or behavior? Reference Huh, J. et al. (2004) Curr. Biol .14:1262-1266. 374. Cell death in the fly eye Jeffrey CopelandEchinus is a Drosophila mutant that lacks normally occurring cell death in the eye. We cloned the echinus gene and found it encodes a member of an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins, the USPs,which remove ubiquitin from proteins. Echinus lacksinteractions with known cell death regulators, suggestingthat it acts at a novel point to promote death. 375. Caspases and their regulators in a non- apoptotic process, spermatid differentiationJun Huh, Jean EdensWe have found that multiple caspases, acting through distinct pathways, acting at distinct points in time and space, are required for spermatid individualization, aprocess in which spermatids (which develop in a commoncytoplasm) become enclosed in individual plasmamembranes and shed most of their cytoplasm*. Spermatidindividualization is an evolutionarily conserved process,but little is known about how it is brought about. Severalquestions are of interest to us: 1) What are the sources of the caspase activity (what are the upstream signals)? 2)What are the nonapoptotic targets that facilitatedifferentiation? 3) How is cell death prevented in the faceof high levels of caspase activity that would normally beassociated with cell death? 4) Do caspases play similar roles in promoting spermatid differentiation in mammals? Reference *Huh, J. et al. (2004) PLoS Biology 1: E15. 376. Cell death and the innate immune system Jun Huh, Israel Muro, Chun Hong Chen, Ian Foe,Soon Ji Yoo, Jin Mo Park, Ming GuoAs discussed above, many IAP family proteins inhibit apoptosis. inhibiting caspases. Apoptosis initiates when proteins such as Reaper and Hid bind a surface groove in DIAP1BIR domains via an N-terminal IAP-binding Hid-dependent apoptosis, but little is known aboutDIAP2's normal functions. We generated diap2 null mutants, which are viable and show no defects indevelopmental or stress-induced apoptosis. Instead,DIAP2 is required for the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infection. DIAP2 promotes cytoplasmic cleavage and nuclear translocation of the NF-\u0001B homolog Relish, and this requires the DIAP2 RING domain. Increasing the genetic dose of diap2 results in an increased immune response, while expression of Rpr or Hid results in down-regulation of DIAP2 protein levels*. Together these observations suggest that DIAP2can regulate immune signaling in a dose-dependentmanner, and that DIAP2 is regulated by IBM-containingproteins. Therefore, diap2 may identify a point of convergence between apoptosis and immune signalingpathways. Reference Huh, J. e t al. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. (doi/10.1074/jbc.M608051200). 377. Driving genes for disease refractoriness into wild pest insect populationsChun Hong Chen, Haixia Huang, CatherineWard, Jessica Su, Bruce HayAn attractive approach to suppressing mosquito- borne diseases involves replacing the wild-insectpopulation with modified counterparts unable to transmitdisease. Mosquitoes with a diminished capacity to transmitPlasmodium have been identified in the wild and created in the laboratory, demonstrating that endogenous orengineered mosquito immunity can be harnessed to attack Plasmodium . However, a critical unanswered question is how to spread these effector genes throughout the areas248 inhabited by disease-transmitting insects. Epidemiological and modeling studies suggest that it will be necessary torapidly replace a large percentage of the wild mosquitopopulation with refractory insects in order to achievesignificant levels of disease control. Because insect diseasevectors are spread over wide areas and can migrate significant distances, mass release of refractory insects associated with simple Mendelian transmission of effector-bearing chromosomes is unlikely to result in a high enoughfrequency of transgene-bearing individuals. Compoundingthis problem, enhancement of immune function in insects isoften costly, requiring tradeoffs with other life history traitssuch as longevity and fecundity. Transgenesis itself mayalso carry some fitness cost. Therefore, it is likely thatinsects carrying effector transgenes will be less fit thantheir wild counterparts, resulting in a decrease in thefraction of individuals carrying genes for refractorinessover time. These observations argue that population replacement will require coupling of genes conferring disease refractoriness with a genetic mechanism for drivingthese genes through the wild population at greater thanMendelian frequencies. Maternal-effect selfish genetic elements are attractive candidates to mediate drive because when presentin a female, they must be inherited in the next generation inorder for the offspring to survive. This behavior ispredicted to lead to rapid spread of the element within thepopulation even if it carries an associated fitness costbecause the chromosome that carries it gains a transmission advantage relative to counterparts that do not. We have engineered novel maternal-effect selfish genetic elementsinDrosophila that can drive population replacement and that are resistant to recombination-mediated dissociation ofdrive and effector functions. The genetic and cell-biological principles utilized should be generally applicableto a number of other species and have the potential to allowfor iterative cycles of population replacement. We are nowinterested in expanding this work in Drosophila into the mosquito system. 378. Sensing and killing dengue and yellow fever virus-infected cells in their insect host Kelly J. DusinberreDengue and yellow Fever virus infect mosquitoes during a blood meal. The virus must first enter andreplicate inside mosquito midgut cells in order to betransmitted to a new individual during a subsequent bloodmeal. Our goal is to develop transgenes that arephenotypically neutral when expressed in uninfectedindividuals, but that kill virus-infected cells. The virusencodes several activities that are not present in uninfectedhost cells. These include a viral polyprotein protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. We are developing molecules that sense these activities and kill cells in whichthey occur.Publications Chen, C.H., Guo, M. and Hay, B.A. (2006) Identifying microRNA regulators of cell death in Drosophila .

We alsocontinue to use as our experimental subject the smallmustard Arabidopsis thaliana , which is to plant science what the fruit fly is to genetics, or the mouse tomammalian research - an organism with numerousadvantages for use in the laboratory, that in its biology isrepresentative of a much larger group of organisms, forwhich it can serve as an experimental proxy. Thequestions of development that we are approaching arelargely those of pattern formation - how does a single cell like an egg, or a small group of cells like a flower primordium or shoot apical meristem, produce a muchlarger and much more organized structure - a plant, flower,or a shoot? Much of our work centers around the shoot apical meristem, the small group of stem cells at the tip of eachshoot, that provides the cells for stem, leaf, and flower.We have developed a set of live-imaging methods so thatwe can follow the cell divisions, patterns of geneexpression, and subcellular locations of regulatory proteinsin the meristem in real time. We have also developed a series of methods to perturb meristem function - by turning on or off specific regulatory genes and proteins, orby deleting cells or groups of cells. By combiningvisualization and alteration, we are inferring themechanisms by which cells in the meristem learn theirpositions, and thereby act so as to produce patternedstructures. We are also using these methods to studymeristematic self-assembly. Culture plant cells form disorganized masses called callus, and regions of callusself-organize to form new meristems, which give rise tonew shoots. By observing the details of this process, weare hoping to learn its rules, and to understand howcompletely unpatterned tissue can make highly patterned collections of stem cells. Similar methods are being applied to flower development, to find the processes that regulate the genesthat specify floral organ identity, that allow cells toremember their state of gene activity through divisions,and that specify individual cell types such as the giant cellsof the sepals. In addition, we are taking novel molecularapproaches to flower development - study of a family ofregulatory RNA molecules that act in allowing each floweron the plant to have the correct number of floral organs (asArabidopsis flowers normally have four sepals, four petals, six stamens, and two carpels), and experiments to determine the complete set of gene activities that are characteristic of the development of early flowers, and ofeach type of floral organ. Finally, there is a set of experiments that follows upon the recognition that the Arabidopsis genome contains a family of genes related to bacterial stretch-activated ionchannels. These experiments, using the methods ofgenetics and physiology, are designed to reveal how it isthat plant cells respond to osmotic changes. 379. Auxin transport patterns and primordium development M.G. Heisler, C. Ohno, P. Das, P. Sieber, G.V.Reddy, J.A. Long * Plants produce leaf and flower primordia from a specialized tissue called the shoot apical meristem (SAM).Genetic studies have identified a large number of genesthat affect various aspects of primordium developmentincluding positioning, growth, and differentiation. So far,however, a detailed understanding of the spatio-temporalsequence of events leading to primordium developmenthas not been established. By using confocal imaging ofgreen fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes in living plants we have analyzed the expression and polarity of PINFORMED1 (PIN1), the thatcycles of auxin build-up depletion accompany, andmay direct, different stages of primordium development.Imaging of multiple GFP-protein fusions shows that thesedynamics also correlate with the specification ofprimordial boundary domains, organ polarity axes, and thesites of floral meristem initiation. These results provide new insight into auxin transport dynamics during primordial positioning and suggest a role for auxintransport in influencing primordial cell type. *Plant Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Sciences, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA92037250 380. An auxin gradient model for plant phyllotaxis H. Jonsson1, M.G. Heisler, B.E. Shapiro, E. Mjolsness2 Recent studies show that plant organ positioning may be mediated by localized concentrations of the plant hormone auxin. Auxin patterning in the shoot apical meristem is in turn brought about by the subcellular polar distribution of the putative auxin efflux mediator, PIN1.However, the question of what signals determine PIN1polarization and how this gives rise to regular patterns ofauxin concentration remains unknown. We haveaddressed these questions by using mathematical modelingcombined with confocal imaging. We propose a modelthat is based on the assumption that auxin influences thepolarization of its own efflux within the meristemepidermis. Such a model is sufficient to create regularspatial patterns of auxin concentration on systems withstatic and dynamic cellular connectivities, the latter governed by a mechanical model. We also have optimized parameter values for PIN1 dynamics by using a detailedauxin transport model, for which parameter values aretaken from experimental estimates, together with atemplate consisting of cell and wall compartments as wellas PIN1 concentrations quantitatively extracted fromconfocal data. The model shows how polarized transportcan drive the formation of regular patterns. 1Computational Biology and Biological Physics Group, Department of Theoretical Physics, Lund University,S 221 00 Lund, Sweden 2Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics and Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine,CA 92697 381. Local signals controlling PIN1 polarity in the shoot apical meristemMarcus G. Heisler, Carolyn OhnoPreviously we have proposed that auxin transport patterns in the shoot meristem are coordinated via auxingradients between neighboring cells. This model assumesthat relative auxin concentrations are communicated vialocal, auxin-induced, cell-cell signals. We have started to investigate whether cell-cell interactions influence PIN1 polarity by examining the effects of laser-assisted cellablations. We find that ablation of single cells inducesdramatic reorientation of PIN1 in neighboring cells,strongly supporting the hypothesis that local signalscoordinate PIN1 polarity patterns. To investigate thisphenomenon further we are testing whether differentcomponents of the auxin-signaling pathway actautonomously or non-cell autonomously to influence PIN1subcellular localization. 382. Investigation of PINOID function in the shoot meristem Marcus G. Heisler, Carolyn Ohno, ZacharyNimchukPINOID (PID) is a serine-threonine kinase that has been proposed to act as a binary switch that acts topromote the apical or basal localization of PIN1 dependingon PID expression levels. However, although these dataimply that the expression of PID is crucial in determiningthe wt patterns of PIN1 polarity, we still do not yetunderstand which aspects of the wt localization patterns ofPIN1 depend on PID. To investigate this question we haveco-visualized PID and PIN1 using different colored GFPs. We find that PID is downregulated after PIN1 polarity converges at a position destined to form a primordium.PID is then upregulated in the boundary regionsurrounding this position. These data imply that althoughauxin is thought to promote PID expression, auxinlocalization is also capable of downregulating PID. To testthis hypothesis further we are examining how PID expression responds to local auxin treatment in bothwild-type and pid mutant apices using a kinase-dead mutant PID reporter. To test whether PID is required forPIN1 reversal events surrounding primordia we are usingtransient knock-out and overexpression methods to visualize dynamically the response of PIN1 to the immediate loss and gain of PID function. Lastly, we areattempting to use FRET to test whether PID directlyinteracts with PIN1 and if so, where and when this occurs. 383. Chemical approaches to studying the role of the AGC kinase Pinoid in meristem function Zachary L. Elliot M. MeyerowitzInitiation of lateral primordia is regulated by a pathway involving the hormone auxin. This process is perturbed by mutations in PID. PID encodes a soluble but membrane-associated AGC family member kinase. Although mutants in PID have been studied for a while, little is known about how these pathways regulatepatterning of the meristem and there are no identifieddownstream targets for either pathway. This is partiallydue to difficulty in interpreting terminal phenotypes inthese mutants as well as the presence, either redundant orbuffering pathways, which act upon, or are an intrinsiccomponent of the PID pathway. In order to circumventthese problems, strategies for live imagining of growingArabidopsis meristems using fluorescent-based markers has been developed by the Meyerowitz lab. Our work is designed to complement these approaches by usingchemical genetics to create specifically inhibitible versionsof PID. We have made a PID fusion protein with aC-terminus YFP. This protein fusion is detectable in thePID proper expression domain and complements the pid 6 null mutant. Using this construct as a template we havemade kinase-dead versions of PID that fail to complementand a dominant negative version of PID that interferes withthe wild-type PID function. We are currently testinginhibitable versions of PID for their ability to complement pid 6 and their responsiveness to specific chemical inhibitors. It is envisioned that these engineered versionswill allow for a more in-depth analysis of the genetics andcell biology of these pathways, as well as aide in theidentification of pathway targets.251 384. Global controls over PIN1 localization patterns and the establishment of organ polarity Marcus G Heisler, Carolyn OhnoPreviously we have shown that one of the earliest markers of organ polarity, REVOLUTA , is expressed adaxially from inception during the early stages of organ formation. This raises the question of how REV is prevented from being expressed in abaxial cells at this early stage. To investigate this question we havevisualized the expression of the KANADI1 gene using a functional KAN1-GFP fusion protein. We find that KAN1is expressed in the periphery of the meristem in acontinuous domain that marks the outer boundary of wherethe PIN1 polarity pattern converges to specify newprimordia. Visualization of REV and KAN1simultaneously confirms that KAN1 marks a prepatterncorrelating with both organ position and the abaxialboundary of REV expression. These observations imply that organ polarity is specified through the positioning of organs on a preexisting boundary of KAN activity suchthat organ positioning and polarity are inextricably linked.Functional testing of this hypothesis is underway. 385. Arabidopsis as a model system for complex regenerationSean GordonMost multi-cellular organisms have a capacity to regenerate lost features, however, few have the ability toregenerate an entirely new body plan from differentiated tissue. Induction of new shoot apical meristems (SAMs) from cultured root explants is a widely used but poorly understood plant regeneration system in which new plantsare regenerated from adult somatic tissue. We havecharacterized early patterning events during regenerationof the Arabidopsis SAM using fluorescent reporters of gene and protein activity known to be required for properembryonic development. We have found that the earlypatterning of the new SAM can be broken down intostereotypic (REV), and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) expression and activity. We have discovered that newshoot meristems are derived from small number of initialcells via a patterning process in which relative temporalgene expression is analogous to embryogenesis, in contrastto spatial gene expression, which strongly deviates fromembryonic patterning. We are further characterizing theshoot regeneration system to support its use as an assay forstudying specific aspects of early developmental patterningand an accessible system for the investigation of complexregeneration in the well-studied model organism Arabidopsis. In addition, exogenous hormonal cues dictate the ability of Arabidopsis to regenerate. Therefore, we are also investigating the requirement of proper hormone transport in the regeneration process, using both mutantswith impaired hormone transport and chemical inhibitorsof hormone transport.386. Retention of molecular memory during regenerationSean GordonPlants can be typically divided into upper and lower halves corresponding to root, or alternatively, shoottissue. Through tissue culture and hormonal induction these two fundamentally different tissue types can be converted from one into the other. For example, somaticroot tissue can be induced to \"de-differentiate\" andassemble a new body axis in the form of a shoot meristem.By definition, shoot meristems give rise to allabove- ground organs of the plant, including leaves during the vegetative growth phase, followed by flower organsduring the reproductive phase. Gene expression, whichsignals the switch from vegetative growth to thereproductive phase, is known to be systemic (Takada,2003). We have made the preliminary observation thatregenerated shoot meristems resume growth after assembly reflecting the phase of the plant from which the tissue was derived. For example, root tissue derived from plants inthe vegetative growth phase regenerate shoot meristemsthat initiate vegetative shoot growth. On the other hand,root tissue derived from reproductive-stage plantsregenerates shoot meristems that quickly undergoreproductive shoot growth. This data conflicts with thecurrent concept of this regeneration system in whichcultured somatic root tissue is thought to de-differentiatebefore re-differentiating into a shoot fate. Instead, our datasuggests that a large degree of molecular memory is retained from the original explant tissue. This is consistent with our observation that root-specific genes continue tobe broadly expressed during the regeneration process. Weare investigating at what level memory of the priorreproductive phase is retained by using a marker of genesknown to be involved in the switch between vegetative andreproductive growth.

Venugopala ReddyThe shoot apical meristem (SAM) is an interacting network of functionally distinct domains. Thecentral zone (CZ) is at the tip of the SAM and harbors a setof stem cells. The peripheral zone (PZ), located on thesides, and the rib-meristem (RM), located just below theCZ, are the regions where cells enter into differentiationpathways to make lateral organs and the stem. SAM sizeand shape is maintained, though the cells are being continually diverted to differentiation pathways. Intercellular signaling between the CZ and the RM,mediated by CLAVATA WUSCHEL genes, has been proposed to function in maintaining the CZ:PZ ratio andalso the overall SAM size. However, the mechanisms bywhich CLV signaling mediates this function are not wellunderstood.252 Our work combines transient gene silencing and live imaging approaches to gain mechanistic insights into the process of SAM maintenance. Conditional silencing oftheCLV3 gene was achieved through a dexamethasone (DEX) inducible two-component system. The effect oftransient removal of CLV3 function on CZ size was monitored by using a CZ reporter, pCLV3::mGFP5-ER, construct. Expansion of the CZ was mapped with respectto the overall cell division activity within the SAM. Thisanalysis has led to several new insights: 1) CZ expansionoccurs through a re-specification process wherein, theexisting PZ cells acquire the CZ identity and this processcan be uncoupled from growth; and, 2) Overall SAM sizeis controlled through a process that restricts cell divisionrates in cells located at a certain distance from themeristem center. Currently we are extending this analysis to study the regulation of WUS expression and function in SAM maintenance. WUSCHEL (WUS), a homeodomain transcription factor, has been shown to be a criticalregulator of SAM maintenance. It has been proposed thatCLV signaling controls CZ size and the overall SAM sizeby negatively regulating the expression of WUS. But thisproposal is based on observations made during theinflorescence meristem stage, which represents a terminalphenotype. Several hypotheses are possible for theexpanded WUS domain in terminal meristems of clvmutants: 1) If WUS is negatively regulated by the CLV signaling network, it is expected that the WUS domain should enlarge within the RM and/or it should beectopically expressed in overlying layers; 2) The RM/ WUS expressing 3) Theexpanded WUS domain in clv mutants could be a reflection of altered cell types within the RM. These hypotheses canbest be tested in real-time experiments by monitoring theexpression of WUS, upon compromising or hyper-activating CLV signaling. The required fluorescentreporter construct, pWUS::mGFP5-ER, has been generatedand it is being combined with the inducible CLV3 RNAi system and also the inducible CLV3 overexpression We are also utilizing the inducible perturbation of CLV signaling to study the interactions between cells inthe CZ and the PZ. This analysis would involveexpression analysis of markers expressed in the PZ, upontransient perturbations in CLV signaling. 388. C ell biological, genetic and chemical approaches to studying the Clavata1 receptor kinaseZachary L. Nimchuk, Venugopala Reddy, XiangQu, Elliot M. Meyerowitz Proliferation of cells in plants is restricted to specific regions called meristems. These regions give rise to all the above-ground organs of plants (shoot and floralmeristems) and below-ground organs (root meristems).Studies have shown that shoot meristems are organizedinto functionally distinct cell populations: the central zone(CZ), peripheral zone (PZ), and the rib zone (RZ). The CZis composed of stem cells that divide slowly relative tocells in the flanking PZ. The RZ subtends the CZ andgives rise to the ground tissues of the stem. In addition,the shoot and floral meristems also give rise to flankingprimordia that develop into various aerial organs. Thisprocess continues throughout the life of the plant and contributes to overall growth and body plan development. Meristems must balance the number of generated anddeparted cells in order to maintain themselves. Acomponent of this process includes the regulation ofproper spatial initiation of primordial outgrowth onmeristem flanks. This process of balanced proliferationand patterning is strictly controlled and is definedgenetically by Arabidopsis mutants affecting meristem regulation and formation. Mutations in the CLV loci lead to a hyper-accumulation of stem cells in both shoot andfloral meristems resulting in stem fasciation, club-shapedsiliques and putative ligandCLV3. We have made a CLV1 fusion a C-terminal YFP tag that fully complementsthe clv1 6 mutation. When expressed from the endogenous CLV1 promoter, CLV1 expression is observed in the central domain of inflorescence and floralmeristems. CLV1 appears to localize to the PM andinternal structures. We are currently exploring therelationship between localization of CLV1 and CLV3 function. We are also exploring this relationship in thecontext of kinase dead versions of containing substitutions in theexternal LRR domain. In addition we are developing achemical genetic approach using specifically inhibitableversions of the CLV1 kinase. It is envisioned that theseengineered version, combined with cell biology,biochemistry and genetic approaches, will allow for a morein-depth analysis of the regulation of CLV1 and potentiallyaide in the identification of pathway targets. 389. Cell fate decision by CLV in shoot apical meristem Xiang Qu, G. Venugopala ReddyLocated at the growing tip of stems, shoot apical meristems (SAMs) are actively dividing, embryonic tissuesresponsible for all of the aerial organs in plants. A balancebetween meristematic cell division and differentiation isrequired to maintain a functional SAM. In Arabidopsis, theCLAVATA ( CLV) genes encode important elements in SAM maintenance. Single loss-of-function mutations oftheCLV genes (clv ) result in a progressive of shoot and floral meristems. CLV1 encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to family ofreceptor-like kinases (RLKs) in plants. CLV3 a putative cleavage signal.Genetic evidence indicates that the CLV genes act inconcert to restrict the size of the SAM. In this hypotheticalsystem, CLV1 acts as a plasma membrane-bound receptor.The signal perceived from the intercellular CLV3 ligand253 will be transduced to the downstream signaling component, theoretically through the C-terminal kinasedomain of the CLV1 receptor. However, no directbiochemical or molecular evidence supports this model.We have been using a combination of methodologies,including biochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches, to gain information in molecular detail as to how the receptor-like kinase CLV1 functions as a keyelement to maintain a functional SAM. We havegenerated constructs that allow us to visualize the CLVproteins directly using a confocal microscope and/or detectthem indirectly by chemi-luminescence. We havedemonstrated that CLV1 is localized to the plasmamembrane. An analysis of interaction between CLV1 andCLV3 and its biological significance has been undertaken.Results from the study of CLV3, potentially leads to thediscovery of a novel mechanism by which the SAM ismaintained. In addition, to address whether the kinase domain of CLV1 and/or the associated enzymatic activity are required for CLV signaling, we have made severalconstructs containing individual mutations which wouldresult in abolition of the kinase activity of CLV1. Theanalysis of physiological output of those constructs iscurrently under way. 390. Expression analysis of the CLE family of putative secreted ligands in Arabidopsis Adrienne Roeder, Nicole KubatPlant and animal cells must communicate with one another to coordinate their actions duringdevelopment. One mechanism, among many, that cells useto communicate is the secretion of small signaling peptidesthat diffuse to the surrounding cells. The receiving cellssense the presence of the signaling peptide throughreceptors on the cell surface and respond accordingly. Inthe small plant Arabidopsis, such a signaling pathway is used in a feedback loop to maintain the size of the stemcell population at the growing tip of the plant, or meristem.The CLAVATA3 (CLV3) gene encodes a small, secreted ligand that is expressed in the stem cells CLAVATA1 (CLV1 ( in the underlying cells ., 1997; Fletcher et al ., 1999; Schoof et et al., 2000; Rojo et al ., 2002). WUS by an unknown mechanism feeds back to positively regulateCLV3, thus maintaining the constant size of the meristem.Inclv3 mutants where this balance is disrupted the meristems becomes greatly enlarged, whereas if CLV3 is constitutively expressed all of the stem cells are consumedand the meristem terminates (Clark et al ., 1995; Brand et al., 2000). CLV3 was the founding member of a family of putative small, secreted ligands termed the CLE family(Cock and McCormick, 2001). To uncover the roles of theother CLE genes, we are undertaking a multi-pronged high-throughput analysis of all 25 of the Arabidopsis CLE family members in a large collaborative effort withJennifer Fletcher's lab at the Plant Gene Expression Centerand Lewis Feldman's lab at U.C. Berkeley(http://www.pgec.usda.gov/Fletcher/CLEproject.html). Although initially it appeared that many of the CLE genes were expressed broadly based on RT-PCR datafrom different tissues (Sharma et al ., 2003), we have generated reporter constructs for CLE9 ,CLE10, and CLE22 and found that each of these genes has a specificexpression pattern during plant development. Our strategywill be to match the expression pattern to that of putativereceptors whose ligands are unknown. References Brand et al. (2000) Science 289:617-619. Clark et al.

All four identified han mutants ( han 1, han 2, han 3, and han 4) display dramatic floral phenotypes, with fused sepals and reduced organ numberthroughout all four floral whorls. The expression patternofHAN in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and floral meristem is distinctive, with strong expression at theboundaries between the meristem and its newly initiatedorgan primordia, and at the boundaries between differentfloral whorls. Although han mutations have minor effects upon vegetative SAMs, han;clv double mutants display a highly fasciated SAM. Together along with theobservation that the WUS expression pattern is altered inhan mutants, our data suggest that HAN is also involved inSAM development. To understand the molecular mechanism by which HAN regulates flower and SAM development, in collaboration with Dr. WolfgangLukowitz at Cold Spring Harbor Labs, we have conducteda second-site screen for suppressors from the EMS-mutagenized han 2 plants. About 20,000 mutagenized plants from 40 pools were screened, among which 64repressors and 25 enhancers were identified. Furtheranalysis and mapping of these mutants is currentlyunderway. As an alternative approach, we have developeda hormone-inducible system that allows us to activateHAN upon the treatment of plants with dexamethasone (DEX). Following the activation of HAN, we can monitor changes in the expression patterns of selected floral andSAM genes ( WUS , for example) in live imaging. Using the same system, we are planning to conduct microarrayanalysis in a time course after induction. The time courseshould be quite useful in indicating downstream players,and for correlating gene expression patterns with254 morphogenic events. The immediate targets from the microarray experiments will be selected for chromatinimmunoprecipitation. 392. Analysis of MOB protein localization Carolyn OhnoThe MODIFIER of B Function (MOB) gene encodes a putative transcription factor that negativelyregulates the expression of the petal and stamen organidentity gene PISTILLATA (PI) .mob mutations suppress theufofloral phenotype associated with reduced petal and stamen development. UFO encodes an F box-containingfactor thought to act as an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. One hypothesis for UFO function is that it targets a repressor of PI expression for proteolysis. Since mob is epistatic to ufo, it is possible that MOB is the repressor targeted by UFO. To test this possibility we haveexamined the expression of a pMOB::MOB-CFPtranslational fusion protein and we find that it is nuclear-localized, ubiquitously-expressed and functional in that itcan rescue the mob mutant phenotype. This is consistent with the ubiquitous MOB mRNA expression pattern detected by in situ hybridization. Confocal imaging of living meristems and flowers harboring a functional pUFO::UFO-VENUS translational fusion protein that is spatially restricted to the peripheral region within themeristem and to petal and stamen primordia in floral buds,indicates that the presence of UFO protein does notinfluence the uniform accumulation of MOB-CFP withinthe inflorescence. We have also examined MOB-CFPprotein accumulation in ufo mutant or 35S::UFO genotypes and find that it is unchanged. Thus, ourevidence suggests that MOB and UFO act in parallelpathways in which the repression of PIby MOB does not require UFO activity. 393. Gi ant cells in the sepal epidermis of Arabidopsis flowers Adrienne RoederAlthough the homeotic genes that control floral organ identity in Arabidopsis have been known for more than a decade, we still know little about how they control the downstream processes of cell division, cell expansion, and cell fate specification to generate complex floralorgans composed of many difference cell types. Thesepals, the external floral organs that surround and protectthe developing bud, are a good system for addressing thisquestion because the outer epidermis of the sepal containsextremely enlarged giant cells interspersed in the smallerepidermal cells (along with trichomes and guard cells). The giant cells average 364 \u00b5m (\u00b1145 s.d.) in length, but can stretch almost half the length of the mature sepal. One of the initial questions to address is whether the giant cellsare truly a developmentally distinct cell type or are merelylarger cells in a continuum of epidermal cell sizes. Infloral buds, the distinction between the sizes of the giantcells and small cells is clear. The average area of the giant cells is 2600 \u00b5m 2 (\u00b1640) whereas the small epidermal cellsaverage only 88 \u00b5m2 (\u00b174). In addition, two molecular markers, one expressed specifically in the giant cells and one expressed specifically in the smaller epidermal cells,suggest that these cell types are have different patterns ofgene expression. Finally, the giant cells contain enlargednuclei, suggesting that they have undergoneendoreduplication, a specialized cell cycle in which theDNA is replicated, but the cell does not divide. Toidentify genes involved in giant cell development, we havebeen conducting a screen for mutants that affect giant cellformation. We have isolated a mutant in which giant cell formation is deficient and a mutant in which all of the sepal epidermal cells appear enlarged similar to giant cells. 394 Analysis of the gene regulatory network underlying early Arabidopsis flower developmentFrank Wellmer, Elliot M. MeyerowitzFlower development is an excellent model system for studying organogenesis in plants. Extensive geneticanalyses, especially in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have led to the identification of several key regulatory genes of this important biological process. The vast majority of these genes encode transcription factors or other proteins involved in the regulation of geneexpression, indicating the existence of a complex generegulatory network that underlies flower development. Weare interested in understanding the architecture andcomposition of this gene network at a molecular level. To identify genes involved in flower development on a genome-wide scale, we have analyzed the global geneexpression dynamics in early flower development, a keyprocess in the life cycle of a plant, during which floralpatterning and the specification of floral organs is established. We used a novel floral induction system, which allows the isolation of a large number ofsynchronized floral buds, in conjunction with whole-genome microarray analysis to identify genes withdifferential expression at distinct stages of flowerdevelopment. We found that the onset of flower formationis characterized by a massive downregulation of genes inincipient floral primordia, which is followed by apredominance of gene activation during the differentiationof floral organs. Among the genes we identified asdifferentially expressed in the experiment, we detected asignificant enrichment of closely related members of gene families. The expression profiles of these related genes were often highly correlated, indicating similar temporalexpression patterns. Moreover, we found that the majorityof these genes is specifically up-regulated during certaindevelopmental stages. Because co-expressed members ofgene families in Arabidopsis frequently act in a redundant manner, these results suggest a high degree of functionalredundancy during early flower development, but also thatits extent may vary in a stage-specific manner. We are now using the genome-wide information on gene expression obtained in this study, as well as the floral induction system to systematically study the gene regulatory network underlying flower development.255 395. The homeotic protein AGAMOUS controls late The floral homeotic selector gene AGAMOUS (AG), together with other members of the same class of floral homeotic genes, is sufficient to trigger reproductive organ (stamen and carpel) development in the context of a developing flower. Although AG is the most studied example of a plant homeotic gene, the mechanisms bywhich a floral primordium responds to the geneticactivities initiated by AG, and thereby develops stamensand carpels, are largely unknown. AG RNA is expressed in the organ primordia of floral whorls 3 and 4 (thepositions of stamens and carpels, respectively) from floralstage 3 until late in flower development, after all of theorgans are fully formed. While early AG expression acts in specification of stamens and carpels, the role, if any, ofcontinued AG expression in later flower development is unknown. In order to examine the timing of AG action and its possible late stage functions, we performed a series oftime course experiments using a transgenic line withinducible AG activity, in an ag homozygous mutantbackground. We showed that ectopic AG activity cantransform organ primordia of as late as stage 6 floral budsinto normal-looking stamens. In contrast, activation of AGin floral buds after stage 7 results in 2 nd and 3rd whorl organs that are stamen-like filamentous petals. Thissuggests that AG can induce the gene activities necessary for filament elongation, but not for microsporogenesis, at late floral stages. We also show by using timed activationof AG that AG controls late-stage stamen development,including and elongation. This demonstrates thatprolonged AG activity is necessary to form wild-typestamens in Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that stamen identity and differentiation control by AG is achieved bythe regulation of different transcriptional cascades indifferent floral stages, with organ specification cascadesinduced early, followed by activities necessary for filamentformation and anther maturation. *Current address: Temasek Singapore117604 396. Genetic redundancy and subfunctionalization among microRNAs: Role of the miR164family Sieber Wellmer, Jos\u00e9 Luis RiechmannMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-strand RNA molecules that control plant and animal gene expression. Although miRNAs have been studied extensively in recent years, few loss-of-function studieshave been reported. In plants this might be because manymiRNAs are represented by more than one locus and lossof an individual miRNA might be compensated for by another member of the same family. Here it is shown that allmembers of the miR164 miRNA family of Arabidopsisthaliana are functionally redundant during shoot development. miR164c, in addition, has some unique functions indicating subfunctionalization of individualmiR164 miRNAs. Elimination of the activity of all members of the MIR164 miRNA family leads to a randomization of certain developmental patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana , revealing a role for miR164 miRNAs as genetic suppressors of phenotypic variation. Molecular and genetic dissection of miR164 mediated target regulation indicates that all miR164 miRNAs function together to control the level of target gene abundance andto prevent fluctuations in the expression of their targetgenes and to prevent variability in organ growth, organnumber, organ size and organ position during shootdevelopment. Our results indicate a negative correlationbetween high abundance of the miR164 targets CUP SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) and growth. Candidate genes with a potential role in cell elongation and cell division rates and which might be regulated by CUC1 and CUC2 were identified in a transcriptome analysis of plantswith altered CUC transcript abundance by using our whole-genome Arabidopsis microarray. *Current address: Institute of Plant Biology, University of Zurich, Zollikerstrasse 107, 8008 Zurich, Switzerland 397. Characterization of the Arabidopsis mutant SNOWBALLZachary L. Nimchuk, Elliot M. MeyerowitzWe have isolated an apparently novel mu tant which we have named SNOWBALL. SNO mutants display various defects indicative of altered meristem function.SNO mutants display alterations in floral organ number,with the most prominent effects being an increase in sepalnumber and a reduction in fertility. All vegetative andfloral organs of SNO mutants are initially thinner than wild type, however, leaves expand to full size but are frequentlytwisted. In addition, floral organ phyllotaxis is altered.SNO mutants frequently display ectopic outgrowths,similar to mutations in the REVOLUTA gene. The SNO mutant is not allelic to REV and SNO mutants do not display other REV phenotypes such as defects in polarity or auxiliary meristem development. We are currentlymapping sno and examining sno interactions with various mutants. 398. Identifying transcriptional targets of leaf growth Carolyn OhnoTo understand growth and morphogenesis of plant lateral organs, we have continued characterization ofJAGGED (JAG), a putative zinc finger transcription factorthat is expressed in leaf and floral organ primordia. Loss ofJAG function results in the development of narrow jagged leaves and floral organs due to defects in both cell divisions and cell expansion. In contrast, misexpression ofJAG in the floral meristem promotes the development of leaf-like tissue in place of flowers, suggesting that JAG is sufficient to specify leaf growth. Whole genomeoligonucleotide microarrays are being used to identify256 downstream transcriptional target genes of JAG that may be involved in specifying leaf cell fate or cell proliferation. Transgenic lines that express dexamethasone (DEX)hormone-inducible JAG under the control of either a constitutive CaMV 35S promoter or the endogenous JAG promoter have been generated in the jag mutant background and a time course study of gene expressionafter 7, 9 and 12 hours after DEX induction of JAG in seedlings has been analyzed with replicates. At 7 hoursafter JAG induction, 88 genes are upregulated while 49 genes are downregulated greater than two-fold (p-value< 0.001). Included among the changed JAG target genes are transcription factors and hormone regulators and weare currently investigating the RNA expression patternsand loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes of thesecandidates. 399. MscS-like proteins in plants Elizabeth S. Haswell Mechanotransduction is the process by which physical information about the extra- and intracellularenvironment is converted to a biochemical signal. Howplants respond to mechanical stimuli has been underinvestigation since the work of Darwin [1], but little isknown about the molecules involved. Response tomechanical stimuli such as gravity, temperature, turgorpressure, and touch are important for plant growth anddevelopment. Tension-responsive ion channel activitieshave been discovered in the plasma and vacuolar membranes of many plant species and plant cell types. However, the molecular identities of these channelactivities are not known, nor have they been clearlycorrelated with a physiological function. Candidates forthe proteins underlying these activities in plants areMscS-like proteins. There are ten MscS-Like (MSL)family members in Arabidopsis thaliana , which can be divided into two classes. Class I proteins are the mostsimilar to MscS and its bacterial relatives, and GFP-fusionproteins are found in the mitochondrial or chloroplastenvelopes. Class II proteins are most similar to otherMscS-like proteins in plants, and are localized to the tonoplast and the plasma membrane. MSLp::GUS reporter genes exhibit tissue-specific expression, most notably inguard cells, the vasculature, and the stigma cells of thecarpel. This initial characterization of the MSL proteinslays the foundation for future experiments designed toevaluate their role as mechanoreceptors in plants. Reference [1] Darwin, C. and Darwin, S.F. (1882) In: The Power of Movement in Plants (London: John Murray). 400. MscS-like proteins control plastid size and shape in Arabidopsis thaliana Elizabeth S. HaswellMechanosensitive (MS) ion channels provide a mechanism for the perception of mechanical stimuli suchas sound, touch, and osmotic pressure. The bacterial MSion channel MscS opens in response to increasedmembrane tension and serves to protect against cellularlysis during osmotic downshock. MscS-like proteins arefound widely in bacterial and archaeal species, and havealso been identified in fission yeast and plants. None ofthe eukaryotic members of the family have yet beencharacterized. We two MscS-Like MSL3 can rescue the osmotic shock sensitivity of a bacterial mutant lacking MS ion channel activity,suggesting that it functions as a mechanosensitive ionchannel. Arabidopsis plants harboring insertional mutations in both MSL3 and MSL2 show abnormalities in the size and shape of plastids, plant-specific endosymbioticorganelles responsible for photosynthesis, gravityperception, and numerous metabolic and MSL3-GFP are localized to discrete focion the plastid envelope, and co-localize with the plastiddivision protein AtMinE. Our data support a model wherein MSL2 and MSL3 control plastid size, shape, and perhaps division during normal plant development byaltering ion flux in response to changes in membranetension. We propose that MscS family members haveevolved new roles in plants since the endosymbiotic eventthat gave rise to plastids. ten MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis show sequence similarity to the bacterial mechanosensitive ion channel MscS. MscS functions asan osmotic safety valve, allowing the non-selective releaseof ions upon extreme hypoosmotic shock [1]. Todetermine of proteins,MSL2 and MSL3, insertional alleles were isolated frompools provided by the University of Wisconsin. In bothmsl2 1 and msl3 1 alleles, the T-DNA insertion is located in the last exon of the gene, downstream of thetransmembrane domains and MscS-related domain. As thelevels of MSL2 and mRNA are normal in msl2 1 andmsl3 1 mutants, we are taking several approaches to investigate the nature of the defect in these mutants. First,we are testing the phenotypic effect of perturbing MSL2 andMSL3 expression in various ways. For example, we are in the process of obtaining an allele of MSL2 with aninsertion in the first exon. We have also reduced MSL3 levels through RNA interference; in a msl2 1 background this results in variegated leaves and enlarged chloroplasts, phenocopying the msl2 1; msl3 1 double mutant [2]. another approach, we are characterizing the truncated proteins, MSL2t and MLS3t, which are predicted that phenocopy the doublemsl2 1; msl3 1 and msl3 1257 are gain-of-function alleles. Extremely high GFP-fusion proteins can also produceenlarged chloroplasts. MSL3 is capable of rescuing theosmotic shock sensitivity of an E. coli strain that lacks MS ion channel activity; when tested in this assay MSL3tfunctions normally. MSL2- and MSL3-GFP fusion proteins are localized to foci at the poles of the plastid envelope. We find that MSL2t- and MSL3t-GFP fusionproteins are also targeted to the plastid envelope, but areevenly dispersed around the periphery of the plastid, ratherthan localized to foci. These data are consistent with amodel wherein the msl2 1 and msl3 1 mutant alleles produce truncated proteins that can form functional ionchannels but are not properly localized; and thatlocalization of the putative MS ion channels MSL2 andMSL3 to polar foci is required to properly control plastidsize and shape and to prevent variegation. We arecurrently more narrowly defining the sequence at the extreme C-terminus of MSL2 and MSL3 that required for localization to foci, and further characterizing the functionof MSL2t and MSL3t in in vitro interaction stability assays. *MURF Student, Caltech References[1] Levina, N., Totemeyer, S., Stokes, N.R., Louis, P., Jones, Booth, (1999) EMBO role of MSL9 and MSL10 in the osmotic shock response of members of the MscS-Like (MSL) protein family in Arabidopsis ; they are most related to other plant MscS-like proteins, contain sixputative transmembrane domains, and do not containorganelle transit sequences. MscS is a bacterialmechanosensitive (MS) ion channel that functions as a safety valve, allowing ions to exit the cell and preventing plasmolysis in response to extreme hypoosmotic shock [1].We therefore hypothesized that MSL9 and MSL10 mightfunction in the osmotic shock response of the Arabidopsis plant. Treatment of whole seedlings with 0.44 M mannitol or 100 \u00b5 M abscisic acid, two treatments known to induce osmotic shock or dehydration [2], induced the expression of MSL9 and MSL10. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated thatMSL10 is widely expressed throughout the plant, whileMSL9 expression is primarily expressed in the tip of theroot. GUS reporter lines verify these data and furtherrefine the expression patterns, showing complementaryexpression patterns for the two genes. MSL10p::GUS isexpressed strongly in the vasculature of the root and shoot,while MSL9p::GUS activity is found in the columella cellsof the root cap and the cortex and endodermal cell layers of the root elongation zone. Low levels of GUS activity are also found at the base of young leaves, but appears tobe excluded from the vasculature. As they are related to amechanosensitive ion channel, MSL9 and MSL10 maydirectly respond to changes in membrane tension thatresult from osmotic stress. A stretch-activated ion channelactivity has been characterized in root protoplasts using acell-attached patch clamp method. This activity is increased by negative pressure in the patch pipette (suction) and is inhibited by treatment with 1mMgadolinium ion, an inhibitor of MS ion channel activities.Preliminary data suggests that this activity is absent orreduced in msl9 1; msl10 1 double-mutant plants. We arecurrently verifying these results and preparing to study theactivity under question in excised patches. Further, we aredetermining the subcellular localization of MSL9- andMSL10-GFP fusion proteins. Vegetal, References [1] Levina, N., Totemeyer, S., Stokes, N.R., Louis, P., Jones, M.A. and Booth, I.R. (1999) EMBO Do MSL7 and MSL8 a in pollen hydration? Elizabeth Haswell, Arnavaz GardaMSL7 and MSL8 are two the MscS-Like (MSL) protein family in Arabidopsis . These two genes are 71% identical at the amino acid level, and are located in tandem on chromosome two. To determine the function of these genes, we have begun to characterizetheir expression pattern, subcellular localization, and toidentify insertional mutant alleles. MSL8 expression was not detected by use of GUS reporter lines or by RT-PCR.However, MSL7p::GUS reporter lines show a distinctiveexpression pattern, with GUS activity restricted to thestigma cells of the carpel. RT-PCR data verifies thatMSL7 transcripts are found only in the flower. The stigmacells of the carpel are important for interaction with andhydration of the pollen grain before pollen tube growth andfertilization can begin [1]. Specific expression in stigma cells, coupled with the putative function of these proteins as mechanosensitive ion channels, suggests that MSL7 andperhaps MSL8 function in the process of pollen hydration.To test this hypothesis, we identified insertional alleles inboth MSL8. However, msl7 homozygous plants appear to have wild-type structure andfunction of stigma cells. As it is likely that these twoclosely related genes function redundantly, we are workingtowards generating a msl7; msl8 double mutant. To do this, a transposon located in the first exon of MSL8 has been mobilized, and we are currently preparing to screen F2 plants for insertion into the nearby MSL7 gene. We are taking a second approach to perturbing MSL7 and MSL8 function, by generating a RNA-interference construct thatwill reduce the levels of both MSL7 and MSL8 transcripts.258 Reference [1] Heslop-Harrison, J. and Heslop-Harrison, Y.

Haswell The Arabidopsis MSL2 and MSL3 genes encode putative mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels related to the bacterial MS ion channel MscS. No phenotype has yetbeen detected in msl2 1 or msl3 1 mutant plants, but msl2 1; msl3 1 epidermal plastids[1]. Variegation, or the presence of differently coloredtissues in the leaf, has been observed in a number ofmutants and is frequently attributed to defects in plastiddevelopment [2]. It has been proposed that a plastid-to-nucleus signal prevents proper leaf development whenplastid development is disrupted. The msl2 1; msl3 1 mutant is unusual in that it is variegated but chloroplastsare normally developed, through greatly enlarged. Othermutants with enlarged plastids, such as the arc (accumulation and replication of chloroplasts) mutants also have enlarged plastids, but none of them exhibitvariegation [3]. To begin to understand the nature of thevariegation pattern observed in the msl2 1; msl3 1 double mutant, we have initiated a genetic screen for variegatedmutants in the msl2 1 single-mutant background. 20,000 seed were treated with 0.4% of EMS for 8 hours, washedthoroughly, and planted. M2 seed was collected in pools of 40 and 160 seed from each of 10 pool planted. Seed from 56 mutant plants with visible variegation wascollected. We are now verifying these phenotypes in theM3, backcrosses and the msl2 1; msl3 1 mutant in that they have enlarged chloroplasts are likely contain new alleles ofMSL3, or genes that control MSL2 or MSL3 function.Mutants that are variegated but do not have enlargedchloroplasts may contain lesions in genes downstream ofMSL2 in the putative plastid-to-nucleus signal transductionpathway. We are interested in both classes of mutants, and preliminary analysis of the chloroplast phenotype of several M2 lines indicates that both classes are present inour mutant collection.

This is a complex process in which stem-cell multipotentiality is lost in steps that actually overlapwith the initiation of T-cell specific differentiation events.Thus, it offers unique insights into the nature of \"stem- ness\" and the distinction between activation of a development program and irreversible commitment to thatprogram. The approaches used in the lab are acombination of in vitro developmental biology, high- resolution characterization of individual celldevelopmental states, and molecular genetics of generegulation. We focus on identifying the transcriptionfactors and signaling events that induce T-lineage geneexpression in an uncommitted precursor and determininghow they work to force the cell to relinquish otherdevelopmental options. Kinetic dissection of this complexprocess using in vitro differentiation systems and retroviral perturbation make it possible to solve the roles of individual regulatory molecules in successive, highlydefined developmental contexts. In addition, the group isinvestigating the subtle variations in this pathway that maypredispose to autoimmunity, and the evolutionary originsof both the T- and B-lymphocyte developmental programsby comparative analysis of basal vertebrates. Initiation of T-cell development depends on Notch/Delta signaling, and beyond that, it also requires thestaged upregulation of a variety of other transcriptionfactors: GATA-3, TCF-1, probably Bcl11b, and specific forms of the bHLH transcription factor HEB. One set of projects in the lab aims to reveal exactly how each of theseregulatory molecules contributes to the onset of T-cellgene expression. Even as these T lineage-associatedfactors are being induced, the cells preserve a stemcell-like pluripotency through many cell divisions into the beginning of their T-cell program. Throughout this period,the cells also continue to express a surprisingly broadrange of regulatory factors inherited from hematopoietic stem cells. What eventually \"locks down\" the T cellidentity in these cells, then, appears to be a separatemechanism dominated by repression: Repression ofregulatory genes like PU.1, which play positive roles instem cells before T-lineage differentiation but also can actively maintain access to non-T developmental options. In a second major interest of the lab, we are now closing inon the identification of the key repressors that terminatePU.1 expression. Some take-home lessons have emerged about the nature of T-lineage specification process as a whole. It isnot a simple command cascade of dedicated regulators,such as appear to drive differentiation of other blood-celltypes. Instead, many if not all of the critical T-lineageregulatory genes are used for other pathways as well andcan even push early T-lineage cells to alternative fatesunder certain circumstances. Their essential roles in T-cell development are completely context-dependent and dose- dependent. This is true not only of factors like PU.1,which plays a transient-positive role in T-celldevelopment, but also of GATA-3, which is usedrepeatedly throughout T-cell development. Thus, theregulatory network context gives these factors theirT-lineage promoting impact, and solving its structure is amajor goal of the lab. This year, we have shown thatNotch/Delta signaling plays a sustained role in thisregulatory context long after it initiates the wholeT-lineage differentiation process, transforming the net impact of the other regulatory factors, and protecting the cells from lineage diversion through at least two differentmechanisms. Another insight that has emerged is howclose in regulatory terms developing T-cell precursorsremain to cells of the \"innate immune system,\" such asdendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells. Recently, Dr. Mary Yui in our group has shown that the earliest checkpoint that normally provides \"qualitycontrol\" for newly committed T-lineage cells is altered infunction in mice that are genetically susceptible toautoimmune diabetes. The checkpoint affected, \u0002-selection, is complex, including a life vs. death threshold and completion of T-cell lineage commitment as well as a less-understood developmental branch point between \u0001\u0002 and\u0003\u0004 lineage T cells, which differentiate using somewhat different transcriptional programs. The identification of the checkpoint alteration in autoimmunity-prone miceprovides an exciting opportunity because autoimmunediabetes is a multigene disease that has been difficult todissect into discrete \"component phenotypes.\" Dr. Yui isnow leading a project to map the genetic defects thatcontribute to this alteration and to determine its molecularbasis. The goal is to reveal in detail how subtle earlydevelopmental defects may result in a mature T-cellpopulation with key failures in self-restraint mechanisms.A physician-scientist in the group, Dr. Chace Tydell, isalso pursuing a separate investigation of the innate- immunity contributions to autoimmune disease. In exploring the evolutionary origins of the complex lymphocyte developmental program, we focus on261 the interface between the conventional B and T lymphocyte-based immune systems of jawed vertebratesand the lymphocyte-independent innate immune systemsof all invertebrates. The represented by the lamprey, a jawless vertebratewith lymphocytes that recognize antigen using highly polymorphic receptors, but receptors of a completely different structural type than the B- and T-cell receptors ofall jawed vertebrates. The lamprey or more B-like, and theanimal lacks recognizable thymus in which a specializedT-cell program could be induced through Notch/Notchligand interaction. Thus, it is of some interest tounderstand the regulatory signature of the lampreylymphocytes, as a clue to what the ancestral immune-celldevelopmental program might have been. To do this, weare starting from the known lamprey lymphocyte receptorgenes and using their regulatory sequences to determine what kinds of factors control their expression, in collaboration with Drs. Max Cooper, Chris Amemiya, andZeev Pancer, and with the Bronner-Fraser lab. This yearhas brought some exciting progress in the mapping of thekey sites, presenting a prospect of understanding this trulyancient family connection in the near future. 405. Notch/Delta signaling modulates PU.1 activities to constrain developmental re-engineering of pro-T cellsDeirdre D. Scripture Adams 1, Christopher B. Franco1,2, Irina Proekt3, Tom Taghon, Mary A. Yui, Stephanie L. Adams, Rochelle A. Diamond,Ellen V. RothenbergPU.1 is essential for early stages of mouse T-cell development but antagonizes it if expressed constitutively.Two separable involved, attenuation anddiversion. Dysregulated PU.1 expression inhibits pro-Tcell survival, proliferation, and passage through \u0002-selection by blocking essential T-cell transcription factors, signaling molecules, and Rag gene expression, and expression of a rearranged TCR transgene does not rescue. However, Bcl2 transgenic cells are protected from this attenuation and may even undergo \u0002-selection, as shown by PU.1 transduction of defined subsets of Bcl2-transgenic fetal thymocytes with differentiation in OP9-DL1 andOP9-control cultures. The outcome of PU.1 expression inthese cells depends on Notch/Delta a myeloid-like statewith regulatory changes, but Notch/Deltasignaling vetoes diversion. Gene expression analysisdistinguishes sets of critical T-lineage regulatory geneswith different combinatorial responses to PU.1 and Notch/Delta signals, suggesting particular importance for inhibition of E proteins, Myb, and/or Gfi1 in diversion.However, Notch signaling only protects against diversionof cells that have undergone T-lineage specification, afterThy-1 and CD25 upregulation. The results imply that inT-cell precursors, signaling normally acts tomodulate and channel PU.1 transcriptional activitiesduring the stages from T-lineage specification untilcommitment. We are currently expanding ourunderstanding of PU.1 function through the use of mousemodels and in vitro knockdown technology. 1Equal author contribution 2Caltech undergraduate, currently attending Stanford University, Immunology 3USC Caltech MD/PhD Program 406. An essential stage specific role for GATA-3 in early T-cell developmentDeirdre D. Scripture AdamsThe T regulatory transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed throughout intrathymic T-cell development aswell as during peripheral T-cell development (where it hasa role in promoting the shift to the T H2 phenotype). GATA-3 can act as a repressor, an activator, and achromatin-remodeling factor. Our previous studiessuggest that GATA-3 is important in the earliest stages of T-cell development, but an absolute requirement for this factor at each of the earliest stages has not been proven.Each of the early stages in T-cell development isfunctionally and genetically distinct: They can be dividedinto T specification, T-lineage commitment, and TCR \u0002-chain selection. Each of these developmental states is achieved through a defined panoply of expressed genes, including many transcription factors. We are now using avariety of gene expression knock down techniques(including retroviral expression of shRNA andelectroporation of siRNA forGATA-3) to discover whether GATA-3 expression isrequired in each of the earliest DN stages, either forsurvival or for developmental progression. In theseexperiments, we are also identifying target genes regulatedby GATA-3, and thus defining the control exerted by this factor over the formation and composition of the gene expression networks controlling T-cell development. Our work so far has shown a requirement for GATA-3 at the early T precursor stage, as well as at DN1,DN2, and DN3. The developmental blocks observed at theprecursor and DN1 stages are the most severe, with mostDN1 cells dying in the absence of GATA-3 after only 5days of in vitro culture. At DN2, loss of GATA-3 does impede development, but does not affect viability. InDN3-stage cells, both developmental progression andviability are impaired. None of the blocks at these stagescan be overcome by providing a bcl-2 transgene, although decreases in viability can be somewhat relieved at the precursor and DN1 stages using this method. Single cellculture experiments support the importance of GATA-3 forviability and developmental progression, as GATA-3shRNA expressing clones failed in all cases to progressbeyond DN2. In an initial analysis of gene expression changes that occur in response to the loss of GATA-3, we find thatPU.1 (a potent promoter of myeloid fates) as well as Mac-1, CD8 \u0001, and CD25 among others, are all upregulated. If PU.1 is directly regulated by GATA-3, this may explain the mechanism of the block in developmentwe have observed, as PU.1 may be promoting a myeloid262 fate in these immature T cells when GATA-3 is lost. We are currently conducting this type of gene expressionanalysis within each stage of T development, and will usethis information to understand the precise GATA-3mechanism in action at each developmental phase. 407. Mast-cell diversion of T-lineage precursor cells by the essential T-lineage transcription factor GATA-3Tom Taghon*, Mary A. Yui*, Stephanie L.Adams, Ellen V. RothenbergGATA-3 is a T-lineage-specific hematopoietic transcription factor that is induced by Notch/Deltasignaling and essential for T-cell development from theearliest stages. However, GATA-3 in itself does notinstruct T-lineage determination. Its action in lymphoidprecursors is profoundly dependent on level, Notchsignaling, and developmental stage. Although Notch signaling and GATA-3 at normal levels collaborate to promote T-cell development, and Notch signaling iscritical for pro-T cell survival, overexpression of GATA-3reverses these relationships. High-level GATA-3 blocksT-lineage differentiation and survival in the presence ofNotch signals, while conferring a survival advantage in theabsence of Notch signals. Furthermore, high-levelGATA-3 confers a gain of developmental function. InDN1 and DN2 but not DN3 hypomorphic GATA-3-KRR 305-307 mutant show that mast cell lineage diversion can be uncoupled from GATA-3 inhibitoryeffects on pro-T cell survival. The unexpected ease oflineage conversion suggests close relationships betweenthe pro-T and mast-cell precursor regulatory programs anda new role for Notch signaling in restricting non-T celldevelopment in the thymus.*Equal author contribution 408. Genome for GATA-3 target genes using ChIP-chip assay Jingli Zhang Within the hematopoietic system, expression of the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA-3 is restricted tothymocytes and T cells. Starting from pre-thymicprogenitors, this factor is involved in multiple stages ofT-cell development progression and critical for generationof mature T cells. GATA-3 knockout mice die betweenembryonic day 11 and 12, but study of gene-deficient cellsin a blastocyst complementation system has shown thatGATA-3-deficient ES cells specifically fail to give rise tothymocytes or T cells. Conditional knockout experiments have implied that it is needed for the DN3/DN4 transition (\u0001-selection) and development of CD4 SP cells (positive selection). It also plays a role in blocking inappropriate development of CD8 SP cells. In peripheral T cells,GATA-3 promotes CD4 T cell differentiation to the T H2 effector type while inhibiting T H1 cell differentiation. Several T-cell-specific genes such as RAG-2, TCR geneenhancers, CD8 and IL-4 have been suggested to beregulated by GATA-3. However, the list of GATA-3target genes is far from complete, and none of those thatare known are expressed early enough to account for thevital role of GATA-3 at the beginning of T-celldifferentiation. Both enforced or over-expression and deletion studies rely on altering mRNA level to determine thedevelopmental efffectors of altered GATA-3 levels, butfall short in interpreting the gene expression pattern duringT-cell development in response to the control of GATA-3.This is because they cannot delineate between genes thatare controlled by GATA-3 directly binding to theregulatory elements of these genes, versus genes that areinfluenced indirectly through a transcription factornetwork in which GATA-3 is involved. In order to understand how GATA-3 directly influences gene expression patterns during T-cell development, we are investigating the potential GATA-3 target genes in two pro-T cell lines: P2C2 cells, aDN3-like cell line; and BL3a cells, an early pro-T-likelymphoma with high GATA3 expression level. We areoptimizing conditions to GATA-3 cross-linked to DNA at itsbinding sites in the context of the natural nuclearenvironment, and DNA-protein complex are collected viaimmunoprecipitation. After size-optimized DNA fragments specifically bound to GATA-3 are isolated, they will be screened using genomic microarray technology. ChIP-chip can only provide information about a transcription factor DNA-binding status, but not about itsrole on the expression of the genes. Once genome-wideGATA-3 DNA-binding sites are identified, individual siteswill be further studied by other biochemical and molecularmethods, such as: (1) to transfect P2C2 cells withconstruct containing a GATA-3 binding site sequence anda reporter gene, whose expression pattern couldcorrespond to the expression pattern of that GATA-3 targetgene in vivo ; (2) since GATA-3 is suggested to be able to induce chromatin structure, epigenetic studies on theDNA-binding sites can help reveal how GATA-3 regulatesT-cell-specific gene expression; and, (3) to find othertranscription factors that interact with GATA-3. 409. Use of obligate transcriptional repressors to study the role of transcription factors developmentJerry G. Kwong, Deirdre D. Scripture Adams,Mark ZarnegarGATA-3, PU-1, and GATA-2 are all transcription factors known to be important to T-cell development.These factors either upregulate or downregulate expressionof other genes and thereby promote T-cell progression. Animportant question is to determine which of these effectson other important genes are direct and which are indirect.To answer this question, obligate repressor fusions of eachof the above genes have been constructed in retroviral263 vectors, using a repressor domain derived from the Drosophila melanogaster Engrailed protein fused to theDNA-binding domain of each of the above factors (see lastyear's Annual Report). These fusion proteins will repressgene expression wherever they are targeted by their DNA-binding domains, regardless of the original function of the normal version of the factor. We are now infecting early T cells using either these obligate repressor-encodingretroviruses, or retroviruses carrying the wild-type versionof the same transcription factors, and will analyze geneexpression profiles in both cases using realtimequantitative PCR. The effects on gene expression of theseobligate repressors can be compared with the effects seenwhen the wild-type factor is expressed. A similar patternof gene expression between wild type and obligaterepressor will suggest that the normal transcription factorin general acts directly as a repressor. In this case, anygene-activating effects of the normal factor and the engrailed fusion protein must be indirect, perhaps by repressing a repressor. If the pattern of gene expression inthe wild-type factor is substantially different from thefusion protein, on the other hand, this will suggest that thefactor in question normally acts positively. This strategy should greatly expand our knowledge of the genes directly regulated by GATA-3,GATA-2, and PU.1, and help us to place them correctly inthe transcriptional network controlling T-cell development. 410. Gene discovery and expression analysis of T-lineage regulators: Defining the transition from hematopoietic stem cell into the T-cellpathwayC. Chace Tydell, Elizabeth Sharon David Fung,Lee Rowen *, Jonathan E. Moore, Ellen V. RothenbergNotch signaling activates T-lineage differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors, but only a few of thetranscription factors initiating this program have beenidentified, e.g., GATA-3 and TCF-1. To identifyadditional regulators of T-cell specification, a cDNAlibrary from pro-T cells was screened for genes specifically upregulated in pro-T cells as compared to hematopoietic progenitors. In addition to 12 knownT-lineage genes, over less-characterized 75 genes ofinterest were identified by a stringent statistical criterion,and these were enriched for transcriptional regulators,RNA-binding proteins, and helicases. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that most of the ~40 genes selectedfor closer study are specifically upregulated in T-lineagecells relative to precursors of B or myeloid lineage. To astriking extent, however, T-lineage program componentsincluding Zn finger transcription factors, helicases, and shared by cells and though not by cells differentiating in otherpathways. Thus, much of the early T-lineage regulatorystate is a legacy from stem cells. The few genes sharplyupregulated between LSK CD27+ and pro-T cell stagesincluded were on Notch/Deltasignaling for induction in fetal liver precursors, whileBcl11b uniquely was upregulated between the DN1 andDN2 pro-T cell stages corresponding to T-lineage specification. *Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA 411. Non-homogeneity in T-cell developmental progression: Using single-cell culture to look at stochastic and non-stochastic models ofdevelopmental stage transition and fate choiceDeirdre Scripture AdamsIn the thymus, as well as in the most powerful and well used in vitro model of T-cell development, the OP9-DL1 culture system, T-cell precursors do not progressthrough development in a uniform mass, even when sorted to apparent homogeneity: They instead pass through each successive developmental state spread among severalconsecutive stages, or alternatively, among \"neighboring\"cell fates. We have found that this is the case even at thelevel of progeny of a single cell. A single cell can giverise to daughters which have differing rates of progressionalong a given developmental pathway, or which have madedivergent fate choices. Fetal liver precursors have beenused successfully to begin to address these questions whensorted as individual precursors directly on to OP9-DL1stromal layers and cultured while monitoring expansion, divergence, and progression along the T pathway. We are using the OP9-DL1 in vitro T-cell development system to generate large data sets to explore variances in thesebehavior types that differ quantitatively among differentdevelopmental states. 412. cis-Regulatory analysis of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 Mark ZarnegarDevelopmental regulation of transcription factor expression is critical in many cell fate decisions. Indeveloping T cells, many factors are up regulated, while some are turned off, as the cells progress from early thymic precursors (DN1 and DN2) to cells committed tothe T-cell fate (DN3). Our lab has demonstrated thatforced expression of PU.1 in thymic precursors, where itsexpression is normally turned off, arrests the cells andprevents them from becoming committed to the T-celllineage. We therefore seek to understand how PU.1expression is controlled in developing pro-T cells throughmapping of the relevant cis-regulatory elements. Comparing the sequences of the mouse and human loci, we have identified several pockets of Conserved E lements (CE1-9) upstream of exon 1 that may PU.1 transcription. DNase hypersensitivity (DHS) and chromatinimmunoprecipitation assays (ChIP), both techniques thatcan identify regions of transcription factor accessibility,and thus potential regulatory function, have been used toexamine the conserved elements. Using our mapping264 information from the ChIP and DNase HS data, we postulated that region CE8-9 may contain a non-specificregulatory element, while CE3-7 may contain a myeloid-specific enhancer element, and/or a T-cell specificregulatory region (see last year's Annual Report). We have designed luciferase reporter constructs to test for cell type-specific regulatory function of these upstream regions. CE9-8 acts as a non-specific enhancerin multiple cell lines. CE5 functions as an myeloid cells. CE4 contains a T-cell observed a non-conserved regionbetween CE4 and CE3, CE3A, which can also act as T cellsilencer. Complete mapping of this second repressiveelement is currently underway. We are also making stablecell lines in order to confirm the elements functionsimilarly when integrated into chromatin. Much effort has gone into identifying the transcription factors that bind and thus regulate the activity of the potential regulatory elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays implicate two important transcriptionfactor families, Ets and Runx, in the potential regulation ofPU.1. We have shown different Ets family members canbind to CE8 in PU.1 expressing versus non-expressing celllines, perhaps contributing to the different PU.1 expressionpatterns in these lineages. Gel shifts have also confirmedthe ability of Runx family members to bind a site presentin CE4. When we knock down Runx1 by cotransfectingantisense morpholinos in our transient transfection system,we inhibit the silencing effect of CE4. We are attempting to identify other factors that may act in combination with Runx1 to control CE4's silencing ability. We have yet toidentify a mechanism through which the alternativesilencer, CE3A, may be acting. Several potentialtranscription factor-binding sites are in CE3A,including sites for Gfi1, Ikaros, Bcl11B, and ZEB(Zfhx1a), all factors known to be able to represstranscription of target genes. Gel shifts to examinebinding to these sites are underway. 413. Finding regulatory elements of PU.1 in an embryonic stem cell differentiation system Long Li, Mark Zarnegar PU.1, an ETS family transcriptional factor, plays an important role in hematopoiesis: Aberrant expressionof PU.1 may result in disruption of some blood lineages oreven cause leukemia. Highly regulated expression of PU.1is critical for T-lymphocyte differentiation: Althoughessential for the earliest stages, its expression decreasesdramatically during T-cell specification and is notdetectable after T-cell differentiation reaches DN3;continued expression of PU.1 blocks further differentiationand even redirects cells into myeloid fate. Decreasing of PU.1 expression coincides with loss of developmental potential of pro-T cells to give rise to B, NK or myeloidcells. As described in the previous abstract, we areseeking to map the regulatory elements responsible forcell-type-specific differences in PU.1 expression, but thestandard cell-line models cannot reproduce the dynamicchanges of PU.1 expression in T-cell differentiation andtheir strict temporal order that we seek to explain. Therefore, we are developing an embryonic stem celldifferentiation system to score activity of regulatoryelements that control developmental changes in PU.1expression. Co-culture of fetal liver hematopoetic stem cells (HSC) with OP9-DL1 cells is being used in our group to generate T cells from these HSC. We are going one stepfurther by using the co-culture of embryonic stem (ES) R1cells with OP9/OP9-DL1 to generate B cells, myeloid cellsand T cells directly from embryonic stem cells in vitro . The advantages of this new system include: (1) It enablesactivity of a regulatory sequence reporter construct to bemeasured from the same integration event in divergent celllineages, without going through a transgenic mouse; and(2) It enables us to monitor the change in activity of aspecific regulatory element at different time points duringT-cell development. These features should make the embryonic stem-cell differentiation system a powerful approach to assay the function of crucial regulatoryelements (conserved DNA sequences, hotspots for DNAmethylation and histone modifications) that control thedifferent expression patterns of PU.1 across differenthematopoetic lineages. Currently we are optimizing theconditions for this embryonic stem-cell differentiationsystem. In parallel, to look for direct molecular signaturesof repression events, we are mapping differences in DNAmethylation and histone H3-Lys cells, not express PU.1, and in 32Dcl5, an IL-3-dependent pre-mast cell line which does expressPU.1. Future experiments include: (1) To transfect ESR1cells with constructs containing conserved DNA sequencein upstream of PU.1 to find enhancer or repressorsequences; (2) To find changes of DNA methylation andhistone modifications of PU.1 during the DN1 and DN2stages when its expression down regulates; and, (3) Tofind how conserved DNA sequences, modifications cooperate fine-tune theexpression of PU.1. 414. Characterization of early T-cell development non-obese (NOD) miceMary Yui, Ni FengType 1-diabetes (T1D) in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and humans is a complex polygenicautoimmune disease, which results from T cell-mediateddestruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. It isthe balance between different functional T-cell populationsthat determines autoimmunity, as T cells are not onlycrucial to disease pathogenesis, but also to the control ofongoing autoimmunity. Several functional defects havebeen reported in the immature and mature \u0001\u0002-T cells, NKT and NK cells of NOD mice, which may contribute to disease susceptibility. Because all T-cell subsets and NKcells share common precursors, we hypothesized that somekey defects affecting fundamental T-cell functions will manifest themselves in the early T-cell progenitors. Our previous studies have shown that NOD mice, with265 mutations that prevent TCR rearrangements, spontaneously violate the earliest checkpoint in T cell development, \u0002-selection. This defect in early T cell differentiation programming in NOD mice occurs at the time that T cells first use the T-cell receptor (TCR) and itssignaling pathways. Furthermore, the trait geneticallymaps to know diabetes susceptibility loci, suggesting a rolein disease. Using the OP9 Delta-like 1 (OP9-DL1) co-culture system, which permits in vitro T-cell development, we have found poor \u0001\u0002-T-cell development from NOD T-cell precursors, while \u0003\u0004-T-cell development appears to be enhanced. Because the strength of TCR signaling can affect this lineage choice, this result is consistent with theresults from NOD. Rag -/- mice, which cannot rearrange a TCR, suggesting abnormally high levels of spontaneous pre-TCR signaling at the \u0002-selection checkpoint. We have more recently found that surface receptors that can modulate the strength and nature of TCR signals (e.g.,CD4, CD2 and CD5), as well as co-stimulatory receptorsinvolved in T-cell survival and proliferation (e.g., CD27and CD28), are expressed at significantly higher or lowerlevels in NOD and NOD. Rag -/- early T cells as compared with their B6 and B6.Rag-/- T-cell counterparts, which may play a role in our in vitro observations. We plan to use the OP9-DL1 system for more detailed kinetic analyses to determine differentiation, survival and proliferation rates, as well as sensitivity to cytokine growth factors and Notchsignals, for the development of various T-cell subsets. 415. Genetic dissection of the early T-cell checkpoint breakthrough in NOD mice usingcongenic miceMary Yui, Ni FengBased upon genetic analysis of Type 1 diabetes in NOD mice, over 20 diabetes susceptibility loci have beenmapped. However, very few of the genes involved indisease have yet been identified. Based upon our previous observations that immunodeficient NOD- scid and - Rag -/- mice, which cannot rearrange T-cell receptors, spontaneously break through the first T-cell developmentalcheckpoint, we wished to determine whether or not thisfundamental defect in NOD T cells maps to know diabetessusceptibility genetic regions. This checkpoint violationprovides a fairly simple phenotype amenable to geneticanalysis, in a mouse that has all of the diabetessusceptibility genes, but does not have the complicationsof ongoing autoimmune disease. As previously reported, alinkage analysis was conducted using PCR-based microsatellite repeat polymorphisms to map the gene(s) responsible for the trait. (NOD X B6) X NOD- scid/scid backcross mice were phenotyped in the genomic regions including 17diabetogenic loci found on seven chromosomes. We foundthat the trait appears to map closely to regions withingenetic intervals on chromosomes 4 and 2 containingmajor diabetes susceptibility loci. The chromosome 4genetic region is of particular interest as the 2-3diabetogenic genes within it are thought to specificallyaffect T-cell functions. Although these susceptibility genes remain unidentified, congenic mice developed byLinda Wicker and colleagues (Cambridge, UK), in whichthe genetic interval is replaced by a corresponding resistantgenetic interval from C57Bl/10 mice, resulted in areduction in the incidence of diabetes from 80% to 3%. Furthermore, T cells were found to infiltrate but not destroy the pancreas in these congenic mice, suggestingthat the genes within this region may control the balancebetween pathogenic and regulatory self-reactive T cells.We have obtained these congenic mice and are currentlycarrying out crosses to make them Rag -deficient to determine whether or not genes within this diabetes susceptibility region are critical for the \u0002-selection checkpoint violation. Furthermore, we are characterizing early T-cell development in these congenic mice todetermine whether or not any of the differences observedbetween diabetes-prone NOD and resistant C57Bl/6 micealso map to this genetic region. 416. An alysis of the expression of key T-cell genes involved in early T-cell developmentalprogramming in NOD mice Chen Yee Liaw, Mary Yui, Ni Feng Detailed analysis of the \u0002-selection checkpoint violation in NOD. Rag -/- mice shows a derangement in the timing and level of expression of several developmentallyregulated cell surface receptors. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the aberrant development and checkpoint violation in NOD. Rag -/-T cells, early T-cell populations have been purified from the thymuses ofdiabetes-prone NOD and normal C57Bl/6 mice, bothRag-deficient and wild type, using antibodies to specific cell surface markers and sorting by flow cytometry. RNAhas been extracted from these cells and reverse transcribedinto cDNA for gene expression analysis using real timequantitative PCR. Based upon previous work in our lab,we have selected a set of transcription factor and effectorgenes to be analyzed that are key to T-cell developmental programming and are normally modulated during this time. We hope to identify specific genes that areaberrantly expressed in the in early T cells from NODmice as a clue to the defective pathways and genesinvolved in the alterations in T development, including the \u0002-selection checkpoint violation. 417. Conditioning the development of antigen- presenting cells by exposure to neutrophilgranule proteinsC. Chace TydellThe \"Hygiene Hypothesis\" addresses the evidence that the mammalian immune system requires exposure tobacterial or parasitic products for normal development(1-3). The consequence of first-world hygiene has beenlinked to the high incidence of asthma, Type-I diabetes,Hodgkin lymphoma and IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) in developed nations (4-6). In a controlled environment, the incidence of Type-I diabetes in coloniesof NOD mice is markedly impacted by hygiene conditions.266 Only recently has the role of the innate immune system been explored for its significance in immune systemhomeostasis. Specifically, bacterial exposure commonlyinduces a successful response by the cellular arm of theinnate immune system; the mustering of neutrophils to asite of challenge with subsequent discharge of large amounts of biologically active neutrophil granule proteins. The proteins of neutrophil granules are not onlyantimicrobial in activity but have diverse effects on hostcells (7-10). It is our hypothesis that the mechanism forthe hygiene effect lies at the interface of the innate andadaptive immune systems. Therefore, we have begun toinvestigate the effect of neutrophil granule proteins on theprogramming of two types of antigen presenting cells,dendritic cells and macrophages, which also present vitalinstructive cues to cells of the adaptive system. Twoneutrophil granule proteins, lactoferrin and PGRP-S, are ofparticular interest. The first specific neutrophil granule protein we considered for a possible effect on dendritic cellmaturation was lactoferrin. A prominent component ofneutrophil secondary granules, lactoferrin, is not potentlymicrobicidal; however, numerous studies attributeimmunomodulatory properties to lactoferrin (11).Analysis of sorted populations of macrophages anddendritic cells by qRT-PCR demonstrated that both celltypes express high levels of Lrp1, a putative lactoferrinreceptor (11-13). Therefore, the effect of lactoferrin ondendritic cells, obtained from mouse bone marrow using the standard culture protocol, was tested. Development of dendritic cells, cultured in the presence of GM-CSF withor without lactoferrin, were analyzed by FACs withdendritic cell markers, and their maturation in the presenceof LPS was evaluated. Cells developed in the presence ofthe anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were also analyzedfor comparison. Cells show a relativeresistance to LPS-induced maturation. DCs generated inthe presence or absence of lactoferrin, are substantiallysimilar when analyzed by flow cytometry with antibodiesagainst a variety of maturation markers. When sortedpopulations of DCs are further evaluated for gene expression patterns by qRT-PCR, these patterns are, again, mostly indistinguishable. To date we have tested theexpression of However, unexpectedly, IL-12 expressionwas shown to be affected by the presence of lactoferrin inthe culture medium. This is important because IL-12secretion by DCs in an immune response has a powerfuleffect on the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to differenteffector types. Expression of IL-12 was high in CD86-LPS-exposed DCs in all three media. Expression levels downregulated more than 100 fold upon DC maturation (as indicated by CD86 surface expression) in the control andIL10 cytokine media but did not downregulate in thelactoferrin cultured DCs. Initial studies thus indicate thatthis abundant neutrophil granule protein is affectingdendritic cell development, possibly generating \"semi-mature\" dendritic cells, reported to induce antigen-specificprotection from autoimmunity (14). Experiments to confirm and extend these observations are in progress. The limitation of the established technique of culturing murine dendritic cells from bone marrow, usingGM-CSF, is that it generates a heterogeneous populationof myeloid cells. Along with dendritic cells, these cultures generate high percentages of macrophages and neutrophils, precluding any media condition from being \"lactoferrinfree.\" Only recently, with the identification of a specificprecursor cell for dendritic cells and macrophages, termedMDPs (15), has an in vitro exploration of the effects of neutrophil granule proteins on macrophage and dendriticcell development been possible. MDPs areCX3CR1+ ckit+ BM progenitors that cannot develop intoneutrophils. We have developed a technique to sort MDPsto generate neutrophil-free cultures of dendritic cells (withGM-CSF) or macrophages (with M-CSF). The effect ofneutrophil granule proteins on the development of precursors guided toward a dendritic cell or macrophage fate may now be analyzed. We propose to analyzelactoferrin and PGRP-S in this novel culture system. Inaddition, the impact of IL-10 on these heterogeneous BMcultures has been documented, so it would be valuable toanalyze the specific effect of IL-10 on pure cultures ofdendritic cells.

MooreOur lab also researches the evolution of the lymphocyte lineage, its genetic regulation, and itsdevelopment. Previous research in our laboratory has shown that the regulation of the adaptive immune system within the gnathostomes, or jawed vertebrates, isremarkably conserved. For of the gnathostome phyla, nearlyevery transcription factor involved in T- and B- lineagedevelopment is conserved, as is also its approximateexpression pattern. We are in the midst of pushing ourunderstanding of the evolution of this system one criticalstep further to the agnathans, or jawless vertebrates. Though the agnathans have many of the cellular- and organismal-level hallmarks of the adaptive immune system, there is no evidence they have its genetic hallmarks such as genes for antibodies, recombinant T-cell receptors, MHCs, or Rag-mediated recombination. Thebeginning of the resolution to this seeming conundrum wasannounced in 2004 by our collaborators, Drs. Zeev Pancer,Chris Amemiya, and Max Cooper, who discovered analternative highly diverse recombinant protein, the variablelymphocyte receptor (VLR), expressed on the surface ofagnathan lymphocytes. It is tantalizing to hypothesize thatthe transcription regulatory network involved in immuneregulation originated before the last common ancestor ofthe vertebrates. In order to investigate this possibility, we are endeavoring to understand the transcriptional regulation of the VLR. This past year, we refined our bioinformatic assays of the upstream region of the lamprey VLR gene,we have created a myriad of luciferase reporter constructsincorporating segments of this region, and assayed theiractivity in several heterologous cell lines with and withoutsome cotransfected expression constructs ofimmunological transcription factors. Despite theevolutionary distances involved, expression levels in thesereporter constructs are quite high compared to background.One tantalizing preliminary result shows considerable activation in a mammalian B-cell line by a region approximately 1 to 2 kb upstream of the transcription startsite; interestingly, this region is rich in predicted GATAand Pax-family-binding sites. Additionally, we have isolated by flow cytometry VLR-positive cells from lampreys; in the near future, wewill make cDNA from these and prepare nuclear extractsfrom similarly obtained samples. We have also takenpreliminary steps to resolve the controversial phylogeneticrelationship between the hagfish, lamprey, andgnathostomes, a question with some considerable relevance to this research. Last, we have created a statistical comparative sequence analysis tool that we hopeto generalize and make available to others.Rothenberg laboratory publications David-Fung, E.-S., Yui, M.A., Morales, M., Wang, H., Taghon, T., Diamond, R.A. and Rothenberg, E.V.(2006) Progression of regulatory gene expression statesin fetal and adult pro-T cell development.

Biaggini Professorship of Biology Beckman InstituteGerman Government FellowshipGrubstake Presidents FundNational Institutes of Health, USPHS Summary: Our work in the Alliance for CellularSignaling has led us to a view of the architecture of thesignaling circuits that process information gleaned at thesurface of the cell. After examining the responses to 22 different ligands applied to the cell singly or in pairs, we concluded that the network that coordinates information isrelatively simple . Most circuits lead fairly directly from a cell surface receptor through a signal transduction processto a response regulator which effects cell metabolism.However, approximately 10% of the circuits involve morecomplex and unpredictable responses, \"non-additiveresponses.\" The results of the initial Alliance experimentpoints to these circuits that include \"interaction agents.\"We have proposed to find the molecular nature of theseinteracting elements in the subset of the signaling networkthat processes information mediated by the G protein system. It is necessary to first generate the tools that will allow us to precisely define the components of thiscircuitry. Our work over the past two or three years hasculminated in just such a \"tool box.\" We built a series ofvectors that can conditionally express single or multiplemiRNA scaffoldings that include RNAi sequences targetedat silencing the production of specific gene products.These are versatile single lentiviral vectors that can beused both to transform or transfect tissue culture cells andalso to transfect primary cells. The vectors have featuresthat allow us to block specific gene expression and to restore that expression. Vectors can also be equipped with mutant forms of a gene so that the native form can besilenced while the alternative form is expressed. Thesecond set of tools developed over the last year and thatnow are beginning to be deployed involve the use ofmicrofluidics. Robert Bao (from Dr. Steve Quake'slaboratory) has built a \"lab on a chip\" that allows us todesign complex experimental protocols for the study ofcells responding to different ligands applied at differenttimes, singly or in pairs, under conditions that are identicalfor each of the 6-12 small populations of approximately100 cells each and to derive data for both single cellresponses and for the response of each small population. We are using this approach to study the mechanisms involved in a number of responses including receptordesensitization and ligand interactions that involve theultimate release of calcium in the cell. We have togetherwith colleagues at University of California, San Francisco,begun to develop methods for transfecting bone marrowderived macrophages (BMDM) so that we can obtainprimary cells that also carry the gene silencing vectors andcan be tested for their activity. In addition, we have continued our work in collaboration with Drs. David Anderson and AllanBasbaum trying to understand the function of G protein pathways in the small diameter nociceptor neurons that innervate the skin in the mouse. Dr. Sang-Kyou Han in our lab has found that mutants that are devoid of PLC \u00013 also lose their scratching intradermal response to injections of histamine. He has been able to show that that the \"itch\" response to injected histamine and a variety of agonists and antagonists that either bind to the histamine H1receptor or induce mast cell degranulation, lose their ability to induce itching in PLC \u0001 3 defective mice. He has been able to show that the histamine H1 receptor that mediates the response is localized on a fraction of the small diameter nociceptor neurons that ordinarily specifically express PLC \u00013. This work is being pursued to further understand the basis for the function of subsets of these nociceptive neurons. Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Mircea Podar, we have undertaken a computational study of the twocomponent signaling systems in microorganisms andparticularly the nature of the two component systems thathave been discovered through metagenomic sequencing.We plan to use computational tools to understand thephylogenetic distribution of different two componentsignaling systems, their functional distribution, and theircorrelation with environmental responses. 419. Mo lecular Biology Laboratory of the Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AfCS) Fraser, Jong Ik Hwang,Baljinder Randhawa, Melvin SimonStudies by the Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AfCS) in the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line arefocused on the analysis of crosstalk between signalingpathways when the cell is challenged with multiple ligandstimuli. The AfCS ligand screens have identifiedthousands of interactions between signaling pathways thatprovide insight to the mechanisms used by the cell to respond appropriately to extracellular stimuli (1). RNAi provides a powerful method to investigate the molecularbasis of interaction between signaling pathways, and we269 have developed sophisticated methods for the application of RNAi in RAW cells and primary macrophages. Wehave developed a lentiviral vector platform (pSLIK; expression of 'microRNA-like' shRNAs (miR-shRNA) from a single viral infection of any na\u00efve cell system (2). In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the pSLIK platform was used to conditionally deplete the expression of the heterotrimeric G proteins, G \u000112 and G\u0001 13, both singly and in combination, demonstrating the G \u000113 dependence of SRE-mediated transcription. In RAW264.7macrophages, regulated knockdown of G \u00022 correlated with a reduced Ca2+ response to C5a. Insertion of a GFPtransgene upstream of the G \u00022 allowed concomitant re-expression of a heterologous mRNA during Tet-dependent target gene knockdown, significantly enhancing the experimental applicability of the pSLIKsystem. We are currently using these and otherexperimental tools, in collaboration with the other AfCSlaboratories at UCSF, UTSW and Berkeley, to developmechanistic models of signal transduction pathways in theRAW264.7 cell line.

Cell Biol Shin, et Pho spholipase transduced four PLC-\u0002 ,\u00021-\u0002 4, and some of these isoforms mediate sensory modalities such as taste, vision, and pain sensation in a variety of organisms. Here, we investigated the nature of the function of PLC\u0002 isozymes in primary sensory neurons by using mutant mice deficient for specific PLC \u0002 isoforms. Expression analysis indicated that PLC \u00023 and \u00024 were expressed in different subsets of sensory neurons. PLC\u0002 3 is predominantly expressed in a sub-population of C-fiber nociceptors, and anterogradely transported to peripheral nerve terminals. Ca 2+ imaging studies revealed that PLC \u00023, but not PLC \u00024 specifically mediated histamine induced calcium responses in cultured DRG(Dorsal Root Ganglia) neurons and the responses werecompletely abolished by the histamine H1 receptorantagonist, mepyramine. In line with this, we found that PLC\u0002 3-/- mice showed significant defects in scratching behavior induced by histamine, HTMT (histamine- trifluoromethyl-toluidine), a selective H1 48/80, a mast cell activator and to a lesserextent by clobenpropit, an H4 receptor agonist and H3 receptor antagonist. These results demonstrate that PLC \u00023 is required to mediate \"itch\" sensation in response to histamine acting on the histamine H1 receptor in C-fibernociceptive neurons. 421. A m icrofluidic platform for cell signaling assays Robert BaoWe are working to establish an experimental platform for probing calcium responses in mammalian cells within microfluidic devices. Using pressure-actuated microvalves, we can precisely gate and switch flow to cellsanchored to microchannel floors. Because the devices arepermeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide, cells can becultured in the device for up to several days underconditions that effectively mimic those found in a cellculture incubator. Calcium responses in hundreds ofindividual cells can then be imaged through the deviceusing standard epifluorescence microscopy. The use ofmicrofluidic devices has several advantages: (1) we haveexcellent control over perfusion conditions that the cellsexperience, both during culture and experiment; (2) many separate experiments may be incorporated into a single microscope field-of-view, so that several differentconditions, including positive and negative controls, maybe integrated into a single experimental data acquisitionrun; and, (3) cells can be kept in culture between differentexperiments, so that long-term, cell-to-cell variabilities inresponses to different ligands can be probed; and, (4)reagent volume requirements for cell stimulation are muchlower than those in conventional cellular assays, so thereare significant potential cost savings for expensivereagents. We are currently working with a device design with six separate channels for use during experiment.Preliminary results for RAW macrophages stimulated withUDP are comparable to those seen in single-cellexperiments performed in macroscopic wells. Work is stillongoing to probe and understand the effects of flow rateand shear stress, both during cell preparation and ligandstimulus, on cellular calcium responses. In addition to thegeneral scientific interest, understanding these issuespromises to improve data quality and consistency for manyexperiments involving solution exchange.

Our main foci are on signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation. Our approaches areexperimental, computational and synthetic. Specifically,we use molecular genetics to understand detailedmechanisms, and functional genomics to obtain globalviews of development and behavior. We takecomputational approaches to understand signaltransduction, developmental pattern formation andbehavioral circuits. We try to couple tightly computationand experimental data, in part to use computation to makeexperimental tests more efficient. Moreover, we study other genomes, genetics, and biology of other nematodes to help us comprehend C. elegans , to learn how development and behavior evolve, and to learn how tocontrol parasitic and pestilent nematodes. In the area of signal transduction, we continue to define pathway interactions and to understand thedeterminants of signaling specificity: How does the samepathway lead to distinct outcomes in different tissues? Forthese studies we analyze EGF-receptor signaling, WNTsignaling, TRP channels, and G protein-mediated signalingpathways. We have found a new role for EGF signaling,controlling behavioral quiescence during development. Vulval development involves a remarkable series of intercellular signaling events that coordinate thepatterning of the uterine and vulval epithelia and allow them to connect precisely. Specification of the anchor cellfrom the ventral uterine epithelium breaks the symmetry ofthe gonad. The anchor cell then produces thevulval-inducing signal, LIN-3, an epidermal growth factorlike protein that acts via C. elegans homologs of EGF- receptor, RAS and MAP kinase. Inductive signaling is regulated at the level of ligand production, as well as theresponsiveness of the receiving cells. LIN-3 is producedin a highly localized and regulator manner. After theanchor cell induces the vulva, a complex program offurther pattern formation, cell type specification andmorphogenesis follows. The primary (1\u00b0) vulval lineagegenerates an E-F-F-E pattern of cell types while the 2\u00b0vulval lineage generates an A-B-C-D pattern of cell types.We now have our hands on a number of receptor proteins,transcription factors and regulated genes; we are trying todefine this regulatory network to understand how organogenesis is genetically programmed. The anchor cell recognizes one of the seven vulval cell types and invadesthe vulval epithelium in a process akin to tumor metastasis,and we have found genes necessary for this process.Regulation by the EGF-receptor, WNT and HOM-Cpathways alsothe neuroectoblast P12 specification, male hook andspicule development. By comparing these examples withvulval development, we seek to understand the signalingspecificity and signal integration. The relativecontributions of EGF and WNT differ in each example. Multipotent cells with three fates utilize NOTCH signaling, as well as EGF/WNT signaling Our efforts in genomics are experimental and computational. Our experimental genome annotationincludes identifying in vitro binding sites for transcription factors, testing enhancer-function in transgenic worms, andsystematic inactivation of C. elegans transcription factors. We are investigating ways to compare the genomes ofCaenorhabditis species. In particular, we are collaborating with the Genome Sequencing Center of WashingtonUniversity to annotate new projects involve establishing pipelines for cis-regulatory computational analysis, new programs to use orthology and known binding sites or motifs, etc. Wehave successfully combined information from worms, fliesand yeast to predict gene-gene interactions in C. elegans , and are extending this to other species. We are part of the WormBase consortium, which develops and maintains WormBase, a web-accessiblecomprehensive database of the genome, genetics andbiology of C. elegans and close relatives (www.wormbase.org ). We initiated WormBook, an open- access online text of C. elegans biology associated with WormBase. We have developed Textpresso (www.textpresso.org ), an ontology-based search engine for full text of biological papers. Textpresso is used by C. elegans researchers, as well as the WormBase staff. It is being expanded to other organisms and fields of study, inparticular Neuroscience and Drosophila . We are also part of the Gene Ontology Consortium272 (www.geneontology.org), which seeks to annotate gene and protein function with a standardized, organized vocabulary. WormBase, Gene Ontology and Textpressoare part of the Generic Model Organism (GMOD) Project(www.gmod.org), a collaborative project among organism-specific databases to develop generic software. Our behavioral studies focus on understanding male mating behavior, as well as locomotion of both sexes.For specific projects we study egg laying, feeding,chemotaxis, osmotic avoidance among other simplebehaviors. Mating behavior, with its multiple steps, isarguably the most complex of C. elegans behaviors. Because it is not essential for reproduction, given thepresence of internally self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, malemating is useful to elucidate how genes control behavior.We are studying several aspects of male mating behaviorto understand the neuronal circuits that control thebehavior and how they are genetically encoded. Our comparative studies include both analyzing behavioral differences among species, and genetic analysis of C. briggsae, Pristionchus pacificus (a nematode species we discovered during the 1990s), and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (an insect-killing nematode). We have developed a that automatically quantifies the locomotion of nematodes. Weuse this system to study individual genes, to examineepistatic interactions among genes, and to obtain data tosupport mathematical modeling efforts. We are expandingthis effort to analyze mating behavior of nematodes. We are involved in efforts to model worm movement, vulval pattern formation and aspects of signal transduction. 422. cis-Regulatory analysis of three HiroakiShizuya, Joseph C. Roden 1, J. Paul SternbergWe scanned three Caenorhabditis genomes (C. elegans for conserved non-coding DNA elements thatcould indicate cis-regulatory signals. We first used MUSSA, an n-species generalization of FamilyRelations,to select ungapped blocks of high identity. MUSSAidentified ~2% of the non-coding DNA in the ceh 13/lin 39 Hox cluster as conserved between C. elegans ,C. briggsae, and C. sp. CB5161 . Within this restricted subset, transgenic assays of Hox cluster elements show expressionpatterns for five of seven tested. Fine-scale examination ofother experimentally verified cis-regulatory elements in lin 3 and lin 11 shows that they are closely associated with MUSSA-identified elements, but not identical to them.We hypothesized that this loose association of smallregulatory motifs with large conserved blocks will begenerally valid. We, thus, carried out a genome-wideanalysis with the Cistematic open-source framework.Cistematic used MUSSA to find blocks of non-codingDNA in the flanks and introns of 8,100 genes withorthologs in all three genomes. These blocks were thenscanned for up to five-candidate position-weight matrices(PWMs) per gene with MEME, and the of degenerate and redundant instances. Theresulting 16,385 PWMs were used to re-scan all threegenomes, checking for conservation and significantly associated GO terms; this biased the motif finders towards conserved motifs in MUSSA blocks, but allowed genome-wide analyses to be unrestricted by MUSSA. We found1045 conserved motifs associated with defined biologicalfunctions (as indicated by Gene Ontology terms,anatomical expression patterns, or homology groups),which we are now analyzing for coexpression bymicroarray and anatomical data in WormBase. We alsotested in vivo Cistematic's ability to find regulatory elements in coexpressed collagen genes; deletion ofCistematic-predicted elements from collagen promoterregions reliably altered their regulation of reporter genes. 1Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, 91125 USA 2Professor, Division of Biology, Caltech 423. Genome-wide prediction of C. elegans genetic interactionsWeiwei ZhongAn essential part of understanding how a genome specifies the properties of an organism is elucidating interactions among its genes. One successful method to identify genetic interactions is by modifier screens (e.g.,synthetic lethal screen). However, this process is limitedto easily detectable phenotypes. Metazoan biologicalprocesses often involve phenotypes that are too complex toscore in large-scale screens. To study functionalinteractions in these processes, an alternative method,direct testing of candidate genes, is often used.Unfortunately, a genome of 20,000 genes has as many as200 million pairwise combinations, composing aformidable challenge for experimental testing. To obtain aglobal view of the genetic interaction network, we took a computational approach to statistically integrate genetic data (such as expression and phenotype) from multiplespecies to predict genome-wide genetic interactions. Weapplied the approach in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and predicted 18,183 interactions among 2,254 genes. We experimentally tested a subset of ourpredictions and successfully identified 12 new modifiers oftheC. elegans ras gene let 60 and two new suppressors of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3R) gene itr 1. Our predicted genetic interaction network provides agenome-level understanding of gene functions and a candidate \"guidebook\" for experimental testing.273 242. EGF signaling regulated behavioral quiescence inC. elegans Cheryl Van Buskirk EGF signaling plays many roles in development across species and recently has been shown to regulatecircadian activities in mammals. We have found that EGF overexpression has strikingly similar effects on behavior in C. elegans and mice. We have observed thatoverexpression of the EGFR ligand LIN-3 from aninducible promoter at any stage causes a complete andreversible cessation of feeding and movement. We havefound these behavioral defects to be mediated by the EGF receptor (LET-23), by PLC- \u0001,and by targets of diacylglycerol (DAG) signaling, including those that mediate neurotransmitter release, suggesting that EGFsignaling acts to control neurotransmission. We arecurrently investigating the neural circuits involved in thiseffect, and screening the genome for additional genes thatplay a role, with the aim of understanding more about howEGF affects behavior in both C. elegans and mammals. 425. Spatial and temporal coordination of organogenesis Ted Ririe, Si Hyun Kim* Organ development requires a network of factors that direct both spatial and temporal patterning. The C. elegans vulva is an attractive model for studying organogenesis because of its relative complexity, and theavailability of several cell fate markers whose spatial andtemporal expression pattern is known. A skeletal networkof the transcription factors that govern differentiation ofthe cells that make up the vulval have been defined. Allthe genes that are known to regulate differentiation of thevulval cells are functional in multiple cell types. Consequently, the mode of cell-type specific regulation remains elusive. To elucidate the mode of cell-typespecific regulation we have screened for transcriptionfactors, using RNAi, that differentially regulate zmp 1::gfp expression in vulA versus vulD and E cells. Also, theminimal element sufficient for zmp 1::gfp expression in the vulva has been defined. The alignment of C. elegans, C. briggsae and recently C. ramanei sequences, has sequences motifs between thethree Site-directed mutagenesis of these motifswill help elucidate the cis-regulation of zmp 1 expression in individual vulval cells. *Caltech undergraduate 426. Ta illess ortholog nhr-67 regulates and of C. types Jolene S. FernandesProgression through C. elegans vulval development leads to the generation (vulA, vulB1, vulB2, vulC, with its own unique gene expressionprofile. The mechanisms that establish the precise spatial patterning of these mature cell types are largely unknown. Dissection of the gene regulatory networks involved invulval patterning and differentiation would help usunderstand how cells generate a spatially-defined patternof cell fates during organogenesis. To identifycomponents of the regulatory network underlying vulvaldevelopment, we conducted RNAi screens of about halfthe known or predicted transcription factors and assayed for the effect on expression of vulval cell fate markers. From this screen, we identified the tailless ortholog nhr 67 as a regulator of gene expression in multiple vulval celltypes. nhr 67 exhibits a dynamic expression pattern in the vulval cells, and interacts with three other transcriptionalregulators - cog 1 (Nkx6.1/6.2), lin 11 (LIM) and egl 38 (Pax) - to generate the composite expression patterns oftheir downstream targets. We demonstrate that theinteractions between these regulatory genes are complexand vary among the seven cell types. We also discovereda striking regulatory circuit that exists in a subset of thevulval lineages: cog 1 and nhr 67 cross-inhibit both one another and themselves in specific vulval cells. Wepostulate that the differential levels and combinatorialpatterns of lin-11, cog-1 and nhr 67 expression are a part of the regulatory code for the mature vulval cell types. 427. Cell fate, cell polarity, Wnt and Ror Jennifer Green Proper formation of the C. elegans hermaphrodite vulva results from the invariant pattern of three vulval precursor cells (VPCs) anddepends on the integration of the Ras, Wnt, and Notch pathways. We are investigating the role of cam 1, the C. elegans homolog of the Ror family of receptor tyrosine in VPC induction. Ror an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Theligand and downstream signaling components of Rorproteins are unknown at this time. We have identifiedcam 1 as a negative regulator of the vulval inductionprocess and are attempting to elucidate its relationshipwith the above pathways. In addition to regulating cellfate, Wnt signaling also orients the polarity VPC divisions.We are different Wnts to establish default polarity, basal polarity, and reversed polarity to generate determination, vulval development, larval viability and male spicule development and IP 3-Ca2+ for ovulation. It is not known what determines the specificity among theRas-MAPK-dependent inductions. One possibility is that different transcription factors act in parallel to or downstream of the EGF signal in different tissues. Hoxgenes have been implicated as one class of regulatoryelements that confer specificity to the EGF pathway inP11/P12 cell fate determination and vulva development.However, their role in larval viability and spicule development has not been studied. Another possibility is274 that different signaling pathways interact to generate specificity. Together with the EGF pathway, the Wntsignaling pathway regulates both P11/12 and vulvadevelopment as well. We are studying the role of the EGFand Wnt pathways in regulating Hox gene expression inthe male tail. 429. Interphylum comparisons of genetic circuits in muscle tissue development Steven Gregory KuntzUnderstanding the relation of network structure and function in genetic regulatory networks is aided bycomparative analysis across different phyla. Striatedmuscle is an excellent candidate for comparative analysis,being evolutionarily ancient, having striking similaritieswith pulsating muscle, and being prominent in severalmodel organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans extensive genetic and molecular studies, primarily focused onindividual components, we know that numerous musclenetwork components in nematodes, vertebrates, andarthropods are orthologous. It is not known if specificdifferences in components between the networks perturbthe general network structure or function. In order toconstruct a comprehensive draft map of the striated muscledifferentiation networks of mouse and nematode, acomputational integration of genetic, expression, andprotein-DNA binding data is necessary. Network mapcomparisons will identify variable and conserved components, as well as similarities and differences among the regulatory properties. This analysis, critical forunderstanding the relation between the networks, will beused to formulate and test specific hypotheses about thenetwork structure-function relationships. To construct thismap for analysis, several techniques will be utilized. Toaide in the generation of expression and protein-DNAbinding data, a complete genome tiling of C. elegans has been designed to allow gene chip analysis of chromatinimmunoprecipitation, as well as mRNA expression. RNAisynthetic lethal screens for genetic interactions to aide inthe generation of genetic data have been performed. A number of candidate genes identified in the screen are being analyzed for potentially critical roles in muscletissue differentiation during embryonic development.These genes may help construct the draft map of theregulatory network. With a draft map of the regulatorynetwork, perturbation and cross-species studies of keytranscriptional regulators, examined by replacing the C. elegans regulators (unc 120, hnd 1 ,hlh 1, and hlh ) with orthologs mouse (MEF2A, SRF, HAND, Myogenin,and Twist), will be assayed to learn about the relationshipof the orthologous and non-orthologous structure and functionality.430. C. elegans L1 developmental arrest as a model for cancer and agingRyan BaughLarvae of the nematode C. elegans reversibly arrest development in acute response to starvation.Embryos that hatch in the complete absence of food arrest development before any post-embryonic development is observed (L1 arrest), and such arrested worms are resistantto numerous environmental stresses. Arrest can bemaintained for weeks and normal development resumedonce food is available. In contrast to the well-studieddauer arrest, L1 arrest is near instantaneous and occurswith no morphological modification. I have found thatinsulin signaling regulates L1 arrest, in addition to dauerarrest and aging. I am using a combination of genetic andmicroarray analyses to identify other pathways thatregulate L1 arrest, as well as genes regulated by insulinsignaling during implementation and maintenance of L1 arrest. I am also investigating the coordination of developmental timing with developmental arrest. Propercontrol of cell division and growth is crucial in preventingcancer, and this system provides a new model to studythese controls. In addition, I find it intriguing thatindividual worms make a coherent all-or-none decision toarrest or develop: While the value of maintaining temporalcoordination among the various cell lineages is obvious,the way it is accomplished is unclear. 431. Linker cell migration Mihoko Kato The shape of the developing male gonad in C. elegans is determined by the migratory path of the linker cell (LC), which is located at the front of the gonad,followed by other somatic gonadal cells and then thegermline. While the LC can migrate independently of therest of the gonad, the rest of the gonad requires attachmentto the LC to migrate. I have identified three genes that,when mutated, result in the LC detaching from the gonadand migrating as an individual cell. Based on these genes,I am investigating the potential role of genetic pathwaysassociated with myosin and dynactin protein complexes in this process. I am also using microscopy techniques to look at the cell biology of the LC and the three adjacentcells that directly connect to the LC as this breakdown incell adhesion and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is a nematode parasite insects that is currently used as a biologicalcontrol agent for a wide variety of insect agricultural pests.Heterorhabditis is symbiotically associated with the pathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens, which colonizes the nematode gut. We found thatHeterorhabditis can infect Drosophila , that the interactions between Heterorhabditis , Photorhabdus, and Drosophila may provide a genetically tractable tripartite model system for the study of insectparasitism and bacterial symbiosis. We are studying the275 molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Heterorhabditis infectivity, as well as the effects of Heterorhabditis infection on the Drosophila immune response. 433. Sens ory control of alterations of locomotory behavior during C. elegans male mating Allyson J Whittaker, Gary C Schindelman, ShahlaGharibWe are studying C. elegans male mating behavior as a model for understanding how locomotory behaviorcan be modulated by sensory input. Of particular interestto us are the early steps of male mating behavior,(response, backing and turning), as it is during these stepsthat the greatest modulation of the normal sinusoidalmovement pattern occurs. The hermaphrodite is notthought to play an active role in male mating but insteadprovide passive cues that trigger different male matingsteps. We have been examining the hermaphrodite cue(s)that trigger turning behavior. When we compared themating behavior of males with hermaphrodites of differentlengths, (wild type, lon-2 and dpy-10), we found thatmales almost always turn within approximately the samepercentage body length. This observation suggests that thedistance traveled along the hermaphrodite or time the malehas spent backing is not important for triggering a turn. Totest if a cuticular cue is necessary to signal a male to turn,we have observed the mating behavior of males with bli-6hermaphrodites. We found that in 51% of encounters withthe end of a blister, males initiated a turn, and they fullycompleted a turn in 20% of encounters. This observationsuggests that a specific cuticular cue is not absolutelynecessary to trigger a turn. We postulate that it is thechange in shape at the head and tail of a hermaphroditethat triggers a male to turn. We are also interested in theneuronal pathways that control response, backing andturning. The effects of mutations in known neuronalsignaling genes, as well as mutations isolated in matingdefective screens in our lab on these behaviors will bediscussed. 434. WormBook: The Online Review of C. elegans Biology and Resource for Experimental MethodsLisa Girard, Tristan Fiedler, Todd Harris, FeliciaCarvalho, Igor Antoshechkin, Paul Sternberg,Lincoln Stein, Martin ChalfieWormBook (http://www.wormbook.org) is a collection of original, peer-reviewed chapters on topicsrelated to the biology of C. elegans , as well as WormMethods, a collection of laboratory methods andprotocols useful to C. elegans researchers. Since WormBook was launched in June 2005 with 12 chapters, ithas grown to over 100 chapters, covering nearly everyaspect of C. elegans research, from cell biology and neurobiology to evolution and ecology, and caters to awide audience ranging from high school students toestablished researchers. WormBook is a product of the C. elegans community, with nearly 150 of its members already contributing. WormBook also serves as the textcompanion to WormBase, the C. elegans model organism database. In this capacity, WormBook is a paradigm forother model organism database companions. WormBook'selectronic publishing model lets it bring information to itsreaders quickly, and extends its utility with relevant linksto other online resources. WormBook content isextensively hyperlinked to WormBase. Genes, proteins,and cells are linked to the relevant pages in WormBase inorder to provide our readers with easily accessiblebackground information. Additionally, WormBookcontributions contain links to other WormBookcontributions, and its in-text citations are linked to theirabstracts in PubMed and their full-text version, whenavailable. Since WormBook is online, its chapters are ableto contain movies and complex images that would no bepossible in print. WormBook is designed to keep up withthe rapid pace of discovery in the field of C. elegans research and it continues to grow, with the addition of newsections, new chapters, and updated versions of existingchapters.

Ourapproaches to these problems increasingly use genome-wide and proteome-wide experimental assays coupled withbioinformatic and computational tools needed to extractconnectivity relationships and evolutionary relatedness. Much of the informatics side is developed in an on-going partnership with Professor Eric Mjolsness ofJPL/University of California, Irvine. In several parts of thework experimental technologies, computational tools,databases, etc., are first developed and tested using yeastas the model genomic system. An underlying challenge for us is to understand the regulatory events that drive the progression frommultipotential precursor cells or adult stem cells todetermined unipotential progenitors and then to fullydifferentiated cells. We are currently studying these cellstates and transitions using microarray gene expression analysis, global protein:DNA interaction measures, mass spec-based proteomics of multiprotein complexes,informed by comparative genomics. In othervertebrates, this lineage arises from paraxial mesoderm toproduce muscle (also bone, skin and fat, among otherderivatives). Skeletal myogenesis is governed by bothpositive- and negative-acting regulatory factors. TheMyoD family of four closely related, positive-actingtranscription factors are key. Upon transfection, each cantrigger nonmuscle recipient cells enter, and often toexecute, the myogenic differentiation program. Our working model emphasizes that MyoD family factors are able to do this because they are highly connected andcross-talk within their group and with other collaboratingfactors (like MEF2 factors) and other regulators that nowinclude microRNAs. This drives us to cast our problem innetwork terms. To understand their extraordinary abilityto drive or redirect a cell to become muscle, we need tolearn the structure and function of the network(s) in which they are embedded. It is also clear that negative regulatorsof skeletal myogenesis are probably just as important forregulating the outcome as are the positive regulators.Multiple negative regulators of skeletal muscle areexpressed in multipotential mesodermal precursors and in proliferating muscle precursors (myoblasts). It is generally believed that some of these are important for specifyingand/or maintaining precursor cells in an undifferentiatedstate, though exactly how the system works is unknownand a subject for investigation. It has brought us recentlyto be very interested in defining specific transcriptionalrepressors and their entire array of in vivo target genes. A newer addition asks what role differential translation andRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms play at each step,and how these might mediate cell communication in theneuromuscular system. To define protein:protein complexes in the network more comprehensively, we developed a collaborative effort with the Deshaies lab here and theJohn Yates lab at Scripps to modify and apply MudPITmass spectrometry, coupled with dual affinity epitopetagging, to characterize multiprotein complexes(Graumann et al., 2004). Among other things, this enabled postdoctoral fellow Libera Berghella to identify a newrepressor that acts on myogenin, the MyoD family membermost directly responsible for execution of differentiation.New technology development projects are focused onlarge- scale measurements of protein:DNA interactions, several of which feature a collaboration between our lab and Rick Myers lab and Genome Center at Stanford (seeMortazavi entries below). The computational toolsdescribed below have been used to find candidateconserved regulatory elements, and these are, in turn,being subjected to functional assays via lentiviral-mediatedtransgenesis. These same tools are being used to analyzedata from multiple species of worms related, in differingdegrees, to C. elegans . This is part of an ongoing partnership with the Sternberg lab that involves severaljoint projects (see Kuntz and Mortazavi entries below). Inaddition to clarifying how many and which worm genomes give us the most leverage for identifying functionally important noncoding elements in the genome, we seekinsights into the evolution ancient gene networks that drivemyogenesis and cell cycle across the large phylogeneticdistances separating vertebrates, worms, flies and for cellcycle, even plants and yeasts. Chris Hart's thesis work began with building a data mining and analysis infrastructure called CompClust(Hart et al., 2005). He then used it to explore the idea that a simple classifier neural network could be used tointegrate complex protein:DNA interactions (chromatin immunoprecipitation assayed by microarray) and global RNA expression data, usingmultiple sets of yeast cell cycle data. This provedremarkably successful with the neural net modelshighlighting in the top dozen 10 of 12 previously knownmajor cell cycle transcription factors from datasets forover 200 factors. An interesting and unexpected278 implication from his work concerned specific \"subnetwork\" domains of negative selection imposed onkey factor-binding motifs. Tracy Teal's study of biofilm development is a collaboration with Diane Newman in the Division ofGeology and Planetary Science. It has absolutely nothing to do with myogenesis, though it does have to do with a different kind of development. Its thematic goal is toidentify, visualize, and ultimately understand the multipledifferent metabolic cell states that comprise a biofilm atdifferent stages of its development and under differingenvironmental stimuli. The degree to which principles andregulatory strategies used by metazoans duringdevelopment are or are not employed by bacteria increating biofilm structures is being probed by markingbacteria with multiple GFP derivatives driven by genesthat will mark functional domains (aerobic vs. anaerobic,for example). To do this, Tracy developed a new and elegant way to characterize biofilm morphogenesis quantitatively. She then used it to establish that the widelyheld view of mature biofilms having cores composed ofdead cells is incorrect, and that these cores are instead in adistinct metabolic and growth state. This growth quiescentbut nevertheless live and active state may help to explainsome properties of biofilm robustness seen under diverseenvironmental stimuli, including antibiotic treatment. 435. A new bHLH myogenic transcription regulators, is a crucialregulator of myogenesis that is down-regulated at the RNAlevel during muscle fiber maturation as a consequence ofinnervation. Comparative genomic analysis of sequencesflanking myogenin using an early version of MUSSA (seeentry from De Buysscher below), highlighted ahighly conserved 17bp element (myogHCE). askedwhat its function is, first by using lentiviral mediatedtransgenesis. This showed that it mediates and is essential for postnatal repression of myogenin in transgenic animals. Subsequent mass spec analysis of proteins enriched bybinding to this motif identified a candidate transactingfactor from adult muscle that could be responsible for thisregulatory action. It binds myogHCE in vitro and occupies the locus in adult skeletal muscle. Altering its levelsexperimentally shows that it can repress differentiation inC2C12 myoblasts in the gain of function mode, and that itcan also regulate multiple effects of innervation in adultmuscle. It binds the myogHCE motif as part of a complexthat includes the homeodomain protein Pbx. Genome- wide analysis identified a family of related conserved elements, one of which is located 35 Kb upstream ofMyoD in mouse and also interacts with MSY-3 in vivo . Taken together, these results suggest MSY-3 is a newcomponent of the muscle regulatory network, critical forproper innervation-dependent activity during development.*Member of the Professional Staff, Caltech436. Inf erring the structure of the yeast cell cycle transcription network by neural networkmodelingChristopher Hart, Eric MjolsnessA prominent network of kinases (Cdks), together with a coupled system of regulated proteolysis, governs progression of the yeast cell cycle. A major downstream output of this signaling system is transcriptional regulationof a large set of genes, some of which are known to playimportant roles in further regulating and executing thephases of the yeast cell cycle. Between 300 and 1000yeast gene RNAs are expressed in a cell cycle-dependentmanner. This wide range in the number of genesdesignated as cycling depends on a combination ofexperimental specifics, such as the method of phasesynchronization, the analytical methods, and criteria fordefining cell cycle regulation, but a core of ~200 arecommon to virtually all studies, and the major kinetic patterns correspond roughly to the phases of the cell cycle. In this project, I used artificial neural networks (ANNs) tointegrate results from ChIP-on-chip experiments. The motivation for thismethod is that this architecture of neural network is verysimple, yet captures and capitalizes on several propertiesof gene networks that are not used by other establishedmethods of analysis. By mining the network weightsmatrix, 10 of 12 previously known regulatory connections that are associated with the cell cycle by traditional molecular genetics and biochemistry emerged as topconnections in the ANN. In addition, several novelconnections scored highly by the ANN. These new model-based connections provide a basis for hypotheses aboutadditional regulators acting in the cell cycle. With each ofthese regulatory relationships we also capture the cellcycle phase in which these regulatory associations arelikely to be pertinent. 437. Automation of genome-wide and cross-genome cis-regulatory element identification and assessment using Cistematic Ali Mortazavi, Sarah Aerni 1 We are continuing development of an extensible computational framework called Cistematic, which isdesigned to automate discovery and refinement ofcandidate cis-regulatory motifs. It further performs genome-wide phylogenetic mapping for the motif or motifcombinations of interest. The objective is to stratify motifoccurrences by applying user-specified criteria forphylogenetic conservation and/or site position relative toadjacent coding sequences or other genome features. Motif occurrences that are most conserved are identified using the cisMatcher algorithm, which assesses conservation without need of pre-computed multiple-sequence alignments. Resulting sets of conserved motifoccurrences, together with identities of the adjacent genes,comprise a \" cis-motif cohort.\" A Gene Ontology enrichment module in Cistematic can then be used to test279 whether a cis-motif cohort is significantly enriched or depleted in members with specific GO functions. Thisanalysis path is especially straightforward and applicablefor relatively large-binding motifs such as those typical ofmany zinc-finger transcription factors. All data is stored transparently in relational form using the cross-platform Sqlite package. Cistematic provides several layers of abstraction, which allow users ofvarying levels of sophistication to customize their uses ofCistematic. Thus, while most users will simply supplylocus identifiers, and thresholds to the experiment classesand receive standard analysis results, some users may wishto use and extend lower-level objects that handle Motifs,Programs, Genomes, and Homology/Annotation mapping. We are further expanding Cistematic by adding native implementations of the greedy, Gibbs sampler, andExpectation Maximization motif finding algorithms thatform the basis of most in silico motif finders used in the field in order to make them available \"out of the box.\" Cistematic currently runs on Mac OS X, Linux, andSolaris, and has a prototype web front-end for userswishing to run Cistematic experiment objects withoutwriting Python scripts. 1Undergraduate, University of California, San Diego, CA 438. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the NRSF/REST target gene networkAli MortazaviWe are investigating the role of a major transcriptional repressor in the evolution of the corresponding vertebrate gene regulatory network (GRN).We are using a combination of computational predictionand direct experimentation to define the genome-wide setof direct targets of the well-known Neuron-RestrictiveSilencer Factor (NRSF/REST), which was originallyidentified as a global repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissues in work in the Anderson lab at Caltech inthe late 80's. It has more recently been shown to repressneuronal genes in stem cells prior to their differentiation.Roles for it have also been suggested in pancreaticdevelopment, cardiac lineages, and lymphocyte lineages, although it is not clear whether these roles differ from repression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissuesduring embryogenesis. NRSF is an ideal model factor fordefining a regulatory network from the trans-factor pointof view, in part because it has a long (21 bp) and relativelywell-defined binding motif. Basic network architecturequestions include: What are all the in vivo targets of NRSF? In what cells are they occupied by the factor andwith what consequences? How has this network evolvedsince its beginnings in the vertebrate lineage? To approach these initial questions, Cistematic (see Mortazavi and Aerni above) was used across human, mouse and dog genomes to leverage evolutionaryconservation to refine the motif model and to locateinstances and their adjacent genes. The majorexperimental tests of sites identified computationally,along with sites of the same size and similar basecomposition that are predicted not to bind NRSF, are ChIPassays (chromatin immunoprecipitation). Initially ~100 predicted sites from the group of ~700 were assayed by Q-PCR. These allowed us to evaluate the predictive successof our model of the human NRSF target repertoire inJurkat cells (Mortazavi et al ., 2006). We are finding similar site occupancy patterns in mouse muscle cells. The composition of the computational target gene set was also interesting because it includes multiple microRNAs andregulators of neuron specific splicing. Among these aremicroRNAs predicted by sequence to be plausibleregulators of NRSF and its Co-Repressor, CoREST,suggesting a dynamic feedback. The perfect conservationof the entire zinc-finger set that comprises the NRSFDNA-binding domain throughout all sequenced vertebratesis striking. Coupled with the absence of any identifiableNRSF transcription factor in all sequenced invertebrates,suggests the notion that the emergence of NRSF in thevertebrates may have been needed to permit \"reuse\" of neuronal genes in non-neuronal, vertebrate-specific regulatory networks. To further test and refine the network of true in vivo NRSE-binding sites and to begin to assess their functional roles, we are working with Dave Johnson andEvonne Thompson in the Myers group to measure theentire global \"NRSFome\" experimentally by usingmicroarray and very high throughput sample sequencing(e.g., Solexa, 454, etc.) for ChIP measurements. We arealso asking how occupancy of different sites varies withcell type and across species and how they relate to expression pattern and promoter methylation on a genome wide basis. Planned perturbation experiments will use cells that express NRSF-derived constructs that are,respectively, dominant activating and dominant negativevariations of the main isoform, plus the naturally occurringtruncated REST4 isoform. Correlates in knockdown ornull stem cells can provide supporting data. 439. Interphylum comparisons of genetic circuits in muscle tissue developmentSteven Gregory Kuntz Understanding the relation of network structure and function in genetic regulatory networks is aided bycomparative analysis across different phyla. Striatedmuscle is an excellent candidate for comparative analysis,being evolutionarily ancient, having striking similaritieswith pulsating muscle, and being prominent in severalmodel organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans extensive genetic and molecular studies, primarily focused onindividual components, we know that numerous musclenetwork components in nematodes, vertebrates, and arthropods are orthologous. It is not known if specific differences in components between the networks perturbthe general network structure or function. In order toconstruct a comprehensive draft map of the striated muscledifferentiation networks of mouse and nematode, acomputational integration of genetic, expression, andprotein-DNA binding data is necessary. Network map280 comparisons will identify variable and conserved components, as well as similarities and differences amongthe regulatory properties. This analysis, critical forunderstanding the relation between the networks, will beused to formulate and test specific hypotheses about thenetwork structure-function relationships. To construct this map for analysis, several techniques will be utilized. Preliminary analyses of cis -regulatory elements of the Hox gene cluster of lin 39 and ceh 13 in C. elegans has demonstrated the utility of computational techniques inefficiently identifying relevant elements for analysis andwill aid in the identification of network components. Toaide in the generation of expression and protein-DNAbinding data, a complete genome tiling of C. elegans is being designed to allow ChIP on chip, as well asexpression on chip analyses. RNAi synthetic lethalscreens for genetic interactions will aide in the generationof genetic data. With a draft map of the regulatory network, perturbation and cross-species studies of key transcriptional regulators, examined by replacing the C. elegans regulators (unc 120, hnd 1 ,hlh 1, and hlh ) with orthologs mouse (MEF2A, SRF, HAND, Myogenin,and Twist), will be assayed to learn about the relationshipof the orthologous and non-orthologous structure andfunctionality. 440. A general cohybridization standard for microarray gene expression measurements using amino-allyl-labeled genomic DNA Richele M. Gwirtz, Brian A. Williams Microarray gene expression data is best exploited when results can be compared and analyzed across manyexperiments within and between laboratories. Thisrequires optimization and adoption of a standard set ofexperimental techniques. Variability in the mass ofhybridizable material deposited on the features of amicroarray is a source of systematic error which must becontrolled before meaningful comparisons betweenexperiments can be made. This is typically done usingratiometric quantitation, in which the labeled cDNAsample is cohybridized to the array in the presence of a differently labeled reference standard. Although ratiometric quantitation is a widely used method for geneexpression measurement on spotted microarrays, there isno consensus about the appropriate material to be used as areference standard. An ideal standard should be relativelyinexpensive and easy to prepare, should provide coverageof all array features at equimolar intensity, and should bebiologically invariant and technically easy to reproduce.We have developed and now refined the simplest and mostcomprehensive possibility, which is genomic DNA. In thiscapacity, genomic DNA provides equimolar coverage of features [Williams et al . Acids Res.; Williams et al . (2006)]. Equimolar representation allows for the direct comparison of abundance levels between features on the same array, because it preservesthe prevalence proportions of individual RNA transcriptspresent in the experimental sample.We improved the convenience and ease of use by adapting an indirect labeling method that allows one tomake and characterize a large batch of labeled genomicDNA standard that can be stored and drawn on over manyexperiments. This indirect labeling method uses amino-allyl dUTP, followed by chemical coupling of the amino- allyl group to a fluorescent moiety. Our data show that this effectively addresses the problems of variation inlabeling efficiency that result from the direct incorporationof fluorescently-labeled nucleotides. It also reducesexperimental risk, since large quantities of the standard canbe prepared in advance and quality tested prior tocommitting precious cDNA samples and microarrays tohybridization. Comparison of intensity measurementsbetween positive hybridization probes (true positives) andnegative control probes (true negatives) shows that thismethod reliably separates their fluorescent intensitiesunder standard hybridization and scanning conditions. The proportion of array features covered by the genomic DNA standard is greater than that covered by commerciallyavailable alternatives, and feature intensity is moreuniform. 441. Microfluidic chaotic mixing devices improve signal to noise ratio in microarray experiments Jian Liu, Brian Williams, Richele Gwirtz,Barbara Wold, Stephen QuakeIn conventional microarray experiments, hybridization of labeled target DNA molecules to sequence-specific probes relies on diffusion in a static hybridization solution volume. During the time intervalfor a conventional microarray experiment, a targetmolecule can be expected to traverse a distance of about1-3 mm. The dimensions of a typical microarray are >10mm, therefore, a large portion of the available labeledtarget does not encounter its cognate sequence probe forspecific hybridization. We have attempted to improve theperformance of microarray hybridization using amicrofluidic chaotic mixing chamber dynamichybridization. We fabricated a two-layerpolydimethylsilicone (PDMS) microfluidic mixing/hybridization chamber and sealed it to a spotted microarray slide. The fluidic layer of the device containstwo symmetric hybridization chambers (6.0 mm x 6.5 mmX 65 microns). They are connected to each other bybridge channels, whose ceiling contains a series ofindentations in a herring-bone pattern, which produceschaotic mixing of the hybridization solution. Fourinput/output through-holes with correspondingmicromechanical valves are used for loading samplesolutions or disposing waste buffers. The valves areactuated to form closed chambers during the circulation of the fluid. Additionally, in the control layer two sets of peristaltic pumps are integrated to move the fluid betweenthe hybridization chambers. Test hybridizations were performed on spotted microarrays 4321 gene-sequence-specific 70mer oligonucleotide probes, with an additional 65randomized sequence 70 mer probes as negative controls.281 Both static and dynamic hybridizations were performed for a 2 hr time interval, and hybridization intensities forpositive probes and negative controls were compared.Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the twoexperiments indicate a much greater separation in thedistribution of positive probe intensities compared to negative control intensities for the dynamic hybridization experiment than for the static experiment (area under theROC curve for dynamic hybridization = 0.92; area forstatic hybridization = 0.73). Experiments are in progressto test the performance of these methods at longerhybridization intervals. The dynamic mixing method hasthe potential to increase the detection sensitivity forconventional spotted microarrays at a relatively low cost.It is compatible with commercially available microarrayslides, and offers the possibility of integration into large-scale nucleic acid sample processing microbial communities, are both ubiquitous and resilient in theenvironment. It is now recognized that many bacteria inthe environment grow as surface-attached microbialbiofilms, and it has been suggested that this biofilmlifestyle may account for the remarkable persistence ofbacterial populations in the face of changingenvironmental conditions. Biofilms are composed of many hundreds to millions of cells, each of which experiences its own microenvironment due to strongchemical gradients that are established by metabolism anddiffusion. Biofilms are therefore heterogeneous andspatially stratified, so that activity levels and biochemicalprocesses occur differentially according to the location of acell in the biofilm and the biofilm structure's biomass. Although much is now known about how biofilms form, develop and detach, very little is understood abouthow these events are related to metabolism and itsdynamics. It is commonly thought that large sub-populations of cells within biofilms are not actively producing proteins or generating energy, and are therefore dead. Early results in this project led us to hypothesizethat within the growth-inactive domains of biofilms,significant populations of living cells persist and that theyretain the capacity to dynamically regulate theirmetabolism. To test this, we employed unstablefluorescent reporters to measure growth activity andprotein synthesis in vivo over the course of biofilm development and created a quantitative routine to comparedomains of activity among independently-grown biofilms.We found that S. oneidensis biofilm structures do indeed reproducibly stratify with respect to growth activity and metabolism as a function of their size. Moreover, withindomains of growth-inactive cells, genes that are typicallyupregulated under anaerobic conditions are expressed wellafter growth has ceased. These findings show that, farfrom being dead, the majority of cells in mature S. oneidensis biofilms have actively turned on metabolicprograms appropriate to their local microenvironment and developmental stage (Teal et al., 2006). This raises a new set of questions concerning the relationship of these cellsin a biofilm to the stationary phase of cells growing inplanktonic culture; the full range of metabolic activitiesperformed by these cells; and the nature of signaling systems that lead to defining this state. *Professor of Geobiology and Biology, Caltech 443. R ole of micro RNA species during cell type differentiationBrian Williams, Richele Gwirtz, Gilberto DeSalvoSpecific gene activation and gene silencing mechanisms play important roles during cell statetransitions that lead to cellular differentiation, includingthe myogenic pathway. At least two aspects of theproblem are likely to involve small regulatory RNAs. Oneis transcriptional repression, where we are especially intrigued by the possibility that a number of zinc-finger regulators may operate either entirely or partly, inrepressing modes. Micro RNAs are 18-25 nucleotidesequences produced from longer RNA hairpin precursormolecules. Although studies of micro RNAs inmammalian systems have lagged behind plant, worm andfly systems, it is increasingly clear that they function intwo major modes in all systems to effect gene silencing.Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is effected byeither destruction of extant messenger RNAs or by controlof translation. Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) involves recruitment of histones and the DNA methylation apparatus to a genetic locus, thereby preventing initiationof transcription. Still other modes of small RNAregulation are beginning to emerge whose mechanism ofaction and importance are less certain. Globally, we areexploring the role of major repressing systems in themyogenic pathway. This branch of the exploration focuseson small RNAs and their relationship to representatives ofthree major types of zinc-finger regulators that are knownat present for their direct association with DNA-bindingsites where they recruit co-repressors and effect shutdownof nearby target genes (the rapidly repressor from Mortazavi). We reasonedthat, since a classic zinc-finger transcription factor (TFIIA)has long been known to interact specifically with bothDNA and RNA targets, this duality may be much morewidespread, and we are testing this idea. We are interestedin the degree to which forms of TGS, which is far betterdocumented in plants, may be operating as part of a majormodulatory network in vertebrate systems. The recent, butstill poorly understood, observation that a small dsRNA version of the binding site for NRSF, is expressed in neural stem cells where it may modulate action of the repressor -or even turn it into an activator - lends impetus to theexploration [Kuwabara (2004) Cell 116:779]. Western blot analysis of protein isolated during a time course of skeletal muscle differentiation in the C2C12mouse skeletal muscle cell line initially focused on four282 factors or cofactors that might engage small RNA substrates Ago4, a member of the Argonauteclass of PAX/PIWI domain proteins that aids in the colocalization of microRNAs with the microRNA processing machinery. We find that all four are presentin C2C12 cells, and exhibit kinetics of expression thatcorrelate (or anti-correlate) with the progress ofdifferentiation. We are using co-immunoprecipitationexperiments from nuclear fractions of C2C12 cells duringdifferentiation, to recover microRNAs with which theymay be specifically associated. In a second related groupof experiments we are testing for the presence andexpression pattern of known and hypothesized microRNAsthat correspond to recognition sequences of interest forthese regulators. 444. Transcriptional regulation of genes underlying skeletal muscle atrophyGilberto Hernandez, Jr.My goal is to identify and then learn the function of components of the transcriptional network controllingmuscle atrophy genes. A major contributor to theprofound proteolysis seen in skeletal muscleatrophy pathway, and two keyE3 ubiquitin this effect. They areMuscle Atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and Muscle RING Finger-1(MuRF-1). Current understanding of the signaling cascade(s) regulating muscle mass have already benefitedfrom the use of MAFbx and MuRF-1 as primary regulatorytargets and molecular effectors However, theexplicit transcriptional regulatory network controllingMAFbx and MuRf-1 remains largely unknown. Byworking from functional cis-regulatory elements, identified partly by their conservation through evolutionand partly by experiment, we aim to define components ofthe transcriptional network underlying skeletal muscleatrophy. In addition, we hope to use these cis-acting regulatory regions, and sequence motifs within them, to identify other genes that share them and are part of the atrophy response gene network. Using comparative genomic sequence analysis, I made a catalog of non-coding, putative cis-regulatory elements for both Mafbx establishedanin vitro atrophy assay, which recapitulates the initial suppression and activation of these genes. Sequencesimilarity analysis and a focus on shared motifs within3'UTR regions has led a focus on specific elements aspredicted target sites for transcription factors binding orfor microRNA interaction. These are presently being tested in more detailed transfection assays to establish which elements, or combinations of elements, are neededto regulate expression of Mafbx and Murf-1.445. CompClust Web, a data analysis tool for array datasetsDiane Trout, Brandon King, Joe RodenThe CompClust environment is a Python computational framework for mining and analyzing large-scale biological dataset. We initially designed it for processing various types of microarray data types such as: two-color, Affymetrix, and ChIP-chip. However, many ofthe tools will also be applicable to other forms of large-scale data. The essential architecture point is thatCompClust provides the ability to attach annotation labelsto arbitrary slices of the array, which are then maintainedthroughout all subsequent transformations and plotsCompClust is capable of. Current effort is focused on extending the utility to a wider group of biologists by developing a web-baseduser interface that rests on top of the original Pythoninterpreter environment and provides access for the less computationally oriented. Once a dataset is loaded and properly annotated CompClust provides rich set ofclustering algorithms and principal component analysis totease apart meaning hidden within the data. The clusteringtools include KMeans, KMedains, EM Diagonal Mixtureof Gaussian, as well as various cross validation algorithmsdesigned to perform arbitrary parameter searches. One ofthe strengths of CompClust is the set of tools it provides tocompare various clusterings through the use of both visualtools like the confusion matrix and quantitative scores likenormalized mutual information and linear assignment. Individual clusters can also be explored with the receiver operator curve tool that shows the overlap of a cluster withits neighboring data points 1. We recently added a significant extension of the previous principal component analysis that enablesautomatically identifying sets of biologically relevantgenes through a combination of principal componentanalysis and information theoretic metrics (Roden et al., 2006). It permits a user to visualize and mine each of theindependent sources of significant variation present ingene array datasets in order to identify the genes mostaffected by specific groups of conditions or tissues and to suggest what underlying factors may be driving the variation. More information about CompClust is availablefrom http://woldlab.caltech.edu/compclust . In addition to the binary builds for Windows and source distributions for Linux and OS X, we also have avariety of documentation and tutorials available. Reference 1.

BioHub Brandon King, Joe RodenThe goal of the BioHub database project is two- fold. The first is to provide our biologists with a tool thatallows them to ask questions of very different kinds oflarge-scale biological data which are tied together based on their spatial relationship to a gene or DNA sequence feature in one or more genomes. The computational goalis to make a rich API (Application Programming Interface)to allow computer scientists to easily write custom large-scale analysis programs, which can then be turned intoweb application or other GUI to allow for easy to uselarge-scale analysis. In it's current form, BioHub is a spatial annotation PostgreSQL database with a Python API for writingapplications. It works by registering sequences(annotations of sequences) in the BioHub core database.Upon registering an annotation at a location on a genome, the user or program receives an SID (Sequence ID) that can later be used as a handle to the 'Registered Sequence'when using the BioHub API. An SID will always be thesame for the exact same location on a genome. Thismeans that if two different programs or people register asequence with the exact same location, both will be giventhe exact same SID. This feature is important because itallows for connection of a wide variety of biological datato associated by simply having the same location on thegenome. For example, if one were to register a sequencethey found in a publication as a 'conserved regulatory motif' and then later a motif finding program finds the exact same motif, they will both have the exact same SID.But they will also have two descriptions and users attachedto the SID, as well. One saying \"found in paper x...\" andthe other \"discovered by motif finding program y.\" Bysimply registering the two sequences, the published motifhas now been connected to all sites in BioHub, and incurrent work the hub is expanding to allow the nextobvious query to recover all expression data associatedwith this custom set of instances. The user has thecapacity, through BioHub, to specify and collect, via SIDs,only those genes associated with motif instances that have a particular positional relationship to your gene models. BioHub was used to design a custom gene chip thatdiscriminates hundreds of related zinc-finger transcriptionfactors in the human genome. These are not wellrepresented with non-crossreacting probes in currentcommercial array collections. 447. Comparative genome analysis over more than three genomes using MUSSA and MUSSAGLTristan De Buysscher, Diane TroutComparative genome analysis, as a routine lab tool for cell and molecular biologists, is becoming increasingly important as the number of fully sequencedgenomes increases. In general, the more genomesincluded in an integrated comparative analysis, the betterthe resolution of functional elements conserved due toselection, versus sequences that are the same by chance.Great evolutionary pressure in such a comparison can alsobe exerted by identifying the very rare elements that are recognizably similar over a single very long distance, suchas human to fish. However, we find that this approach, aswould be expected, is very severe and has the effect ofeliminating many known functional enhancers andpromoters that we want to be able to detect. The availability of many mammalian genome sequences means that we can get evolutionary leverage by integrating overlarger numbers of genomes each of which is individuallynot so distant from the reference mouse or human genome.Once these basic comparisons are made we want to relatedomains of sequence conservation to each other, ask ifthey have shared internal elements, and map additionalfeatures such as small transcription factor-binding motifs,regulatory RNA interaction motifs, etc. MUSSA (multiplesequence similarity assignment software) is an interactiveviewer that was designed to do analysis of this kind, at thelevel ~100 kb regions for N genomes, rather than for two or three. It uses a transitivity-filtering algorithm to integrate sequence similarities over the entire collection ofgenomes being compared. The underlying sequencesimilarity mapping was done with a classic sliding windowmethod, implemented as it was for the earlier FR projectwith the Eric Davidson lab. MUSSA interactivity featurespermit inspection of the analysis at varying levels ofresolution, recovery of specific sequence regions forfurther external analysis, and user-driven integration ofconserved sequence domains with maps of sequencemotifs such as transcription factor-binding sites or gene model annotations. MUSSA analysis has been done on multiple worm genome sequences with Erich Schwarz andPaul Sternberg and Steven Kuntz, and on several genes ofinterest in the myogenic regulatory network from varyingnumbers of mammalian genomes. These comparisonshighlight both known and new candidate sequencedomains and candidate factor-binding motifs within thosedomains. Experimental tests for regulatory function intransgenic assays are underway and a majority ofnoncoding conserved elements from the lin39-ceh13 Hoxlocus are proving to be active. MUSSA is available fromthe Wold website. 448. A PCA-based way to mine large microarray datasetsJoe Roden, Chris Hart, Brandon King, DianeTroutIn many instances where large-scale microarray analysis is part of a project, the biologically important goalis to identify relatively small sets of genes that sharecoherent expression across only some conditions, ratherthan all or most conditions, which is what traditionalclustering algorithms find. The PCA (principle components analysis)-based tool developed in this project performs a complementary kind of datamining that helpsone identify groups of genes that are highly upregulatedand/or down-regulated similarly, across only a subset ofconditions. Equally important is the need to learn whichconditions are the decisive ones in forming such gene setsof interest, and how they relate to diverse conditional284 covariates, such as disease diagnosis or prognosis. This is a nontraditional use of PCA, and the software tools fordoing it will be accessible from the group website. Themethod is described in a recent paper (Roden et al., 2006) and the software is openly available at the Wold groupwebsite. Publications Hart, C.E., Sharenbroich, L., Bornstein, Wold, B.J.

The power of flowcytometry is its ability to analyze, at high speed, lightscatter and fluorescent properties of heterogeneouspopulations of suspended particles such as cells, micro-organisms, and/or beads. These measurements arecorrelated on a single-particle basis to yield bothqualitative and quantitative information, and statisticalpopulation characteristics are revealed for all componentsof the sample. In addition, the particles can be sterilely sorted based on their individual characteristics into tubes or multi-well plates of several configurations. Becausefluorescence can be used as a quantitative indicator ofmany different molecular and cellular properties, thistechnology is a multifaceted tool that can be used to studymany aspects of cell biology including cell cycle,physiological function, and membrane antigen phenotype.It has direct use in immunological, neurobiological, anddevelopmental systems to define and isolate cellpopulations of interest. Some examples are: isolation oftransfectants that exhibit reporter gene expression that can be correlated with other desired properties; real-time measurements of physiological responses in cells such asion usage; quantitation of cell death; isolation analyses; and single-cell cloning by direct celldeposition. This Facility is different from most cell sorting facilities in medical schools throughout the United Statesbecause of the unconventionality of the applications itsupports. A relatively small fraction of the Caltech usergroups employ the facility for separation of immunesystem cells, which is by far the most common use of flow cytometric technology. These currently include the Baltimore, Patterson, and Rothenberg groups. Other usersfocus on nonmammalian or nonhematopoietic cells, and/orthe fluorescent detection of novel compounds andbiological indicators. For example, the David Andersonlab uses the facility regularly for mammalian cell work,but for developmental neurobiology and endothelialpatterning studies. The Elowitz lab uses the facility toselect bacteria with heritable variability in geneexpression; the Smolke lab uses it to study induciblepromoter networks and control of RNA splicing in yeast. The Campbell group uses the facility to determine the roles of genes in particular aspects of the yeast cell cycle. TheTirrell lab is using the facility to develop methods forimaging newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells,and to select E. coli expressing tRNAs that accept non- natural amino acids. A collaborator at USC, Dr. Bottini,has used the facility to screen fluorescent probes for invivo activity of particular protein tyrosine phosphatases. The Sessions group has used the facility to isolate bacteriaand eukaryotic microbes from environmental samples forisotopic composition analysis. The Dervan group has usedthe facility to measure functional impacts ofDNA-targeting pyrrole-imidazole polyamide-chlorambucil compounds, while the Barton group is using it to study uptake of ruthenium(II) dipyridophenazine into cells andnuclei. Many of these unconventional applications haverequired special system modifications or de novo protocol design, which have been aided through the uniqueconsultation and application development services that ourfacility provides. The facility is well equipped with two sorters, two analyzers, and a workstation. Our newest sorter, the BDFACSAria, is an industry-leading instrument that analyzesover ten colors of fluorescence with all-digital signalprocessing and sorts up to four populations in parallel at high speed with minimal phototoxic damage to the cells. The FACSVantage SE is a consistent full-featured sorterthat can sort up to 3000 cells per second and detect up tosix colors. An older, non-sorting Beckman Coulter Elitethat can analyze up to three colors is excellent for cellcycle work. The non-sorting BD FACSCalibur cananalyze four colors and is available to researchers aroundthe clock, provided that the investigators havedemonstrated competence with the analyzer or taketraining provided by the facility. In addition the facilityprovides a 10 client site license for Treestar's FlowJo off- line analysis for users of the facility . This past year, the facility has serviced 23 research groups spanning over 50 researchers from theBiology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, andGeobiology Divisions. Facility operator Stephanie Adamsleft in spring of 2006 to enroll in a prestigious Ph.D.program, and Diana Perez has capably stepped into herplace.

Mouse Colony Manager : Jennifer Alex, A.A., RLATG In June 2005, the Genetically Altered Mouse Core and the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources,(OLAR) combined to form the Caltech Laboratory AnimalServices, (CLAS). CLAS consists of two subdivisions,OLAR, which is headed by Dr. Janet Baer and GeneticallyEngineered Mouse Services (GEMs) that is headed byShirley Pease. The purpose of the merger was to refine,streamline and standardize procedures for laboratoryanimal care and use on campus. GEMs continues toprovide microinjection, cryo-preservation, re-derivation and tissue culture services. In addition, we offer services in the form of rodent colony management and use, whererequired, in all animal Facilities. Gene addition in the mammalian system is accomplished by injecting DNA into the pronucleus of afertilized egg (Gordon et al, 1980). This is a non-targeted event. Targeted disruption of specific genes, however,requires the manipulation of pluripotent embryonic stem(ES) cells in vitro and their subsequent return to the embryonic environment for incorporation into thedeveloping embryo (Zijlstra et al , 1989). The resulting chimeric mouse born is useful for two purposes: 1) it is comprised of tissue from two sources, the host embryo andthe manipulated stem cells. More importantly, 2) it can bemated to produce descendants that are entirely transgenic,resulting from the ES cell contribution to the germline ofthe chimeric mouse. The facility, in collaboration withAnderson, Baltimore, Kennedy, Lester, Patterson,Rothenberg, Simon, Varshavsky and Wold laboratories,has generated multiple transgenic, knockout and knockinmouse strains, amounting to nearly 160 mouse strains.More recently, the Facility together with the Baltimore lab,participated in the development of a new method for the introduction of DNA into early-stage embryos (Lois, et al., 2002). This method makes use of non-recombinantlentivirus as a vector for the introduction of DNA into one-cell embryos. The method has proven to be highlyefficient and promises to be useful for studies in mice andrats, where large numbers of constructs need to be tested.This new methodology also makes feasible the generationof transgenic animals in species that were hithertoimpractical to work with, due to the very low numbers ofembryos available for use. Since the lentiviral vectormethod was established, 79 transient or established mouse models have been generated by this means, together with one Tg rat model. Facility staff has performed all embryomanipulation involved in the production of these newlines. Microinjection equipment has been set up within the mouse facility, which operates on restricted access aspart of a barrier system designed to safeguard themicrobiological status of the animals. A room outside the facility has been allocated by the Division to be usedprimarily for teaching graduate students, technicians andpostdocs the techniques involved in transgenic mouseproduction. This room has been operating since July 1996.Investigators have the option of using this room to perform their own microinjection of embryos, rather than using the full technical service available from the GeneticallyEngineered Mouse services. At the merger, a new position was created, that of Colony Manager. An experienced technician has beenappointed to the post and is available now to assistinvestigators with all colony management questions,primarily assisting investigators in making sure theirexperimental needs are met as economically as possible. In tissue culture and the use of embryonic stem (ES) cells, the Facility participated in the derivation of newES cell lines derived from genetically altered mice (see Simon laboratory Annual Report, 2001). Several investigators are using these pluripotent cells in researchthat involves pushing the cells down specificdevelopmental pathways, and also to investigate theincorporation of extraordinarily large pieces of DNA intothe mouse genome. Last year, we acquired several newembryonic stem cell lines, including a hybrid cell line, andtwo C57BL/6 derived lines. We have tested the efficiencyof one of the C57BL/6 ES cells lines and find that we canobtain germline transmission with these cells afterelectroporation and selection. Before the end of the year, we will electroporate our two C57BL/6 ES cell lines side by side, to determine which will give the best results,before making these cells available to all investigators.C57BL/6 ES cells provide a significant advantage in thatthe mutation will be established initially on this wellunderstood genetic background, instead of undertaking atwo-year breeding program to reach the same point, havinginitially established the mutation on a sub-optimal geneticbackground. Hybrid ES cells may be useful for theirreported vigor. Once a new mouse model has been characterized, it may be cryopreserved, or sent to the Mutant Mouse Resource Center, to be made available to the research community in general. We currently have 84 mousemodels cryopreserved. For each line, between 200 and500 embryos at 8-cell stage have been preserved in liquidnitrogen. There are currently 26,033 embryos frozen intotal. We shall continue to preserve embryos from mousestrains. The advantages of such a resource are many.Unique and valuable mouse strains that are currently not inuse may be stored economically. In the event that geneticdrift should affect any strain, over time, then the option toreturn to the original documented genetic material is available. Lastly, in the event of a microbiological or genetic contamination occurring within the mouse facility,we have the resources to set up clean and geneticallyreliable mouse stocks in an alternative location. In the coming year, Facility staff will be receiving training on the culture of human embryonic stem cells.290 Presently, eleven principal investigators and their postdoctoral fellows or graduate students use GEMs services. In addition to the maintenance of nearly 100different targeted and non-targeted strains, we alsomaintain colonies of inbred and outbred animals, which areused to support the development of new lines, by investigators at Caltech. We also have many mouse models on both an inbred and an outbred background, plusintercrosses between two or three different but relatedmouse models. In total, we currently maintain nearly 200separate strains of mouse. Some of these strains areimmune deficient and require specialized care, althoughnot pathogenic, to protect them from bacteria commonlypresent in immune-competent animals. In immune-deficient animals, these hitherto harmless organisms cancause a problem. This may interfere with the well being ofthe animal and the extraction of reliable experimentalresults. Listed below are the names of the eleven principal investigators and their postdoctoral fellows or graduatestudents who are presently using the transgenic facility.

Nature Millard Joanne Tan-Cabugao Support: The work described in the following reports has been supported by: Muriel and Millard Jacobs Fund for Genomics and Genetic Technology Millard and Muriel Jacobs Family Foundation National Science Foundation Summary: The goal of the Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics Laboratory, in the Division of Biology, is to provide a suite of cutting edge genomicresearch tools to all interested Caltech scientists, with aninitial emphasis on large-scale gene expression profiling. The Laboratory performs gene expression analyses using DNA microarray technology, and is equipped with thenecessary experimental and bioinformatics infrastructurethat is needed to generate, store, and analyze large-scaledatasets from a variety of microarray technologicalplatforms. In addition to the broad mission of the Laboratory, we are interested in the analysis of regulatorynetworks in Arabidopsis using genomic technologies, in particular those networks that are related to flowerdevelopment. An important, but only relatively recently characterized, class of regulatory molecules in animals and plants are microRNAs (miRNAs): small non-coding RNAs(~20-24 nt in length) that regulate gene expression in asequence-specific manner by targeting mRNAs forcleavage or translational repression. We are usinggenomic technologies (such as DNA microarrays) tocharacterize the Arabidopsis complement of microRNAs and its participation in floral development processes. Infrastructure and capabilities: The laboratory is equipped with the instrumentationnecessary to manufacture microarrays and to use commercial Affymetrix GeneChips. Available equipment in the laboratory includes a MicroGrid II arrayer(BioRobotics), a GenePix 4200A scanner (MolecularDevices/Axon Instruments), system(LightCycler 480, from Roche) has recently been added tothe laboratory. A more comprehensive description of thelaboratory infrastructure is available at:http://mmjggl.caltech.edu/. The MicroGrid II arrayer allows us to produce large numbers of microarray slides in a cost effectivemanner, and to produce customized microarrays for whichthere is no equivalent commercial counterpart available.For example, we produce whole genome Arabidopsis microarrays using 70-mer oligonucleotide sets fromOperon, which are used in various research projects relatedto flower development (work performed together withProfessor E.M. Meyerowitz's group). Customcarbohydrate microarrays are used to studyglycosaminoglycan-protein interactions (Professor LindaHsieh-Wilson, Division of Chemistry). MicroRNAmicroarrays have been produced for mouse (Professor David Baltimore) and Arabidopsis (see below). Other customized microarrays include yeast intergenic chips (Professor Judith Campbell), and microarrays printed withCy3-labeled probes, which are used to study the dynamicsof DNA hybridization in real time (Professor BabakHassibi, Division of Engineering and Applied Science). The laboratory is equipped to use the latest generation of Affymetrix GeneChips. Among the researchgroups at Caltech that have benefited from that technologythis past year are those of Professors David Anderson,David Baltimore, Seymour Benzer, Marianne Bronner-Fraser, Peter Dervan, Henry Lester, Paul Patterson, Ellen Rothenberg, and Alex Varshavsky. The laboratory uses Resolver (from Rosetta Biosoftware) as its primary gene expression data analysis system. Resolver is a robust, enterprise-scale, geneexpression system that combines a high capacity, MAGE-compliant database and advanced analysis software in ahigh-performance server framework. The system isaccessible through client stations using a web-basedinterface. We also have at our disposal additionalmicroarray software tools and analysis packages, bothpublic and commercial. The hardware infrastructure of the laboratory currently includes a Sun Fire V880 server (from Sun Microsystems), that we use for the Resolver database(Oracle) and analysis system. 449. Genomic analyses Arabidopsis miRNAs: roles in flower development Brandon King, Vijaya Rao, Lorian Schaeffer, Patrick Sieber 1, Joanne Tan Cabugao, Jos\u00e9 Luis RiechmannThe focus of this project is to characterize the functions of the Arabidopsis complement of microRNAs (miRNAs), and to identify the gene regulatory networks in which they may participate - in particular during flower development, by using microarray analysis of miRNAexpression and other genomic approaches. MicroRNAsare small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expressionin a sequence-specific manner, and they have emerged as avery important class of regulatory molecules in plants andin metazoans. In Arabidopsis, more than 100 miRNAs have already been detected and/or predicted, and theArabidopsis genome may in fact contain several hundred distinct miRNA loci - a number that demands thedevelopment of high-throughput methodologies for their study. We are revising, and extending, the computational identification of Arabidopsis microRNAs. We are also developing a microarray platform for miRNA expression detection, which will be used (together with our standardgene expression microarrays) to conduct miRNAexpression profiling experiments aimed at understanding292 the roles of miRNAs during flower development, at gaining experimental evidence for predicted miRNAs, andat identifying miRNA targets. We have initiated the firstround of experiments on miRNA expression profiling bygrowing the first cohorts of plants and purifying samplesof small RNAs, and we are preparing a variety of additional Arabidopsis transgenic and mutant lines. 1Postdoctoral Scholar, Division of Biology, Caltech (Meyerowitz laboratory) Publications Riechmann, J.L.

We also produce polyclonal ascites Abs byimmunizing mice with antigen until the serum titer is highenough, then inducing the mice with sarcoma high polyclonal ascites fluid per mouse byusing small amount of antigen. In addition to these servicefunctions, the Facility also conducts research on thedevelopment of novel immunological techniques. In its service capacity, the Facility produced Mabs for the following groups during the past year. The Hill lab (UCLA) obtained mAbs against full-length recombinant trypanin, which is essential for cell African Trypanosome.

Mathog The Sequence Analysis Facility (SAF) provides software, computers, and support for the analysis of nucleic acid and protein sequences. Currently the SAF hardware consists ofa Sun Netra running Solaris, a small 20 node Beowulfcluster, a file server, a 26 ppm duplexing laser printer, anda 16 ppm duplexing color laser printer. The PCs thatcomprise the \"structure analysis facility\" are also located inour facility. The SAF has over 250 registered usersdistributed among 50 research groups. Most common programs for sequence analysis are available on the primary server http://saf.bio.caltech.edu/.These include the GCG and EMBOSS Packages,PRIMER3, Phred, Phrap, Cross Match, Phylip, and HMMER. Many of these may be accessed through the W2H or Pise web interfaces. Other programs, customwritten programs, or special databases are available onrequest. The PCs support hardware stereo under bothLinux and Windows XP. Under Linux the programs O,Molscript, XtalView, CCP4, and Delphi are available.Under Windows XP Swiss PDB Viewer, O, PyMol,POVray, and various drawing and animation programsmay be used. The searchable documentation for theseprograms is available on the SAF web server. The lecturenotes and homework from the introductory course \"Fundamentals of Sequence Analysis\" are also available on the SAF web server. BLAST jobs submitted throughthe SAF web interface run on the SAF Beowulf cluster (inparallel) faster than they do at the NCBI server. Personalsequence databases of up to 50 Mb may now be searchedlocally. An enhanced parallel HHMER server offers thefull set of HMMER programs plus the unique ability tosearch any of the installed BLAST databases with anHMM. Traces and sequences from the DNA sequencing facility may be analyzed on or downloaded from ourserver. The SAF also distributes site-licensed software for PCs and Macs like DNASTAR, Gene Construction Kit, ChemSketch, and X-Win.295 Protein Expression Center (http://www.its.caltech.edu/~pec)Director : Jost Vielmetter Staff : Inderjit Nangiana Staff : Chris Fogelsong Supervisors : Pamela J. Bjorkman, Barbara Wold The Protein Expression Center was established in 1996 to meet the needs of the Caltech community for proteinexpression and purification. The services includedexpression of recombinant proteins in a variety ofexpression systems and purification of the expressedproteins. To date, the majority of recombinant proteinsthat have been produced at the Center have been expressedin the insect cell/baculovirus system, which is the mostwidely used and versatile eukaryotic system for thegeneration of recombinant proteins. This system has anumber of benefits over other expression systems including the preservation of many glycosylation and other post-translational modifications that are important forprotein function. Since its inception, the Center hasgenerated over 900 recombinant viruses and has generatedan average of 300 liters of infected viral cells per year. More recently the need to use additional expression systems has brought mammalian expressionsystems into focus. To overcome limitations of thebaculovirus system, particularly in cases where properglycosylation of the Fc-portions of antibodies is required,transient expression in HEK-293 cells is an excellent alternative. We are currently validating two cell lines HEK293T and HEK293EBNA mostly for engineeredantibody expression in the context of the \"EngineeringImmunity\" program and have successfully expressed ananti-HIV antibody. Both cell lines have also been usedsuccessfully for transient expression of many differentmammalian proteins. Protein Expression, Purification, and Applications Involving Recombinant ProteinsA number of the recombinant proteins that have beenexpressed have also been purified by the facility staff over last years. The purification methodology has ranged from affinity chromatography to ion exchange or size exclusionchromatography, or a combination of these. The proteinsthat have been expressed and purified are diverse in theirbiochemical and functional characteristics, ranging fromnuclear proteins involved in DNA replication to cellsurface proteins mediating cell-cell interactions. Proteinsexpressed and/or purified by the Protein Expression Centerhave been used for a variety of experiments orapplications. Some have been used as immunogens for thegeneration of antibodies, or to study or utilize their functional activity. In other projects, the Center has generated up to 30 different variants of a protein in orderto allow investigators to do an exhaustive site-directedmutagenesis study to map a binding site. Many otherproteins have been used in crystallization trials to solvetheir three-dimensional structures, resulting in thedetermination of several crystal structures by the Bjorkman laboratory. Utilization of facilities: The utilization of the various services the Protein Expression Center has provided duringthe past year are summarized in the following list: ServiceVolume/orders completed Baculovirus generation 135 Generation of high titer baculovirusstock 34 Liters Baculovirus titer determination 23 Baculovirus plaque purification 4 Baculovirus protein expression andprotein characterization 255 Liters Protein purification 17 During that period the Center has provided services for thefollowing Caltech investigators: David J.

High mass accuracy andpre-selected masses in acquisition method enable us to selectively pick up expected peptides for MS/MS fragmentation during LC/MS run. Similar approach wasalso applied to detect peptides with two differentalkylations on cysteine residues in the peptide mixtures forVarshavsky's group. Some protein identification work was done for samples in gel pieces from groups of Simon and Parker, with just nearthe threshold of our instrument sensitivity to identify thoseproteins. Increased sensitivity by adding heated chamberon EIS ion source of Q-Tof would improve the work. API 365 quadrupole ESI mass spectrometer has higher interface pressure (more collisions) than Q-Tof. Coolerinterface of Q-Tof tends to produce more multiply-chargedion peaks of large proteins. So higher mass accuracy,higher sensitivity and more multiply-charged ion peaks fordeconvelotion of ESI Q-Tof MS make it better instrumentfor mass spec analyses of large proteins. This applicationgreatly improved the protein analyses for groups of Mayo,Gray and Winkler, with mass accuracy of +/- 1 Dalton for proteins of MW up to 20 kDa. Application of negative-ion electrospray ionization in non- aqueous solvent enables us to analyze sulfatedcarbohydrates from Dr. Hsieh's group. Metal complexes from Barton's group were also analyzed in positive ion mode.Our homemade, easily replaceable set-up for sample infusion and spray tip makes our ESI source feasible toanalyze crude reaction products of organic compoundsfrom groups of Barton, Dougherty, Grubbs, Dervan, Hsieh,Fraser, Tirrell and Peters. Throughput and Interactions During the first seven months of fiscal 2005 PPMALinteracted with 25 laboratories. Samples were analyzed from the Division of Biology, and Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (see list). A total of 1634 sampleswere analyzed. In addition to our work for campus facultyand staff, work was also performed for Nanogen, Geron,UCLA and Xencor (46 samples analyzed). Mass Spectrometry In seven months, 1,531 proteins, peptides,oligonucleotides, and carbohydrates, small organiccompounds have been analyzed. This extrapolates to anannual throughput of over 2,600. Our off-campus activity recorded 26 samples. Proteomics For the period covering this report, 85 digests had beenanalyzed. This amount is over twice of last year's duringthe same period. This extrapolates to an annual throughputof 130 samples. Protein and Peptide Sequence Analysis The lab has sequenced proteins and peptides for 146cycles, a 37% decrease over the same period last year. The average number of residues per sample rose from six to eight.298 List of Facility Users and Activity October 2005 - April 2006 On-Campus Name # Samples # Mass # Protein ID # Sequences # Cycles # HPLC Barton 534 525 9 Bjorkman 1 1 6 D.
