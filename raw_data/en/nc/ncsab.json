As with other ancient healing arts, its practitioners have tried to defend the utility of herb poultices and tree bark against the cruel skepticism of Western medicine. As one guru in the film, Brahmanand Swamigal puts it, he is happy to work with allopathic (Western) doctors, so long as he is treated as an equal. And there's the rub. Although filmmaker Pan Nalin is a believer in Ayurveda,there is little in the film to convince anybody else. It consists mostly of letting the gurus and swamis talk, often while administering treatment. No hard questions are asked, and the only Western-trained doctor who appears in the show, Scott Gerson, is the head of the National Institute of Ayurvedic Medicine in New York. So the viewer is left alone to decide what is credible and what isn't. Ayurveda holds that health comes from balance among three fundamental bodily energies called Vata, Pitta and Kapha,which emerge from the five elements of air, fire, water, earth and space. \"Space\" is a surprising element, consisting as it does of an absence, but Ayurveda is closely allied to the remarkably subtleties of Indian philosophy. One guru in the film even suggests that no practitioner is worthwhile unless they develop a \"nuanced\" view of their art. To me it is all reminiscent of the bodily \"humours\" of premodern European medicine. Like Ayurveda,the old European healers talked in mystical terms but effected real cures through accumulated knowledge of medicinal herbs. However, modern medicine relegated the \"humours\" to a historical footnote, and certainly the system has no believers today. Ayurveda is more tenacious. Typically, a middle-class Indian goes to an ayurvedic healer only after Western medicine has failed. The healers, with admirable flexibility, ask to see the Western diagnosis and even send people back to the hospital for further testing after they get ayurvedic treatment. One healer, dressed in a dhoti and with the healer's emblematic streak of white paint across his forehead, noted with satisfaction that his patient's white-blood cell count had dropped from 200,000 to 119,000 units and with further ayurvedic treatment would reach a normal range of 5,000 to 10,000 units in 30 days. The healer, of course, certainly can't do those tests himself, and it's moot how much he actually understands about white blood cells. There's no doubt a lot of knowledge can accumulate over 4,000 years, and that Ayurveda was the first medical system to distinguish pediatric, obstetrical, opthalamological and toxicologic specialties. In one astonishing scene, a healer is able to paralyze a goat by touching a nerve ending, and then unparalyze it by touching another. I can believe these healers know things about the nervous system that Dr. Joe down at the walk-in clinic doesn't. But the healers seen in the film resolutely refuse to use microscopes, and refuse even to contemplate surgery. Their attachment to unchanging methods has a quasi-religious intensity. One of them reverently fingers a sheaf of 500-year-old palm leaves inscribed with medical procedures he follows and teaches. This makes for some very moving documentary footage. We see a small child born with crooked legs being arranged in a truss made of knotted rags, her legs tied into position while being massaged with a herbal paste. After some months of this treatment her legs are straight and she walks for the first time. But what does this prove exactly? Did Ayurveda accomplish something Western medicine could not? Or is it simply that Ayurveda has unpaid workers available to massage a child's limbs for hours each day? Pan Nalin's answer is: Have faith. Gerson, the American ayurvedic doctor, points out sensibly enough that most of Western medicine treats diseases created by overconsumption. If Ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating, sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation, it is clearly a good thing. But that doesn't make it a medical system. It is perhaps enough that it is what the film calls it, \"the "}
