It is a way of gently coaxing healing from the body, by helping the body to listen to itself. While acupuncture is one of the pillars of Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, dietary habits and the influences of foods, movement and postural practices, and a vital blend of ancient physiology along with a keen observational eye for how multiple systems work together all are aspects of Chinese medicine that we will discuss here on Everyday Acupuncture. So in addition to acupuncture we will touch on those wider aspects of Chinese medicine. And even some aspects of modern medicine as they relate to the ancient Chinese wisdom about health and well-being.Copyright \u00a9 Everyday Acupuncture Podcast [Show more Show less] - Jan 12 2023 Real Mushrooms 25% Off Your First Order! I'm Mary Beth Huwe, my husband Brian, and I run Huwe Acupuncture, an acupuncture and herbal medicine clinic in a super tiny town in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. We are often asked, what does acupuncture treat? And we explain it in this way. Acupuncture treats people not diseases. That means no matter who you are or what you're suffering from, acupuncture is an option for you, not just an alternative or a last ditch. But an actual, serious, thoughtful medicine. We've helped people aged one month to 92 years with conditions such as fatigue, headaches, menstrual problems, joint injuries, and pain, H I V, digestive complaints, back aches, earaches, nose bleeds, nightmares, constipation, anxiety, cancer, insomnia, nausea, brain injury, neuropathy, pregnancy, depression, lupus, diabetes, and smoking. And each of those individuals, Individualized care. That's because effective acupuncture is specifically tailored for an individual at a certain place in time. For example, if five people came to me today for treatment of headaches, they would not all receive the same treatment. , each individual's point prescription would depend upon the very detailed picture of pathology, the location of the headache, the type of pain, the time at which it occurs, the triggers, the pulse picture, the tongue. Each of these components is significant, both in its own right and in relationship to the other components. Furthermore, if those same five people with headaches came again next week, they would not receive the same points they received today. I reevaluate each individual each time, and though I may keep the treatment targeted toward the same general channels, I won't necessarily do so. Of course, we cannot legally guarantee a cure, and we wouldn't want to make such a claim even if we could. What we do put forward is that even if acupuncture doesn't cure your disease, save your life, or remove your symptoms, it will very likely change the way you feel about your disease life and symptoms. And this way, acupuncture greatly and profoundly reduces suffering. Some people wonder is acupuncture for. . The short answer is yes. Acupuncture is for anyone who wants it. Maybe you're in the best shape of your life, or maybe you feel like you're falling through the cracks of modern healthcare. Maybe you don't notice your body unless it's hurting you. Maybe you have a vague sense that something is lacking in your health, or maybe you're very sick. Acupuncture is multidimensional. It has something to offer every one of those maybes because it is a medicine that takes the full constellation of the individual of you into account.

I'm Michael Max from Yong Kang Chinese Medicine Clinic in St Louis, MO. And today I'm here to answer the question.... Will one session of acupuncture fix my problem? this is common question. And it shines a light on our magical thinking about acupuncture. That it's either magic or mumbo jumbo, or a wing and prayer attempt at stepping out of the box of convention and maybe getting lucky. One of the problems with acupuncture is that there are times people indeed do get dramatic relief from a single treatment. And so acupuncture gets a reputation as being magically effective. But for the most part we have to grow into our health, the same way we grew into our illnesses....over time. One of the curious things I noticed from practicing acupuncture that often people have a big change in how they feel after a treatment, and then the next time they come in the request is--- \"whatever you did last time, do that again.\" Which almost never brings a satisfiying result, because it's impossible to do what we did last time. And the reason for that is you're no longer the same as you were last time. Things are already different. There's that phrase about you can't step in the same river twice, because the river is in constant motion and so are we. The trick, if there is a trick, is to see what would be helpful in this moment, and our \"this moment\"....that's always changing. I suppose if we were machines then we could be fixed with a particular acupuncture protocol, like changing out the oxygen sensor or brake pads on a car. But, we are biological beings. it's more complicated. And if you've got any sort of complex issue, you already know what I'm getting at here. Things take time. Baking bread, raising children, growing orchids, developing in your career, or learning a new skill. As you likely already know, our health and wellbeing is the result of what we do over time. It helps to be realistic. So, it's unlikely that acupuncture will be a one and done proposition. Just like eating well for a week is not going to change how your clothes fit. But if acupuncture is something you've been thinking about and want to give a try, then to give it a fair trial... plan on a series of 4-6 treatments. Within that time time, you'll get a sense of how it might be helpful for you. As ever, judge by the results you get. To give acupuncture a try, contact your local licensed Acupuncturist.

This is Dr. Neal Sivula. I'm a veterinarian and owner of Dancing Paws Animal Wellness Center, a holistic veterinary practice located in beautiful Richfield, Ohio. Today I'll answer the question- \"I love acupuncture for myself, can I get it for my pet?\" Of course, you can! The basic acupuncture certification program for Veterinarians in the United States is a post-graduate course, usually around 200 hours in length. We learn Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, acupuncture point locations, case management, and in some courses, students study herbal medicine as well. Some courses only teach TCM, others teach a combination of TCM and Medical Acupuncture, and some teach Medical Acupuncture exclusively. All courses offer a certification examination upon completion of the course and most require internship hours with a certified doctor and the submission of a few case reports to verify that the candidate can think logically through an acupuncture case. Like our human acupuncture colleagues, the basic training is only the start of our journey in acupuncture. Our certifications require that we participate in approved continuing education courses in acupuncture. These range in topic from refresher courses on basic acupuncture theory all the way to instruction in other techniques like the Balance Method or Scalp Acupuncture, or in other philosophies like Classical Chinese Medicine. Certification is just a jumping off point for every acupuncturist I know, continual education makes us better acupuncturists. Once trained, veterinarians use acupuncture in all sorts of ways in their practice. I am fortunate in that I am able to limit my practice to holistic medicine, while other doctors may offer acupuncture as something that they provide alongside their allopathic services. So how should one find an acupuncturist for their pet? That can be a little complicated, as we don't have a centralized database for all veterinary acupuncturists. Resources that provide practitioner location services include the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, the American Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture, Chi University, Curacore Academy, the Canine Rehabilitation Institute, and the College of Integrative Veterinary Therapies. Of course, doctors that are seeking acupuncture patients will have that service listed on their practice websites as well. If you're interested in hearing more about holistic veterinary medicine, I host \"The Integrative Veterinarian\" podcast where I have conversations with veterinarians and discuss their training and their lives as holistic practitioners. Acupuncture is as powerful in our animal friends as it is in humans, so don't forget to consider acupuncture when thinking about your pet's health!
