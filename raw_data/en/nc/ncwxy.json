It is caused by the Varicella zo ster virus which is spread from person to person direct contact, droplet, or airborne sp read of respiratory secretions from an infected person. It is usually a benign disease but can be associat ed with serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, Reye's syndrome, and / or death. It is ordina rily a more serious disease of adults and children. Past infecti on provides immunity; s econd attacks are very rare. In some persons the virus may appear years later as Herpes zoster (shingles), particularly in older adults. VARIVAX is a live, attenuated varicella viru s vaccine which is given by subcutaneous injection. In clinical trials, the vaccine induced measurable immune responses in a high proportion of individuals and was generally well tolerated by healthy persons from 12 months to 55 years of age. The majority of people who received the vaccine and then were exposed to chicken pox were either co mpletely protected or developed a milder form of the disease. This represents an approximate 70% reduction in transmission compared to unvaccinated persons exposed to a household contact with chickenpox. SIDE EFFECTS : VARIVAX is indicated for vaccina tion against varicella in indi viduals 12 months of age and older. The most frequently reported side effects during clinical trials were pain, redness, and/ or swelling at the injection site ; fever has also been reported. A chickenpox- like rash occurring at the injection site was re ported from 4% of vacci ne recipients in one study. A similar percentage reported a generalized varicella-like rash. Reported by less than 1% of vaccine recipi ents were upper respiratory symptoms: (cough, irritability / nervousness, fatigue, gastroin testinal symptoms, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pa in, headache, malaise, hives, and a stiff neck.) Whether these reports were directly related to the vaccine has not been determined. DOSAGE : Adults aged 13 years and older should r eceive one 0.5ml dose given by subcutaneous injection; then receiv e a second identical dose 4 to 8 weeks later. PRECAUTIONS: It is not known whether Varivax gi ven immediately after exposure to varicella will prevent disease. After receiving Varivax, any Im mune Globulin including VZIG should not be given for 2 months. Vaccine recipients should avoid the use of SALICYLATES (aspirin and aspirin containing products) for 6 weeks after vaccination because Reye's syndrome has been reported after using aspirin during natural varicella infection. Vaccine recipients may potentially be capable of transmitting the vaccine virus to close contacts; therefore the recipient should avoid close contact with susceptible high risk individuals (newborns, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons.) Vaccine recipients should report any adverse reactions to their health care providers. PREGNANCY: The possible effects of the vaccine on fe tal development are unknown at present. However, natural infection with varicella is known to sometimes cause fatal harm. Varivax should not be administ ered to pregnant women. Pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months after vaccination. Varivax should not be administered to a nursing mother unless advised by a physician.
