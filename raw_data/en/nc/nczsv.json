In 3 VC we performed a [skin] [biopsy]24h RNAseq]of less to 39 weeks after [vaccination]compared to VC but [similar]ELIPSOT responses. [ELISPOT]was positive in 33.3 % and 66.6 % and IDR in 62.5% and 90.5% of seronegative vs seropositive had significantly lower [T cell]responses and [IgG]titers than those with positive IDR. Importantly, the TCR repertoire of infiltrating [skin] [lymphocytes]revealed 18/1064 clonotypes with known specificities against [SARS-CoV-2]. Conclusion:Our results indicate that local reaction to IDR is partially composed of [SARS-CoV-2]-specific [T cells].
